My favorite little wood elf has come at last to see me. I trust your journey to our evil city was a safe and non eventful one?&quot; Xaithan's quite voice echoed in the room to which we met, unconciously giving it a dangerous undertone. Always fearing for my life when coming to this foul city i watched my back and had ready many battle spells and escape spells on the top of my mind. &quot;Yes Dark One, it was an uneventful trip but i pray let us be hasty. There is so much i need to know and very little in the way of time to prepare.&quot; I bowed my head in honor of his Vileness and again wondered  as i did when speaking to him of what i was doing with this evil creature. Tunare forgive and protect me.<br>
&quot;Well then let us start soon, but please, let us share in a glass of Elvin wine whilst we talk. I believe it is your favorite drink....right?&quot; he asked with that evil grin painted across his face. Xaithan motioned towards the door and a beautiful female drow walked into the room carrying a tray of wine, bread and cheese. She set the tray down on the large cherry stained table. First she poured Xaithan a glass and then turned to me. As she did so, her eyes locked onto mine and both our faces flushed with color. There was an odd feeling passing through my body and i could see the same affect happening to her. I looked over to Xaithan and noticed that he was enjoying all this a little more than he should. What on Norrath could this be all about? When she was finished seeing to our needs, her head turned my way and she shot me an evil look that seemed to have daggers of death behind it.<br>
&quot;Thank you Aingel, you are dismissed to your studies again and see to our privacy. No interruptions, do you understand?<br>
&quot;Yes Master Xaithan, it will be done. Aingel said as she bowed to him and backed out of the room giving me one last icy glare.<br>
Not being able to hold back i asked, &quot;Who was that your evilness?&quot; He looked to me and casually responded with a wave of his hand, &quot;That is just a new apprentice i have taken on, nothing more. But as you can see, she doesn't share my pleasure in entertaining one such as yourself. She will one day understand, like me, that it is neccesary to have light in the world as well as the dark. We are but two sides of the same coin. Of course i'm sure you know that already. Think of her no more and let us get to the reasoning of your being here. The Plague Bringers are attempting to destroy your precious guild and bring about the dishonor of Tunare.&quot; Choosing my words carefully, i began.<br>
&quot;Do you have any idea why this Iszabelle is wanting to destroy my brothers and sisters of the Bronze Dragons? We know that she has taken Caddil prisoner and is getting Phyllis from another dark elf here in the city. She also gave Molina the plague and has attempted to recruit others from our guild to her own evil purposes. There doesn't seem to be any connection with her and our guild, so why do this? It makes no sense to me.&quot; i asked.<br>
Xaithan looked at me for a long moment before answering. &quot;Kygero, does there need to be a reason? As you said yourself, we are ruled by chaos and such being the case, we do things chaotically and without reason. Fortunately for you i anticipated this visit and gathered some information from the spirits of the dead, from my, what do you call it....forbidden arts? Yes that is how i came up with some of the answers you seek. Are you still interested in learning all you can knowing that?&quot; he smiled that crooked smile again. Damn him for enjoying all this!<br>
Pondering for only a second on the matter, i answered him, &quot;Of course i still want to know. I did not ask you to find the answers that way and so i am clean of your sins, but this IS most important! Tunares children are in danger! And they are my family and will do anything for them!&quot; As i said this last, it dawned on me that i was playing right into his little mind game and needed to control myself. Gaining my composure, i looked over to Xaithan steadily. He raised his glass and took another drink before commencing to speak again.<br>
&quot;I was able to ascertain that Iszabelle has it in for your Paladin sister Phyllis more than any other in your guild. You see, she is the daughter of a man named Connor. I couldn't gather why Iszabelle hates Phyllis's bloodline, but i assume that this Connor fellow killed Iszablle's parents or other family members a long time ago. Well that makes sense to me, does it not? Regardless, since Phyllis is a part of the Fellowship, that is why Iszabelle wants to annihilate you all. She wants to kill any that Phyllis cares for and all that care for Phyllis. Mind you i think this to be a tall order, but it seems she started the whole ordeal in an ingenious fashion. It looks to me that she holds the upper hand at this time.&quot; taking a breath he continued. &quot;Also she has a plan with Farvak to slowly drive your dear guild sister Katreena insane. Iszabelle hopes to turn Katreena against the BDF by pushing a wedge there using Caddil. And Farvak wants her to bare his unholy child to maybe have control of their Innoruuk blessed relationship? I'm not sure of his reasoning. Here i thought i had a sick mind...this Farvak is twisted even beyond that of some of my own associates. I could almost admire him if he weren't so sloppy and such a fool.&quot; he replied.<br>
&quot;That is about all i could come up with from the dead. They are not a cooperative bunch i'm afraid.&quot; again that smile.<br>
Getting weary of staying here any longer in the hands of evil, i decided it was time to leave.<br>
&quot;Ok then, i have gotten what i've come for and now must report. There are things to be done and Lord Rashek must be told all this. I'm sure he will come up with something. Thank you again Druidsbane, and may Tunare forgive and embrace you.&quot; i dared to say.<br>
His smile faded upon my utterance of Tunare and his forgiveness. Xaithan would have killed anyone else in an instant for saying such a thing to him. Instead his smile returned and he obviously wasn't finished with me. &quot;One other thing before you depart...she has decided upon her next prey.&quot; He paused here for a long time, taking a drink of his wine again, and slicing off a piece of the bread and cheese to slowly consume. Being respectful of him, i waited patiently. Xaithan continued to chew his food slowly and stare at me as if this were a game. A minute passed then two....as the time drifted into the past, my patience wore thin. Finally i could take no more of this.<br>
&quot;Damn it Xaithan, stop this madness and tell me!!&quot;<br>
He opened his mouth and softly spoke the name, &quot;Gorsha.&quot; That was all he had to say. My heart froze and a rage began to build inside me. How dare that wicked beast Iszabelle! I looked all around the room as if there was an answer there to my dilema. Calmly Xaithan said, &quot;I figured that would have an affect on you.&quot; I turned my head back to him and quickly settled, not wanting to give him the advantage over me and my feelings. That could be a dangerous thing with this evil being.<br>
I had to go find Gorsha. If i could get to him before Iszabelle, then maybe we could get a small advantage ourselves. And if she showed her face then i would end her evil plans myself with her death! That i promised.<br>
&quot;I must take my leave now Xaithan. As always your cooperation is greatly appreciated. I am in debt to you for this.&quot; My chair skidded across the earthen ground as i pushed away from the table and stood.<br>
&quot;Kygero, understand this, with the invaluable info i have departed to you here...we are now even by my considerations of my life debt that was yours. From this day on, i owe you just as you owe me....Nothing!! Now be gone from here fair druid.&quot; With that he turned his back to me in dismissal.<br>
At least i knew where he and i stood. I bowed to him and began to call upon my Tunare given powers to take me far from here. The rip in space appeared in front of me ready to take me to West Commons. As per usual of my nature, i couldn't help but to look back at Xaithan one last time. He was there looking back at me...was that a look of sorrow? Not likely coming from him, i must've misread him.<br>
&quot;We will see each other again soon Kygero, Innoruuk willing!&quot; and i stepped through the portal to feel the cold comfort of the dark surround me. Gorsha, where are you?<br>

I was still trying to clear my mind of the dreams I had.  My thoughts broken when Banlaen stood up and spoke out to all the members gathered there.  He had put to word the very things that I knew in my heart to be true.  Said things that I would not mention because of my disobedience of Lord Rashek's orders earlier to stay at High Hold Keep.  <br>
<br>
   When he got up to leave I quickly left to follow him.  My intention was to ask him if I could come with him, but knew that he would say no.  I longed to be anywhere but in High Keep.  To just be doing something other than long days and nights keeping vigilance over Khaldron. I desired to be in green meadows and under trees,  High Keep offered none of this.<br>
<br>
   When I caught up with him, I  did suggest that he take Slaor just for back up. Maybe find Calicer or Gorsha, I hadn't heard from either of them in a long time. Banlean said he would keep an eye out for both men. <br>
<br>
    I was walking back to my room when a dark figure stepped from the shadows.  He spoke in a whisper &quot;You must come with me now, I have news of Caddil&quot;.<br>
<br>
    I looked at him and questioned &quot;Your not a member of the Bronze Dragon Fellowship, how did you get in here?&quot;  <br>
<br>
    He repeated &quot;Do you want to save your husband, Kat, or not?  If so, then come with me now.&quot;  I quickly followed him my heart racing.  Quickly down one passage and then another, I had not ventured here and followed him onward. Only stopping briefly to find a secret passageway out of the Keep.<br>
<br>
    I continued behind this stranger eager to hear of the promised news of Caddil.   It was when we had cleared Highhold pass and were well into Kithicor Forest that I said  &quot;Stop now, please tell me now Is he alive?&quot; This Barbarian spoke as he glanced back over his  shoulder  &quot;Yes, but not much time to waste follow me now if we are to save him&quot;.  I dare not stop in the Woods here I knew to well the dark evil that ruled this place.  Following behind him I realized I had no weapon, no armor, not even my spell book.  I only questioned this for a moment and then dismissed it quickly as I was now more concerned that Caddil may be dying somewhere.  I was holding onto the ring at my neck  praying to Mother Tunare under my breath as we moved onward.  <br>
<br>
     My legs ached from running, my heart pounding hard in my chest, I was breathing hard, my side aching from trying to keep up with this man.  We finally stopped at a group of empty huts just outside the entrance to Nektulos Forest when he turned and looked down at me &quot;Are you ready to see your love?&quot;  I quickly moved from one hut to the next hoping to find Caddil there. The barbarian stepping close behind me  <br>
<br>
     He then smiled evilly, casting root on me so that my feet sank into the ground, he then stepped aside.  Farvak came from behind him laughing with this man. &quot;Still gullible and trusting as ever aren't you Kat&quot;  Farvak said. Then turned and asked &quot;She came eagerly did she not, Ragingwolf?&quot; <br>
<br>
     &quot;Aye, she almost turned back, but her blind love ensured that she would come.  Praying all the way.&quot; he replied chuckling. &quot;The sweet thing is no one saw us leave.&quot; <br>
<br>
     &quot;Ah, very good Raging, I owe you for this one&quot; Farvak answered pleased with himself.  <p>Katreena Wanderheart 40th Leaf Master Brewer <br>

Raging Wolf had brought the chains and shackles that would bind me to Farvak  for now.  There was little hope of escape.<br>
<br>
Farvak took every opportunity to shame me and my belief in Mother Tunare.  As we walked into Nektkous Forest, he would jerk the chains tripping me so that soon my knees where bloody my neck and wrists were bruised.  I had been stripped of most of my garments and what I had on was torn and dirty now as I was paraded in front of those who worshiped the Evil and Dark Gods.<br>
<br>
The children through stones and sticks at me, there where those that spat on me, the males of this ungodly group would grope my body, the women jeered.  I heard laughter and vile names cursed at me from every corner of this forest before we stopped to camp.  <br>
<br>
Farvak tossed food on the ground my way, I'm sure it was wolf meat, I didn't eat disgusted by the smell.  To drink Farvak had poured water on the ground making a small muddy puddle. Farvak laughed and said &quot;Yes, drink like the dog you are.  You will have many such lessons before I am through with you. At last my time has come to finish the job I started so many years ago in Kithicor.&quot;<br>
<br>
 There was no soft grass to sleep in, No warm blankets to cover myself with. My body dirty, aching and cold I curled up and let my mind call out to anyone who would help. I couldn't reach out for somehow Farvak had a spell over me so that this one last hope was crushed as well.  I was so tired, but only dozed on and off keeping my eyes of Farvak all the while.  I knew what was in store for me now no mercy would be shown to me here, my spirit would be crushed, my body made to serve, my mind lost in madness.  <br>
<br>
In the Morning I was offered more spoiled meat and muddy water.  Then ordered  to carry the heavy packs that Farvak had had his pet carry the night before.  He again jerked my chains if I slowed.  If he felt I resisted he would then pull so that I fell to the ground, saying &quot;You must learn your place now Kat, your my pet.   I must teach you who is master here I will control all that you are and do from now on.  If you do not please me I will take you to the guards or worse yet to the Hell of Sciences where they will make what I do to you look like loving touches&quot;.       <br>
<br>
Rumors had spread that Hell of Sciences was beyond demented and tortured but truly Hell on Norrath.  I winced at the thought of my most horrid imaginings and knew that they were but shadows of what would happen to me there.<br>
<br>
Farvak said finally &quot;Rule 1:  I am your Master you are never to look at me directly ever again. Rule 2: If I tell you to do something you must do it without hesitation.  Rule 3: You will worship My God and denounce yours.  Rule 4: You will never escape me. Don't attempted it.  Rule 5: never speak to me unless I give you permission.  Rule 6: You will always show me that you totally bend  to all my wishes.  You will no longer be allowed the high and heady attitude you have had towards the Dark Eleven races.  You are beneath us and you are unworthy to even be among us.  The punishment for breaking any of these rules will be severe.  Do I make myself clear!.<br>
  <br>
  I dared not answer so I keeping my head bowed shook my head, yes. I thought to myself for now I would agree but in my heart I would never denounce Mother Tunare.  The rest I could accept with some grief.  I knew I would not be allowed to die that would be to easy for me and knew Farvak would never allow such a luxury. <br>
<br>
Farvak entered the house and was greeted with warm loving embraces, words of kindness and smiling faces.  Those same faces turned when he pulled my chains and brought<br>
 me into their view.  Those same faces turned cold and evil as their eyes looked me up and down.  A voice from one of them said &quot;Get that filthy creature out of my House.!&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Ah yes, she is vile and beautiful in her hate but you are right we must not treat her as an equal take her and leave her with the  animals to be slaughtered maybe she will find comfort there&quot;.  Farvak's laugh was his order.  <br>
<br>
I was taken to a barn like hut and left there my chains fastened to the wall by a woman servant. She peered at me her eyes widened for only a second then she left. The stench of death was everywhere here.  There were others here of Mother Tunare's a couple of wolves and a great black bear they all seemed to know their fate.<br>
<br>
  I was praying to Mother  Tunare when Farvak walked in looked disgustedly at me.  He spoke &quot;You disappoint me Katreena you have been keeping a secret from me.  My servant has told me you are with child.  Well now I can't have you giving life to anything that would represent love, and especially a child that was conceived in your weak form of love&quot;<br>
<br>
 He sat down and laid my head on his lap then  held my head and poured a bitter potion in my mouth and said &quot;drink&quot;.  I spat it at him, he laughed.  Then he held my nose and waited till I could hold my breath no longer then slowly poured the potion down my throat. &quot;There now this will be better for me as you will feel the life in you die and it will bring Me more passion from you.  Yes,&quot; he seemed to be speaking to himself.  I lay there in the straw and dirt feeling Caddil's and my Child dying inside.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Oh how I want the passion you let go on the Shadow Knight in Befallen those many years ago.  It was then that my desire for  you became consuming.  Your rage, you hate were divine.  Will you Love me so?.  I have had 4 wives now and each could not match the hate or rage you so lovingly showed that night.  The one I have now will be delightful tonight in her jealousy but it will still not match your rage&quot;.  He said almost wishingly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh look your child is dying&quot; He smiled and kissed away the tears that had crept out of my eyes and rolled down my cheeks. &quot;How delightful this is&quot;  His hand found my breast his fingers found my nipple and he twisted it bringing a wince of pain to my face.  &quot;Oh you are so controlled right now but you will soon let your Rage and Hate free on me.  You know that love and hate are 2 sides of the same coin and your Hate for me is Love.&quot; <br>
<br>
It was then in this very moment I knew what Mother Tunare's message to me was so many years ago. &quot;Show it Love&quot;.  Ah the copper dropped Yes only love would destroy Farvak and the Plaguebringers.  This was the reason why she wanted me trained in the way of the Druid I only hoped that I would be strong enough.  <br>
<br>
Farvak smiled &quot;I am very eager to feel your rage and hate so starting tomorrow we will begin again.  I must help you to lose that control you seem to have over  your rage&quot;.  He again twisted my nipple in his fingers bringing pain to my body and a wince to my face. <br>
<br>
He left me there in all of my sorrow, but I was also comforted by Mother Tunare herself as she blessed me with a vision of Caddil and our Child lovingly together. She then whispered &quot;You will join them and your love will heal all of your wounds&quot;.<br>
<br>
I heard the straw stir and looked quickly around there to my surprise was Kygero.&quot; It is I sis. I have come to help you escape&quot; she whispered as she unlocked the chains.<br>
<br>
  &quot;No!&quot; I quickly replied &quot;I will not be leaving yet&quot;. In the shadows and light I saw her eyes grow big &quot;What, come now don't be a fool you need to leave now&quot; urgency was in her voice now.<br>
  <br>
&quot;Kygero thank you for your help but Mother Tunare has given me a great task to do here. The Plaguebringers must be destroyed and this is where she has placed me to do the most good&quot; I answered firmly. <br>
<br>
 Kygero looked into my eyes and bowed &quot;Oh sister&quot; she said sadly understanding now.  &quot;Is there anything that I may do to assist you, Kat.?&quot;  &quot;Yes, please tell Rashek the Child is dead&quot;. She looked at me startled and then tears filled her eyes as she understood all to clearly what I had said. &quot;Oh no, not Caddil's and yours&quot;  &quot;Yes&quot; I replied.  She hugged me as we both mourned the loss of an innocent life. &quot; This battle has been hard on you Kat. Yet your strength and Love for Mother Tunare has always shown through&quot; <br>
<br>
 &quot;Now if you would take Caddil's ring and put it with my stuff till I return. Then take Caddil&quot;s Armor and give it to his sister Luner she will understand as well.  Then if you would, I know this is asking much of you, bring me my spell book.  That is all I will need here.  I hope to have some information that will help the Bronze Dragons to defeat the Plaguebringers next time I see you.  Oh, that reminds me do tell Rashek that my Orders supersede his as they come from Mother Tunare, Herself. To send no rescue at this time I will be keeping Farvak very busy for a while this may gain him some time&quot; <br>
<br>
She hugged me one last time fastened the chains back around my wrist.  She was then at the door quickly with just one last look back and was gone.  Alone again I let my sorrow consume me.   <br>

After Mythias contacted me and told of the capture and torture of Katreena by that vile waste of flesh, Fravak, i immediately left to meet with him in Nektolus Forest. I certainly didn't want to leave Gorsha as we were setting a trap for Iszabelle, but Katreena was in trouble at the present. Gorsha told me to go and that he could handle himself for now. I pleaded with him to return to Highkeep where the other Bronze Dragons were gathering and of course he said he was going to stay and continue his plan of attack. Reluctantly, i bid him farewell with a hug and a light kiss on the forehead. I truly hated to leave Gorsha by himself at this time but Katreena needed help now!<br>
Now that i was leaving the small building that Katreena was being held in, it almost made me sick to think of not taking her out of Fravak's dirty little hands. But armed with confidence in my sister and her decision to stay, it was time to do as she bid and get her spell book for her. At least i was able to give her some food stuffs and fresh water to hide for her consumption. Now to go and break the news to our fellow guild members of the going on's of Kat and her child that will never see the light of Norrath. She is so strong to stay in the face of such adversity. Mother Tunare protect her, enough of your children have suffered at the hands of these wretched creatures, the Plague Bringers! And may Katreena get the last laugh on Fravak. I only hope there is enough of him left when she is done for me to play with!<br>
Running to the tree that was hiding Mythias, i stopped just short of him as a gaurd was nearing. I hid and readied a battle spell, fortunately he did not see me or Mythias and continued on his way. As i came up to my reptilian friend, he had an odd look about him and he asked,&quot;Where isss your guild sssissster, Katreena?&quot; he was obviously thinking the worst. &quot;She has decided to stay where she is for now and do what she can here to delay Fravak.&quot;, i replied.<br>
&quot;What? You are kidding right? You ssshould go back and convinccce her to come away from thisss placcce now! And if ssshe doesssn't come, then we can take her forcccefully for her own good. Ssshe will underssstand when her health returnsss and ssshe isss in her right mind.&quot; <br>
A rage began to build in me for being in such a predicament and the blood in me began to boil. My face became flushed and i snapped at Mythias for no reason.&quot;NO damn it!! Katreena has made her decision, and as much as i hate to, we must leave her to her designs. She is strong willed and would never forgive me, besides Mother Tunare is watching over her.&quot; i paused and regained control of my feelings. &quot;Please forgive me good friend, i am merely worried for her safety and allowed a bit of weakness to show. You are the best for helping us and i had no reason to take it out on you.&quot;<br>
Mythias smiled, bareing his sharp teeth, which tended to give him a menacing look more than a friendly one, but i knew him and it was good to see him do it. &quot;No worriesss Kygero, i do underssstand. You are good to your guild sssissster and i can sssee that you love her very much. We ssshall leave her where ssshe isss for now. Ssso what ssshall we do in the mean time?&quot;<br>
I thought for only a second, then formed a plan in my head quickly. &quot;Mythias, i have to ask you to stay here and continue you vigilant watch over her while i retrieve her spell book and give Rashek Caddil's wedding ring. I promise to return hastely as it will not take to long to do these things. I will bind right here so as to make my trip even quicker. If you do not wish to stay and feel it too angerous then know that i understand whole heartedly.&quot;<br>
Mythias shrugged at this and said,&quot;Of courssse i will ssstay and watch over Katreena. I have no doubtsss that you and your guild sssiblingsss will prevail in the end. And if i can help, then it ssshall be done. Fear not for her, if thingsss go bad then i will pull her out and we will run for the light of the commonsss and i will contact you right away!&quot;<br>
Relieved, i then got my bind spell ready and cast it upon me. &quot;Thank you again scaley one, and contact me if you need to pull her out and i will have gate and a circle spell ready to come and get you both out fast and you wont have to run. When this is done, remind me to repay all your kindness and help somehow!&quot; I knelt in revilence and humility to him out of respect.<br>
Returning the gesture of respect, Mythias bowed to me and replied,&quot;Go now and we will be waiting for you. Good fortune my sssoft ssskinned friend!&quot;<br>
With that, i called upon the spirits of the winds and stepped into the comforting blackness that was the &quot;everything&quot;. Mulling over all that was needing to be done i thought of my blood sister, Kaitlyne and her welfare.<br>
Then the rip in space and i was standing before the Druids at the West Commons ring. I quickly asked the spirits to camo me and i was off, racing to Highkeep. It was time to check on Kaitlyne. I reached out for her with my mind and immediatley linked with her. &quot;Kaitlyne my sister, how fair thee? What is Ragingwolf up to?&quot;<br>
&quot;Greetings sis, i am doing my best not to confront this blasphemous thing that i spy on. He kills everything he comes across, wether it be an evil creature or a lowly woodland creature. He simply doesn't care for life at all! We should rid Norrath of his presence and soon!!&quot; It was good to hear her again, but she sounded disturbed.<br>
&quot;Do not be impatient Kait, we need a little more time as things are getting more hectic by the hour.&quot; Telling my sister of the events at hand it only made her want to take out this Ragingwolf even more hastely. &quot;Come on Kygero, we can take him out now and that would be one less worry.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes sis, but if we do that then the Plague Bringers will know we are on to them and we can ill afford a blunder right now! Please stay with him and contact me if Iszabelle shows up or something else comes up...o.k?&quot;<br>
&quot;Alright Kyg, i do hope you are right about this, and be careful. I will talk again with you soon, he is on the move again... i must go now. Luv ya!&quot;<br>
&quot;I luv you too sis, and safe journeys to you as well!&quot; and then contact was broken.<br>
Nearing the undead forest with its foul smells, luck was with me as it was the afternoon and i would not be in danger on my journey through. Without incident i arrived at the Highkeep and found Lady Kuvanu and many others of the Fellowship.<br>
Taking me in, they were anxious to hear all of what i had to say. I knelt before the Lady Kuvanu and bowing before all others present i asked everyone to be seated at the large table that was at our disposel. After a half hour of retelling all that had transpired and what needed bto be done, i placed the ring in Lady Kuvanu's hands and asked her to put it with Katreena's stuff. I looked around the great table only to see everyone here about to go insane as they all wanted to storm Nektolus forest and rescue another of our captured guild members. Particularly Sloar and Banlaen were nearly fuming and i could see them beginning to rise from their seats. Then Lady Kuvanu took control of the situation, &quot;Sit down you two and everyone remain calm! Tweani, please be so kind as to take this ring and place it with Katreena's stuff then return with her spellbook. Kygero you return to her and do as she has asked by giving her the spell book. We will wait for Rashek to return and then we'll decide on a course of action. In the meantime we will take care of Caddil's armor and prepare ourselves for the coming battle.&quot;<br>
Sloar then broke in, &quot;I am going with you Kygero!&quot; That was all Banlaen needed to hear, &quot;Then i will go as well for backup.&quot; At this Lady Kuvanu raised her brow, &quot;You two will sit down and wait with the rest of us. I will not have you both jeopardize Katreena's decision and Kygero's life by sending a couple of battle ready, on the verge of a nervous breakdown, men to go along. It seems that kygero has it under control and can better sneak around without you two on her heals. Besides i believe that Katreena says that Mother Tunare has made these plans and will you go against that? Would you be so arrogant as to disrupt what Tuanre is doing. We must show our faith for her more now than ever before. This is a great time of peril and our undieng faith is what she needs, not hot heads and irrational thoughts. Unfortunately, we must face the facts that maybe Katreena will not survive this, but if that is the case then know that it was Tunare's decision to bring her to her right hand rather than the Plague Bringers.&quot; No wonder Lord Rashak had taken this woman as his wife, she was strong and beautiful!<br>
Everyone seemed to calm down and understand her words. Tweani returned with Katreena's spell book in hand. She passed over the table to me and as i grabbed it, Tweani took hold of my hand and she winked as if saying she believed in what Katreena was doing and giving her blessings. I placed her spell book in my backpack and prepared to depart. Standing up from the table i bowed to all and then knelt and kissed Lady Kuvanu's hand. &quot;Thank you M'lady and i love you all!&quot; Lady Kuvanu turned me bak to her and said, &quot;Young Kygero go to Katreena and tell her she has our blessings and that we all love her and pray for her safety! We will be ready when the time comes. No go and be careful, contact us when you have given her the book.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes M'lady, it shall be done.&quot; Everyone bid me farewell and good fortune, then i was off.<br>
I had to make a quick stop at the bank before i went back to Katreena. There i picked up a couple things and again gated to the dark place that Mythias stood by watching his charge. Appearing before him out of no where, he merely looked my way and put his long taloned finger to his mouth in way of shushing me. I remained quite and looked around the tree to where Katreena was being held. To my surprise and disgust, Katreena was outside on her knees and the dark children were using wooden swords to poke and prod her, practicing there swordsmanship. They did this gleefully, happy to have a live target. She was being beaten while Fravak and the other adults look on, laughing and throwing verbal abuse her way as well. I could barely contain myself as i watched the evil bastards doing as they please to my sister! It was me who almost blew it all as i started to pull my newly acquired Wraithbone Hammer and storm into the encampment. But Mythias's strong hand grabbed me and pulled me in close so he could whisper in my ear, &quot;Do not go in there, i wasss about to do the sssame when the began, but Katreena looked over my way asss i ssstarted to move in. With a sssmall nod no, ssshe forbade me to interfere and sssinccce then hasss ssstoically taken this punissshment. Your sssisster is very ssstrong and ssstuborn. We must wait.&quot; <br>
I couldn't believe this, i had to watch and do nothing as she was beaten over and over only to be healed by the dark cleric that was there and it started over again. It seemed this went on for hours before they finally stopped and threw her back in the building with the animals. Fravak and his evil friends returned to the house and i could smell the fumes of food being prepared. Good, they were sitting to eat and that would give me time to enter the shack and give Katreena some supplies. I winked to MYthias and gave him the silent command to stay and watch and contact me if someone came near. Casting the camo spell again, i disappeared from site and ventured in.<br>
Katreena was there, sitting and refusing to cry. She was not looking well at all. &quot;Katreena, i am here.&quot; She raised her head and looked for me. &quot;I'm camoflaged and remain hidin. Here is your spell book and some more food and water.&quot; I dropped the supplies on the ground before her and she smiled as she ran her fingers over the spell book. Not being able to take it, i called upon the spirits of healing and some color returned to Katreena face as her wounds began to close and her blood flow subsided. Now that i was visible, she looked up at me and i could see in her eyes that she was deeply hurt on the inside and i knew that there would always be a scar there forever more. Reaching into my bag, i pulled out my old Screaming Mace, &quot;Here sis, take this and hide it, if it gets bad, use it and scream for help. I have Mythias near and watching in case you are needing rescue. Lady Kuvanu sends her blessings and prayers and says she understands the will of Mother Tunare but to be careful. The rest of our guild siblings also send their love and prayers! We nearly had to lock up Sloar and Banlaen as they were ready to storm the forest to rescue you. So keep in mind that we do not like what you are doing, but we will obey your wishes. And also that you are so greatly loved by all and everyone wishes to see you well again, so be careful!!&quot; At this Katreena's spirit seemed tp lift a bit, &quot;Thank you Kygero, you are a great sister to have. Tell the Bronze Dragons that i love them all as well! Let you Iksar friend that i am pleased and feel somewhat safe knowing he is close by, ready to do battle for me life. With my spell book and your mace, i feel armed again and can proceed with my plans!&quot;<br>
&quot;It is the least we can do Kat. Mythias will contact me quickly if you need help, i will come on the winds and am bound just outside the clearing where he stands gaurd. So scream if you need us and we will come!!&quot; I hugged her tightly and kissed her cheek then camoed myself again. &quot;Good Fortune and may Tunare's light shine upon your head while in this dark time!&quot; Bowing even though she could not see me i took my leave from the shack.<br>
&quot;You watch your back as well Kygero!&quot; Katreena's voice followed me out as i went to where Mythias was watching. The times were getting harder by the sun and moon cycle. These Plague Bringers must feel the cure to there diseased life essences and soon!! While i was discussing things with Mythias, we were unaware of another presence watching from the shadows. The female dark elf apprentice of Xaithan, Aingel, watched us and relayed information to her dark master. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ada07e><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ukatreena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Katreena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Knight, Order of Talon</span><br>  Posts: 266<br> <font color=#c54400>(11/2/00 6:40:40 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/soyouthinkiam/eq/Kat/images/Katpix.GIF WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   The Battle of Wills </span><hr size=1>  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  The night was long and cold, sleep did not come to me.  My heart was aching for my losses, both Caddil and our child, gone from me.  I meditated  in prayer to Mother Tunare for the strength of spirit and soul I would need for the battle ahead with Farvak .  One that would not be  with weapons but of Wills. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I heard someone approach in the darkness that was just before the dawn.  I could see only shadows.  Suddenly cold water poring over my body. Surprised, but  quickly thinking I took this opportunity to wash some of the dirt off my face.  This action surprised whoever was there, a gasp of breath was the giveaway, they left as silently as they came. I did my best to put some order to my hair and straighten the torn dirty clothing.  I then again turned to prayer and meditation, awaiting the day's tortures.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It wasn't long till Farvak entered,  &quot;Ah, I hear you enjoyed your shower this morning.  Well good, we will keep you happy then.&quot;  he said.  He then walked over to the a wolf that was tethered across the barn.  Farvak  took out his knife and cut off an ear leaving the wolf howling in pain. &quot; I think that you should have a wolf skin pelt to wear and this one will do nicely&quot; he said tossing the ear to me.   He waited watching for my reaction to this.  I humbly bowed to him keeping my eyes on his feet.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He walked over to me, the tension between us made made the air thick.  He knelt down lifted my head wanting to peer into my eyes.  But I kept them from him, looking every where but in his eyes.   This only angered him and he slapped me hard across my cheek.  I again returned to the bowed position tasting the blood in my mouth from a split lip.    He stood up and kicked my side and then commanded &quot;Kiss my boots, Kat. Now&quot; I quickly obeyed him and lowered my lips to his boots, I felt the anger rise in my head. I reminded myself that this was exactly what he wanted from me my anger and pride. I took a deep breath and let the anger slip from my mind. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He spat on me disgusted that he could not get the reaction he wanted.  He turned and grabbed the wolf and slit its throat and left.  The animal's eyes showed surprise as it gasped for its last breaths.  I said a prayer for my brother wolf and only then shed a tear for his suffering, as the blood oozed from the now limp body.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A servant came in skinned and prepared the wolf for cooking.  I could smell the odors from the kitchen wafting through the air mixed with the smell of blood ,urine and stench of the barn.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Farvak returned an hour later, grabbed a shovel from the wall and ordered me to start cleaning up, &quot;I had to earn my keep here&quot;.  He sat down on a barrel and watched as I obeyed him.  He was eating an apple, slicing off pieces, putting the piece in his mouth and chewing all the while describing how good it was, how juicy.  Then he started speaking of me in the same manner. <br>
<br>
      &quot;You know Kat your like this apple.  If taken to soon from the tree you would be bitter and tough to eat.  But I will wait till it is time for you to be taken, you will be sweet, juicy and wonderful&quot;.  He then came up behind me and stood so that his body was against my back.  When I didn't react to him he put his hands around my body and pulled me to him.  Whispering with his rough beard against my cheek &quot;I will have your rage, I will have you.&quot; then he backed away and pushed me into the filth, laughing at me.  I landed on my knees and hands in  the muck that came up to my elbows and smelled like sewage.  I waited for his orders all the while trying to control my temper. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I slowly stood up and continued to shovel the mess from the barn.  It was then that  Farvak left, this battle would be long and hard. <br>
<br>
       A servant came in and watched as I finished the job that was apparently his.  The whole time he laughed while eating and drinking, He said through a cheery voice &quot;Boy, am I glad you came along,  my days have just gotten easier.  You will now do my tasks&quot;.  The job completed I was again chained to the wall, the servant left.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I again returned to my meditative prayer &quot;Oh, Mother Tunare I know what you want of me, please see me through this give me the strength to control my temper, pride and rage. Give me the spiritual fortitude to complete this task.  Let my soul find peace no mater what is done to my body&quot;.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Farvak entered smiling,  &quot;We have need of entertainment, Kat and it looks like your going to be it.  The children are bored and have asked for a game.  Since I killed their pet,  you get to take its place&quot;.   He took me out into the yard area and locked my chains to a post that had rings on it for just such a purpose.  Then walked to the chairs beside the house where more men sat.  The children, demon possessed came piling out of the house armed with wooden swords and weapons.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Farvak said &quot;Well look what we have here a wild beast, a filthy animal of Mother Tunare's.  Show me children what we do to anything so vile in our forest&quot;  Quickly they came charging at me holding weapons overhead shouting gleefully at the prospect of a real live elf to kill.  I prepared myself for the worst, it was then that I saw a scaly creature amongst the brush weapon drawn and ready.  He looked as though he would gladly take on the whole of the house. This must be the friend Kygero spoke of,  my guardian.  I shook my head  no, and only hoped he would not come to my aid.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Time and time again I would be bludgeoned and near death when a cleric would heal me and the game would start again. Only when the children became bored with this and there was a call to come eat was I returned to my place in the barn. The cleric's last heal were just enough so that I could  feel the bruises, pain  and broken skin..<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   It was then that Kygero came to me giving me my requested spell book, food and water.  I drank and ate while she healed my wounds. She shook her head  at what she saw.  Sadness  filled her eyes as she looked at my body. I could feel her anger rise  and I knew that i needed to say something. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  I said &quot;Your friend has a tough job.  To stand by and watch this will be hard for both he and you.  Understand, please, you  must leave me to this, it is important that I consume Farvak's mind.&quot;  Her nod of understanding did not erase the sadness as she spoke.  She  told me of the blessings given and all of my family wished for my safety. That all those in the Bronze Dragon Fellowship worried but understood that my orders came from Tunare.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   I said  softly &quot;Farvak will not allow me to die so do not worry there. He is obsessed with my rage and anger and as long as I can, with the help of Mother Tunare, keep that out of his reach he will make sure I live. Now time for you to go&quot;.   I could see in her face the outrage that she felt towards all who would hurt me. I knew she left me only because of our faith in Tunare. I hid the rations, the water and sat to memorize the spells I would need to keep myself alive.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  I heard footsteps and quickly hid my spell book.   A woman dressed in fine silks came out to me with water and food.  Speaking with disgust and anger she said &quot;You have his attention now, how I hate you!  My hate will keep him by me for a while.  He has sent me out here to tend to you so that my anger will delight him tonight.  But it is you he wants.  Although from what I've seen I can't imagine why. Your a weak and stupid girl for letting him catch you.  You have no fire that I can see, no your just another elf with the sickening light that will be crushed all to soon.&quot;  I didn't reply and she left.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Alone in the barn, I tore a small piece of cloth from my clothing, what was left of it.  Rinsed it in the water and then washed myself as best I could.  I was so tired from the days events, emotionally and physically exhausted.  I soon drifted off to sleep.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I woke up to find Farvak kneeling by my side with a piece of straw tickling my arm lightly, then whispering in my ear..&quot;Dreaming of Caddil where you&quot;  He then straddled me and lowered himself down on my stomach.  I again would not look him in the eyes, I kept my head turned from him. Grinning he  ripped the last shred of clothing off of my body.  I made no movement to resist him or hide my nakedness. His hands touched my skin, his fingers cold and hard he moved them to my chin turning my head to his gaze.  I closed my eyes again avoiding eye contact.  He then moved his hands down my body .  I could feel his gaze hard, cold and hungry. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Your to dirty for me to soil myself with now so we shall bath you.   He marched me out into the yard where the animal water trough was. He ordered me to step in and sit down, I did exactly as he said.  He took a rough brush and scrubbed me raw.  The water cold the air even  more so.  The dark elves from inside the house came out to watch as he pushed my head under the water, holding me there till I though my lungs would burst.  Then let me up and breath.  They all laughed  as I gasp for air.  Then he had me stand up naked in front of these people for their inspection.  &quot;She clean enough to come in the house now&quot; he asked them laughing. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &quot;Yes come bring her in by the fire it is to cold for me to stand out here waiting for you. I will see what I can do to cloth her ugly white body, I won't look at it any longer&quot;  came the answer.  As I walked passed the group they each took a swat at my butt, feeling the sting I was lead to the fire.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Farvak said &quot;She needs to be clothed in your finest love.. I wish to take her to  the Temple of Innoruuk.  I wish her to see the power of my God.  To know and learn to fear me and respect all that Innoruuk  is&quot;.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You cant take her there,  no one will let you in with her looking like this&quot; came the voice of a woman.   Farvak's voice now sharp  &quot; I know. so you must dress her so that she can be taken in.  Hide her, cover her well.  Do not disappoint me or you will be chained in the barn tonight and she will be in your bed.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Damn you Farvak&quot; she said as she angrily waked out of the kitchen.  He then turned to me and chuckled, proud that he had got a rise out of her. His grin charming and yet menacing.  &quot;Well now lets see what can I do to help you let go of your anger&quot;  he walked over to me smiling evilly &quot;I have been to gentle with you, Kat.  I feel the need to see pain in your eyes&quot;.  He grabbed my arm and turned me so that I faced the group of men standing at the door.  &quot;You see them each of them would like to know what it is like to touch you.  Each would like to rip you apart.  Your life is mine, your body is mine and I will let them have you when I tire of you&quot;  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I closed my mind to this thought and again reminded myself that it wasn't my body, but my rage he wanted.  Let the anger go I prayed let me be strong enough not to let it control me.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was then that his wife returned with clothing. Seeing him touching me, holding me, her face twisted in anger.    She picked up a knife off of the table and started for Farvak swearing, shouting, at the top of her lungs.  &quot;I am going to kill you and that whore of an elf Now!!&quot;.  Farvak turned grabbed her arm and pushed her to the floor. Laughing at her he told the men at the door to take her and do as they will she needed to be taught who was the Master here.  &quot;Bastard&quot; she shouted &quot;You will pay dearly for this&quot;. As she was lead out of the house.   <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He picked up the pile of clothing the ordered the servants to dress me.  He sat and watching them telling them this was good or that wouldn't do. When I was dressed to his saticfation.  He said to me &quot;She will be very ripe tonight.  Her anger will make her passionate and her body will bend to me and my will.  Soon yours will do the same. I love a woman with fire that is ablaze.&quot;  His eyes cold and hungry with the desire to hurt something.  I thought he would rape me there in front of the servants, on the table.  But instead he  walked out of the  room.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Through Neriak to the Temple of Innoruuk  I was lead.  It was in the Temple where I saw the true face of evil. The pleas for help unanswered, the evil delights of all wicked things could be found here. Chaos abounded here no order no reason just evil.  Farvak's eyes gleamed with pride at all of this.  His smile broad and he walk proudly strutting.  He was powerful here, there were those who bowed to him and gave him leeway.  Mostly the place reeked of fear.  Evil wears many faces and the ones I saw here were sickening.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Farvak seemed to absorb the energy from the very ground itself here.  How was I ever going to be strong enough to overcome this place, this man. Our visit was short, and on our way out of the Temple who was there but Iszabelle.  She stood and smiled at Farvak with the same hunger he had had in his eyes in the kitchen that morning.  &quot;Where have you been Farvak I have need of you&quot;.  He smiled and waved her to follow him.  I behind the both of them.   <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Farvak proud that he had been successful at sneaking me into the Temple of Innoruuk was now a bit nervous with Iszabelle here. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Her voice tensed with anger &quot;Farvak what the hell is this.  Tell me now why have you not responded to my request for your presents.  I need you to help finished my plans for Gorsha.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &quot;Please Iszabelle I will tell you as soon as we are out of here Please follow me.&quot;  Iszabelle not use to being ordered stopped in her tracks &quot;Farvak tell me now, I am your mistress and you obey me remember&quot;.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &quot;Quickly then come here into this doorway.&quot; He almost pleaded.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yes fear was the stench that controlled everything here, even Farvak.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;That isn't my wife&quot; he spoke softly.  Then smiling he said &quot;I have Kat. I am going to break her, to make her mine&quot;.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   Iszabelle looked perturbed now &quot;So you have Kat and you now can ignore me.  I think not&quot;  You are to be my servant remember all you have is because I allow you to have it&quot;. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Anger now rose in Farvak's eyes. &quot; Do not speak to me so in front of her&quot;.  He grabbed my arm and pulled down the veils that covered my face. Iszabelle looked a bit shocked as she suddenly understood why he had not stopped and given her due respect. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &quot;You fool&quot; she spat &quot;How can you bring her to our Temple.  How can you show such little respect for our GOD&quot;  She was even more angry at him. &quot; You think that by showing  her our GOD she will change&quot;.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I wanted to show her the true power our GOD has here that her beliefs where simply weak and stupid rules.  Traditions that controlled the people through superstition&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Let us get her out of here your mind is clouded and your not thinking clearly of your duties to me&quot;. She said disgusted.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We were well out of Neriak when they spoke again. &quot;Farvak you have pushed to far this time I will take Katreena and give her to Trax. To do with as he will. You are losing control of yourself with this desire to have her&quot;  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   He was now standing his shoulders set, his full height menacing towards her  &quot;I think not,  she is mine.  I have waited years for her and I will not give her to anyone.  Not even you Mistress. I will kill all who try to take her from me.  I admit I have been lax in my duties to you.  But do not think that you can take her without a fight&quot;  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Oh very well then, keep her but do not let her interfere with My orders to you again or I will see both of you dead&quot;. She said firmly  &quot;Your a fool you know, she will never change and you will kill her in the end.  Her strength comes from her beliefs in Tunare.  But if you can break that then you will have won a prize worthy of your talents indeed&quot;.  Farvak grinned and marched on ward to his home. <p>Katreena Wanderheart 40th Leaf Master Brewer <br>

The woman who was his wife looked up at us as we entered the room.  If looks could kill Farvak and I would be dead.  However, upon seeing Iszabelle she changed her face quickly. <br>
    <br>
    Farvak's mood was of a proud peacock, delighted with the charade at the Temple and then to be able to bring Iszabelle to his home.  He seemed unmoved by his wife's fuming nature nor by the disapproving looks Iszabelle was casting his way. <br>
<br>
    The best seats were made available food and drink were brought.  Farvak turned to his wife and said  &quot;Take Kat to my bedroom now&quot;.  Her look was one of ice and fire.  All he did was chuckle as he took a bite of  fruit.  <br>
<br>
    I was lead upstairs to a large room with a bed  at one side.  She quickly took the clothes from me.  Glaring she said&quot;I will have to burn these now there is no hope of ever getting your stench off them&quot;. <br>
<br>
    Left alone and naked, I pulled a blanket off the bed and wrapped it around me. I wanted nothing more than to be in the barn with my meditative prayer, my spell book and my solitude.  So now what, what did Farvak think he was up to tonight. I studied the room and all that was there.  The hour was getting late and there was nothing more to do so I sat down on the bed to meditate and pray for the strength that only Mother Tunare could give me.  <br>
<br>
    I heard voices outside the door. Farvak said  &quot;I have no more need of you Jess.  I told you to dress Kat this morning.  That if you didn't do this you would be sleeping in the barn and so you shall&quot;  She kept her voice low but the threat was still there &quot;If you do this to me tonight I will not be here tomorrow&quot;.   Farvak laughed &quot;So be it, You leave with only what you have on you now.  If you take anything from here you will be arrested for thievery and be punished so&quot;.   The voices trailed off and then Farvak entered the room. <br>
<br>
    &quot;I think I owe myself a treat tonight Kat, and your it&quot;  He came to my side and touched my cheek.  I didn't move or respond, although inside I felt myself tighten at his touch, revolted by it.  &quot;Humm, how will you please me tonight&quot;? He said with a whimsical tone.  Then his hand came full force across my face, stinging and shocked. I looked at him.  &quot;Yes that is better, I was beginning to wonder&quot; there was that smile that chilled me to the bone.  Quickly I lowered my eyes, knowing I had given myself away.  <br>
<br>
    Iszabelle has need of your druid talents tomorrow and you will obey her.  But tonight you are mine alone.  There was a knock at the door, a servant came in with a jug of wine and glasses then left without a sound.  Farvak got up from my side and walked over to the glasses and pouring wine into both he said you need to drink this it will help you through the night.  He chuckled as he poured a potion into one glass and handed it to me.  &quot;Drink&quot; he ordered. <br>
<br>
    My face still stinging I took the glass and did as he ordered.  The room became soft at the edges and I  felt the warmth of the liquid flowing through my body.  Try as I might my thoughts would not remain clear.  <br>
<br>
     Then I felt his hand on me, no longer able to control my temper in this state, I was fighting back.  My composure gone, I was speaking angrily to him, all of my hate pouring out for all he had done to me and I couldn't seem to stop.  He was holding me down with the weight of his body now on mine. He  was tense with excitement.  His voice trailing somewhere far off as his hands becoming more rough as they roamed my body.  Forcing me, hurting me.  A slap across my face and his laugh it all became so much like a dream, a nightmare. <br>
************************************************************<br>
         Jess Farvak's wife found herself out in the barn.  Outraged that she had been put out of her own bed. <br>
         &quot;Damn him Damn him and that pastey white wood elf May Innoruuk have you both&quot; she said with clenched teeth.  Looking around she found the cleanest place she could to lay down and sleep for the night.  &quot;We will see who has the last laugh my sweet Farvak&quot; plans forming in her mind.<br>
<br>
       She would have left him a year ago but he had come into power being one of the Plague Bringers.  This had raised her status as well.  He had been away so she had the run of the place and his name.  Now it had all gone sour with his return and bringing that creature with him. <br>
<br>
       It was in the morning after a restless sleep that daybreak had offered her enough light to see the corner of a carefully wrapped book hidden under the straw. &quot;Ah she is a spy and this is proof.  I will give this to Iszabelle and be done with both make him look like he is in on a conspiracy&quot; <br>
<br>
        It would have been so simple to do but Farvak had come in to greet her.  &quot;I trust you slept well Love&quot; he taunted.  She sat up startled by him. &quot;Oh your hiding something come now let me have it&quot;  Knowing him she dare not try to keep it from him.  &quot;Damn&quot; she though &quot;Damn, damn, damn&quot; she had missed her chance.<br>
<br>
         She handed him the book looking sheepishly up saying &quot;See that elf is a witch, a spy.  Look what was in the hay here&quot;  Farvak's smile turned into a wide grin  This was the one thing he had hoped for.  He could now get rid of this &quot;dead weight&quot; and have his Kat too.  Oh how delightful things had turned out for him.<br>
<br>
************************************************************<br>
    I awoke to  Farvak grinning at me as he held my spell book out to me.  <br>
&quot;So there is a bit of dishonesty in you, how delightful.  Kat you've been hiding things from me haven't you.  Just as well you have this book but only when I see fit to give it to you. Iszabelle was right you will be the one to bring about the downfall of the Bronze Dragon Fellowship&quot;  His laugh turned menacing now. &quot;Up Kat  here get dressed in these&quot;. He through some tattered leathers at me.<br>
<br>
    I dressed as quickly as I could under his gaze.  He smiled as he looked me over his eyes hungry with that need to cause pain look. He held my arm tightly as we approached Iszabelle who was sitting at the table eating.  He lead me to a chair in the corner and handed me a plate of what looked to be scraps.   He ordered &quot;Sit and Eat&quot;  then turned to Iszabelle smiling. &quot;See Mistress she is as tame as any pet I have ever had&quot;  <br>
<br>
    Iszabelle glanced over and said &quot; Yes well be careful of that one she will turn on you as quickly as you have seemed to tame her&quot;  Farvak snickered &quot;No tame isn't the word I would use more like under control.  I like my pets wild and able to bite back&quot;  He glanced my way it was then that I saw there were scratches on his cheek.  He touched them with his fingers then gave me a smile.<br>
<br>
    Iszabelle said &quot;Well can she, or more to the point will she, teleport us to Kunark and insure our safety to reach our brethren there in Cabilis&quot;  Farvak  said &quot;You doubt my  ability to control her&quot;raising an eyebrow.    &quot;Lets get started then shall we&quot; Iszabelle said<br>
<br>
    I somehow had to get this information to Rashek this could be the one weapon that I could use  to help The Bronze Dragon Fellowship to defeat the Plague Bringers.  I needed to gain what trust I could of Farvak and Iszabelle now.  To become their means of transportation could mean that I had the ability to know where their forces would gather. <p>One Very Adventurous Druid<BR>Katreena Wanderheart 41st Leaf Master Brewer <BR>

Come Kat we need to go to Dreadlands&quot; handing me my spell book.  &quot;Just a precaution Kat&quot; he again put the chains and shackles on my neck and wrist &quot;Can't have you teleporting without me can I&quot; he stated.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I memorized the spell gave him back the spell book  and then cast it.  A rift in the air opened and time and space folded as we walked through it.  We stood at the Druid Rings in the far corner of Dreadlands in Kunark. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Farvak was pleased &quot;That sure beats the boats.  Now for our passage to the Overthere and the docks.&quot;  I stood where I was eyes lowered  as Farvak said &quot;Well now how do you think is the best way to go Kat?&quot;   I answered &quot;I will need my spell book again. I need to cast Spirit of Wolf, See Invisible, Levitate and Superior Camouflage on all of us for the safest travel&quot;  He grinned and gave a nod to Iszabelle, as he handed me the spell book again.  Sitting and memorizing the needed spells I felt like such a traitor to my Family.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I swore that somehow I would die if I couldn't help the Bronze Dragons to defeat these horrid Plague Bringers.  I would turn my Druid Skills against them as best I could.  But for now I would learn all I could of their plans.  I thought of Kygero and her friend sitting outside of Farvak's home waiting for me to come out of the house that morning.  What had they thought of Farvak's wife in the barn that night.  Had they seen Farvak with my spell book.  <br>
<br>
        I hoped that they would remain safely hidden.  I knew that Farvak would become even more obsessed with me as my Druid Powers would give him more power in the Plague Bringers.  He was an ego thinking itself a God.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I returned the spell book once again to Farvak, proceeded to cast the necessary spells.  Once done I guided them through the dangers of the Dreadlands to the tunnel through to the Frontier Mountains then on to the land known as the Overthere.  I lead them to the Dock area.  I had never been inside, it had been known as a death trap for any one who served the Truth and Light of Tunare.  Farvak lead me in as I hesitated.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A rush of guards came at us then stopped as they saw Iszabelle and Farvak with me chained to him.  A look of satisfaction came over both of them as they walked through to a building.  I stood by Iszabelle as Farvak went to gain the owners key to the place.  Upon returning he opened the door and said &quot;This will do for our headquarters here&quot;  Iszabelle nodded as we entered.  She went upstairs to check out the rooms there.  Farvak eyes gleamed at me and his fingers once again traced the scratches on his face.  He looked as though he were in a moment of ecstasy.  He leaned over and whispered &quot;Tonight&quot;.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well you did that so well Kat that we are going to have you do it again&quot;  Iszabelle said returning.   &quot;Farvak have her take you to Lavastorm then on to Neriak to pick up and teleport  those that are waiting for us there.  This will turn out much better than I had planned.   You have done well Farvak, but keep her under control at all times&quot; she threatened.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Farvak made me do this once more that day.  Brining those who served Iszabelle and her Dark Lord.   I was met in Neriak with distaste which did not change and it was Farvak who received the congratulatory pats on the back when they reached the Docks safely and so quickly.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Iszabelle too was pleased.  Her personal servant taking charge  and things in the building were taking shape to her desires while we were gone.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The group entered the building and a round of Congradtuations to Iszabelle where said.  &quot;You have a good man in Farvak who would have thought to capture one of our enemies Druids for our use&quot;   Farvak strutting with pride dragging me behind him.  He ordered me taken to his room &quot;Feed her as well, but chain her to the wall and make sure there is someone there to watch her now&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   I was lead away and up the stairs remembering his whispered words &quot;Tonight&quot;. I knew it was no use to keep my temper under control with the potions he had at his disposal.  Last night I may not have remembered much, but what I did remember was my rage. Rage and hate pouring out onto him and his delight that it had.  I was ashamed, I thought that I had learned to let it go, to grow beyond all of that hate.  Now here it was again rearing it's ugly head to serve him, of all people.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I again fell into prayer to Mother Tunare and into meditation.  I knew what was going to happen later tonight and I needed her strength to help me through it.<br>

He traveled to the city on the mountaintop.  Buildings were carved into the mountains side, he was impressed to finally see a city he had heard about.  He asked one of the guards for the location of the inn. <br>
<br>
 The corridor was long and the winding stairs ended to the 2nd floor.  Around the corner he saw the room number and knocked.  A lovely lady had answered the door.  She was a radiant with auburn hair.  She was smiling holding onto the door.  How can I help you?    The boy began to stutter and looked away,  I have a package t t t to deliver for Rashek.   Ah, you have found the right place: however, he is not here. I will take the package and make sure that he will get it.<br>
The boy handed the box to Kuvanu.  As she laid her hands upon it, she felt a cold chill run through her body, she instantly wanted to drop the box but she had held on to it and placed in on the wooden table quickly.  She thanked to boy and closed the door. <br>
<br>
Kuvy wanted to know what was in the box.  Her curiosity was urging her to open it. I can take a peak at it, he will be home soon.  She slowly opened the box and noticed that the box was lined with a protective covering.  A cloud of mist was obscuring the view.  She slid her hands into the box and lifted the object out. Kuvys eyes froze.  The screams echoed through the inn.  She dropped the head of Warpoet onto the floor.  She tried to wipe the blood off her hands on her clothes and sat on the floor as tears were streaming down.  The door opened with such force that it cracked. Rashek had rushed in and saw his wife in a corner cover in blood. What happened! What happened! Dear! he cried out.  Who did this to you and where are you cut!  He turned to grab a towel to clean the blood and noticed that head of Warpoet on the ground with a note pinned to his forehead.  Rashek sat on the floor. Stunned. He couldnt say a word but to mourn. He took Kuvy around the shoulder and hugged her, letting her know that things will be better. <br>
<br>
Iszabelle sat down and smile. &quot;I wish I could have let him alive. I have Phyllis and Kelee now but that will change soon.  I will sacrifice Phyllis and make Kelee a slave forever.  She does have a beautiful voice.&quot;  I wish I could be there to watch the reaction of Rashek, as she began to laugh.<br>

Not sure of wether to contact Kygero when he saw Iszabelle walking with Farvak and Katreena, he decided to hold off and see what happens. Nothing did and Iszabelle took her leave from them as Farvak, with Katreena in tow, made their way back to the little house. Shortly after their arrival, he watched as Fravak's wife went fuming into the barn and stayed there over night. It was obvious what Farvak had planned with Katreena for the evening and it made him sick to think of what that was. Maybe he should try and rescue her??? No, that was made clear when she bade him to stay back on his first attempt to intervene, as those evil children used her for sword practice. He would wait this one out too. The evening passed and at daybreak, Farvak came out of his house to enter into the barn. After a few minutes had passed, he walked out of the barn with Katreena's spellbook in hand!! That could not be good. And the look on Farvaks wife's face, she agreed. To make matters worse, Iszabelle arrived at the house with a small escort. They entered when Farvak answered and have yet to show themselves since. With that, he made his decision to contact Kygero.<br>
Mythias concentrated and focused on the one mind he looked for. &quot;Kygero my friend, we have trouble!&quot; He quickly explained all that happened. &quot;And that wasss about sssixxx hoursss ago when the entered the houssse!&quot;<br>
&quot;O.k. Mythias, good job. They must have used Katreena to port them all somewhere, damn, that could be any druid ring. Stay there in case they return and i will have to go druid ring hopping to see if anyone saw them. Get a hold of me immediately upon sight of them and i will gate back there to you.&quot;, i responded.<br>
&quot;I will fair one, be careful!&quot; and Mythias's watery sounding voice disipated from my mind as he went back to his vigilant watch.<br>
Now this could be a problem, trying to find them now with the help of Katreena porting them who knows where, it was gonna be tough! Oh well, only one thing to do and that was get started on the druid rings to see if anyone had seen them. I sat and began my memmorizing of the different druid ring spells. Hmmmm, where would they go that would benefit them... let's try the Karanas first seeing as how Iszabelle has plans for Gorsha and that's where he is. Casting the appropriate spell for the North Karana Druid ring, i was gone and traversing the darkness to my destination. I stepped out of the dark and found firm footing. Hastely i went to the Druids there and asked them each if they had seen the people i described. Neither had and i decided to ask everyone in earshot. Again no noe had seen them. So not here, lets try Feerrot as it is an evil place and they would be welcome. The gate was open before me and in seconds i was standing at the foul Feerrot ring. Shouting out to all the same questions of possible sightings i got no answer. I repeated the question a couple times and someone answered that no one had seen the Plague Bringers around. Thanking them i then called the spirits to take me to Lavastorm. Unfortunately, i met with the same answers there as in Feerrot. At least these three zones were clear and i sat to rememorize ring spells.<br>
Next to Steamfont where i found the same results and on to Butcher Block. The druid there told me that no Plague Bringers had come through this ring. Alright, on to West Commons. There were alot of people at the ring today. Unfortunately, there were alot of evil people here today as well hunting the druids here at the ring. It always saddened me to see how the evil creatures camp our beloved ring and attack all the druids that Tunare blesses the ring with. But alas, it will always be that way and as i found on my first visit to this ring, there is nothing to be done, except pray to Mother Tunare for there souls. As i mentioned Katreena's name to the druids there, two of them said that they had seen her by herself in torn rags. She gated in and moved off quickly instead of greeting them as she usually did. They figured something wrong but could do nothing as their hands were full with the evil bastards that hunted them. I told them that i understood and then bade them thanks and good fortune. I looked over to where the evil ones camped. Well.... maybe they had seen something. Walking over to where they were sitting, they all turned and gave me an icy glare. With my head held high, i dared to ask, &quot;Has anyone seen any of the Plague Bringers come through here as of late?&quot;<br>
There was laughter and snickers from all. &quot;Like we would tell you if we had stupid druid, you are lucky we do not get up and throttle you!&quot; one of them by the name of Everkill answered. Again the laughs.<br>
&quot;Inc!!&quot; i heard one of their pullers say and the evil little beasts all rose as one and commenced to destroying another of Tunare's children.<br>
&quot;Does this look fun to you druid? Would you like to take the place of this poor fool? Then we can kill you instead!!!&quot; another of the wretched dark ones said. And then the laughs went into an uproar and the druid was dead.<br>
I winced as this did hurt me to watch, but keeping my cool i spoke again, &quot;I offer 10pp to any that knows anything about what i ask!&quot;<br>
At the mention of platinum, all got silent and looked and me curiously. Everkill was the one who spoke up, &quot;Make it 20pp and i will tell you what you want to know!&quot;<br>
&quot;Very well, but your information had better be good! Now first tell me what i want and then i will give you the money.&quot;, i answered.<br>
The others here all gave Everkill a look of confusion at which he said, &quot;Platinum is platinum and the Plague Bringers never gave me any.&quot; He turned to me and began, &quot;I saw the one called Farvak invisible from nomal sight and he was holding on to a druid like yourself but dressed in leather rags. It seemed he was controling her and forcing her to move east with him. She was not looking good at all, so i'd say this Farvak has done a great job!! If only we could all have a druid to control, Norrath would be a better place. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!&quot; And of course all present began to roll around laughing. These horrid creatures had no right to live, i hope a griffon comes along here soon!<br>
&quot;Now my 20pp light skin!!&quot; Everkill shouted over the tumult of laughter and pointing.<br>
&quot;Yes, your 20pp... as i promised, so it shall be. I will leave you with the knowledge that unfortunately your god can never overcome the light and so shall stay in the darkness forever, may your false god live as he lives, in chaos and decide to kill you all for the fun of it as you do the druids here!!&quot;, i finished and began walking back to the druid ring.<br>
&quot;Thanks for the 20pp's stupid druid!! May Tunare contract the plague herself and die!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!&quot; as one started to laugh they all had to join in again.<br>
I turned and winked at him as i stopped and began calling upon all the spirits i know one by one and buffed the druids at the ring. There was an uproar of anger and filthy curses hurled at me from the evil encampment. I merely laughed back at them and said, &quot;Good hunting, foul smelling beasts!! HAHAHA&quot;<br>
The curses continued and i couldn't help myself, &quot;Hail a Griffon.&quot; i said.<br>
Everyone of them jumped up and began searching the skies. A few of them even ran without waiting for the others to confirm. I got the last laugh there, but it was time to move on. The spirits gathered about me and i was camoflaged and heading east.<br>
Reaching out i contacted Mythias, &quot;Mythias, i believe that Katreena and Farvak are on their way back, keep an eye out and i'm on my way now. I would gate there, but i wanna run it in case they stop and i can catch up to them. If they show before i get there then i will gate, so keep me informed!!&quot;<br>
Mythias responded, &quot;Yesss Kygero, i will. And thisss time, they will not lossse usss!!&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ada07e><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ukatreena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Katreena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Knight, Order of Talon</span><br>  Posts: 281<br> <font color=#c54400>(11/15/00 2:14:36 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/soyouthinkiam/eq/Kat/images/Katpix.GIF WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   New's both good and Bad for Iszabelle</span><hr size=1> The night had been as I had feared, Farvak using and abusing my mind and body Not trying to break my spirit but to turn my soul  into something vile and evil to serve him only.  He spent hours delighted by my rage as I battled within myself.  He knew to well just how to get the reactions he wanted.  First he would torture me then allow me to let my rage out on him then show kindness that was so tender, only to return to the torture again.  It was a cycle of anger, action, and then guilt.    He would let me heal myself but not him.  I had left him with some very nasty wounds that would take days to heal and he seemed proud of them.  The pain from each one delighted him as if each one was an award for my soul sinking into his hell.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I awoke to knocks at the door and a voice calling in &quot;Time to get moving we have a lot to accomplish today&quot;.  Stirring, I felt arms around me,  I remained, comforted only for a second, before I remembered who's arms they belonged to.  Tremors of shame and rage ran through my body and mind.  I quickly stood up gathered my clothing, putting it on I turned to see Farvak smiling at me.  He said &quot;Oh you are so sweet when you dream an angel and yet I know just how evil you can be&quot;  his fingers finding a scratch touching it longingly.  &quot;Love wounds, you are delightful my pet&quot;  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Those words hurt me to the bottom of my heart &quot;My pet&quot;, Caddil was the only man who had used that term and when he had said it it was as if Mother Tunare had whispered it.  Now when Farvak said it it was like hell reaching up and pulling me down drowning me slowly. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I knew Farvak saw my pain as he pulled the covers back and step out of bed towards me.  He grabbed my waist and pulled me close his beard scratching my face he kissed me hard.  &quot;Good morning, to you&quot;. He said grinning.  My hand raised up to slap him when I caught myself. &quot;Oh go ahead dear one show me you love me. It will make my morning perfect&quot;  Ashamed, I lowered my eyes.  He pulled my chin up and looked at me &quot;Yes we still have work to do, but the task is one I am enjoying very much&quot; he then slapped my butt &quot;Here pick up my clothes and dress me, Kat&quot;.  I did as he bid me my face still flushed with temper.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We met Iszabelle down in the dinning area she seemed in very good spirits as a young boy stood at her side, she handed him a bag full of money smiling like the cat who ate the best rat.   &quot;Hello Farvak&quot; she said  &quot;You must have had a very good night by the looks of you this morning&quot; giggling.  &quot;Here have some warm mead and food.  Then you must go to West Commons then on to the underworld of Freeport I have a list of things that you must get and people you must teleport here.   If we are to be successful with our next move against the Bronze Dragon scum we will need to move quickly.  Oh and I want to go to Feerrott I will be taking some help with me.  It is time for me to get Gorsha&quot; her laugh was so vile that it sent chills up my spine.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You will then meet me and teleport me back here&quot; she handed a list to Farvak.  He looked a bit perturbed at being ordered around like a pack mule but took the parchment putting it in his pouch as he sat down to eat. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   I stood behind him waiting,&quot;Sit down on the floor Kat, at my feet&quot;. I obeyed without hesitation.  All the others in the room even the servants stopped to stare as Farvak would place food in my mouth.  &quot;He said proudly &quot;yes she is the finest pet, I believe, I have ever had. Delightful at night and well behaved during the day&quot;  He grabbed my hair and held my head as he leaned over and kissed me hard.  &quot;Here  is some water my Lovely little Kat&quot;.  Grinning he handed me a glass of water.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Iszabelle looked my way disgusted and said &quot;Farvak you are to distracted by her but as long as she does my bidding during the day You may do as you will with her at night&quot;  They looked at each other and chuckled as if they both shared the same thought about me.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &quot;You should have seen her.  She is appropriately named. She was a wild cat last night and a snuggling cat this morning&quot; Farvak said touching a wound left by me.  I winced at the words and his thought.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Breakfast done those that were going with us to Antonica gathered I was given my spell book.  Memorizing the Druid Rings for everyone's destination and then using the camouflage spell to cover our arrival we were off.  Iszabelle to Feerrott with her party, Others to North Karanas, and then Farvak and I to West Commons. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  When we arrived there were a group of dark elves were killing the Druids at the ring.  How cruel to see this and yet they were given the freedom of death I wished I had been so lucky.  Farvak smiled their way and  joined in the laughter as one of the Druids fell in death.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We moved quickly away and on to Freeport and to the sewers there.    Farvak had just about completed the list of task on the parchment when he said &quot;Time to go pick up Iszabelle, quickly at Feerrott Kat&quot;.  When we arrived I felt a chill from the mood of the group.  Iszabelle was now fuming She was shouting out orders to all.  Asking who was responsible for the escape and heads where going to roll.  At first I thought that Grosha had done something that had Iszabelle so mad.  But then I heard someone mention to Farvak &quot;Kelee and Phyllis have escaped, whoever was in charge of their keep is dead meat now&quot;.  Farvak smiled to himself as he knew that Iszabelle would be handling that matter personally and he would be left in charge. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Teleport me to LavaStorm, Now&quot; She barked.  Farvak handed me the spell book.     When we arrived she said &quot;Farvak you will be in charge till I return to the Docks Do not fail me, I want Gorsha there when I get back.&quot;  &quot;Yes, Mistress it will be done&quot; he reassured her.  I cast Spirit of Wolf on her and her party, they turned and with speed set off for Neriak.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well, well my Kat lets see what kind of trouble we can get into&quot; he said smiling  &quot;I think we need to find Gorsha and I know just the way.  You can call to him, have him come to you, to your aid.  Yes that will work&quot;  I looked at Farvak in horror &quot;No&quot; slipped from my lips and just as fast  his hand was across my face.  &quot;You will do it or I shall find and kill other's of the Bronze Dragon till you do&quot;  Knowing Farvak this was not a threat but a promise.  So we teleported to North Karanas and headed toward the great stone bridge as I sat my mind to calling out to Gorsha.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Betrayal was all I felt.  Gorsha was a good friend.  Kygero my close sister had loved him she had confided in me only one time.   Now I was going betray both.  Damn how could I change this.  I saw no way out,  if I refused he would kill others and make me watch.  What could I do?<br>

All I could do is hope that Kygero had spoken with him of my situation and be on guard.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Farvak was in the shadows as I lead the way to South Karanas.  I was nervous as we approached the far side of the Great Stone Bridge as there stood familiar friends and members of the Bronze Dragon Fellowship none suspecting the danger that was so close.<br>
<br>
       They greeted me with hello's and well wishes asking me why I was dressed so shabby.  I answered with a lie, hoping they would believe me.   I had been killed by a hill giant and needed to go get my corpse as Mother Tunare saw fit to resurrect me one more time in her  mercy.   I asked if anyone had seen Gorsha the reply came at the Aviak Towers.  I bid them good-bye and safe journeys and headed south with Farvak lurking in the shadows.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;My love you handled that well, very good&quot; he said pleased &quot;You lied to your brothers and sisters so well&quot; he said grinning <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I felt sick, but knew that one of my brethren would not die today at the hand of Farvak, well not yet.   We continued our journey southward to the Aviak Towers. <br>
<br>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There to the side of the ramp up was Gorsha.  His red robes flowing as he was in battle with a large Aviak Rook his pet besting the beast. It took only a few minuets and the great bird lay lifeless on the ground at his feet.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gorsha looked up to see me standing there.  &quot;Hello there dear friend.  What a surprise to see you here&quot; his words stopped short as he looked at my face. &quot;Kat this isn't like you what is wrong&quot;. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Tears filled my eyes as I looked at him and then looked away whispering &quot;I'm so sorry for this old friend&quot;.  Farvak stepped from the shadows. Holding a sword to my side growling &quot;Come with us now or she dies&quot;  Gorsha took in the situation and agreed to join us.  Farvak's voice low and menacing &quot;Wise choice Gorsha. Kat teleport us to Dreadlands now&quot;.   I did as Farvak commanded, with deep despair in my heart and spirit.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We arrived at the druid ring in Dreadlands and there Farvak took all that might aid Gorsha to escape then took the chains that secured my wrist and put them on Gorsha. We were now chained together Gorsha and I, my neck his wrist. How I wished he would jerk the chains and break my neck so I could no longer feel this heart break.<br>
  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Okay Kat do your thing&quot;. Ordered Farvak.  I cast the spells necessary for our travel to the docks of the Overthere.   I couldn't look at Gorsha feeling that I should have died rather than put his life at risk.  So we traveled silently to the Headquarters of the Plague Bringers.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  My thoughts remembering the times we had fought side by side.  Gorsha was not like most mages.   He used his pet for the heavy battles yes but unlike most mages he had not neglected his own body and under those robes stood a man that could have been a warrior.  I had always admired and loved this man for his wisdom and advice.  He was a noble man, generous friend and one of the few that I would trust with my life. My heart feeling sickened and unworthy of his friendship now.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We arrived at the building in the docks of the Overthere.  Gorsha was put in chains of his own and lead away. Farvak pleased with the way things were going seemed to strut around with his new power and success.  &quot;Okay Kat back to Feerrott and finish up there&quot;.  Farvak handed me my spell book. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was now that I took the opportunity to reach out with my mind an tell Gorsha that I was truly sorry for his capture.  Gorsha answered back &quot;Hon, it is all right, this is as planned, Kygero wanted to have someone here to make sure you were all right she was there watching us.  She has followed us as well do not worry yourself any more friend.&quot;  At this news my spirits were lifted and hope had been restored.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I wasn't alone now with Gorsha there.  My sweet smart sister Kygero had kept the Bronze Dragon informed of our situation.   I now wondered how to best get information to Kygero.  I would have to talk with Gorsha some more later but for now it was off to Feerrott to teleport those Plague Bringers and supplies back here.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With Kygero knowing of the Plague Bringers current movements she could report back to Rashek.  Things looked better now than they had just a few hours before. Now the news of Phyllis and Keel's escape began sinking in and became frosting on the cake for me.<br>

It was late and Iszabelle was not pleased with her followers.  They were unable to find how the prisoners had escaped.  Iszabelle channeled her mana and manipulated the magical energies inherent to Norrath and summoned her familiar.  It softly perched on her shoulder and servants quickly moved away, for they were familiar with its scorpion like tail and how it liked to flick at them.  The imp straightened and began to flap its leather like wings as it reads Iszabelles thoughts.  Upon receiving her mental cue the imp jumped into the air in a flurry of motion.  The servants began to run and scream as they realized it was after them.  Worthless, all of you.  Worthless, Iszabelle said softly as she left the room where death now reigned. <br>
<br>
Fravak was with her again.  It was late and Katreenas anger was arousing him.  She stood in the middle of the room undressed. Fravak was teasing her and pushing her limits.  Iszabelle appeared with her imp and shouted Fravak!  His eyes were wide when he turned to see Iszabelle.  You are to go and solve this mess immediately. No questions asked. Leave now!  Fravaks eyes darted from Iszabelle and you could see he was very angry for the interruption, he gathered his things and left.<br>
<br>
Iszabelle walked slowly to Katreena. Her hands touched Katreenas soft shoulders as she walked behind her.  Iszabelle took her hair and brushed it to one side and kissed her necked while sliding one arm around her.  Iszabelle whispered you see Katreena, you and I know that Fravak has gone overboard with his fascination about you. It is his downfall.  I know what you are up too!  Katreena tightened as she felt a sharp piercing pain at her neck.  <br>
<br>
Iszabelle walked to the front and grabbed Katreenas rags and threw them at her.  Go, you are free. I dont need you here.  You are disrupting everything! I will know what you are up too.<br>
<br>
Katreena grabbed her clothes and dressed.  She stood at the mirror and gasped.  She saw a strange small beetle like creature trying to enter the puncture that Iszabelle had made........<br>

I held it in my hand it shell hard, it's legs scraping against my fingers, it's pinchers gnawing, cutting into my skin as it struggled to free itself from my grasp.  Then my mind cleared. <br>
<br>
    I walked back over to where Iszabelle was standing watching my every move.  Her eyes dark, empty holes of blackness.  Her face as cold and calm as a dead sea, lovely to look at but holding so much danger under the surface.  The air was thick with tension between us as I approached her, our eyes locked as the challenge had begun.<br>
<br>
    I held out the bug to her, smiling showing it to her as I crushed it in my hand.<br>
<br>
    I spoke my voice calm and almost musical  &quot;Leave, me leave? Free? Whatever makes you think I want to leave? I have all that I want here and now for my purposes.  You seem to miss the point of my actions Iszabelle&quot; her face darkened as we stood together her breath hot against my face. <br>
<br>
         I continued &quot;Yes, I am here to distract and disrupt Farvak and your plans for the Bronze Dragon Fellowship.  But you and I both know that there is something more going on here than the war between the Plague Bringers and the Bronze Dragon Fellowship.  You and I are instruments of our own Gods yours and mine.  I have been prepared for this battle all of my life have you?&quot;  My eyebrow raised to her on this last note. I brushed my hair aside, as blood dripped down my neck, warm and wet.<br>
<br>
    She was smiling now as if she finally understood all to well that I too had some knowledge of my fate to come. <br>
<br>
      I smiled back my voice more firm &quot;Your God has saw fit to kill my family. Without that 1st strike I would not have become so strong in my faith.  My own God filing me with the Light of the Righteous and Just.  Yours testing the strength and will by continuing to punish me without just cause.  Taking from me the only man I could love, stealing from my womb the child that was created from that love. Taking the only soft spots from my life that gave me reason to care for others.   I have learned my lessons well, don't you think?  I am like a sword of the best metals that have been fired and bound, enchanted made pure with lessons from both your God and Mine.  I hunger for your vile and evil blood,that of your Master and followers there will be no survivors or prisoners.   I am cold, hard and ready for what is next&quot;<br>
<br>
      &quot;You should know that I am the wild card that will destroy your kind.  Know  now that I have nothing more to lose.  If I die now, that in my death I play the martyr! not only to the Bronze Dragons but to Farvak and his &quot;loyal&quot; followers in the Plague Bringers, as well!  I have a win win situation destroying you from both inside and out.&quot;  I laid  down on the bed with an air of command knowing that I had the upper hand now.<br>
<br>
    &quot;Are you ready to do battle with me? Here! Now?  You and I both know I do not need that spell book to call upon the powers of Mother Tunare&quot; my hand waved towards the book. I stood up as if preparing to fight, but instead I started casting. <br>
<br>
    An electricity ran through the air as a rift opened and we were both teleported through time and space to the Druid Ring in North Karanas.  Iszabelle was taken aback at this, when we arrived she was quickly attacked by the druids that held vigilance there.  She had to quickly stepped into the shadows, retreat was all she could do to escape her death. <br>
<br>
       It was then that  I quickly gated back to the docks and the building where I was bound by more than my chains.  I cast Superior camouflage on myself and searched the building for Gorsha.  I found him and quickly gated out to the Druid Ring in East Karanas.  Then told him to head quickly to High Hold Keep, to contact Kygero, I would be in touch.  <br>
<br>
       I was headed to find Farvak, grinning as I now had again bested Iszabelle.  She had given me a tool, the plague to use against her own kind.  I was not done with the Plague Bringers or my plans to destroy them all. My reasons were personal, but my actions and deeds were by the will of Mother Tunare, herself.<br>

can concentrate on more important matters at hand! This foul<br>
creature has taken too many lives and too much of our time. He is nothing, and should be dealt with hastely!&quot;, my sister's logic was finally getting to me. Kaitlyne had a point, and i was tired of wasting hers and Mythias's time. All this waiting around for the Plague Bringers to make a move was wearing on everyone's nerves and patience. I had made up my mind.<br>
&quot;O.k. sis, you are right. Ragingwolf will be our first objective, then we will move on to the rest of the wretched Plague Bringers. I am going to retrieve Mythias from his post and we will join you. Do not make a move on him till we get there!! Just wait, it won't be long.&quot;, i replied.<br>
I could hear my sister's mental sigh of relief, &quot;You got it Kyg, i will be waiting... but hurry, he is in East commons now and i think he is headed to the Oasis to take the boat to Kunark. We have to stop him before he gets on the barge or we will lose him!&quot;<br>
Damn, Mythias and i will have to move fast to catch up to him. &quot;Enough talk then, on my way. Be careful sis, and don't let him on the barge!&quot;<br>
Kaitlyne responded, &quot;I will do my best, just hurry!&quot; and i felt her break the connection of our minds.<br>
Without preparing my self, i called the spirits to take me to my bind point. I stepped out of the darkness and right behind Mythias. Without turning around, Mythias spoke, &quot;Greetingsss Lady Kygero, your ssscent isss unmissstakable and i am glad you here. It ssseemsss that Katreena and the Plague Bringersss are not coming back here<br>
or at leassst not for a while.&quot; Finally turning to face me, i could see that there was a few long scratches, caked with dried blood running down his check. Yet he was smiling that sharp, toothy smile as if nothing was amiss.<br>
&quot;What happened to your face, Scaly one?&quot;<br>
His long, narrow tongue flicked out of his pointy toothed mouth to lick the wound, then he chuckled. &quot;I took the initiative and ssspoke with Farvak'sss wife while i waited.<br>
Ssshe wasss not very welcoming to me and ssshowed me that fire that Farvak must love in hisss women. Neverthelessss, ssshe did cooperate when i told her that Farvak had hisss coming to him and ssshe could help with it. That wasss all it took for her to loosssen her tongue. Guesssss what i found out? The Plague Bringersss have there head quartersss in the Overthere port cccity. Alssso, thier plansss are coming to a head.&quot;<br>
Well that explains Ragingwolf's reason for going to the Oasis and the docks there.<br>
Quickly, i sat and began memming the spells i would need for our trip and possible confrontation with Ragingwolf. When i was finished i stood and told Mythias what the plan was. He seemed to like the idea and was getting bored with his vigilant watch. He too then sat, pulled his book out and began to prepare.<br>
&quot;I am ready Kygero, let usss be off.&quot;<br>
Calling the spirits again to do my bidding, both our feet left the ground and the Scale of Wolf entered our body and we were off.<br>
We both ran in silence and stopped for nothing. Reaching the East Commons tunnel, i concentrated my mind and contacted Kaitlyne. &quot;Sis, where are you now?&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm running behind Ragingwolf, we just left the tunnel and am headed out into the desert. Where are you?&quot;<br>
&quot;Mythias and i are in the tunnel now and Tunare willing we will be with you soon! Hang in there Kait.&quot;<br>
&quot;No problem Kygero.&quot;<br>
Ahh, Northern Ro and the heat blasted desert surface. We left the tunnel and continued on. As we passed the undead ruined ring and derv camp, i picked up on my sisters tracks.<br>
Excellent, we were catching up, and just might be able to stop Ragingwolf before he gets on the barge to Kunark. The snake spire was just in sight when Kaitlynes tracks disappeared. That could mean only one thing, she and Ragingwolf had entered the Oasis. Pushing on, Mythias and i soon found ourselves in the Oasis as well and just in time. My sister called out to me, &quot;Sis, he is at the docks and the barge is here!!! Should i confront him and try to stop him from getting on the barge?&quot;<br>
As i was about to answer her, she started again, &quot;Wait, he just got off the barge and is now sitting on the dock, what is this all about?&quot;<br>
&quot;I don't know Kaitlyne, but good.&quot;<br>
Then i heard Mythias begin to chuckle.<br>
&quot;What is it snake breath?&quot;, i asked.<br>
&quot;We can ssstop Kygero, he isssn't going anywhere. I contacted him, insssult him, and challenged him to a duel. Hisss vanity got the bessst of him thisss time. He accccepted, we've got him now.&quot;<br>
&quot;That was good thinking Mythias, but he is a little more experienced than you.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yesss but, he doesssn't know about you and your sssissster.<br>
Buff me up and then ssstay out of sssite, just watch from a dissstanccce and heal me when i need it. By the time he figuresss it out, it will be to late for him.&quot;<br>
I began to laugh. This reptile was smarter than the average Iksar. &quot;What would i do without you Mythias?&quot; We both shared in a laugh then.<br>
&quot;Here is the plan Kaitlyne, Mythias challenged him to a duel. That is why he got off the barge. I will buff him and when they begin you watch him from the south side of the dock and i will watch from the north. When Mythias is almost downed, we begin to heal him. Ragingwolf will be helpless then to Mythias and we can take the bastard.&quot;<br>
&quot;Sounds like a plan Kyg. Lets do it!&quot;<br>
Again burrying my nose in my favorite book, i memorized all the good buff spells for Mythias. As i started to buff him, he too buffed himself and sat to meditate.<br>
&quot;With all thessse buffsss, i feel like i could take him and the whole of the Plague Bringersss on!&quot; Mythias was excited and his adrenaline was pumping for the battle ahead.<br>
&quot;Good, and remember, we have your back. Shall we?&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh yesss!&quot;, was his reply.<br>
With that we were off. I stayed behind the dune just north of the dock and called the Spirit of the Wolf and Superior Camoflauge on myself. Mythias went down to the dock and confronted Ragingwolf. I heard him challenge Ragingwolf to a duel and of course it was accepted. Everyone near the dock stopped what they were doing to watch and made room for the insueing battle.<br>
Ragingwolf let out a cry, &quot;You will die now by my hands you stupid reptilian beast!!&quot;<br>
Not saying a word, Mythias began casting. The battle was on.<br>
Getting the first blow in, Mythias diseased Ragingwolf and then pulled his Wraithbone Hammer out to go into melee. Fuming that he wasted his initiative, Ragingwolf pulled his own weapon and began to fight back. The battle went on for quite a while. The air was filled with magic and their weapons were drenched in blood. It looked as if Mythias might actually not need our help when Ragingwolf riposted a critical blow from Mythias. Ragingwolf came around and slammed his weapon into Mythias's head, knocking him back and nearly killing him. As if on que, Kaitlyne and i stood and called the spirits to heal our scaly friend. With both our heals soaking into Mythias, his wounds all closed and he<br>
started in again with refreshed eneregy.<br>
Outraged, Ragingwolf looked around and yelled out, &quot;What in the name of Innoruuk!! How dare someone help this beast while in a duel with me!!&quot; He looked up and saw me. His eyes bulged out and i could see why he got his name. It was appropriate for him. Everyone else that was sitting and watching also started to yell out that it was a forfiet duel.<br>
Stupidly, Ragingwolf did not turn to face Mythias in time to stop him from his downward thrust with the handle of the hammer on Ragingwolf's head. Ragingwolf's head split wide and the blood spewed out in all directions. He fell to the desert floor unconcience. Mythias hastely disarmed and tied up Ragingwolf. Kaitlyne and i came down the dunes and stood next to Mythias. All that was watching started in on us. Saying that we cheated and should let Ragingwolf go. I quickly explained all that was going on with the Plague Bringers and our Bronze Dragon Fellowship. I told them of the capture and destruction of some of our guild by theirs and that we were merely getting back at them. Most of the spectators were still confused but seemed to decide it wasn't there problem. Of course there was a few that continued putting up an argument but were quited by the others. Deciding it was time to make our departure, we gated out to the East commons with our quary.<br>
Carrying the prisoner, we took him to Highhold Keep where the other Bronze Dragons awaited. Camoflauging Mythias, we got him into our rooms and we all knelt in front of Lord Rashek.<br>
&quot;You and your small band have done well Kygero. My thanks to you Kaitlyne of the Order of Concord and Mythias of the Bloodtalon. Banlaen, Sloar, show our unwilling guest to the dungeon and put a watch on him.&quot; Rashek pointed to Ragingwolf and waved his hand in dismissall. The two Bronze Dragons grabbed Ragingwolf roughly and lead him away.<br>
Rashek continued, &quot;We will deal with him later and ask the questions that need to be answered. As for you three, get some food and rest. Plans are being made as we speak to deal with the Plague Bringers.&quot;<br>
&quot;Thank you M'lord, but i must tell you that Mythias has found out the where abouts of Iszabelle's head quarters. The port city of Overthere is where they are amassed.&quot;, i said.<br>
Rashek only smiled, &quot;Yes i know Kygero, someone has told me this already. He was captured by Farvak and then saved by our own Katreena and gated out. Gorsha is waiting for you in your chamber. Go to him.&quot;<br>
My face flushed with color and i moved to depart to my room when Rashek gently grabbed my arm.<br>
&quot;When you see him, do not be alarmed... but he has left our guild to join another. He is a brother to the Pax Maelstrom now. He still loves us and we him, but people change and he has decided to move to another family. It is his life to do with, and we will not shun him for his free will.&quot; and Rashek let go of me.<br>
Confused and some what disappointed, i went to my room while Kaitlyne and Mythias were made comfortable. What was this all about? I had just seen Gorsha not too long ago and he said nothing of his thoughts of changing guilds to me. My mind was racing now. Was it because i didn't marry him? He knows that my heart is his. Did he have problems with our guild or someone in it? Did the Pax Maelstrom plan to recruit him for a long time now? Or was it just a spontaneous decision? Like we needed more distractions from our present dangers. I stood in front of the door to my chamber thinking for what seemed an eternity, going over all and trying to figure out what to say. Suddenly the door swung open and there stood Gorsha. Looking at his dark skin and curly hair, memories and feelings came flooding back in a rush and all my doubts and questions were forgotten. I was just so glad to see him safe. I threw my arms around him, pushing him back into the room and quietely shut the door behind me. I would eat and rest later. All the while, in the back of my mind, i kept visualizing my guild sister Katreena's face. Mother Tunare please keep her safe and may she contact me soon! We need to know how she is and what she wants us to do! Watch over her Mother Tunare! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ada07e><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ukatreena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Katreena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Knight, Order of Talon</span><br>  Posts: 312<br> <font color=#c54400>(11/29/00 1:41:37 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/soyouthinkiam/eq/Kat/images/Katpix.GIF WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   The Beginning of the End</span><hr size=1> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I now called upon the Druids at the ring in West Commons opening the rift again and gating there.  I walked shyly over to the group of evil elves who found sport in killing the Druids at this ring.  I caught the eye of one of them and he started taunting me with names and spells.  I raised my eyes to meet his and asked &quot;Have you seen Farvak, my Lord and Master&quot;.  This stopped him and he looked at me in shock &quot;Farvak your Master, Druid?&quot; <br>
<br>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  I lowered my eyes and said &quot;I am sorry for being so bold, but I must find him. I have my duties to him now.&quot;  He doubted my sincerity with more questions &quot;You wear the Bronze Dragon Fellowship Insignia, Druid! Why call Farvak your Master? He is of the Plague Bringers&quot;.  I knelt now and held my head low &quot;Please Sir, I am the plan that will bring down the Bronze Dragons.  I must find Farvak quickly.Lead me, if you will, to his side I know he will reward you well for this service&quot;.  I held my hands out and offered him my chains.<br>
<br>
  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I could sense the change in him with the mention of reward as he took my chains.  He leaned over to the group he was with and laughed &quot;Look I have my own pet Druid to play with&quot;.  They laughed as he stood up and began to lead me on to Neriak and hopefully to Farvak.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp On through the woods then into the city following my captor who was enjoying the power of bringing in one such as I.  Vile insults were thrown at me as well as stones and spoiled foods.  He stopped at a bar and found out where Farvak was. <br>
<br>
A guard stopped us as we approached a building that had apparently seen some destruction my captor spoke with him and the guard turned entered the building. A few minuets later Farvak stood in front of me and my captor.  His eyes filled with suspicion as he saw me in tow.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Humm, now what have we here&quot;  He spoke with my captor and asked how he had come into possession of me and I knew that lies would be told here.  Farvak smiled and paid the man well with bags filled with gold.   He then garbed my chains and pulled me along into the building. <br>
<br>
 &quot;Well now it seems you have tried to escape again! My what fun we will have  getting to the truth of how you came to be here&quot; he said as we marched along.  &quot; Ah, maybe I can use your talents now to sort out this mess&quot;.  We stepped over bodies that  lay ripped, bloody and scattered on the floor.  &quot;Iszabelle should have been a bit more subtle than this if she is to have the support she needs to defeat the Bronze Dragons.  Killing her own  even if they were fools is not a good sign.  There are better ways to handle things and keep those you need close&quot;.   We stopped in front of a badly wounded dark elf who looked scared and quite shaken.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &quot;You can start with him&quot; Farvak waved his arm as he sat down in a large chair.  I healed the elf and then sat at Farvak's feet.  Farvak started questioning the elf and for every foolish answer the poor thing gave Farvak would strike him down.  Soon the story of what had happened according to this poor mans knowledge came out.  I again healed him and he was taken out to a room to eat and rest.  Farvak turned to me and said &quot;Well now, not much else we can do here I will leave it to the fools to clean up&quot;.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Time for you and I to return to Kunark, aye Kat&quot;   He said looking tired by the days events.  It was then that I spoke up &quot;Sorry to speak to you Lord&quot; I braced for the slap that should have come for speaking to him without permission.  &quot;I am afraid that Iszabelle is not going to be pleased.  She has granted me my freedom. This just after she had you leave.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   Farvak's eyes filled with surprise and then rage.  &quot;What&quot; his voice roared.  Glaring at me with suspicion he then pulled at my chains so that I was close to him.  I dared not look at him, but could feel his hands grab my arms tightly, pulling me still closer. His breath  hot on my head his body so close to mine that I was bushing up against his strong muscular chest, feeling the warmth through his clothing. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I think you lie Kat.  Why are you here then&quot; his voice commanding an answer. So I gave him the truth, well sort of,  &quot; It was in my efforts to set Gorsha free that I was captured at West Commons Druid Ring.  I didn't get to bring my spell book when I left the docks I wasn't prepared to do battle then&quot;.  <br>
<br>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Farvak laughed amused &quot;So she has lost three of her most valued prizes today.   She is a foolish woman.  Failure is all around her now!  It is time to report things to Iszabelle's Master, O'berton and perhaps get a promotion&quot;   His voice now filling confidence said  &quot;So now on to High Pass!&quot; he had let the words slip, then caught himself.<br>
<br>
 &quot;But we must be very careful as that is the stronghold of your guild.&quot;  He pulling my face so that our eyes met then said &quot;Wouldn't want you to trick me now would I &quot; there was a pause for a moment as he thought and then said &quot;So maybe, we will go to the docks of Kunark and see if your telling the truth first. We will pick up your spell book as well&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I thought to myself O'Berton was behind all this I how had a name and a location. High Hold Pass, this was all to convenient.  So this is how the Plague Bringers knew of the Bronze Dragons movements?  Yes, this was going to be tricky to get this information to Lord Rashek.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I was brought out of my thought by Farvak saying &quot;Are we ready to go, Kat?&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I quickly started casting the spell for the Gate to the Dreadlands Druid Ring the rift opened and we were again standing there in a most beautiful, but deadly valley.  The trees painted with leaves of gold, red and orange that danced in the wind. We ran to the tunnel that would lead us to a land frigid and iced over.  Then on to the Overthere where the fern and fauna were alive and deadly as well. <br>
<br>
When we reached the docks  Farvak was holding my chains he walked ahead of me through the streets to the building that was now the Plague Bringers Headquarters. The guards at the dock were all to familar with this scene to stop and question us. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We entered the main floor as Iszabelle came down to meet us.  &quot;Farvak&quot; she said seductively &quot;I see Kat has brought you back.&quot;  His eyebrow raised &quot;Kat? brought me!&quot; he laughed.  Then said &quot;No, she was captured at the West Commons Druid Ring by one of our own there.  You were a fool to try and set her free Iszabelle!  You know that I am the one who controls her&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Iszabelle's eyes flamed as she spat &quot;You are her puppet, fool, delusional!  Take her up to your room now!.  Then come back we have much to discuss.&quot;  Iszabelle's eyes said it all as she stared at me and said &quot;You will be dead by morning,Kat&quot;   I knelt down to both and then was lead off by Farvak to his room.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Again chained to the wall I looked around knowing that this was right where I should be.  It was now that I said a prayer to Mother Tunare &quot;Thank you Oh wise and all knowing Mother of the Earth the Stars the Very essence of Norrath.  You have blessed me by delivering to me my enemies at just the right moment.  Lead me on let the knowledge and the power you have given me smite them down and destroy all of their kind.  Wipe the face of Norrath clean of their vile souls.  For Caddil, for my child for your Glory I pray.&quot;  <br>
<br>
  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Knowing what she would tell Farvak about the details of our encounter earlier.  Yet knowing he would look and judge her by her actions, they had no trust in one another  words.  She would now be seen as woman who was trying to save face, all of the mistakes that had been made, all of her orders she had given that had lead to the escape of Phillys, Kelee and Gorsha. Clearly she was not the leader that  they thought she was.  The Plague Bringers would soon turn on her.  That was what I had as a weapon now, the plague that I would bring would be one of division and doubt.<br>

The couple of days refreshed her mind and perspectives.  She knew she had to be prepared for anything.  Even though, Fravak may turn against her.  The plans were made and set to go if things didn't go well.<br>
<br>
She asked the guards to find Dekaarn and Ragingwolf.  She missed the barbarian and his companionship.  She knew he was always busy with the Iksar slaves and the mines in Frontier Mountains.  Iszabelle took a deep breathe and sighed.<br>
<br>
She paced the floors in her room.  She knew that Katreena asked to be brought to Fravak from the druid rings and she knew that she was free to go on her will.  This confirmed Iszabelle's suspicions.  She will use Fravak to destroy her.  She grabbed her cloak and disappeared into the darkness.<br>
<br>
Iszabelle enter the room as Fravak was pulling his pants up.  He blushed as he walked over to the chair to grab his tunic.  Katreena was asleep in the bed.  Iszabelle tried to contain her anger.  She looked hard at Fravak and told him to meet her downstairs.<br>
<br>
"I set her free, Fravak.  She's using you and yet you are blind," as she sat down staring at him.  "How dare you! Iszabelle. You think you know everything.  I love her and she will not do such a thing," as he paced the floors hard and avoiding eye contact with Iszabelle. <br>
"Fravak, you must kill her today.  If you don't, you will have to answer to me!"  She was eager to here his reply.<br>
"I will do no such thing!" as he shouted.  "If you touch her, I swear..." He words can to a sudden stop. He turned around to find Iszabelle missing. She had disappeared. Fravak let a sigh of relief. "I must hide her tonight and fake a death to make her trust me."  <br>
<br>
Upstairs, Katreena could here the augments.  She was please to see that her prayers were working to her advantage.  She knew that her returning would put a wedge between Iszabelle and Fravak. She dressed quitely feeling an odd sense that someone was watching her then she heard 'I'm watching you'.<br>
                    *****************<br>
<br>
Iszabelle gated to the Dreadlands. She stepped into the shadows and passed travelers to the city.  She followed the creek into the vast mountains.  The breeze carried a faint smell of death.  She took a deep breathe.  Iszabelle felt she was not in control. "Has the gods punished me! Have I done any wrong" as she shouted as the echoes traveled throughout the mountains.<br>

His face tense with worry over what he and Iszabelle had be arguing about.  How was he going to handle this, how was he going to hide me, protect me.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  His attention drawn to me as  he started to speak then stopped as he saw that my spell book was beside me. Eyeing me with suspicion and surprise he said &quot; Why are you still here.  You have your book, you could have left at anytime while I was gone.&quot;   <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I stood up and faced him, our bodies touching, my fingers finding the buttons on his shirt. I began unbuttoning them.  My lips found his and passionately, teasingly I kissed him.  Then I whispered &quot;How could I leave you now.  My'lord you are the Love and Master of my life now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He stepped back, looking questioningly into my eyes &quot;Kat, what trickery are you up to now&quot;  I let my nails scratch  his chest, cutting into his flesh, I then quickly kissed the wound.  My eyes then found his as I answered seductively &quot;I am sorry  My'Lord, I overheard you as you confessed your love for me to Iszabelle&quot;  Sighing I continued &quot;This is so confusing for me, but then it has all  become so very clear.  You were right Hate and Love are two sides of the same coin.   You have opened my eyes and shown me that&quot;,  I spat with discussed  &quot;Mother Tunare has used me my whole life.  You were right and you are the Truth that has set me free&quot;.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I knelt at his feet and said &quot;Thank you, My'Lord&quot;.  Farvak's eyes gleamed with delight as the thought of his plan for my transformation into his servant and wife seemed close at hand. He pulled me close and  kissed me back.  Hungry he lifted me to carry me to the bed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then the moment was broken by the remembrance of Iszabelle's words  &quot;Kill her today.&quot;   He looked at me and said &quot;Kat it is time we go to O'Berton.  Get us there quickly your life depends on it&quot;.   <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Straightening my clothes I picked up my spell book and began to cast.  &quot;I belive you said he was in High Hold Pass. Yes?&quot;   He grinned &quot;You've a mind like a trap&quot;.  He put his strong arms around me  as we were teleported to the Druid Ring in Misty Thicket.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Quickly we moved through Rivervale and Kithicor Forest to the high cliff walls that would lead us to High Hold Pass.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Farvak in the lead now guided me to an older, forgotten part of the Keep.  Once there we were shown to a study and I was told to wait there.  I knew Farvak would be taken to see O'Berton.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  I opened my mind and let all of those that were there enter.  What they would find is a stone cold heart, confusion, and twist of truth that would lead them to believe that I was truly under Farvak's control.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I waited as I felt dark forces all around me closing in.  I knew what I had planned could be suicide.  I could find myself lost in Farvak's dark world, forever mad. Or better for me, at least, be with Caddil and our Child.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp O'Berton would be suspicious of Farvak but would find no trickery in his heart about what he would say about Iszabelle and her failures to bring about the downfall of the Bronze Dragon Fellowship.  He would send for Iszabelle, seeking out answers to why she had failed.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp O'berton's Imp followed him into the study as I turned to face the three of them.  O'berton looked me over and then I felt his mind enter mine looking for any thoughts or emotions that would betray me.  He spoke into my mind &quot;You confess love for Farvak and yet I find none&quot;   I answered &quot;Hate and Love are but emotions. I serve Farvak and if he serves you then so do I&quot;   &quot;What of the Bronze Dragons don't you serve them&quot;.  I thought  &quot;Look deep here you will see that I have Hate for them all now.  For being a caring family they haven't shown it once. For they  sent no one to save Caddil, or me, and let my child die&quot;  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &quot;Ah&quot;, he said as he searched on. &quot;What of Mother Tunare?&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &quot;Lies all lies, Farvak has shown me that my eyes were closed by lies&quot; I answered bitterly.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Good&quot; He said &quot;Now you will be shown to a room to rest we will talk again later. My Imp Safvas will guard you as I have more to speak of with Farvak&quot;.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Imp flapped it's batlike wings as we headed down the hall.  It's face was twisted in a grotetesque smile.  &quot;In here white skin&quot; He ordered his voice a gravely high pitched scratch.  He smelled me as I walked past, his nostrils flared.  I walked across the room to the doors that opened out onto a balcony and stood there.  Safvas said &quot;Come back inside. Now!&quot;  I turned and answered &quot;No&quot;.  I smiled at the Imp and said &quot;Have you ever tasted Wood Elf Blood?&quot;     <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Safvas looked and me and licked his lips.  &quot;I have only heard tell.  Some say it is very sweet&quot;.   I offered &quot;would you like to taste mine&quot;  I held out my arm.  This drew the Imp closer.  As he settled closely to me.  I said &quot;Please be gentle&quot;.  He bit down and started sucking up my blood.  So engrossed in his feeding,  he didn't feel me casting a spell on him of Stinging Swarm.  But it wasn't long before, I was quickly becoming dizzy from the lack of blood.  The Imp was delighted and emoting over his meal.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was then that Farvak entered the room saw me in distress, drew his blade and killed the Imp.  But not befor the Imp called out to O'Berton &quot;Spy Lord, Spys!&quot;<br>
O'Berton burst into the room as Farvak was lifting me to the bed.  Farvak said threateningly &quot;So you would have killed her while you put me in charge of the Plague Bringers.  This behind my back is this all Iszabelle's plan?&quot;.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp O'Berton looked shocked and then simply waved him off, saying.  &quot;Didn't know Imp's had a weakness for Elven Blood.  Sorry, No harm done, she lives&quot;.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Smiling weakly I looked into Farvak's eyes and said &quot;I will be fine I just need some fruit and rest love.&quot;  He looked at the bite wounds on my arms licked at the last drops and said grinning &quot;I see why the Imp couldn't resist you&quot;  He bandaged my wounds and brushed my hair from my face. While I ate and drank the fruit and wine that O'Berton had ordered brought.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sometime in the middle of the night I awoke to find Farvak asleep beside me.  It was now that I tried to contact Kygero.  Using the code she had taught me when we first met.  She and I had been laying in wait to kill the leader of the Bandits here in High Hold pass for a valuable page needed for the Testament of Vanear.  She and I didn't want the Bandits over here us or our plans. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  If O'Berton discovered me sending a message it would be easily explained away.  I would simply say that I was discovered here in High Hold Pass by, what use to be, a friend.  I needed to keep the Bronze Dragons complacent.  Letting them know I was safe and why I had not come to them. Explaining that I had be infected by the Plague and refused to endanger my family and not to send a rescue. This expiation would work, I was sure of it.   <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kygero was here and close.  I told her that the Bronze Dragons had a chance to &quot;Cut the Head Off the Snake&quot; so to speak.  Thereby destroying the Plague Bringers from the head down.  If they moved quickly and secretively they could lay in wait till Iszabelle was here and then attack killing them all.  I would let her know when Iszabelle arrived. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I stood out on the balcony as the sun rose in the ski turning it shades of orange on a blue pallet.  Farvak came up behind me kissing my neck, teasingly biting at my ear lobes.  He said grinning &quot;Come back to bed love I am in the mood for passion and you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp O'Berton met us in the Dinning area later that day.  He eyed me and again entered my mind &quot;Iszabelle says your pulling Farvak's strings&quot;   I let my mind open up and said back &quot;Not unlike any woman who is smart around Farvak, or any man for that mater.  See for yourself search my mind for your answers&quot;.  This open invitation took O'Berton by surprise.  He turned to Farvak ordered  &quot;Come with me&quot; turned and walked away.   I returned to my room feeling the coldness in the shadows that could only mean one thing &quot;Iszabelle was here&quot;.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I am watching you&quot; she said in my mind, now close and threatening. &quot;You think your safe here?&quot;.  I answered &quot;Safer than you right now&quot;.  I returned to my room.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I sent Kygero one word &quot;Now&quot;.  and waited for the storm that would wash Norrath clean of this Plague once and for all.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It wasn't long before the Bronze Dragons entered that part of the Keep. They had been gathering in number under Lord Rashek for months and easily out numbered  O'Berton, Farvak and Iszabelle.  They  were soon taken prisoners and the deed done.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Everything seemed anticlimactic as if there was something missing. <br>
  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It wasn't till later when Kygero explained what had been going on with the Guild that my heart was again broken.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  It seemed that the Guild had suffered its own losses in my absence.  An internal struggle had occurred ending with Lady Molina leaving and heading out with Lady Kelee and Phyllis at her side to help find the cure that would heal Khaldron who was still very ill.  Lord Rashek now had more duties as he was given Regency Over the guild we now had a new High Lord.  High Lord Tiggyr and his new wife High Lady Bekkaha who was with child now. There were many new faces in court as well as some old dear friends.  Regency High Lord Rashek had appointed me as an officer and I was welcomed into the court by High Lord Tiggyr with honor.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I requested that I be given leave from my duties as I needed to renew my faith with Mother Tunare and erase the doubts and mistrust that Farvak had planted.  My heart now had time to grieve deeply for Caddil and our lost Child.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was on just one of these nights when I lay in bed letting the grief take over like a sea at high tide, that Mother Tunare came to me again.  She said that Caddil's spirit had survived.  That he was now a young mage.  However all memories of me were gone.  To try and remind him of our love and life would only drive him mad. That this  was the work of the Gods as they had need of his spirit in the future of Norrath. <p>One Very Adventurous Druid<BR>Katreena Wanderheart 41nd Leaf Master Brewer <BR>
