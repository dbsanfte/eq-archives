So i ooc saying &quot;we got 300+ traders could a few please step outa trader mode for no longer then 30 secs so i could buy myself a trader bag&quot;( i even offered to pay the ones  that did step out for me) there was also a other trader in the bazaar the was trying to get a bag he ooc as well asking people to step out just for 30 secs or so. After about 2 or 3 oocs someone replys back in ooc saying something like I am thinking out of reason and i think i want to log onto my other two accounts and put em into trader mode( thus making it even harder to buy a bag ) so i send him a tell asking him why he would want to do that all we want is a bag. he comes back with becuase i feel like it and i can if i want to. So i ask him who is your main (he was on a lvl 3) he goes why do you want to know i said to him well so i know to FD if your ever around and there are  mobs around. ( he was being alot more rude then it seems above) So he goes my main is a lvl 59 if that matters.<br>Then he sends me a tell . &quot;cent is in your guild isnt she?&quot; i said yes tell me who your main is and i will let her know your upset. he says thats all i needed to know have a nice night.<br>The next day i was on cent sends me a tell saying Kempo i need to talk to you.  i asked her how the kael raid went and grats to bc on it. she comes back saying she had a complaint about me. not even asking me what went on she tells me that we dont curse at people. and we dont train people.(this all about the guy in bazaar) i said oic this is about that guy in bazaar. i said dont you want to hear my side of the story she didnt say if she did or didn't want to hear it but i told her anyways.  she goes well we dont act like that in BC im going to have to ask you to remove your self from the guild. so at this point i was a lil po'ed at this guy in the bazaar i asked who was that guy anyway she says a very good and trusted friend of mine. i said well i don't think i should have to leave without talking to some people in bc first. befor i got to say anything else she /guildremoved me saying i got consent from all my officers on this. so i sent s few tells to some of my friends in BC ( wont say names might incriminat them) and they were as po'ed as me about it so cent gets asked about it doesn't really reply with anything but Kempo was removed do to repeated offences and left it at that. Well just wanted you guys to know the real story.<br>I was kicked out of BC because of Cents long time trusted friend. so becarful out there those non guild members are always more important then the members of the guild that been with bc for awhile.<br><br>Silverjake Hammerfist 52 shaman<br>Kempo Furyfist 52 monk <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/usilverjake0081.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Silverjake0081</A> at: 9/27/02 6:29:22 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#353535><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/uthorvan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thorvan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Admissions Officer</span><br>  Posts: 1383<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/27/02 6:58:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclebloodcirclegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2204.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.tj3systems.com/images/bc_avatar.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: GOOD BY BC</span><hr size=1> K, first things first. There is no way in all of time and creation I or the rest of the officers would let Centuri guildremove somebody just because he had ticked off a good friend of hers.<br><br>If you must know something that you haven't witnessed yet, this guild is run by it's officers with the guild leader making final-neutral decisions on votes. Very democratic. Centuri may be the guild-leader but she can't do anything without asking the officers first. Same with the officers, they can't do anything without asking the officers first and the guildleader. <br><br>We have received multiple tells on you Kempo, don't try to say something else. What you were doing was swearing and generally making an ass of yourself in /ooc. Since that is a /guildremovable offense, action was taken. <br><br>Just in case you ask. What's a guildremoveable offense? Nowhere other than in the applications section, which lays down the rules, for BC is it said.. <br><br>A guildremoveable offense is anything that makes BC or the person doing it lose face and look dishonorable. We're pretty lenient because.. Hey.. we're human.. we mess up. But after receiving multiple tells. There's not much we can do about it but take action.<br><br>Sorry it had to come to this.<br><br>~Thorvan<br><br>p.s. Your story's close, but with all the profanity removed.
