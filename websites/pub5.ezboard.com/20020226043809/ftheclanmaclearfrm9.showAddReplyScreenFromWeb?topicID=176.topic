From the gates, simply go north through that valley where the road bends to the left.  When the valley ends, you will see a large &quot;village&quot; of undead directly in front of you.  Since the guard changes appear to have deterred the grief hunters for now, it should be better than ever.  Just be careful if you sit on the north side, there is an Isailf camp with roaming scouts just north of there.  Once the undead get too low level, there are ice skrags on a nearby hillside that are a couple levels higher.<br>

We were getting nice xp there last night.  Even got hit by a Lurkien Invader.  Think we could have taken him if he hadn't run off and hid.   Came back and finished the rest of us off.  He coned purple but we were getting hits for around 20 point on him.  He had real good tactics.  Had to be fairly close to our level otherwise I don't think he would have run from the straight up fight.  Took out the shaman and healer before we knew what was going on. <br>

<br>
The Lurikeen invader that took us was adept at his strategies, using divide and conquer to his advantage. By killing off the Casters, and then running off the melee, he ditched behind a tree, and walked in shadows at that point, the melee folk ran behind the tree, and where confused at the disappearance. They then gathered together at the corpses of their fallen, which was where the Lurikeen was waiting in stealth. Hindsight being 20/20 - ye can see here that to hunt ones prey, one must know it's habits or tendencies. <br>
<br>
If yer members have fallen, there is no need to go gather near them my friends, it is better perhaps to make the invader come to YOU on your own terms to another prearranged area when initially setting up to engage in a friendly monster hunt in the frontier for XP. Agreeing on a secondary spot to base from in the event of invasion could/should be as second nature as checking your mirrors before you go for a drive in RL.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, in upcoming planned excursions, Ronod and I are roommates playing in the same room. If groups ever need spilt up into 2 due to having more in attendance then slots, we have talked and have decided that each of us being on two different teams would help to streamline communications betwen the groups.<br>
<br>
In much the same vein, I also am going to be looking into setting up roger wilco myself for folks that may be interested in using voice technology over typing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Lastly, I love the group we have formed, Nor, Miel, Naraa, Ronod , Traxd and I - often grouping with Raurien as well. This group has really done a LOT to make being in Siol Lear home for me. I just wanted to acknowledge that, my friends, and tell ye that I can't wait to see ye tonight <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

[PS *edit* - Met someone last night named Etherdais that wanted me to convey to his Siollian friends his hello. I take it he may be an old friend to some of ye? He said that he is very happy to see that Siol Lear has thrived, though he also said that his own guild unfortunately is not. Just wanted to pass this on to ye my friends. Thankee!

The cowardly Elf waited till our warriors were engaged in melee combat and used that opportunity to backstab our healer (Traxd) and runemaster (Abbatoir), and then run away.  Nor and I gave chase as soon as the rest of our group was secure from the creature we were fighting, but the Elf was far ahead of us by then.  If I had had me wits about me to sing my song of speed without delay, we might have caught him. As it happens we did get a few hits in on him before he &quot;vanished into the shadows&quot;. We returned to our group and began a search for a healer, but the invader struck a second time and finished the rest of us off.  One hit to me was with a dagger for 450 points of damage in a single blow!<br>
<br>
The enemy did employ good sniper tactics, and I give that credit to him. There were several lessons learned that night, which have prompted me to start a new thread called &quot;Baisc Strategy for RvR&quot; which I think might benefit the whole guild.<br>
