All is mostly quiet this time of night.  The guards very much on duty cover their assigned space with as much diligence as possible these late hours.<br><br>As the shadows play with the light of Maclear, an event occurs.<br><br>Slowly smoke appears to be coming from the floor in an area not so well patrolled.  The smoke has no smell.  The smoke is shadows and they begin to dance as a small vortex begins to form.  It expands slowly up and outwards till it reaches about a 3 foot width and 5 foot height.  Swirling the shadows crackle with little charges of light as if small electrical charges are going off.  It is here sounds begin to be heard.  Muffled at first by electrical sound offs, a voice starts to be heard.  It is that of a troll but can anyone yet hear it??  I do not know.<br><br>The votex slows and the billowing effect smooths out as if a portal is about to open.  It looks like shadowed glass.  The image of a troll appears.<br><br>&quot;Kulek speaks!, listen to mes yus Maclear.  Yus block Kulek's way.  Mes thrown out from yus place wid powerful majiks.

Across from him lie Yaibong, sleeping in her fur-lined sleeping bag, seemingly at ease in their small camp in the southern Plains of Karana. Her breath came soft and she slept easily, and she deserved the sleep. The scratches on her arms, all that were left from the combat earlier int he day, was full evidence of that. The thought of the gnoll bringing it's filthy paws close to her made Jeffryn snarl and he had to take a deep breath to let the feeling of anger pass.<br><br>He turned his attention to the group of leather gloves that he had hanging next to the fire to dry. He had obtained several pairs from the dogs of Splitpaw and had washed them to be rid of the rank wet-dog smell...and the blood. He had to give grudging respect for the makers of the gloves, they were still fine quality, even if they were in the service of the Tesch Mal gnolls.<br><br>As he went stoking the fire, Jeffryn stopped and tilted his head. He no longer felt alone and his senses perked up to capture all sound, all movement, and he turned his ear to the sounds of the hills and trees around him. His hand slid down to his feet, where his short sword lay, a gift from Morin, earned with blood and courage, with Yai at his side.<br><br>There! To his left, he heard the snap of a twig, and his hand tighted around the hilt of the sword, his mind instantly calling upon the grace of Tunare to snare his enemy before they could enter the camp. He glanced at Yai and wondered how fast he could wake her and be ready to fight...but the chance never comes. In a flash, he stands and spins, as the call of a male voice comes from the trees.<br><br>&quot;Jeffryn of MacLear,&quot; it called, questioning, unsure.<br><br>&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Jeffryn replied, backing towards his wife. &quot;Show yourself and we can discuss who we are...&quot; He was scanning the trees, but could see nothing. As he reached Yai, a man stepped from behind a tree. He was dressed in light leather and held onto a sword himself, but in a purely defensive manner. From his belt hung a small flute and over his shoulder, a lute could be seen. His light blond hair was pulled back, allowing the points of his ears to be seen. His eyes gleammed golden in the firelight, and he bore the proud look of the elven people.<br><br>&quot;I am Rukos, bard and messenger. I carry a message for Jeffryn of MacLear, from Lanadena MacLear,&quot; he said, in a stronger voice, sounding more sure of himself. &quot;Are you him?&quot;<br><br>Jeffryn relaxed his grip on his sword slightly, but still standing defense in front of Yai, who was stirring awake with the voices. &quot;Aye, I am. Jeffryn of MacLear, son of Surefall Glade.&quot;<br><br>The bard nodded, meeting Jeffryn's eyes for a moment, and being satisfied with what he saw, he dug out the sealed envelope and handed it over. He then bowed and slid his sword into the scabbard hanging opposite the flute. &quot;Very well then, Master Jeffryn, I then shall be off. I have other messages to deliver.<br><br>&quot;My thanks, good bard,&quot; Jeffryn replied, and then looked up from the envelope to add, &quot;Safe journies. May Tunare watch over you.&quot;<br><br>As the bard departed, Jeff sat next to Yai to read the letter outloud to her as she was fully awake. He then borrowed one of her parchments and wrote his reply...<br><br><br>/**************************************************\<br><br>Dear Lanadena,<br><br>Greetings, sister. First of all, fear not for Yai, <br>for she is brave and we watch out for each other. <br>She proudly faces the vicious gnolls and taunts them <br>with her magics while her pet and myself ambush them <br>from the rear. <br><br>As to your message, I shall do my best to find out <br>what I can and pass that knowledge on. I have heard <br>the name of Nordester, though I fear I do not remember <br>from where. The Karanas is a huge place, with many <br>nooks and crannies upon which to hide, but a ranger <br>never fails in tracking those he hunts.<br><br>With Blessings of Tunare,<br><br>Jeffryn Duskrunner<br>Ranger of Surefall Glade<br><br>\**************************************************/<br><br><br>...sealing the note, Jeffryn slid it into his pack. Yai jokingly pokes at him and says, &quot;Silly...you should have let the bard take that for you...&quot; <br><br>He smiles back and places one finger on her nose. &quot;Aye, I could have...but he has other duties, and we'll be heading back towards the bridge soon so I can sell the weapons and gloves from the dogs. I'll find a bard there.&quot;  He patted her sleeping bag softly, smoothing the fur out. &quot;But for now, dearest...rest and sleep...it's going to be a long week...&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/btheclanmaclear.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=jeffryn>Jeffryn</A> at: 1/31/02 8:42:43 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ubrutredblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brutredblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lad</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#330000>(1/31/02 6:25:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmacleargeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1367.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: majics, projections, and trolls</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> An eagle flies in to the Great Hall holding a scroll in it's talons.
