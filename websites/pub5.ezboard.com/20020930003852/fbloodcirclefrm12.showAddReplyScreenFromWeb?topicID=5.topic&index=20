Absently, she identified the sound that had wakened her; shuffle thud footsteps on the stone of the corridor floor.  One set.  It was the Orc guard.  She settled back into an uneasy doze.<br>
It had been such a strange couple of days, she was glad for the peace of the dark, wet cell and the cold chains on her chapped wrists, wrists that sometimes stung like an open wound.  Centuri’s mind drifted backwards in time, Tyvlain had been summoned….<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Centuri knelt at his feet in rebellious defeat, waiting for him to pronounce her fate.  Hating him, hating herself, and coming very close to hating those she loved that had yet to rescue her from this torment. The rogue stood over her, triumphant and gloating.  Just as he began to issue his first command, a young man in a robe cleared his throat behind Tyvlain.  The Dy’Truin turned, enraged at the interruption.  The Tier’dal messenger simply handed him a note with a black seal, bowed, and left without speaking a word.<br>
Fuming, Tyvlain looked at the folded piece of parchment crumpled in his hand.  Centuri could swear that the Dark Elf actually turned pale for a moment as he identified the seal.  Was his hand trembling when he broke the seal? She could not say.  Her head was lowered once more.  This time to hide her smile.  <br>
Tyvlain let loose a long curse in the Orcish tongue.  After almost two weeks in the prisons, Centuri was able to identify most of it. Biologically improbable but definitely descriptive.  “Well, it seems I must delay my enjoyment of you for a time.”  He turned to the guards, “Take her back to the cell until I return from my meeting with the Master.”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
That was two days ago…two very strange days.  Her memory blurred at this point.  It must be the drug they tried on me, she thought.  There had been a Necromancer…<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> He had stood in front of her and laughed.  He hated her for no reason but for the fact that she was Fier’dal and in chains.  Quite tired of being abused by every being within 3 leagues, she had yelled back at him. &quot;My family, my guild Blood Circle, will come for me.&quot;<br>
He laughed harder. &quot;Is that so? Do you seriously think it is possible for a bunch of fools to enter Neriak, TRY to rescue you, and survive? They would not be able to get passed me let alone the amount of guards we have,&quot;<br>
He then sat on a stool outside her cell and chuckled to himself for what seemed like hours to her.  Just sat, and stared and laughed.  <br>
But then, he grew thoughtful.  His laughing fits grew farther apart and eventually he stood and left.  A pensive look on his face. Still, his words had planted yet more doubt in her heart.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
He was right, of course.  It would be suicide to attempt to rescue someone from this place.<br>
Then there was that “cleansing ceremony”….<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> She had been taken out, into the clearing in front of the city, and put in a cage. She remembered the incense smoke and not much more besides pain, both physical and mental.  They had left her there under guard for a bit, panting from the pain.  She breathed as deeply as she could of the relatively fresh air.  Even this dark forest was still a forest and made her feel better.  Had she seen a gnome?  Reminded her of that funny, little guy, Dohpaz.  He was the reason her lingerie drawer had a lock.  Idly she wondered if Dohpaz had ever finished that spell he had been working on when she left.<br>
</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
When had that happened?  Her memory was jumbled; she couldn’t remember and had trouble even focusing.  She had sensed Kannushi and Fergussen and Masius with her the last couple days, but those must have been dreams, No one could reach her here.  They couldn’t have been real.<br>
<br>
But the man in red, the one whose face didn’t fit right, THAT had been real.  She was pretty sure it had been real, she could still feel the cold edge of his blade across her throat…<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> He had knelt over her; she remembered his words clearly. &quot;Yes, you are beaten m'lady, but not broken.&quot;<br>
He had slipped his dirk back into it's scabbard. &quot;The BC and others have a plan. Be at the ready and remain with your faith. They will come.&quot;<br>
<br>
“They will come”, “They will come”, “They will come”,  she used it as a mantra.  His words had given her something to cling to.  They knew. They were coming.  Her messenger had gotten through.  Hold on... Be strong...  Not much longer…  They were coming…<br>
</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
New step in the corridor, more than one.  Orcish grunts.  Tyvlain’s name.  An order.  The door opened.<br>
So, he had come back.  And, now he’s ready to play with his new toy.  The rage swept over her once more.  Then despair.  Centuri thought of the blank eyes of the child in Tyvlain’s room.  She whispered, “I’m sorry friends.  It appears your efforts may well be in vain.  There may be nothing left to rescue by the time you get here.”  She fingered the little red stone one more time before they hauled her to her feet. Quickly, she kicked it into the dust in the corner so they would not find it. <br>
Her fingers tingled with warmth that reminded her of a lover’s caress and she heard a faint whisper in the dark of her mind, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> “I will come…”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Then the guards hauled her back down the corridor to the Dy’Truin rooms.<br>

Not that he had really known a good night's sleep since the age of 12, two years before he began his training as a ranger. His mind drifted lazily back to those days, back to that more peaceful time. <br>
<br>
Sunlight and laughter, trees and games. Those are the memories that all should have of their childhood. Fergussen smiled and his eyelids drooped as he recalled those happy, happy days. As he drifted back to sleep his mind replayed the time he spent with his family in the forest's of the Jaggedpine. <br>
<br>
He remembered sitting on his brother's back, waving goodbye to his father. His mother stood beside them, a knowing but sad smile on her face. It had not been the first time that Fergussen had watched his father strap on the armor of a paladin of Mithaniel Marr and answer the call of the crusade.<br>
<br>
He recalled asking if his father would be back in time for his brother's wedding. She had smiled and stroked his hair and sang softly to him in the elven tongue. The song was soothing and reassuring. His father had not returned for the wedding, but it was a beautiful ceremony. Neighbors for miles had come to view the ceremony and wish the happy couple well.<br>
<br>
All had not gone well though. That was the night that the gnolls had attacked. The bright lights of his dream quickly turned into flames and blood. 43 dead...43 INNOCENTS slaughtered by the damned gnolls! He had hid in fear, watching all those he loved being killed. Powerless......<br>
<br>
Fergussen awoke from his sleep in a cold sweat that he was used to. He uttered a quick prayer to Tunare, asking that she watch over her family in her kingdom, and praising his elven heritage that allowed him to maintain on a minimum amount of sleep.<br>
<br>
In the back of his mind he could almost touch the thoughts of the missing paladin, Centuri. He concentrated the words &quot;they will come&quot; poured over his mind. Fergussen tried harder, reaching out for his friends mind. Her emotions washed over him, drowning him, breaking the link.<br>
<br>
The ranger gently touched his wrists. He could hear that others were awake. Footsteps that could only belong to the shadowknight Soulshiver could be heard pacing back an forth in the great hall. Others moved slowly in their rooms. Kannushi's near silent prayers played across his ears.<br>
<br>
The great hawk, Swiftstrike sat silently watching his master. Fergussen bekoned him and swiftly wrote a missive to Theofrid. He opened the window and sent the bird on his mission. The ranger then silently strapped on his armor and readied his weapons.<br>
<br>
As he sat at the table in his room, Fergussen quickly wrote two more notes. And then stealthily crept out of the window. He silently slipped the first through Kannushi's window. If anyone could reach Centuri's mind, it would be her twin sister. Fergussen only hoped that the song his mother used to sing to him would bring the same comfort to Centuri as it had to him.<br>
<br>
The second note, he slipped under the door of the great hall. He hoped the others would understand that he had to move now. As Fergussen entered the forest he drew out the costly potion he had looked so hard to find. The bitter liquid sent a brief sensation of pain through his body. The rangers vision blurred and then faded away as his body was magically transported to another location.<br>
<br>
Soulshiver looked out the window to where the ranger had been standing. He then slowly read the note...<br>
<br>
&quot;My friends, you all know I am of a restless nature, as the forest itself is. I must take some action now. I have contacts near to Neriak now and go to meet them. Rest assured that I shall be there when the time comes. My friend, Swiftstrike, shall return to you shortly. Should you have need to contact me, he will know how. Until we share the field of battle and rescue our dear friend...Fergussen&quot;<br>
<br>
...........................................<br>
<br>
Fergussen snuck silently along the tunnels wall, sticking to the shadows as Theofrid had taught him so many years ago. The twisting tunnels and branches were not overly difficult for him to follow. The wind brought the stench of Neriak to him and showed him the right paths to take.<br>
<br>
The dark elves had been expanding these tuneels since he had last been here. Within the next few years, Fergussen suspected that the tunnels which wound other Neriak would reach to all of the lands of Antonica. Already their underground paths traversed under the commonlands and stretched to bloody Kithicor.<br>
<br>
Footsteps resounded down the tunnel ahead of him. Fergussen muttered the spell of camoflage and stepped deeper into the shadows. Two dark elves passed by him. The ranger did not move for a long time afterwards. He understood the risks of moving about these tunnels, but he had to know if they would allow for their entrance into Neriak when the time for the raid came.<br>
<br>
Centuri's emotional state came to him again. Fear, frustration, doubt, submission, a shred of hope which seemed to be quickly fading.....all bound together by hatred. Fergussen began moving up the tunnel again. Well did he understand the power of hate, and the dangers.......... <p><center><img src="http://www.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/84/1899584.jpg"></center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ufergussen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>fergussen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0> at: 7/12/01 2:48:20 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1E1E1E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ukrysaniar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>krysaniaR</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 86<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/12/01 5:53:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclefrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yin and Yang</span><hr size=1>                                                                                        Krysania had long been far away on the continent of kunark helping the brave souls fight the evil frogs in the dungeon they call Sebilis.  I only now heard about the plight that has befallen our  sister Centuri.  I wish to rush back to the halls of  Blood Circle to help with the rescue of our brave sister. I fear I will not make it in time. It is a long and dangerous journey to Neriak from here, I offer up many prayers to Tunare ask which way I should go.<br>
<br>
In the dark of night while begging Tunare to tell me what I should do I am granted a vision,  I see the pain in his eyes and feel the rage of Fergussen, as he makes his way through the evil tunnels of Neriak.  With this vision sent to me  I know I must undertake the dangerous journey into the bowels of Neriak to help heal the pain of Fergussen if he is  to succeed in his mission.  <br>
<br>
I begin the search for Intuity the mighty wizard, I know if anyone can get me there in time he can.  <br>

<br>
The bodies were scattered everywhere. There wasn't any other word to describe it. It was carnage.<br>
<br>
In his rage he had become one with the magic and unleashed such a hellstorm that even the gods took notice of his actions.<br>
<br>
Scattered body parts that would've easily made him gag before were just another part of the scenery. He stood in the middle. He was the source of everything. He was the fury that had made the storm.<br>
<br>
He knew Soulshiver had much honor and would not turn against his own kind even though they had betrayed him to the highest degree.<br>
<br>
But the little magician called Dohpaz Xorbelbeeb was not as honorable, deep inside him he had the heart of a killer.<br>
<br>
He hadn't thought twice about it. He had avenged the death of his blood-brother Soulshiver.<br>
<br>
As the council lay there on the floor motionless, Dohpaz summoned back his elemental that was slaying everything in sight.<br>
<br>
He lifted his arms in the air and in one quick motion brought everything within 15 feet of him ablaze. <br>
<br>
He was the fire that burned, the fire that cleansed, he was the flame of vengeance.<br>
<br>
The council was dead, Neriak would return to anarchy as it was before. Blood Circle would no longer feel the pain that the council inflicted upon them.<br>
<br>
High atop their clouds, the Gods argued what to do with this little gnome that had channeled the power of the God's themselves. They were frightened of him.<br>
<br>
Innorukk stood up and shouted at the others.<br>
<br>
- &quot;It is time that we end his life. He will be a thorn in our side from this day forth until he is dead!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
The mother of all stood and calmly waved her hand.<br>
<br>
- &quot;There is another solution to our problem apart from killing this little one. We could always open a gateway to another world and let him choose wether to stay or go. If he stays you can have your way Innorukk, but it must be his choice, he must decide his fate without us intervening.&quot;<br>
<br>
All of the gods agreed and gathered together to cast the runes to open the portal...<br>
<br>
<br>
Dohpaz felt a magical force in front of him. He had never seen something as complex before and had never thought something like this could be done.<br>
<br>
Before him stood now a window. It wasn't a gate. A gate could only take you across this world. This was a window to another dimension. Having avenged his blood brother, Dohpaz would surely be hunted down by the followers of the council. He did not plan on hiding for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>
As he approached the window, he could hear a faint whisper. A voice filled with soothing melodies and that seemed to smell like honey.<br>
<br>
- &quot;You... have... chosen... wisely.... little one...&quot;<br>
<br>
Dohpaz smiled and stepped through.<br>
<br>
<br>
