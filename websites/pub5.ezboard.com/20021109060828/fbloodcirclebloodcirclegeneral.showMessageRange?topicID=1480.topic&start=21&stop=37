Any nation willing to harbor some one like this is also aiding this person.  That means they are also the enemy and should be removed.<br>
<br>
Vipes, I suggest you be more careful in reasoning out how to deal with radicals.  They will not stop til we are dead, worshipping Allha and under their government or they are all dead.<br>

I chose their deaths.<br>

The Taliban continues to swear he could not have done it, they took his communication equipment away but he still makes sattelite calls.<br>
<br>
If there are any innocent people in that nation they may be hurt, but unlike those cowards that will not be our goal.  We will target and destroy the military, government and terrorist points of power and anything that stands in our way.  Note that these sick individuals will give their pregnant wives and 6 year olds guns and have them shoot at our people.  Tell me how many innocent people are in Afghanistan now? <p><br>

That it happened to our Noble country raises passions within me that are not unlike those that ignite at the thought of protecting my own family.  However, to suggest the we reciprocate with the same promise of death and destruction upon like innocents, is silly.  Our government, while not perfect, has gained the backing of NATO and the backing of those country's thought to harbor the criminals, that are in need to be brought to justice.  There will come a time that for a government's &quot;good-will&quot; that such terrorists groups will be &quot;offered&quot; to slack the vengance under which the whole of America is currently suffering.  The day is fast approaching that those that feel that they live under the pretense that they are untouchable or invisible, will find themselves without a place to rest their weary heads... and I earnestly pray on that day, eternal rest would come for them...quickly...in the form of a bullet.<br>

&quot;Nuke 'em all&quot;......That would be satisfying, wouldn't it?  I think so too.  Unfortunantly, it won't work.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, while I agree whole-heartedly with these sentiments, I want to share a little information with you.  I want you to think about it.  I hope it scares the shit out of you the way it does me...<br>
<br>
(I got this from a histoic website.)<br>
The United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. On August 6, 1945, a B-29 bomber--the Enola Gay--released a 9,700-pound uranium bomb, nicknamed Little Boy, over the city of Hiroshima in southern Japan. Hiroshima was an important military and communications center with a population of 300,000. It was also the only primary target city not thought to have American prisoners. Little Boy detonated 1,900 feet above the city, killing 70,000 people and wounding another 70,000. The bomb devastated everything within five square miles. President Truman warned Japan that if it didn't surrender, the United States would attack other targets with equally devastating results. <br>
<br>
The Japanese did not surrender, and the United States continued conventional bombing raids on Japanese cities. On August 9, another B-29 bomber--Bock's Car--headed to bomb Kokura Arsenal; however, the pilot switched to his secondary target, Nagasaki, because of the weather over Kokura. Nagasaki was the home of a Mitsubishi torpedo manufacturing plant. Bock's Car dropped a 10,000-pound plutonium bomb, nicknamed Fat Man, over the slopes of Nagasaki. Fat Man killed 40,000, injured 60,000, and destroyed three square miles of the city. Japan surrendered on August 14, 1945. <br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
One 2 kiloton bomb and one 2.5 kiloton bomb...together they killed over 110,000 people and injured another 130,000.  Most of whom died later of the radiation poisoning.  The region at ground zero in those two cities is still UNINHABITABLE after FIFTY YEARS. <br>
<br>
Now, the nuclear weapons we have today are rated in the GIGATON range, not kiloton.  If a 2 Kilo bomb destroyed 5 square miles, imagine what a 100 GIGAton bomb would destroy....<br>
Not a city, an entire country.  One bomb.<br>
<br>
How long would that area be poisoned by radiation?<br>
50 years? 100?  1000?  more?<br>
It would be in the plants, the air, the soil, the water...<br>
...the surviviors.  (yes, there would be survivors.)<br>
<br>
The radiation would also spread across the globe over the wind currents and through the water supplies.  Now we're talking about poisoning the whole world we live in.  This would effect OUR children as well.<br>
<br>
Ok, that's a few of the obvious PHYSICAL reprecussions of America dropping a bomb in the middle east.<br>
How about the Political ones?<br>
<br>
The THOUGHT of retalitory strikes by conventional means is making people in the area nervous.  What would happen if they thought we would drop atomics?  What would happen if we did?<br>
<br>
Enemies would say &quot;screw it.  The world's over now, I'm gonna nuke &lt;insert country name here&gt;.  If we're gonna live in a nuclear wasteland, so are they.&quot;<br>
<br>
So, we have little nations like Pakistan lobbing their missles around too.  Oh, and did I mention that their guidance systems aren't as good as ours?  Hmmm. most of their missles will probably miss the targets....pissing off other people in the process...<br>
Oh my, sounds like WWIII.<br>
<br>
And what would the neighbor's think? <br>
Does anyone think our allies would REMAIN our allies if we started throwing bombs and artillery around?  They'd be shocked at the very least.  (Their oil comes from the same source ours does.  They'd probably be pretty upset if we turned the area into a nuclear wasteland.) Probably destroy relations with a lot of countries we're economically dependant on.  (yes folks, America still imports far more than we export and oil is the least of those things.)<br>
And there's always the fact that the terrorist organizations have people all over the world.  We STILL wouldn't have ended the threat.<br>
<br>
Now, this is what I've been thinking about for the last couple days, as I've listened to people blowing off steam, listened to the radio and the television. <br>
 <br>
This is what I'm going to do:<br>
<br>
1)  I am going to put my faith in the leaders of my country.  They have far more facts and experience than I do.  I will trust them to make the best decisions possible under the circumstances.  That's what I elected them for.  (I hope they find a way to get the bastages.) Diplomatic and Political pressures are much harder to see at work than military ones, I will wait to see what rewards they reap.<br>
<br>
2)  I will turn my sights to doing what I can to help the rescue and recovery efforts of those in New York and Washington DC.  Even if all I can do is donate a bit of blood and send up prayers.<br>
<br>
3)  I will show the world, by my example, that no act of terrorism, no matter how extreme, will reduce my pride in my country and the freedom that we stand for.  I will not run, I will not hide, I will not be goaded into a rash act of premature retribution.<br>
<br>
There. I have spoken my piece.  <br>
Peace be with you all, friends.  Let us make our world a BETTER place, not destroy it.<br>
<br>
/lowers her head in a moment of silence for those who have already lost loved ones to this tragedy.<br>

When the proof comes out that points to Osama...then we shall see if Afghanistan tells us where he is or grabs him for us. At this moment there is no reason to take him because even the US says the evidence is not pointing directly to him YET. If and when it does if they continue to protect him I do hope we declare war and I hope they pay for this dearly.<br>
<br>
Now please read this carefully Eryl...if ANYONE tries to stop us after it is out that Osama bin Laden without a doubt did this...they should die whether they are 50 or 6. Protecting him when it is obvious he did it makes them no more innocent they the hijackers.<br>
<br>
Now back to the nuke them all deal. Do you seriously think as an intelligent human being that dropping nuclear weapons...nukes at this day in age...will stop terrorism? If you think so you are just being naive. The people who do not die from this will continue the terrorism to pay the US back as revenge.<br>
<br>
Anyone who stands in our way after we go after Osama I will consider an enemy of the US and no longer innocent. <br>

The first to launch a nuclear warhead will start something which we all don't want. A nuclear war.<br>
<br>
It only takes one well placed nuke to eliminate thousands of lives. But if by any chance they miss one of their nuclear missiles I'm pretty sure in the following seconds they'll launch that nuke.<br>
<br>
I'm not a military expert, but I clearly remember that the only defense we have against a nuclear warhead coming our way is that we will now it's coming but we can't do a damn thing to stop it.<br>
<br>
And what if they already have backpack nukes as we call it and are only waiting for the americans to launch a nuke to make em go off?<br>
<br>
I don't think they will risk to launch a nuke, it will only cause a chain reaction.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure though they will go at war very soon and infiltrate Afghanistan and start military stirkes against them.<br>
<br>
Nukes are there from the race in the cold war, they meant power and were a symbol of strenght. I hope they are still viewed as such and they won't be used anytime soon.<br>
<br>
Do you guys know the repercussions of a nuclear blast? The ecosystem is totally destroyed. The terrain cannot be used for years and years. The radiation can be carried in the water or by the wind which causes all sorts of other crap. Not to mention all the people that die in the blast.<br>

Remember it's a discussion we all have our opinions. I like to argue with Eryl because he doesn't hold back on what he believes is right to him. You make your own choice and let him makes his own <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Comparing hydrogen bombs to atomics is silly, apples and oranges.  Hydrogen bomds are much cleaner and more powerful.  They will not leave the levels of radiation that Hiroshima and Nagesaki left.  <br>
<br>
Don't lie to yourself, we may use nukes there.  Any of you hear about the special weapon they made?  It is a bunker buster, designed to burrow 1 mile undergroundbefore detonating.  It has a small hydrogen bomb warhead. <p><br>

The hydrogen bomb still uses a nuclear bomb as it's trigger. It needs it to reach the critical temps necessary for the bomb to explode. The fusion (which is also radioactive, btw) also creates a bigger explosion, spreading the fallout material in a larger pattern. Therefore, there are still the nuclear fallout and the &quot;hot zone&quot; effects that are associated with normal nuclear missiles. In short - we still need to deal with the aftermath and it won't be pretty.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; INCOMING GENERAL RANT NOT AIMED AT ANYONE &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Consider this -<br>
<br>
We are not the only nation that is nuclear capable. Also, there are other weapons of mass destruction, i.e. biological and chemical. To think that we as a nation can retaliate by launching nuclear warheads at a region without consequence is somewhat childish. We could anger our allies and our enemies would see this as the opportunity to strike with impunity. In short, the possibility of WWIII is quite feasible. Am I saying that the perpetrators should go unpunished? No. Rather, I am saying that there has to be a clear headed way of bringing the criminals to justice.<br>
<br>
To those who have suffered personally...my thoughts, prayers, and support go out to you.<br>
<br>
To the rest - we should be united in our time of grief, not just as Americans, but as human beings.<br>
<br>
And no, I am not a hippy protestor &quot;saying no more nukes.&quot; I've signed the dotted line and served my country. Now, I am just a concerned citizen looking at my children and wondering if I had the right to bring them into this crazy world. For their sake, I hope it gets better.<br>
<br>

Peace<br>

We currently have alot of support and we would ask before doing this.  Also you ignore the new bunker smasher weapon I spoke of.  That may very likely be used soon in the war on terrorism. <p><br>

 I have much sorrow for all the people and their familys that went through this . Just hoping the US Goverment would stop sitting around dwelling on what happened than and get on to stopping this . <br>
  They know who started this they know where the leader is so why are we still sitting here we have enough trained people in the US to get this thing started ,they have ruined our lands now my beliefs are IT PAST TIME TO RUIN THEIRS !!!<br>
Many of our Fellow Americans are dead because some asshole thinks we owe them something . They dont want to go to warr because they dont want to hurt the innocent in ththe other country not thinking that all they wanted from of was a massive body count and they got what they wanted . They want WARR i say we give them warr .They wanted a Body Count we could do that to .They wanted to distroy our Friends and Families so why arnt we willing to return the favor? Whitch i guess that why im not in Office ,cause If i was my only comment would be ......<br>

----WELCOME TO WORLD WARR lll------<br>

However, it only fits the first strike policy if it is to be used to eliminate another country's or enemy's first strike capability.  We will not use first strike to kill anything but nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction.<br>
<br>
Stop being retarded, we will never use nukes against terrorists.  We will never use nukes against a country that we can wipe off the map with conventional weapons either.  These terrorists come from countries that we can destroy in a matter of days.<br>
<br>
Stop worrying about the damned nukes no matter what type they are, or if they are clean or dirty nukes (btw, there is no such thing as a clean nuke).  <br>
<br>
The U.S. will conduct air strikes and numerous covert ops to destroy the terrorist camps and infrastructure.  We will even conduct cyber war to freeze the terrorists assets where possible.  Expect SEALS and Special Forces.  We will use smart munitions and technology that is not openly known to the public.  <br>
<br>
If anyone uses nukes it will be terrrorists in the form of &quot;backpack bombs&quot; as Dohpaz states.  And just a wake up call, those types of threats have been around for a number of years.  It will do no good to worry about terrorists using nukes at our level.<br>
<br>
My thoughts: remained pissed off and support the government and the fighting men and women that will be conducting operations to destroy these terrorists.<br>

I only answered your question on H-Bombs.<br>
<br>
I also agree with Gerik. <br>
<br>
There is no such thing as a clean nuke. You use one, the effects last for quite a bit after the fact. Radiation is radiation. The main reason to use a H-Bomb was that the A-Bomb was only capable of so much damage. The H-Bombs are the nukes that are capable of doing damage in the megatons. And a 1 megaton bomb can radiate - if I remember correctly - roughly 80 miles in 24 hours...<br>
<br>
Expect covert action - yes there will be mobilization of forces into the area - that's for show. Most of the important stuff will happen behind closed doors and out of the media's eyes.<br>
<br>
Keep the faith, and believe in this country.<br>
