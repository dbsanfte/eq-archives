It has been a long time since I put pen to paper.<br>
<br>
Today I woke with a heavy heart, things weighing heavy on my mind.   I had made decisions the day before in haste and with emotion.  This had left me sleepless through the night, as Doubts now filled my mind and other paths of action flowed in and out.<br>
<br>
The sun shown brightly, but a cool breeze held the promise of a storm approaching.   I  looked out from my efforts to break camp, tired, I just wanted to sleep.  I knew that was useless now.  I needed distraction from my troubles and woes.  <br>
<br>
Keal Guards where on the patrol and those that would kill them were waiting in ambush.  I was not ready to join a group to help fight the evil that lay beyond the pass into that Giant City.  I would have been no use, as my mind would not be on the fight.  I headed out into the beauty of the Wakening Lands.  This place was like no other.  Lush forest, mythical creatures and danger. Mother Tunare so close here had blessed all with her powers.  <br>
<br>
 I thought of taking my thoughts to Mother Tunare in Plane of Growth, but then thought again no these are of personal nature and Mother Tunare was more than busy with the news of a plague taking over the Old World. They seemed to  me frivolous by comparison.<br>
<br>
I stood at the base of the Mountains that thrust up in shear rock faces and looked out towards the South West.  There a Dark Elf Necro and his pet took up a fight against the animated Sentinel Suits of Armor.  His battles successful, one after another the suits fell in a heap on the ground. <br>
<br>
 The cry of a Mist Panther close by gave me a start and I realized that I would be in danger if I did not give this land the attention it demanded of me.<br>
<br>
It was then that my guild sister called,  Olympia, a young Paladin in the BDF.  Like all paladins, human, dwarf or high elf, she held strong to their code and fought endlessly for the Just and Right in Honor of Her God.<br>
<br>
She and others from the guild offered their support and comfort.  I took solace in her words of kindness and offered back my own.  Jaered too, a ranger, also took time to comfort me.  Much needed to be said and yet no words could express the pain in my head or heart.  I thanked them for being concerned and expressed my gratitude that they where there for me.  But I needed to handle my decisions and the aftermath that was in the process of unfolding.  Tears fell again, as the reality of what I had done hit me in a wave of unbelievable pain. I held back moans of sorrow as I bit my lip.  I could do nothing more but wait and see. <br>
<br>
It was then that Buzaglo called to me. &quot;Katy you okay?&quot;  Buzaglo Dwarven Paladin of Kaladim. He was a long time friend and one that I gave my Love to as a brother. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, but I need to find some distraction from my thoughts today&quot; I replied.  &quot;You doing anything, that involves fun?&quot;<br>
<br>
He asked &quot;Anything I can help with? <br>
&quot;Yes, take me on an adventure to make me laugh and forget my woes for now&quot; I replied.<br>
<br>
He  said &quot;Come we are about go in and kill a GOD! If nothing else we will die but you will not be bored.&quot;  <br>
<br>
I took stock of what provisions I had, decided that I was prepared and ported to Feerrott. I followed the familiar path that lead to the gates of Fear.  Others stood before the glowing orange eclectic gate that separated our world from that of the God of Fear, Cazic Thule.<br>
<br>
There he was smile beaming across his face eyes bright and clear although shorter than I by a head, he possessed the stature of a very powerful warrior.  I always felt I looked up to him rather than at him.   He put his arms around me and hugged me close then looked at me  with concerned, but did not ask what my troubles were.  He knew me well and that I would share them when I was ready.   <br>
<br>
&quot;Here talk with the Raid Leader Sharidann.&quot; He instructed <br>
I gave a shy tell to Sharidann and asked if there might be room for a Druid of the 53rd leaf on this raid.<br>
<br>
Sharidann laughed &quot;Yes.  For you, yes. If I don't make room Buz will yell at me!&quot;<br>
<br>
I laughed back and said lighthearted &quot;I wouldn't worry to much about Buz's bark, but that flaming sword does carry with it a mighty sting&quot;.  Thankful that I would be fit in somehow I offered my gratitude with humble thanks.<br>
<br>
I was invited into a group, brief instructions were given, buffs were cast  to protect from the first wave of battle we would meet beyond the gate.  <br>
<br>
 The Plan was that we were going to train as many mobs as we could and hold them in a confined area and the casters were to use Area effect spells while the Melee class were to battle up close and personal.   The Idea sounded like it had merit, but it took several attempts to accomplish a true successful coordination of everyone there.  Once all troops worked as a team this went smoothly and let us clear the Mobs quickly.  <br>
<br>
When all of the creatures were dead it was time for the reason we had come,  Kill Cazie Thule, God of Fear, himself. Commanders gave orders troop leaders gathered and followed them. Just when we where about to make our stand..<br>
<br>
 The God from beyond this world took us, and gave that ever frustrating message &quot;YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED&quot;.  Try as I might the forces that be would not let me return.  Nervously I paced making attempt after attempt to return to the side of those left to hold the ground that we worked so hard to win all morning.<br>
<br>
Then a break and I was back, Buzaglo shouting to me &quot;Come we are going to start our charge. Hurry we need you, now!&quot;  Off like an arrow following his instructions I was soon standing and in group with all those that had made it back from the eitherworld.<br>
<br>
<br>
Cazie Thule called out to his servants in anger.  None would respond as we had killed them all.  He came crashing through the trees uprooting several with a wave of his massive arms.  &quot;You will die foolish mortals, I am a GOD&quot;.  <br>
<br>
This is when I saw him, a massive brown hell creature that only evil could give birth to. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.home.net/abunting/CTRAID/EQCT4.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Fear froze me for only a second. Then the Order to Charge was given.<br>
<br>
  First to meet the raging Cazie Thud  were those of the Melee classes.  Without fear they fought, the sounds of clashing swords, cries of pain and anger rose from both them and Cazie.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.home.net/abunting/CTRAID/EQCT5.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
  Then those casters of us who could, cast huge damage spells in hopes that they would deal death blows to the God that Shook the ground beneath us.  The healers  giving aid to those who needed it as quickly as possible.  <br>
<br>
Time and again we all were thrown into the air like rag dolls as Cazie fought back with force that ripped the ground wide open.  Back we would rush into the fray there was no time for fear now and no time for grief for those who had fallen.. and many more would before the battle was done.<br>
<br>
Cries now were heard above the clashes and explosions.  &quot;Heal me or  Help me I must fight on.&quot; No braver souls had I ever encountered than on this day.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.home.net/abunting/CTRAID/EQCT6.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
My mana spent on spells that were ineffective, I charged in with no thought of giving up. I cast heals on those I could and  stood and fought at the side of others who did the same.<br>
<br>
One last spell from Cazie Thud threw me half way across the zone.  Limping and then shaking off the pain I rushed back to the battle. There he stood enraged and bleeding badly but he would not give in to death without taking more with him.  I ran in close knowing that I was risking my life, taking blows  and giving them in return.  A last rumble and curse left Cazie's lips as he fell, the ground shook the air quivered for just a second. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.home.net/abunting/CTRAID/EQCT3.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
I looked down at his body and waited expecting him to get back up.  Then shouts of victory rose from those of us who were left standing.  Hugging and laughing, tired and covered in blood and earth we stood, it was done. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.home.net/abunting/CTRAID/EQCT2.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> <br>
<br>
We gathered those who had died bravely, respectfully we called to them to return to us and gave praise to the Gods of Right and Good that those who fought so valiantly would  be blessed with a resurrection into our world, One by one they returned.<br>
<br>
My reward for this victory was to be lead to the gate that would take one back to the world of Norrath.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.home.net/abunting/CTRAID/EQCT1.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
The day spent in battle gave me no time to spend in my own soup of troubles and made them seem trivial by all measure.  I promised that I would think upon it tomorrow but now tired I would find sleep at last.  <p><img border=0 src=http://www.goodnet.com/~saxon/full-logo.gif><img border=0 src=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/tags/katreena.gif><img border=0 src=http://personal.sdf.bellsouth.net/sdf/w/e/webslide/BDF/candle07.gif width=100 height=100><BR><IMG SRC=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/academy/3b-baker.gif><IMG SRC=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/academy/3b-blacksmith.gif><IMG SRC=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/academy/3b-brewer.gif><IMG SRC=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/academy/3a-fishing.gif><IMG SRC=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/academy/3b-tailor.gif><IMG SRC=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/academy/3b-lang.gif>
