The basics of the e-mail were as follows-<br>
<br>
A friend of his was dating an Afghanistani prior to 9/11.  Just before the incident (let's be honest, an &quot;incident&quot; is a derailed train, this was mass murder) he dissappeared leaving an empty apartment and a note to her.  The note said to avoid air travel on 9/11/2001 and to avoid shopping malls on Halloween.  On 9/11 she turned the letter in to the FBI.<br>
<br>
I am not one to give in to terror... I've not changed my air travel schedule one minute, and I don't succumb to bullies, threats, weapons, lies or anthrax scares easily, but I do believe in sharing real information if there is validity.  I have never met any of you in person... well, I don't think I have... but I care about the real people behind your this computer screen.  You take care out there, but don't let terrorism reign you in.  Right after 9/11, I took a vacation with about 500 friends and we celebrated life and liberty for all Americans and life the world over.  I'm not one to ignore life, either, but think about this...<br>
<br>
Try to stop breathing forever.  Go ahead.  If you can make it 4 minutes without breathing, you're a pearl diver!  Are you worried about breathing?  No.  It's not in your controle.  If you aren't worried about breathing, why worry about other things that are also not in your control.  Be aware of the world around us, but don't fear it.  Live life.  Love life.<br>
<br>
I love you all, and I'll see you soon.<br>
<br>

<br>
Amy Harmon<br>
New York Times News Service<br>
Oct. 11, 2001 17:00:00<br>
<br>
At a time when Americans are plagued by a generalized fear of an invisible enemy, the latest urban legend from the Internet warns specifically of a terrorist attack on a mall on Halloween.<br>
<br>
The e-mail message, which began circulating last Friday, describes a story the author heard from a &quot;friend of a friend&quot; whose Afghan boyfriend stood her up on a date on Sept. 6. On Sept. 10, the e-mail message says, she received a letter begging her not to get on any commercial airlines the next day and - drumroll - not to go to any malls on Halloween. After the attacks on Sept. 11, the message said, she immediately turned the letter over to the FBI.<br>
<br>
By this afternoon, the e-mail message had been forwarded by so many friends of friends of friends that the FBI was deluged by calls from people who had received it. An FBI spokesperson said that the attack described in the e-mail message was &quot;not a credible threat,&quot; and that the agency had not received a letter like the one described in the message.<br>
<br>
The e-mail message is just the most recent in a series of rumors that have arisen after the terrorist attacks that historians of urban legends say are a common cultural response to large-scale disasters. Several Web sites, most notably www.snopes2.com, have compiled lists describing and debunking the post-attack legends. Typically, they serve as a psychological shield against the unknown, and cause no real harm themselves.<br>
<br>
&quot;A lot of legends come out of situations where there is an intense and poorly defined feeling of stress,&quot; said Bill Ellis, an associate professor of American Studies at Pennsylvania State University, who received the &quot;mall attack&quot; e-mail message Thursday. &quot;The legend puts a face on it and provides a strategy that the common person can use to help ward it off.&quot;<br>
<br>
But the speed and global reach of the Internet may have made the current crop of urban legends more difficult to weed out. Natural skepticism seems to wilt in the face of the sheer number of people who seem to almost simultaneously get word of something like the Halloween e-mail message.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is scary,&quot; wrote one of the many people whose e-mail addresses appeared in a long list of forwarded messages. &quot;Please be careful and keep this in mind. Not sure if it is real, but it comes from a friend who is a pretty reputable source.&quot;<br>
Also overwhelmed by phone calls Thursday was Volt Information Services, in Orange, Calif., the employer of the woman who appears to have originally sent out the e-mail message. Norma Kraus, a spokeswoman at the firm, declined to make the woman, Laura Katsis, available for comment. But she did note that Katsis had violated the firm's e-mail policy by sending the non work-related message to 15 friends.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's amazing, isn't it, how fast things can circulate with this medium,&quot; Kraus said. &quot;I think we're learning something about that.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I just brushed it aside but I didn't delete it. Here is what it said when I got it.....<br>
<br>
&gt;I recieved this from a friend who's son is in the marines. Better safe than sorry. This has been passed along so I copied and pasted. It was long. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hi All - <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;I think you all know that I don't send out hoaxes and don't do the <br>
&gt;reactionary thing and send out anything that crosses my path. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;This one, however, is a friend of a friend and I've given it enough <br>
&gt;credibility in my mind that I'm writing it up and sending it out to all of <br>
&gt;you. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;My friend's friend was dating a guy from Afghanistan up until a month ago. <br>
&gt;She had a date with him around 9/6 and was stood up. She was understandably <br>
&gt;upset and went to his home to find it completely emptied. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;On 9/10, she received a letter from her boyfriend explaining that he wished <br>
&gt;he could tell her why he had left and that he was sorry it had to <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;be like that. The part worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her not to get on <br>
&gt;any commercial airlines on 9/11 and to not to go any malls on Halloween. As <br>
&gt;soon as everything happened on the 11th, she called the FBI and has since <br>
&gt;turned over the letter. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;This is not an email that I've received and decided to pass on. This came <br>
&gt;from a phone conversation with a long-time friend of mine last night. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;I may be wrong, and I hope I am. However, with one of his warnings being <br>
&gt;correct and devastating, I'm not willing to take the chance on the <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;second and wanted to make sure that people I cared about had the same <br>
&gt;information that I did. <br>
&gt; <br>

Surrounded by parking lots and parking structures.<br>
<br>
Halloween - Derived from All Hallow's Eve (I think).  Celebrated as a secular (despite pagan origins) holiday (though not a government holiday).  Focus is on scary things and the unnatural.  Mostly a children's holdiay, as on the night of Halloween (always October 31), children put on costumes and go door to door receiving candy (always with the phrase 'Trick or Treat').  Adults often throw costume parties and also have the responsibility of giving out candy and chaperoning their kids.  Third biggest party day in the US (behind New Year's and the Super Bowl). <p><hr width=20%>
