The wind blew gently across the rough edges of the rocky peaks in Lavastorm Moutains blowing everything in its path that weighted less then a piece of paper.  Bekkaha&quot;s hair blew with the wind too showing the curls that she usually hide by pulling her hair back.  She watched it blow uncontrolably like it was alive and dancing with the wind. The silky brown strands had goten considerably longer then she had though.  Her hair was almost all the way down her backside.  For a woman of her age she really had no complaints about her looks.  She could still turn heads when she got dressed up enough.  Smiling softly and chuckling to herself she caught a glimpse of a person out in the distance.  A strong handsome man standing not more then a few yards in front of her.  The steam from the lave pits was making it hard for her to see his figure well enough to identify him.  She stood peering more to see if she could catch a familar feature.  The hair on the back of her head stood up from what she saw.  The shadow figure that stood off to the distance was that of her dead daughter Brianaha.  All of her breath that she had been holding seemed to drift out slowly.  Her heart racing so fast she feared she may have a heart attack.  She closed her eyes and started to cry uncontrollably.  &quot;Why do u torment me!  Please leave me be!&quot; She droped to her knees she felt all different kinds of emotions at once.  Looking back where the shadow had been she noticed it was gone.  Beside where it had been laid a red rose.  She moved forward to pick it up thinking to herself where on earth can u get a rose in this horrible place?<br>
A hand touched her shoulder just then scaring the daylights out of her.  Chantrelle had droped someone off at the druid ring and seen her in the distance.  Chantrelle and Bekkaha were close almost like sisters.  Knowing what Bekkaha was going through with the lose of her husband and children the only thing she knew to do was by there to let her cry on her shoulder.<br>
After a few moments of silence Chantrelle decided it was okay to talk to her now. &quot;Would you like to go somewhere?  To get you out of this depressing place?&quot;<br>
&quot;I guess that would be best wouldnt it&quot;, Bekkaha said sighing slowly.<br>
Chantrelle started to cast a spell that sparked beautiful colors around them. Before Bekkaha could even ask where they were going they where in Great Divide in velious.  <br>
&quot;Someone is here waiting for you&quot;, Chantrelle said smiling at Bekkaha. &quot; You take care my dear sister.  Ill see u later after i get out of this raid we are doing in Umbral.  It is of up most importance that we kill the ice guy in the cave today&quot;.  <br>
Then Chantrelle disappeared as if she was never standing there.  Bekkaha giggled at the thought of how Chantrelle is always a pop in and out of any situation really quickly.  She is the fastest druid she has ever known when it comes to zipping around the world.  Now she started to wonder who was waiting for her.  Looking around she seen no one that she knew.  Ubane ran around the corner in a flash to run up and hug her tightly.<br>
&quot;Hello Beautiful Bekkaha, long time since i have seen you&quot;, he said looking at her up and down.  The had been life long friends but she is hardly ever on the same contient as him.  She travels around alot more then he could keep up with.<br>
&quot;What brings you here to the Great Divide?  Are you the one that was waiting for me?&quot;<br>
&quot;Well i would love to be the one waiting for you dear but im afraid i was sent to get you since i was closer to you then he was&quot;.<br>
&quot;Then who was?&quot; she said looking confused.<br>
&quot;Guess you will see follow me my dear sister&quot;, then he took off running faster then she had seen him run in awhile.  She could tell he had been practicing.  He had turned out to be such a great warrior.  Even though he was quite little in size he could take the hardest of giants out easily.<br>
He took her up many icy hills and cliffs that she didnt recognize at all.  Then in the distance she seen an old fort that should have been burnt down by now since it was barely holding together.  It was the giant fort she could tell by the smell around it of death.  <br>
&quot;Becareful we dont want to get a giant on us right now. We are far from a safe spot&quot;, he said almost whispering.  The whispering didnt help though because as soon as the turned the corner he had a giant trying to cut his head off swinging a sword around.<br>
Bekkaha laughed at how stupid the giant was.  She slowly began casting a spell that summoned her water elemental.  The water elemental appeared before her and she pointed at the giant and smirked.<br>
&quot;Attacking an Frost Giant master&quot;, it said then started punching and slashing at the giant.<br>
Ubane walked away to watch the elemental defeat the giant.  As soon as he started back up another one started swinging at him.  Bekkaha laughed again this time at the other giant for being so stupid to attack her.  Fire griped around her hands as she start to cast Scars of Sigil.  The fire bolt struck the giant off guard which sent him running for his life.  <br>
After a few moments the giants were dead.  Ubane hurried off with Bekkaha close to his heels.  The ran up the other side of the fort where there was a group of people siting there fighting every giant that came along that path.  They turned and looked at Bekkaha and Ubane, then one of them ran toward them.  <br>
&quot;Kegolas!&quot;, she shouted as if she hadnt seen him in years even thought it had only been a few weeks.<br>
Kegolas ran down scooping Bekkaha into his arms holding her tightly as if he didnt want to let her go.  <br>
&quot;Hello my love.  I heard about your crying lets go to Thurg and lay down a bit.&quot;<br>
&quot;okay sounds nice i havent slept much for a few days now&quot;.<br>
Thurg was just a few  hill tops from the giant fort so walking there wasnt much of a workout so they walked slowly talking about what she had seen.  She was so tired that when the got to the inn's room that Kegolas had rented, she laid on the bed and immediately fell asleep.  Kegolas layed beside her holding her tightly still.  For the first time in weeks she got to sleep in peace without the shadow or bad dreams to awaken her. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cac3ab><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ukorafsoulmender.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Koraf Soulmender</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>BDF Guild Leader (Interim)</span><br>  Posts: 1591<br> <font color=#c54400>(6/4/02 9:35:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbronzedragonfellowship75394stories.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=106.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://216.92.155.24/images/KorafBeer.jpg height=150 width=111></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: just a little more of my stories</span><hr size=1> Nice Bekkaha. <br>
