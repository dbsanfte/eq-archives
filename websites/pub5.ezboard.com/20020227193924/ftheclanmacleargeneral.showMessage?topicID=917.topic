The dew sparkling on a spiders web.  The vast ocean spanning on for miles and miles in all directions.  A gentle spring shower falling like mist in a forest.  These are the images that a person in deep meditation sees.  I had just stopped along a path running through one of the many forests of the land, and finding myself with no provisions, I was forced to summon them out of the air.  After my meal of ethereal bread, I began to meditate, so as to be ready for the perils that might await me down the path.  <br>
<br>
I had been in Odus for a while, practicing my meditation with the magi that dwelled there.  While I was listening to a teacher, a snow falcon landed on my bracer.  It had a note around it's talon and it was sealed with the MacLear crest.  The letter told of a gathering of fellows to discuss an urgent matter, we were all needed in the commons.  The note said nothing of the matter at hand, and it had a very dire tone to it.  Intrigued and a little frightened, I sent the falcon back with a note telling of my coming, and set out for the commons.<br>
<br>
This particular mediation, I was floating in a vast ocean that smelled faintly like lilacs after a rainstorm.  You other magic users will know that when in meditation, the outside world all but vanishes from the mind.  It was so with me on this morning.  While the waves carried me across the ocean, and the aroma of flowers filled my nose, I was vaguely aware of some sort of noise.  It was loud enough to penetrate my meditation, but being in a forest, I thought little of it.  After all, a crow might have easily called out over my head.  A gently breeze was coming up in the ocean of my mind, and the waves were rolling playfully along the surface, as if they were kittens chasing mice.  As I watched a wave come towards me and begin to curl about itself, something big and hard kicked me in the arse!<br>
<br>
This jolt broke my meditation and I sprang to my feet, prepared to do battle with whatever beast or man had struck me!  As I was rising from my meditative position, I began to wave my hands in the gesture of my most powerful offensive spell, Wrath.  As my spell was in it's casting, I began to spin around so as to face my assailant and be sure that my spell hit it's mark.  My heel dug a circle in the ground as I spun on it and my attacker was coming into view from the corner of my eye.  Whatever it was, it was very big and looked very strong.  I was afraid that this might be my last spell.  The spell was climaxing when I finally turned around to face the brute!  The air around us was crackling with divine power, and I found myself gazing into the center of the MacLear crest that was etched into a large metal breastplate.  This took me quite by surprise, and I fell backwards as my spell sprung into life and flew so near the head of Hammar that the wind it made blew his hair  The spell continued on it's course and flew into the trees above our heads.  The branches it toughed didn't burn or freeze, as with spells of the mage class, they turned into dust as the power of a God grazed by them.<br>
<br>
I lay on the ground on my back breathing heavily.  Looking up to meet Hammar's gaze, I found him more shaken than I was, probably because of the near miss of my spell.  The two of us were stunned for a moment as we pondered our strange meeting.  Coming out of the dazes that we both were in, Hammar helped me to my feet and we greeted each other in the fashion of MacLear brothers.  I began talking first, I asked him what had brought him to this obscure place so far from his homeland.  His face turned grim at my question and I saw that his gaze went from me to something off to my right side.<br>
<br>
When I looked to my right to see what he was looking at, my gaze was met with that of a young dark elf.  The elf was a little ways away from us, and he was stuck to a tree by an arrow that had pierced him in the shoulder.  In his eyes was a look that I had never seen before.  I had seen people angry, I had seen people enraged, but I had never seen anyone with such a look of absolute hatred in their eyes.  It took me aback I must admit.  Gazing into hate is quite an experience.  The elf was immobilized for the time being, so I took the opportunity to raise an eyebrow at Hammar.  He had a look that gave away that he knew something of this.<br>
<br>
Hammar related the story of Eyre's encounter with the dark elves a few days before.  How he had been stalked by a small band of them, and believed himself lost.  By the grace of the gods, he had been saved by the timely arrival of the Clan MacLear and the elves were defeated in a most expedient fashion.  Only two of the elves survived to be questioned, because that is not the barbarian way.  It was by the wisdom of Engel that the elves had not been slaughtered with the rest.  These two were tied and stripped of their armors and weaponry.  They were given two options, they could talk and die swiftly, or they could die very slowly indeed.  The elves were resistant at first, but once the pain began, they swiftly let slip their purpose.<br>
<br>
They were but a few among a great host of dark elves that had been charged with a simple task.  They had been given a list of names and told to find the people on the list and kill them.  These elves had chosen Eyre for their target.  The elves did not have a copy of the list, but they remembered a few of the other names on it.  All the names he knew of were names of MacLear.  <br>
<br>
The order was shortly given that MacLear separate into groups and seek out the few members that were not in attendance that day.  It was known that I was in Odus, and known that I was on my way to the meeting, as I had sent the falcon back with my note on it.<br>
<br>
Hammar was sent to find me.  After all, Odus is very far away from the dark elf lands, it was unlikely that I should befall any harm, but just to be safe, one warrior was sent for me.  Now he had found me, and had saved my life from this devilish elf.  He found me sitting in meditation with the dark elf sneaking up on me from my side.  The distance was too great to cover in so short a time, so an arrow was knocked and loosed at the elf.  It struck him in his shoulder and stuck him to a nearby oak.<br>
<br>
Taking all this in, I walked up to the elf.  As I approached, he drew yet another dagger and acted as if to stab me if I drew near.  With a smirk on my face, I sat down again.  I rose a few seconds later and began casting another spell.  As the elf held the dagger, the flesh of his hand began to hiss and fizzle.  He let a howl and dropped this dagger as well.  Coming closer to him, I said, &quot;Your race has priests as well, slime, tell me, do you know anything of their power?&quot;  <br>
<br>
His eyes were filled with hatred as he hissed, &quot;Innoruk shall feast on your blood dwarf!&quot;<br>
<br>
With a sigh, I made his other hand sizzle as the first had, and repeated my question.<br>
Sucking air, the dark skinned one gritted his teeth against the pain and looked strait into my eyes.  &quot;I know a little of their ways, but I use one of them.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good, then you should know that the spell I have used thus far is the weakest in my arsenal, I pray for your sake you do not make me use another, stronger one.  Now, tell me who you are and what you are doing here!&quot;<br>
<br>
The elf answered again with an insult.  I had no recourse but to sigh, sit down, and cast another spell, this one more powerful.  The air around the elf's wounded shoulder got very dry and crackled.  Suddenly, the elf winced as a divine Force struck him.  I had aimed my spell at his already wounded shoulder, so as to get the maximum effect out of it.  Welts formed where the power went into him, and the force and magnitude of it caused his shoulder-blade and collar bones to break.  This poor elf knew nothing of the art of meditation, so he was left to deal with the intense pain of his broken bones.  At last he understood what true pain even a priestly dwarf like myself could inflict, and began to talk.  <br>
<br>
He never did tell his name, but he told me he was sent to kill me, and that he would not be the last.<br>
<br>
&quot;You elves have always hated dwarves and our God.  But tell me why you came after me and not some other, more powerful cleric.&quot;<br>
<br>
Darting a stare so filled with scorn and hatred so as it might have been the very fires of hell in his eyes, he hissed in a low voice, &quot;Dwarf, it is not your race or god that compels me to kill you, though all these are reason enough.  The cause of your death by our hands will be for none of these reasons.  You will die for the crest you wear upon your shield!&quot;<br>
<br>
Glancing downward, I looked at my shield, and saw nothing there but the MacLear crest imprinted therein.  At the same instant, understanding and rage filled my eyes.  He was sent to kill me for no other reason than that I was MacLear.  There were doubtless others of our rank that were in danger as well, and maybe they would not be as lucky as I had been.  Maybe several of my friends were already dead.  And this elf was the cause of it all.  This elf was waging a holy war against my family, against my brethren, and that would not stand.  <br>
<br>
Anger filled me as I contemplated all the things his evil race had done to us in the past.  They had battled the first barbarians and ancestors of my friends.  They had killed my uncle and father with their magics of hatred.  And now they were trying to kill every last remnant of MacLear.  Was it not enough that they had caused so much suffering in the past?  Now they sought to cause even more pain and death to us, to MacLear.  This was more than even my dwarvish heart could stand.  The memories of the past came rushing back to me as all the old wounds I carried with me were opened again by the words of this Dark Elf.  Tears filled my eyes as rage filled my heart.  The elves had gone too far this time.  They would not stop until they had taken away everything that I held dear to me heart.  That notion, I could not stand.  I fell to me knees and began to weep.  And that was when it happened.<br>
<br>
Just as the waves in my meditation had washed over me, so too did this wave.  But this was not an earthly wave of water, nor a wave of air.  This wave was of something that transcended the mortal earth.  This wave was Godly in origins.  My sorrow vanished as courage filled my soul.  I rose to my feet and lifted my eyes, that were red and swollen from the tears I had shed.  My gaze then fixed upon the elf.  My face was as stone now and my teeth were gritted in my maw.  I stared directly into his eyes, those eyes that were so embittered with hatred, and I watched as the hatred in them gave way to a total and absolute fear.<br>
<br>
My own eyes began to shine with an eerie white glow.  Sparks began to fly around me as my hands began to move on their own accord.  They began to weave a spell that I myself did not know how to cast.  The air all around the clearing started to shimmer and crackle with power.  The wind rose up and whipped leaves all around the three of us.  As the spell continued it's almost endless casting, a voice arose from the very earth itself.  The voice was so deep as to make High Hold Pass seem nothing but a scratch.  &quot;Child of darkness and follower of hatred, through my servant, you will feel the ultimate retribution for your sins.&quot;  The ground began to shake as small rocks were lifted into the air and flung around like so many blades of grass in a gale.  All at once, a brilliant red flash appeared and began to dance between my hands.  It grew in size until it arched from my waving hands into the chest of the elf.  <br>
<br>
In the deafening roar of the blast, I could not hear what it was the elf screamed at me as he died.  there was a brilliant light, as though the sun were placed in the forest with us, and as it cleared, the elf was gone.  The white glow faded from my eyes as I fell again to my knees, and I regained control of my hands just in time to keep myself from falling on my face.  The spell that Brell had cast through my body was so powerful that my body was exhausted and all my magical power had been used.  The tree and the arrow remained untouched.  On the ground was a pile of salt and ashes, and the ringmail armor of the elf.  His mantle was still stuck to the tree by the arrow.  <br>
<br>
I got to my feet and motioned Hammar to come out from behind the tree he had sought refuge behind.  I began gathering the ashes and armors in a small box.  I would send this morbid package back to Neriak as a warning to the elves.  I noticed a strange emblem on the mantle as I plucked it from the arrow.  <br>
<br>
The scene depicted in the emblem was that of a castle, and a sky of fire.  Hovering directly over the castle, was a moon, black as the darkest ebony had ever been.  This had been a disciple of Darkmoon, now he was ashes in a small box I held in my hand.<br>
<br>
My hands began to shake as the anger within me grew once again.  This elf would not be the last, nor was he a vagabond.  There would be many others like him, lurking in the shadows and awaiting a time to kill us all.  The Darkmoon had begun a war.  They wanted to see us destroyed once and for all, and I was not going to let that happen.  As long as I had blood in my veins, MacLear would carry on.<br>
<br>
Thinking all this, I looked again at the emblem, and my anger subsided.  A smile broke on my face and I even let a chuckle.  I called to Hammar so as to show him the source of my amusement.  The arrow that had pierced the ringmail mantle had also pierced the emblem, right through the moon of black.  Now it was in twain, and blood seeped from it.  I took this to be a sign.  MacLear would be victorious…<br>

An EzBoard forum can only have 20 pages of posts.  As you can imagine, we've lost over a year's worth of history because of this.  We can create an &quot;archive&quot; forum to move posts that we wish to keep due to their value, or bump certain things up once in a while.  Today I've begun going through the Great Hall to delete unnecessary posts.  For example, once I've returned from a business trip, who is going to go back to read it? <p><a href="//home.attbi.com/~geist22/lanadena2.jpg"><center>
