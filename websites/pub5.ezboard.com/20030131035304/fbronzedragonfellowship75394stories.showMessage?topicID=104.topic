<br>
The run from Lavastorm was a test of the high elf's stamina, even without the weight of her armor.  She could have sought magical transport, but she wasn't pressed for time and there were many to see and help on the way.  The trek had shown her the beauty of lands where she had once made her stand against the forces of evil, now rushing memories back into her mind.  Eyes of a bright spring green flashed in the last light of the setting sun as she left the fields and hills of warmer lands behind.  She was off to a more pressing destination.<br>
<br>
The earth grew increasingly rigid beneath her feet as ronium solarettes dragged her down while protecting her from the sharp stones of the crag she trudged out of.  Four gnoll guards rushed forward, barking and growling curses in their gutteral tongue.  Instict more than strategy flashed her Argent Defender through one creature, then another.  With less effort than it took to climb the hill, all four gaurds were slain.<br>
<br>
&quot;It has been a long time!&quot; she thought to herself.<br>
<br>
Her breath returned, Elewin wove her hair into an intricate braid and sighed as she drew her helm on once again.  Steam dampened her cheeks and she could feel the cold of the metal close to her skin.  Snow began to drift into the ravines of Everfrost, where she drove into the snow toward the northern passage.<br>
<br>
Gnolls, goblins and orcs all fled at her approach now, but she remembered the days when they hunted her, rather than the other way around.  A rumbling shook the ground as a mammoth lumbered by.  Those creatures, on the other hand, seemed to worry not one wit about her presence in their lands.  But she had to march on; she was getting close, and then could camp for the night.<br>
<br>
There were a few stout hearted halflings who had joined forces with a powerful barbain shaman near the gates that were her destination; Permafrost Keep.  She couldn't help but smile at the four entered battle with a thundering ice giant; the halfings the same size in relation to their ally as he was to their quarry.<br>
<br>
With the huge gaurd distracted, she ran easily into the keep.  Within, she knew Lady Vox awaited.<br>
<br>
In the gloomy halls of ice she felt a stillness unlike she had ever experienced.  Something was wrong.<br>
<br>
&quot;Izzn!&quot; she called.  &quot;Cybril?&quot;<br>
<br>
There was no answer.  She was alone in Permafrost; there wasn't a single sign of the raiding party!  Disgruntled, Elewin began to make preparations to camp.  An ice goblin diviner scowled at her, but dared not move.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't see myself getting any rest with you watching over me,&quot; she said flatly.<br>
<br>
The goblin screamed as a burst of divine flame erupted from its body.  It began to weave the power of the goblin dark arts, but Elewin's spell stunned it, and it fouled the workings of the cantrip.  A shock of force smashed it backward, leaving it wheezing.  Before the goblin could recover, Elewin was on top of it, her sword ending the fight quickly enough.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, where was I?&quot;<br>
<br>
She had long ago started packing an extra blanket, but this time she slept atop it, as the floor was solid ice.  She felt sleep finally beginning to take hold of her when a sound stirred in the back of her mind.<br>
<br>
&quot;How long has it been, Ele?&quot;<br>
<br>
She sat up and looked about... or did she?  No, she was certain she still slept.  It was the cold.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm so sorry,&quot; the voice continued.  &quot;I know I've been away long, but I had no power to resist it this time.&quot;<br>
<br>
She stood, in the blackness of her dream, and her eyes darted around; her hair streaming about her.  She tried to call out, but her throat clenched to quell each word.<br>
<br>
&quot;By Tunare, you've become more beautiful.  What a fool I've been... such a fool....&quot;<br>
<br>
Her eyes caught a glint in the darkness and her heart stopped, mid-beat.  Her head swam.  The figure before her could not be real.  A dream!  It was all a dream and she knew it... she must awake!<br>
<br>
&quot;You're so much stronger than I remember... the things you must have seen!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Kelrith....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And here you stand, a Cavalier of the Code, ready to face that devil dragon, Vox!  Yes, you are so much stronger than I am... but then, you always were the stronger of heart.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're a dream!  Why have you come into my dreams!?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;This is the only way I can speak to you for now... a friend of mine is guiding my thoughts to you.&quot;  The vision smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Guiding...?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm alive, Elewin.  I'm on Velious.  Don't ask me how I got here, I don't think I know.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Kelrith....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I really messed things up, didn't I?&quot;  He smiled sadly and walked up to the stunned paladin.  &quot;A blackness took me, but the hate is gone, Ele... my heart is at peace again, as when I first joined the clergy!&quot;  His eyes feasted on hers, never straying from them; blue to green.  &quot;Am I too late?  Are we still...?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Still married?&quot;  She gasped.  &quot;You were dead!  My most trusted friends informed me that it was the end, Kelrith!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They were right,&quot; he said defensively.  &quot;Ele, I played no trick on you!  It was not my option to...&quot; his eyes brimmed with tears.  &quot;You've moved on, haven't you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Elewin laughed and cried all at once.<br>
<br>
&quot;I erected your memorial with the Guild, Kelrith.&quot;  Her eyes hardened.  &quot;You should see it... it's quite lovely.&quot;  She looked into the darkness as if to see the words she had etched into the marble.  &quot;Kelrith T'Arruk; Cleric of Light, Child of Felwithe, Husband.&quot;  Kelrith flinched but said nothing.  Elewin's eyes flashed fire.  &quot;I wanted to add, 'father' to the monument... but you never gave me a child!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I've done everything wrong, Ele, but I won't take the blame for that!&quot;  Elewin placed her fists on her hips and awaited the explaination for that one.  &quot;We both followed our holy quests, Ele.  Even when I was about the same lands as you, we seldom met for but a moment... it takes two, Ele.&quot;  He looked at her sadly.  &quot;Ele, I just thought we would have more time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I admit, so did I.&quot;  She laughed softly, sadly.  &quot;You would think I wouldn't have to try very hard.  Maybe I never will understand men.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can only say how sorry I am,&quot; he sighed.  &quot;But you didn't answer my question, Ele.&quot;  She looked into his eyes again.  &quot;Have you... I mean... since I was gone... dead to you...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not remarried,&quot; she said softly.  To her shock, Kelrith actually began to weep.  &quot;I have accepted the name of my parents once again, I am now Elewin Bowheart, but I have sworn a vow to never remarry.&quot;  He peered at her as if in a new light.  &quot;I am dedicated to Tunare, love.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But if I was never dead, are we still together?&quot;<br>
<br>
Elewin stood silently for a long moment.  Kelrith dared not look away, his eyes filled with hope and dread.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are alive, and my vow lives with you,&quot; she said quietly.  &quot;But I beg you, give me some time.  You're back from the dead....&quot;  She walked up to the cleric and eyed him sharply.  &quot;And you're treading on thin ice, love.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can live with that.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's hope so,&quot; she smiled wryly.<br>
<br>
Kelrith laughed and gently embraced her.  As the world faded to the blackness of her dream, there was a warmth in her heart that overcame the ice of Permafrost.<br>
<br>
They had a second chance at life.<br>
<br>
Elewin prayed that Tunare would guide Kelrith home. <p> <img border="0" src="http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/Files/tags/full-logo.gif" width="200" height="100">
