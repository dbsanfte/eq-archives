<br>
Beginnings are hard for me… I am not sure how I came into this world whether sent from a God, disregarded like trash or dropped on whim from a tree like a seed, one thing is certain; I fell… and fell… and… fell! I know this much only from the countless times my parents have told it to me. My beloved parents whom, despite having four children of their own found it possible to foster me in their care regardless the hunger they already had to endure. Their hardships were many as migrant Halfling merchants. Forced out of their home under the Vale by a shifty land deal, a thief now enjoys the warmth and light of the fireplace Samlemirth, my father, built with his bare hands. But despite the arthritic pain in his joints this old man enjoys telling the story of my coming to the family while jumping around the fire light in an animated, almost choreographed display.<br>
“Oye! Den derre we was.” Papa begins the story, standing; hands raised above the fire ‘setting the scene’ as it were. Talking over the flames in his cockney accent, us kids huddled in a blanket leaning against a wheel of our wagon surrounded and covered with my siblings we stared at him in complete awe. Mother was sitting on his side of the fire also peering up at him as if he was 100 feet tall. “Comin round the ways wake ounder Kelethin’s financials. (winks) Your ole pa gots all de short cuts ounder his ole cap, he does.” We giggle as mom makes a silly face and shakes her head behind his back. “Any matters, derre we was makin' our ways towards the gnome mountains and da port so we could gets ourselves back to the mainlands. Your ole pa sure as hell made a killing that night! (winks)<br>
         Mom interrupts him, “Dwarves dear, Dwarves live there”. Mom was another character almost as odd as I see my dad. They are complete opposites dad is a down to earth, silly, ex-professional bar room fighter, and mom was an educated Drewish home maker brought up in the suburbs of the Vale. She was always quick to point out a mistake.<br>
        “Ach, woman are you sure?”<br>
        “I am positive. Dwarves live in the Butcher Block Mountains and that is where we were headed.” mom enunciating each syllable through her nasal voice. She looks at us and says in a much less formal and lower tone, “Your father, such a kibitzer. But at least he’s got chutzpah!”<br>
        “Bah, quit your interruptions and quiet yerself! Any matters, we was making our ways when yer ole pa heard a faint sceamin. I pulled up on the reins and stopped Epona, her hooves quiet now I drew me sword and stood me self up high on my seat, thinking we was in store for an ATTACK!” he always made us jump when he said that part. “I looked off into the night, then at your mother, she shook her head but heard it too as it got louder and louder. I couldn’t place it yet but it was getting closer and louder when all of a sudden I sees your mother lookin up with a gasp, I look up me self and BAM! I get knocked cold and wake to see this lil young elf girl who nearly knocked me blinkin block off!”<br>
        “After you fell on him I jumped over to the two of you and healed you, Emy. I laid you down in the blankets in the cart, oh what a doll. By this time the twins were wide awake and wailing their heads off. And Rei hovered over my shoulder looking at you, as timid as a squirrel. Oh how small you were then… I’m getting all verkelmpt now.” <br>
        This night we were camped outside the city of Freeport, my father was trying to sell militia helms to the Freeport guard he obtained on our last trip to Kaladim. My mother and I sold the usual trinkets we made while on the road, hand woven cloths and bags, and various things we carved. I did allot of the bargaining with people, father showed me how and we found that I was rather good at it, I had an unusually loud voice and could attract plenty of attention from the passers by. Also being taller then my parent’s people found it much easier to deal with me, my father jokes “Ya makes business wit no back aches!” But now was the time for sleep after a long day’s work the campfire that held light to my father’s storytelling now glowing embers we all curl up together in the tent. I stare up past the window and the stars put me at ease enough to fall asleep.<br>
        The next day was business as usual; my mother and I setup the cart across from a rather large smelly fellow selling his old fashioned pickles. Boomba was nice, and very talkative, all day he went on about his pickles and all the ways they could be prepared and served etc. He was telling us how to make barbecued pickles when he stopped pointed and said, “You cart, looky!” We turned and saw a small person running away with the basket with the twins in it!<br>
        My mother screamed, “My babies! My babies! Stop thief!” I pushed past the onlookers and ran after him with all my strength. He turned corners quickly as I ran after him grabbing at walls to help me around the turns. He was making his way to the docks when I finally caught up enough to grab at his coat. I wrapped my fingers at his collar and pulled it back at me, he dropped the basket as he tried to regain his balance. With his coat off I could plainly see he was a dirty gnome! He spun around at me and quickly drew his blade and came at me. I dodged his first slash and threw his coat over his head, I fell beside the basket that held the twins and clutched it to me checking to see if they were okay. As I knelt holding the basket the gnome threw down his coat and turned to me again his blade in hand. As he neared I looked down at the crying twins my heart started to sink, I looked up to see the gnome about to strike me down and I screamed…<br>
“NOOOOOO!”<br>
This is when something amazing happened. My word boomed loud and with such intensity that the gnome was knocked on his back, his knife fell from his hand as he thud to the wood of the dock, finding a separation in the planking the knife fell into the water below. As it echoed, my voice rattled windows of the Port Authority building. The gnome looked up with such confusion and quickly got up and ran into the darkness of an alleyway and vanished. The twins stopped their crying and just looked at me. I looked up, utterly perplexed and turned to see an audience of my mother, sister and other people that followed just staring at me. &quot;What am I?&quot; I whispered to myself as I collapsed.<br>
