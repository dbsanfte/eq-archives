Where once frolicked a young elf maiden, secreting dreams of grandeur, there now stood a woman, tall and lean, her soft flesh encased within an enchanted metal skin.  Hair like fire tumbled down her back and snapped in a gust of wind as she pulled her golden helm, a catlike visage, from her head.  There was only the sound of her heavy mail armor as her skirts held against the low howls of the storm outside.<br>
<br>
    Elewin stood near the dark, pulsing sphere that held closed the doorway to the dreaded realm of Sebilis.  She was battered but stronger for it.  Absently she daubed at her eyebrow.  The bleeding had almost stopped.  She sighed and shook a few more dead insects from her cloak; a gift from the froglok shaman that had crashed the party.  They had recovered, but had decided to leave the labyrinthine corridors behind them for the day.  She had decided to stay on a short while more.<br>
<br>
     She could tell that the moon was out fully tonight, though she could not see it.  Shifting her weight from her wounded leg, she frowned at the rivulets of elvin blood staining the metal of her Deepwater boot.  There was a mild shock of pain as she recanted the spell in her mind and the last of her many lacerations faded away.<br>
<br>
     “Would have been useful to have a cleric, eh?” asked an unfamiliar voice.<br>
<br>
     “Yes,” she answered, as if to herself.  “Very.”<br>
<br>
     “Never around when you really need them, are they?” came a second query.<br>
<br>
     Elewin didn’t respond.  Her mind drifted with her heart, seeking though the ether any sign of he who possessed her soul.  She closed her eyes and sought further still.  Perhaps he had traveled to Luclin.  She had heard that such a distance could even hinder an elf’s talent to find her mate.  The void that returned almost staggered her backwards.  No.  He wasn’t there.<br>
<br>
     “You married a cleric, didn’t you?”  The voice seemed without body; she couldn’t even tell if it was in her own head.  She had no desire to look, merely to answer absently.<br>
<br>
     “Yes,” the paladin said plainly.  “A handsome cleric.  High born.”  A slight, sad smile came to her lips.  “Father and mother would have been proud.”<br>
<br>
     “Would they be proud that you withdrew from his name, ‘Bowheart’?” the voice mocked.  “I understand there is no honor in that.”  The voice seemed to walk around here, but she did not lift her eyes.  “Honor… such a strange concept.  The life of the paladin, yes?”<br>
<br>
     “Honor comprises all that I am,” she replied softly.  “All that I have.”<br>
<br>
     “And that you gave away with the name you accepted, if I understand the custom.”  The voice was mocking, hurtful, spiteful… but it did not seem to attack her.  It merely was.<br>
<br>
     “There is no dishonor in error,” Elewin explained to the voice.  “I believed him dead… I was told he was dead, and by my closest of friends.  There is no dishonor in accepting the name of one’s father as the last of his line.”<br>
<br>
     “Interesting.”  Elewin’s eyes wandered to the stone circle around the pulsing, black sphere.  She wanted to sit and rest, but she kept to her feet.  She did not know why.  “Is there dishonor in seeking another?”  The question sounded legitimate; almost concerned.<br>
<br>
     “If one’s mate passes on, it is not expected that she live her life alone forever.  In fact,” she smiled lightly again, “it is expected for a high elf lady to take a husband.”<br>
<br>
     “Yes, and to settle down and have children, and care for the home.”  The voice mocked once again.  “You are not one to settle so, are you, paladin?”<br>
<br>
     “I’ve thought about it.  A baby would be wonderful.”  Elewin absently rocked her arms, almost dropping her bloodied Wurmslayer.  “I often wish I could wear pretty dresses like other elves.  The scion in North Karana has such a beautiful gown.”  She should sit, but found herself walking slowly around the dais.  It would be so welcome to finally sleep after such a hard battle.  How had it ended, again?<br>
<br>
     “Is there dishonor if your heart belongs to another?”<br>
<br>
     “I cannot halt the beating of my heart,” Elewin said softly.  “It is the actions one takes that bring dishonor… the heart and mind may be the root, but a weed can be dredged from the garden before a flower falls as its prey.”<br>
<br>
     “Very poetic,” the voice seemed to sneer.  “But if your mate no longer lives, should you not seek another?  One that already has your heart?  One whose heart you already possess?”<br>
<br>
     “Kelrith may live,” she said in absent defiance.  So tired.  She should stop talking and get some sleep.<br>
<br>
     “Kelrith may not,” intoned the voice.<br>
<br>
     “I gave his name away when he lived still,” she admonished.  “I’ll not give away his mate in same.”  She glanced down at her boot where the blood trickled from the etched plates and onto the cold stone floor.  Hadn’t she healed that wound?  She cast the spell again, and the cut sealed.<br>
<br>
     “What if he has died and there is none to inform you?  Will you wait forever?”<br>
<br>
     Elewin slid her hand from her gauntlet and pressed it to her brow.  She withdrew it, confused.  That cut had been healed as well.  She healed the brow first, didn’t she?<br>
<br>
     “Will you wait forever?”<br>
<br>
     “It is honorable to take no other…”<br>
<br>
     “Will you wait forever?”<br>
<br>
     Elewin looked for the voice for the first time.  Her eyes widened in horror and she took a staggering step back, tripping on the stone dais and falling back into the black sphere.  The vision of a scarlet haired high elf paladin was obscured from her sight even as her own voice echoed in her mind.<br>
<br>
<br>
     “Will you wait forever?”<br>
<br>
<br>
     In a rush of agony, like fire in her lungs, she gasped, lurching from the floor of the old dungeon under the weary eyes of the old dwarf cleric.<br>
<br>
     “Get her healed,” he barked, “get her up!”<br>
<br>
     “Move it, soldier!” a huge barbarian roared as he hauled the paladin to her feet, the loosed her arm to slash a froglok knight to the ground.<br>
<br>
     “Ele!” shouted a half-elf ranger, her powerful bow drawn.  “We thought we’d lost you, girl!”<br>
<br>
     The pile of frogloks now numbered nine, and the party, bloody and endowed with powers from nature and ether, was finishing the last of them.  Elewin looked around, trying to get her bearings, then began swinging away with Wurmslayer, cleaving into another amphibian’s flesh.  There was a rush of cold and a terrible crash as shards of ice erupted through the air and chopped the last froglok to its death.  For a moment, the party stopped to congratulate each other and celebrate their lives.<br>
<br>
     “Ele,” the ranger said quitely.  “You were talking to yourself before Thoden revived you.”<br>
<br>
     “Yeah,” a human rogue said with a smirk.  “Who’s Krowyn?”<br>
<br>
     All eyes on her, Elewin Bowheart tried to recall the dream she must have had as her life’s blood ran from her body.<br>
<br>
     “It’s… complicated,” she said.<br>
<br>
      Even the massive barbarian’s eyes saddened as he looked upon the elf, now seeming so small and frail.  The uncomfortable silence ended abruptly as a froglok wizard and his knight guard rounded the corner.<br>
<br>
<br>
     Back to the fight.<br>
<br>
