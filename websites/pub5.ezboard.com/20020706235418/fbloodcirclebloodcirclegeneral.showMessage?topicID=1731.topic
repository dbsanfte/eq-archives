<br>
Just wanted to clear up any harsh feelings I left with any of you tonight during the raid.  I felt kinda crappy afterward.  I wasn't trying to create conflict, but I truly did feel like an insignificance at the raid tonight.   <br>
<br>
Like I said, it's not that I didn't appreciate you being there, not that I wanted to level like mad, and not that I wanted phat lewtz.  But gee, to set a rule like the person who gets the kill, gets the loot for his/her group, and then send lvl 50 + in to fight with little lvl 30-35's just doesn't seem fair.  I wouldn't have even said anything, had I not seen someone's name who was 50 + 9 times out of 10 after the kill.  And it's not even so much the loot.  It's the thrill of contributing, and showing off my brute high elf pally strength, and getting a hit or even a kill in every now and again.  <br>
<br>
I wasn't trying to be a snot, tonight, just had enough.  The post is just me wanting you to hear a little about where i was coming from, and wanting to apologize for having the little outburst.  <br>
<br>
Thanks for listening.... <br>

<br>
What was meant by the loot thing was that whatever group got the kill, one person from that group loot the kill to get rid of the body.  We had one ML and the bodies were stacking up too fast and it was getting hard to target.<br>
<br>
Most of the loot from tonight will trickle into the raid fund over the next couple days.<br>
I have 58pp I looted, and Kiari has the pp from our ML... that will go to the raid fund.<br>
The Diamondine Earring and the couple nice weapons that dropped will go to the guild bank for folks to use.<br>
<br>
<br>
You'll often find that in raids you'll have just one group getting the majority of the kills (called a KS group).  Sometimes done on purpose so someone can get xp, but often done becuase that's the group with the MA and the puller and the mega-nuker.  All put in same group so they can watch each other and communicate faster. They just happen to get most of the kills.<br>
<br>
<br>
We were absolutly delighted to have you with us tonight.  We don't get to see you nearly often enough. <br>
Come back again soon so we can work on your Soulfire quest.<br>

And it's a great idea to put the MA and other mains in a group... but Raun was MA, and he was getting very few kills too, were all the 50 + in his group?

I mean really, it's not like someone of a lower lvl than 45 or 50 couldn't have handled that, most of the mobs were blue to me at 35.  And we all would have had more fun that way too... challenges are more fun, always!  And hey, if we would have gotten into real trouble, all you big, experienced players would be there to help us out.  I thought that was the purpose of the mid-level raid.<br>

I dunno. Just like to feel like I'm doing some damage.  That's all it amounts to.  Thanks for accepting the apology.<br>

First of all, I wasn't on the raid last night (had a track meet) but I do have a bit to contribute regarding &quot;mid-lvl&quot; raids. Some of what I'm thinking comes from the Tower of Frozen Shadow bonanza a few nights ago. I could be wrong, but I think some of the frustration I felt during that &quot;raid&quot; parellels what Glia felt last night. Let me explain...<br>
<br>
I introduced the idea of going into the Tower of Frozen Shadow as mostly an experience/maybe a little nice loot exercise for a group of 35-40ish or two. I'd heard that the place was &quot;very good loot/very good experience&quot; so it sounded like a good place for me to make a substantial chink in the hell level while also having a good time. What I was envisioning was 2 mid-lvl experience groups moving through the tower with a few higher level &quot;guides&quot; buffing, healing, occasionally helping if we bight off more than we can chew, and showing us through the pathing of the tower. These guides were to come only out of generosity and if they had nothing to do. <br>
<br>
What that turned into, for better or for worse (from my point of view, for worse) was basically a full-fledged pick-up raid consisting of a.) the 35-40ish crowd, comprising probably 1/3-1/2 of the raid who were there (atleast I assume) for the same type of experience/loot that I was thinking of in the first place... we would have been content to only go up a few floors as long as experience was good and b.) the high-lvl, 45+ contingent, the majority, who saw the first few floors not as a potentially great xp oppertunity for the mid-lvls, but as a pain-in-the-ass farm for keys... they were there primarily for loot on the higher floors, keys, and perhaps a shot at tserrina to top off the night. Like I said, for better or for worse.<br>
<br>
Basically, that night changed from a slightly inflated xp group (as was my original idea) into a kind of chaotic training raid/key farming/occasional rolls on Studen't Homework event that yielded almost no experience (i got 2 blue bubs in 4 hours of fighting) and no loot to the 35-40ish crowd (the ones who this was setup for in the first place). The higher levels were NOT there as guides; they didn't seem to care one bit whether the lowbie groups got exp/loot, and were there for their own purposes (most highlevel casters rolled on the student's homework). Ultimately, the lowbie groups were just tagging along (atleast I was). Again, this would have been fine if it was what was planned, but it was supposed to be something completely different. <br>
<br>
Alright, I'm done complaining... i hope no one takes offense to the TOFS rant; I am not accusing anyone of anything, I just don't think we were all on the same page. I didn't want to screw up the &quot;raid&quot; in progress by complaining, so I decided just wait a little while until I could formulate my thoughts and let it all out. Now, I DO have a couple of ideas on how to help with some of the annoyance/frustration mid-levels may feel on some of these raids.<br>
<br>
First of all, a level range needs to be set for the &quot;main&quot; raiding group. Anyone higher than this becomes one of the guides. The level range should be set with primarily xp in mind. Then as the raid gets going, the mid-level groups should do ALL the fighting (after all it is a mid-level raid). Someone from the guide group can pull if that makes sense (because they know the zone better or whatever) but they should not actually engage their pulls, just let the raiding group take it off. The guide group should basically just buff, heal, debuff, maybe help kill if the mob is well below 50% health, and as an insurance net in case something goes wrong. <br>
<br>
Also, remember that the guides come out of generosity only. All loot from the raid should go to the players who are actually raiding. <br>
<br>
Now, it is fine if there is some boss mob or something that the higher-level players want to hit (in the case of TOFS this would be the top couple floors). That would be a good incentive for the guides to come and help out. But, remember, it is still primarily a mid-level raid and until it gets to the point of this higher level encounter, the people above the raid group parameters need to stay as strictly guides. <br>
<br>
I think if we pay more attention to some of these things, it will make the lower-level raids more fun for everyone. Higher levels that come need to realize that what they are basically doing is a raid-style powerlevel. If this is not the kind of thing that you want, I would suggest that you don't come along. If you want to come to one of these to help out and have a good time then maybe get a shot at a boss mob or something, then bravo to you. <br>
<br>
Hopefully we can make future mid-level raids more successful and fun for everyone present. Thanks for reading.<br>

Gila, My group was getting a fair portion of the kills, b/c Das, Nairi and Art were kicking lots of booty and taking names.  But personally, I had a hard time trying find the pulls that came it.  That came from extra people pulling, or getting agroed from repops, me being short (still drinking milk!) excetra.  Basicly, last night we had a VERY entheustic response for the raid (Which we DID appreciate from everyone!  Don't get me Wrong everyone!!!  /mad hugs go out to everyone there!).  Personally, I was hoping for 2 groups of the 20-40 range, and one group of the 40+.  But we had so many wonderful people show up, and we thought the ballroom would have fit everyone we invisiond...<br>
<br>
But aside from our overpopulation in the ballroom (wouldn't want to have to clean up after our mess), I thought the raid went ok considering it was Toli's first as Raid leader.  Like cent said, 7 groups in MM is trouble waiting to happen.  But I think we got out of there in pretty good shape.  Special thanks for Kannushi coming out to rez our fallen friends last night too.<br>
<br>
We will make some changes for future raids so that they flow much more smoothly.  So thank you again everyone that showed up!  Our future raids will (we hope!) work more like clock work.  Just give us a little time to learn. =)<br>
<br>

Ok, Demun, I will take this oppertunity now to say thanks. Perhaps it is a bit late, but I truly do appreciate you helping out. You did a great job pulling and were everyone else there of the same mindset of you, I doubt it would have been so confused.<br>
<br>
Like I said, I am not accusing anyone and I am kind of seeing that higher levels can get swept away in the chaos of one of these midlevel raids just as easily as the midlevels. There is no need to be defensive.<br>
<br>
However, I would like to point out that it was not the &quot;lower and mid lvl's [that] just didnt seem to want to sit still&quot; Most of the extra pulls were brought by a couple of higher levels that were impatient with the speed at which we were getting keys and getting through the floors. Specifically, I remember a 50+ bard (name escapes me) who was a very nice person but didn't seem awfully interested in midlevels getting xp. <br>
<br>
Now, let me clarify the whole key farming thing and &quot;coming for their own purposes&quot; thing... I was not trying to imply that anyone was using the raid as a tool for getting loot or for getting keys that they would use as a later date. What I was saying was that on the lower floors, the raid mentality seemed to be to get keys as fast as possible and move up to higher level floors (ultimately Tserrina) without thought to xp for the midlevels. What I had in mind when we started was to milk each floor all possible xp before moving up then milking the next floor; I think it is obvious that the raid wasn't approached in this manner.  I am not trying to say that anyone came out of greed or anything like that, only that the goals of many there were different than the original goals of the raid. <br>
<br>
In response to the raiders listening to my so-called &quot;guides&quot;, I realize that this is ALWAYS a problem on most raids. People listening to those in charge is an obviously integral part of any raid situation. Not so obvious, however, is how the leaders (guides) are themselves implemented. I thought that this perhaps needed some light shed on it and is why I chose to look at the other night from this angle instead of a more traditional listen-to-the-leaders type of thing. <br>
<br>
I understand that this may sound selfish, but it really was set up FOR the mid-levels so I think they have a right to be a bit selfish. <br>
<br>
Thanks again Demun, I would reiterate that I mean no offense to anyone personally. <br>

I think however, that part of the reason others started pulling at MM was that they were bored.  I for one hit each mob once, if that, and then it was dead.  coulda been a combination of having a lot of people there and having high level folks there, but also as I said before, these mobs could have been pulled by someone of a lower level, or even after having been pulled, been taunted off by those who were there for the MID LEVEL RAID.  We had a guy in our group who went in the other room and fought by himself, because he wasn't getting any nukes in.  And my point in even saying anything is, What's the fun in sitting there doing nothing or as Silvethon put it, tagging along?<br>
<br>
I guess it's pointless to re-hash, because it is over, and I don't even expect an apology, because I'm sure there will be a reason or excuse for anything I might bring up.  But for the next time we have a mid-level raid... please, try to keep in mind that we mid-level folk are there to have fun, kick some butt, and if possible pick up some exp or loot along the way.. all the same reasons you'd go on any raid.  If the high-level people do it all, what's left for us?<br>

Please do not blame ANYONE other than MYSELF.  I formed the group of 50+'s.  I put Raun in that group.  I chose how the loot was going out.  AND it was ME who invited everyone.  It was all MY fault.  Please, point the fingers at ME.  <br>
<br>
First of all, this is what I wanted.  I needed the criticism from as many people as I could possibly get.  So please, continue your posts along this thread on what went wrong, just please turn your finger where it was meant to go... on me (Don't worry, I can take it ).  I understand where things went wrong, I now understand HOW things went wrong, but more importantly, from this thread, I know how to make things better.  Mid level raids WILL NOT be like this again.  I can assure you of that.  <br>
<br>
Secondly, I would like to thank everyone from showing up, but most importantly, I would like to thank the mid level charachters who showed up and was able to give me there feed-back on how to improve the raids for THEM.  Since they are my Primary concern.  I was made an officer to plan mid level events, and therefore it is the mid levels who I care most for.  ( Not saying the rest of ya don't matter at all to me, everyone knows how much I love everyone.)<br>

And, of course, last.  I would like to assure everyone again that I have learned alot from this expereince.  It was a night that many of you wasted on me, which I understand can be difficult, but it was not a night wasted by me.  The next mid level raid (which will be scheduled at the beginning of January, unless enough people tell me that they want to try again somewhere else this month) will be an oppurtunity for Expereince, phat lewt, and a good time had by all.  These next raids which I will lead will be capped at 2 OR 3 GROUPS only.  If we have a large raid like this again, you can be certain that I will hold it in a larger zone, where we will be able to split the raid.<br>
<br>
Humbled by this experience, and gratefull for that oppurtunity:<br>

The reason I posted in the first place was to tell you that I do still respect all of you, and to clear up any harsh feelings I might have left the night of the raid.<br>

If anything, I think this forum shows more family qualities than anything.  Do families agree all the time? NO!  but they sure do talk about their differences and try to get them sorted out.  That's all I'm trying to do.<br>

JK man!!  <br>
No actually I just wanted to point out a couple of the good parts of the raid. First, even though it got a bit crowded its always nice to see that big of a turnout of guildies for our raids. Secondly, there was a few items drop, if only one BC member walks away with more then they showed up with then its not a loss. A big thanks to Kannushi for coming and rezzin all our fallen guildies and friends, and to Centuri for getting ahold of her to get her online...hehe <br>
Great job on doing MA Raun(we just shrink everyone on the next raid for ya bro..hehe) <br>
And to Tolifalcon for setting everything up(bet ya didnt expect that turnout hey)        <br>

 I am sorry if this rubs anyone the wrong way but it is my opinion and its something that i have been haviong a serious problem with for months.<br>

<br>
As this was not only his first raid as a leader, but pretty much his first raid EVER...I'm surprised he didn't just type /q and blame it on his service provider.<br>
<br>
/salute Tolifalcon<br>
He has been tested in the fire and found worthy.<br>
<br>

I am honored to work at your side, Toli.<br>
