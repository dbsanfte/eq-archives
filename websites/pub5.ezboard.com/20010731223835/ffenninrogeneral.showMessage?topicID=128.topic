<br>
I am in the process of creating a new guild on the test server, and am trying something a little different the what I have seen, and been a part of in the past.<br>
<br>
I have been an EQ player since retail release, and have many over 40th level charactors spanning across many servers. Like many of you, we have killed the gods, and dragons alike. The biggest problem I have encounted in my playtime has been politics and Uber Guilds.  So many planes capable guilds out there, and everyone with thier own agenda. This has often led me to many evenings of pointless debate with opposing guilds.  Yes, I have tried on many occasions to work within the politics, but found that was taking the fun away from me, and the game.<br>
<br>
Recently, a very good friend invited me to play on The Test Server with him, and I have since been having a blast.  The people of the test server are among the nicest I have met in any Everquest community, and the zones are all but empty unless there is a server outtage =).  I don't want to take away from this open, friendly community, I want to contribute to it.<br>
<br>
We are forming a guild called Gnomercy, open to all short races.  The philosophy of the guild is one of team advancement.  We are looking for experienced players preferably, but open to players of all skill level.  Just as long as the tanks are willing to /taunt, and everyone knows what the /assist key is for heh..  We will be about team advancement, not personal gain.  There is no room for greed in this guild.  An example of loot distribution is as follows.  2 groups get together, and decide to do lower Guk.  Rule 1: Group Leaders Master Loot at all times.  Distributing coin among their team.  Magic items are held until the end of the evening. At the end of the evening both groups get together and all random on the loots of the night based on need and usability.  ie:  Casters and tanks in both groups, while Group 1 camps the SMR while group 2 camps the Yak.  Say, 3 yaks and 2 SMR's drop all night (I'm an optimist).. Casters and Tanks from Both groups would Random on all itesm based on need at the end of the night.<br>
<br>
Planes, and very rare camps will be seeded based on attendance to guild events.  Every event gets you 50% points added to your role for an uber item until you get it, then your back of the list and taking your chances like everyone else.  Example, We do the PoF a pile of times, and Necro A is there 5 times, while Necro B is here for the 1st time with us.  We Random 1000 for the Robe.. Necro A rolls 350, then adds his seed 50x5 = 250, thus his role is 600. Necro B rolls 750, and everyone /boos, and laughs at Necro A's bad luck. =)<br>
<br>
We will have Master Trades peolpe in the guild, and all items will be sold at cost to the others.  For starters,  we would do what we could to get you on your feet, My Chanter is practicing like mad in Jewel Craft and Tailoring, thus, I would give what I could in Rings etc to get you moving.<br>
<br>
If there is interest, our launch date will be May 1st.. The couple of us that are there are going to try to hit 16th level before then so that we can hold, and help our newcomers to catch us.. With My chanter, I would be dishing Breeze to the casters, and Hasting the tanks, to make your groups more deadly.<br>
<br>
We will be getting together for regular hunts approximatly 3 nights a week, and doing at least one event per week.  Events would range from raiding Najena, to drunken boxing in the freeport arena.<br>
<br>
We are looking for mature players who live on the West Coast, PST - MST..  We are serious about taking our charactors to the top, and doing everything the game has to offer on the Test Server. Thus, we would be looking for players that are serious about a change, and are willing to commit to a new primary charactor.  I recall from my experience that it was more exhillerating to loot my Shiny Brass Shield, then it was for my Carmine Robe hehe, thats the thrill we are after here.  Starting from scratch, and earning our way up.<br>
<br>
We are looking to be as self sufficient as possbile, thus we will be looking for a balance in classes. Right now it's an open book, but when you contact me, please tell me what your interested in playing. A guild of 20 Necro's and 4 Tanks might be deadly, but not very effective later on =).  We are looking for a target of 24 - 30 people<br>
<br>
If your interested, fire me an email at tylaric@home.com (email subject to change when I can find my &amp;*&amp;^% password.), or drop into test and look me up as Gwylldor.<br>
<br>
Thanks for taking the time to read my speal, happy hunting to you all..<br>
<br>
Gwylldor Stormwarden<br>
9th Level Fizzle Master of Test<br>

Even worse Tailor<br>

<br>
Be advised if you don't know. There is no customer support on the test server, and your at the whims of the gods. If you get stuck or screwed, there is no one to /petition to. It is up to you, and your guild or friends to resolve the situation.  At any time, your equipment could be gone without compensation.  <br>
<br>
This is why we will strive for self sufficiency. And have trades people to get us back on our feet should there be a gear wipe.<br>
