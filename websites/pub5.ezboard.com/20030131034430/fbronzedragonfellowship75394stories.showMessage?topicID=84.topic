Its smells of burning odors at all times and can make u quite sick if u stay by the lava too long.  I myself prefer to sit by the druid ring and watch people come and go.  sometimes i see people i know and sometimes i just chat to people i dotn know  at all.  On this fine and hot day the rock underneath  me at the druid ring seemed hoter then usual so i decided that ill just stand here and see who comes today.  I looked around wondering where everyone was at for i was the only person standing here which was unusual.  I heard some noises from the back of me so i turned around quickly wondering what it was.  A druid with the name i have seen so many times appeared before me.<br>
&quot;hi Bek&quot;' he said with a voice too familar it made me feel sick to hear it again.  He walked up to hug me but i turned so he wouldnt be able to.  &quot;giving me the cold shouder huh.  Well maybe it isnt me u should be giving the cold shouder to&quot;.<br>
&quot;whatever do u mean by that&quot; i said with a upset voice trying to hide they way i was feeling.  He made me so uncomfortable it made me shake with angry inside.<br>
&quot;Well i never left your side for one day when we together. but by what i hear from friends that your new hubby has left u to be by yourself.&quot;<br>
&quot;Left me by myself? im sorry but he is rather busy. Tiggyr loves me too much to leave me now leave me be!&quot;<br>
&quot;um still mad at me are we?  Figures.  What did u expect em to do Bek.  Sit around and wait for u to be ready for a family?  That pretty little druid girl gave me some beautiful kids.  Now we cant say u would have since u are human and all.  Humans as everyone knows arent the pretty's things that walk the face of this earth&quot;.<br>
&quot;The only problem with her giving u kids Dear, IS that i was your WIFE not her.  I dotn ever want to see u again be gone&quot;,  my voice started to hurt about as bad as my body did i hated him touching me.  His grib on my arm was starting to hurt since he had thistles growng from his sleeves.  <br>
With that he ran off toward the temple or ro like a bolt of lightening.  I looked down at my arm and seen where the thistles dug into my skin.  That was the last thing on my mind though.  <br>
I slide down a rock to the hot ground beside the druid ring.  Tears filled my eyes as i thought about his unkind words.  Tiggyr would neve leave me he was just busy doing something else right now.  Yes things are different now since he became leader between us but he still cares for me just like he did the day he married me.  The guild means everthign to both of us.  About that time brianaha came running up to me.<br>
&quot;mom! i knew i had the feelign something was wrong!  What happened?  That one guy  did this to u didnt he UGh i hate your ex husband mom.  Dad warned me to stay away from him&quot;<br>
She looked so cute in an outfit her dad gave her.  She was always so strong willed but so courious too bad combination.  &quot;Ill go get dad! u stay right here and dont move&quot;.<br>
i felt more comfortable as i seen her run out of my sight.  She was so much like her father it was almost like the could be twins.  about that time i felt myyself start to float.<br>
&quot;the grounds too hot to sit on M'lady,&quot; i heard a voice  say from behind me.  I stood up and seen Milwen smailign at me. He was so kidn to cast leviatate on me so i didnt sit on the ground.  &quot;u going to sol b? its not that crowded in there. But i must be going have things to do.&quot; He waved and left like the speed of light.<br>
Many BDF hang out in sol b now so i figured what the hey i can go join them. As i walked off from the druid ring i felt pride gear up inside me.  Im proud to be part of this wonderful family and that will never change.   <p><img border=0 src=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/tags/bekkaha.gif><BR><IMG SRC=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/academy/3a-baker.gif><IMG SRC=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/academy/3b-brewer.gif><IMG SRC=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/academy/3b-fishing.gif><IMG SRC=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/academy/3a-jeweler.gif><IMG SRC=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/academy/3b-pottery.gif><IMG SRC=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/academy/3b-tailor.gif><IMG SRC=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/academy/3a-mage.gif><IMG SRC=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/academy/3b-lang.gif>
