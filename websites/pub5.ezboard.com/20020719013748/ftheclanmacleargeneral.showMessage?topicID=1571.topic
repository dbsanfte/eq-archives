I also found out about the Thurgadin Shawl Quests, which require you to master almost all of your trade skills. This guide was how I mastered the trade skills the fastest. This is not a way to make money. Most of the time I destroyed the items I made because they were worth nothing to a vendor or I had no room to store them. This is a work in progress and not yet completed for I have not started Jewelcraft, once I do, there will be an update. I highly recommend that if you are evil, you hunt the Gnolls and Orcs in Highpass Hold to raise your faction. This is one of the best places to work on trade skills seeing there is a bank inside.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Pottery</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>I was able to master pottery for around 20 platinum and it took around 1 hour to do so. I used the vendors in Shadow Haven but I had to do a lot of boring tasks so that the vendors would speak with me.  This can also be done in Thurgadin, in the bank area.<br><br><br>Step One: <br><br>Purchase around 50 flasks of water, 50 Blocks of Clay and 50 Medium jar sketches. <br><br>Combine then on a pottery wheel until your skill reaches 36. I destroyed the unfired jars that I made because the firing sheets are too expensive. When I ran out of ingredients, my skill was 36 so I move on to a new design. <br><br>Step Two: <br><br>Purchase 100 flasks of water, 100 blocks of Clay and 100 Medium bowl sketches. I once again threw away the unfired bowls. I was able to reach a skill of 109 before running out of supplies. <br><br>It cost less than 20 platinum to do this. So I decided to master baking next which cost around 25 platinum to do so. <br><br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Baking</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Step One: Evil<br><br>Go to the Erudian vendor in EC (Katha Firespinner, by the Inn closest to WC). She sells has an unlimited supply of bat wings. I purchased about 80 wings and then ran back to Neriak. In Neriak down under, at the The Refined Palate, you can buy Frosting. Combine the two in the oven until you skill reaches 46. <br><br>I gave my batwing crunchies to friends and young ones in the city. <br><br><br>Step one: Good<br>Go to the Erudian vendor in EC (Katha Firespinner, by the Inn closet to WC). She sells has an unlimited supply of <br>bat wings. I purchased about 80 wings and then went to Inn 1 in EC and purchased the frosting from Parthar. I was using a spit to do the combine. But if you don’t have a spit, you can buy the Batwings from Lysa Truegreen (Academy of Arcane Sciences, W. Freeport) and the frosting from Pincia Brownloe (unlabeled building next to monk's guild, W. Freeport). And then use one of the ovens in Freeport - oven - in empty shop near Torligs Herbs &amp; Medicines (W. Freeport), inside Grub &amp; Grog Tavern (E. Freeport - if too tall to go over the counter, circle around the building for the backdoor), inside Traders Holiday (E. Freeport), inside Chops &amp; Hops (E. Freeport) inside unlabeled inn near bank (N. Freeport), outside empty building diagonal from Tassel's Tavern (N. Freeport). Keep making until they become trivial (46).<br><br>Step Two: Evil<br><br>Mariz Ixtaz near Toadstool in Neriak Commons sells fresh fish. I purchased around 80 and then went back to the Refined Palate and purchased 80 jugs of sauce. Combine those in the over to make 2 Fish Fillets. I made those until my skill reached 82. <br><br>Step Two: Good<br><br>Find Tanlok Harson (Port authority) and buy stacks of Fresh fish. Combine those in an over or spit with Jugs of Sauces that can be purchased from Pincia Brownloe. Keep making until they become trivial (82).<br><br>Step Three: Evil<br><br>Go back to EC and buy batwings. Then return to Neriak and combine the batwings with fresh fish in the over. They produce 1 fish cake, which is a banquet-sized meal. Make these until you reach your mastery skill. <br><br>Step Three: Good<br><br>Buy Batwings from Lysa Truegreen and combine with one fresh fish from Tanlok Harson. They produce 1 fish cake, which is a banquet-sized meal. Make these until you reach your mastery skill.<br><br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Brewing</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Step One: Evil<br>I was close to Ogguk so I purchased 4 stacks of snake scales, 4 stacks of bottles and 4 stacks of water. I kept making bog juice until my skill reached 21. (If you do not want to do this, you may do the same as Step One good in either Highpass Hold or in Neriak.<br><br>Step One: Good<br>At the Tiger’s Roar in Highpass Hold, when you first walk in the door, there is a vendor to your right, Lyn Tarburner, who sells barley, hops, rice, malt, yeast and wine yeast. Purchase stacks of Barley, Hops and Malt from her. Go to the other side of the building and buy Casks from the Bartender. Combine 1 Barley, 1 Hop, 1 Malt and a cask in the brew barrel.  If you fail, you get to reuse the Cask. This becomes trivial at 31.<br><br>Step Two: Good and evil<br>I was in Neriak now (this can also be done at the Tigers Roar in Highpass Hold buy all the supplies from Lyn Tarburner and the bartender), I purchased Barley and Malt from Wiska who is above the smugglers inn in Neriak. And Palais Derekor who is next to the soulbinder in Neriak sells the casks needed. If you walk up the ramp next to Palais, there is a brew barrel there. I continued to make Ale until my skill reached 68. <br><br>Step Three: Good and Evil<br>This took the longest time. Using the same vendors, I then began to make Ol' Tujim's Fierce Brew. <br>Combining Barley, Hops, Yeast, Malt and a cask in the brew barrel makes two brews. But, they take <br>longer to raise you skill. I took me one hour of brewing these to reach a master skill level. <br>I hope this helps all who read it to achieve the good fortune I now have.<br><br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Tailoring</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> – The easiest place to do this is East Karana. Run around killing spiders, lions and wolves. Loot all the furs and silks you can, even the ruined ones. First, work on Silks. The Crag Spiders are the best. They can drop up to 8 spider silks! Combine two silks in tailoring kit to make a silk swatch. Purchase 10 stacks of Mask Patterns at the Serpents Supply in Highpass Hold before you start to hunt.<br><br>Step One:<br>I suggest combining silks until they become trivial (15). Continue to wipe out anything that moves. There is a bandit camp in the land also; it is good to kill them for faction while hunting. <br><br>Step Two: <br>Next combine a mask pattern with a ruined wolf/cat/bear pelt. I purchased my patterns at the Serpents Supply in Highpass Hold. Continue to make these until they become trivial (26). Trick: There are some vendors in the houses next to Crag Mountain; I often find they have ruined pelts on them.<br><br>Step Three:<br>Combine a mask pattern with a silk swatch to make raw silk armor. You can either destroy these or sell them to the vendors. Continue to make these until they become trivial (36).<br><br>Step Four:<br>Combine 1 metal stud (made from smithing, trivial at 41), 1 mask pattern and 1 MQ Bear/Cat/Wolf pelt. These become trivial at 56 or if you have no smithing skills and have brewing, you can just jump to the next step.<br><br>Step Five:<br>Combine 1 silk Swatch, 1 Mask Pattern and 1 Heady Kiola (made from Brewing, trivial at 46) to make Cured Silk Armor. These become trivial at 86.<br><br>Step Six:<br>I was working on the Thurgadin Shawl quest and I needed the Crystalline Silks for the quest. So, I gathered as many as possible and started to make Crystalline Silk Masks by combining 1 Swatch, 1 Mask Pattern and 1 Silver Thread (which can be purchased in Thurgadin). Continue to make these until they become trivial at 108.  Then I started making the Mantle, 1 Silver Thread + 1 Swatch + Mantle Pattern until they became trivial at 118.  If you need to go higher, you can make the Shirt, 3 swatches + Tunic Pattern + 1 Silver Thread. <br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Smithing</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>This one is not as hard as some people think. It is not as easy as Pottery but you need to make sure you have tons of empty slots in your bags to work on this! I did most of my work in Thurgadin, but these supplies are easily found in Neriak and Highpass Hold.<br><br>Step One:<br>I first started with Metal Bits by combining 2 small pieces of Ore (Stackable) and 1 Water Flask inside of a forge. These become trivial at 21 but keep them, you will need them!<br><br>Step Two:<br>I made tools boxes next. They count as a container so you can’t stack them or place them inside of bags. These are made by combining Metal Bits and a Water flask inside of a forge. These become trivial at 51. <br><br>Step Three:<br>You’re now half way to becoming a master and it doesn’t get much harder from here. I made skewers next. Combine 1 metal bits, 1 Water Flask and 1 Skewer Mold in a forge. These are also inexpensive to make and become trivial at 115.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Fletching</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>This trade skill was the first one that I mastered. Mostly because I use arrows but if you don’t need the arrows, find someone near who can use them, they will love the gift. I purchased all my supplies at the Bleak Fletcher in Neriak. But there is a fletching supplier in every town.<br><br>Step One:<br>Type One Arrow – Combine the following in a fletching kit. 1 Field Point Arrowhead + 1 Wood Arrow Shaft + 1 Round Cut Fletch + 1 Large Nock. These become trivial at 16.<br><br>Step Two:<br>Type Two Arrow - 1 Field Point Arrowhead + 1 Wood Arrow Shaft + 1 Round Cut Fletch + 1 Medium Nock. These become trivial at 36.<br><br>Step Three:<br>Type Three Arrows - 1 Field Point Arrowhead + 1 Wood Arrow Shaft + 1 Parabolic Cut Fletch + 1 Large Nock. These become trivial at 46.<br><br>Step Four:<br>Type Four Arrows - 1 Field Point Arrowhead + 1 Wood Arrow Shaft + 1 Round Cut Fletch + 1 Small Nock. These become trivial at 56.<br><br>Step Five:<br>Type 5 Arrows - 1 Field Point Arrowhead + 1 Bone Arrow Shaft + 1 Round Cut Fletch + 1 Large Nock. These become trivial at 68.<br><br>Step Six:<br>Type 6 Arrows - 1 Field Point Arrowhead + 1 Wood Arrow Shaft + 1 Shield Fletch + 1 Large Nock. These become trivial at 82.<br><br>Step Seven:<br>Type 7 Arrows - 1 Hooked Arrowhead + 1 Wood Arrow Shaft + 1 Round Cut Fletch + 1 Large Nock. These become trivial at 102.<br><br>Step Eight:<br>Type 8 Arrows - 1 Field Point Arrowhead + 1 Wood Arrow Shaft + 1 Wood Vane Fletch + 1 Large Nock. These become trivial at 122.<br><br>Step Nine:<br>Type 9 Arrows - 1 Field Point Arrowhead + 1 Ceramic Arrow Shaft + 1 Round Cut Fletch + 1 Large Nock. These become trivial at 135.<br><br>Step Ten:<br>Type 10 arrows - 1 Field Point Arrowhead + 1 Wood Arrow Shaft + 1 Bone Vane Fletch + 1 Large Nock. These become trivial at 162.<br><br>Step Eleven:<br>Type 11 arrows - 1 Field Point Arrowhead + 1 Wood Arrow Shaft + 1 Ceramic Vane Fletch + 1 Large Nock. These become trivial at 202.<br><br><br><br>I used EQ Traders (www.eqtraders.com) as a reference guide to find out most of this information. I suggest you visit the site if you are looking for more information.

Electrum and Onyx will take you to 90 <br>Then electrum and wolf's eye will take you to 103. <br>Every thing is combines in a Jewelers Kit, usually found on the precious metal merchant<br>Everything is worth selling back to the vendor. Be sure you sell to the gem merchant for the best prices. Jewel Craft is in no way an inexpensive craft. The best way to save as much as you can is to use the lowest gem to get you the highest skill increase (ie the electrum and malichite is ultimatly less expensive than teh silver and opal) to get your skill up this high it will cost you any where from 500pp to 1000pp depending on your faction and charisma. All in all to get my skill to the 202 level I have spent nearly 12k in plat. I don't suggest you do that unless you are an Enchanter and can enchant the bars yourself. Enchanting the metal gives the item stats and you do not need to do this for simple skill increase. I wish I could tell you you could get to 101 or better with 50pp but then you would be in total shock when that 1k you had in the bank went to the gem merchants. Oh another note, if you sell everything back as you go you will not have to return to the bank until you are done.
