There is a moderator there, Gyani (a Hibernian), who is extremely biased and has engaged in the editing of people's posts if they say something bad about the Hibernian realm or players. <br>
<br>
The help I ask is this:<br>
<br>
1) Please post to that thread stating that you find Gyani's actions to be wholly inappropriate and abusive. Deadbolt, Beow, and Gomziak have already done so.<br>
<br>
2) Send an email to the following email addresses expressing your disapproval of Gyani's actions, and your request that such actions not be tolerated from their moderators:<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Percival Server (RP) VN Board, Dark Age of Camelot<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Moderator: Gyani<br>
<br>
<br>
You have a moderator on your forums that is engaging in gross abuse of power. His name is Gyani, and he is a moderator on the Percival (RP) server forums. Gyani plays in the Hibernian realm on the Percival server, and is letting this fact negatively affect his responsibilities as moderator on the Percival server forums.<br>
<br>
The first incident I came across was him editing someone's post (Deadbolt) simply because the post listed the names of Hibernian players that danced on his corpse. There was absolutely no justification for this editing as Gyani never edits posts that list Albions or Midgardians who dance on Hibernian corpses. Furthermore, the post did not flame or insult these people. It simply listed the names of people Deadbolt engaged in RvR combat, was killed by, and then danced on his corpse. <br>
<br>
Additionally, Gyani did not explain why he edited the posts. When I responded in that thread asking WHY this had occurred, he did not point out ANY rule or Term of Service on the forum that justified it.<br>
<br>
A few days later, there was another thread where someone was posting their opinions on the behavior of Hibernian players in general.  In this post, Gyani took out his flame thrower and started flaming away. I have no problem with that part. If you feel it is ok for moderators with a clear bias to get involved in flame wars, then that is your choice. I do not take issue with that.<br>
<br>
I replied to that thread, posting my thoughts on the issue. Then in a SINGLE SENTENCE of my 6 paragraph post, I wrote in reference to Gyani &quot;The one who edits posts that have FACTUAL information that happens to shed an unfavorable light upon Hibernia&quot;. This was not an attack or harassment on Gyani. It is a clear statement of facts based on his prior behavior. If he does not want people to worry about editing of posts, then he should not be editing in a way that is extremely abusive of his &quot;power&quot; to edit.<br>
<br>
Today I login and find out I am banned. This is absurd. I did not harass any moderator. I made a post cautioning other people to be careful since Gyani is engaging in editing and censoring if people post things negative about the realm he happens to play. There is absolutely no justification for me being banned from the forum.<br>
<br>
Perhaps your server moderators should be required to only moderate forums that they are not players on. Perhaps that would eliminate problems like this from occurring in the future. It is clear that Gyani, at least, is unable to separate his in game biases from his duties as a moderator. <br>
<br>
IGN websites have a reputation of high quality. The DAoC website is excellent, and I check it every day before logging into DAoC. I enjoy your sites and do not want one rogue moderator to sully the otherwise positive experience. I hope that you will take this matter seriously and not allow this type of moderator abuse to continue.<br>
<br>
Thank you,<br>

<br>
For what it's worth - I agree with you, though I do think that you're judging G a bit harshly in the open to be too innocent in all this, hehe. But hey - thats just me, lol. But the ban was just heavy handedness, pure and simple, regardless of the reason. Is that a cause for a stand? probably.. but I think you would really get so much more out of reminding G that there is too much fun to be had in the game and the people in it to let stupid stuff like cranky moderators of fan sites ruin it.<br>
<br>
Thank him/her for a nice try to ruin the game for ya though, and then carry on having a good time on the boards as you always have.<br>
<br>
I do think that like most player run communities, the only thanks the staff there should ever ask for, or expect, is for folks to log into their set ups. If they need to be ban happy to get their rocks off - someone will surely put a stop to it - as folks WILL just find, or make a community of their own, where the comfort level is maintained by mutual respect, and mutual agreements to disagree, lol.<br>
<br>
[honestly? its not so hard to have a set up like they have - they just are using tools we all can use to run a community is all, lol - and though I see more 'content' at their site then others - their site is like a strip and rip of so many others out there.

Michael, I have read through the threads in question and discussed the situation with Gyani.  I've determined that the original ban was reasonable and have advised the moderators on how such situations might be prevented in the future.  Gyani is an active participant as a class tester for Mythic and moderator for Camelot Vault...I have confidence that he meant well in this situation.<br>
 <br>
Thanks for taking the time to articulate your concerns and I hope you continue to stop by now and again.<br>

Subject: Regarding Gyani [percival moderator]<br>
<br>
<br>
Hail!<br>
 <br>
My appreciation in advance to you all - I am not in the habit of submitting complaints - but with all due respect, I just have to tell you that the actions of Gyani [moderator for the percival server boards] is appalling. He has taken to banning folks with opinions that differ from his own - and then publically announcing the bans - and then editing any and all posts that try to counter this course of action.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Please note that 3 hours after I received my email from Tarant - Gyani edited my post to the thread with this:<br>
<br>
***EDITED For discussion moderator actions in a public forum. Either PM the moderator in question or their superior.*** <br>
<br>
****EDITED again for further discussion of moderator actions in a public forum. As of 9:48 pm est, this user has been perminately banned.**** <br>
<br>
<br>
Banned, lol - which by the way is a first for me, hehe.. but honestly? It's marginally better then being kicked out of a leper colony. Just someone get this dumb pissant a spellchecker, pls!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

You know... I have half a mind to just go make a better community site then theirs now, lol <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
at any rate - please dont make an issue out of it. I am hardly upset by the actions of a cranky player that moderates a fan site.. and well, lol - if the staff there really is this cuh-razy, I don't think that anything positive can be expected to come out of telling them where they are wrong. They just are inept at running a community is all, and simply adore their little 'star of the board' more then the playerbase. It'll bite him in the butt one day to be sure, but I am having entirely too much fun playing a game I love to give his little hissyfits anymore mind then they deserve.<br>

I really hope that when Mythic gets their 'official site' going (the content one, not the promotional one) they will make some forums. The IGN forum software sucks, first of all, and their moderator system is clearly a huge problem.<br>

Here's a funny thing about this incident. When I first got on to the internet, I used to get in usenet flame wars all the time. I loved them. They were a lot of fun and intellectually and creatively stimulating. <br>
<br>
Then I grew up a bit =). I started to realize they were a huge waste of time. <br>
<br>
I would still get occasionally dragged into a flame war now and then. Mainly because I make online games for a living, and my work would sometimes get attacked by people who were banned from our game for cheating or whatnot. My wife started getting really bothered by the flame wars and how they caused me a lot of stress and such. So for her sake, I pretty much swore off flame wars even when I was the one being attacked.<br>
<br>
When she saw that thread I got the 24 hour ban for, she was disgusted. She mailed the staff herself. She hates flaming, and hates for ME to flame anyone. So when even SHE thought that was a really timid post by me, that says something =).<br>
<br>
By the way, the heat is getting poured on over at IGN. A lot of people are starting to get sick of the censorship and heavy handed actions of Gyani:<br>
