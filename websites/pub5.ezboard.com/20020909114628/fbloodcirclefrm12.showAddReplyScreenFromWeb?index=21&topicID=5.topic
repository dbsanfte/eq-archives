Not that he had really known a good night's sleep since the age of 12, two years before he began his training as a ranger. His mind drifted lazily back to those days, back to that more peaceful time. <br>
<br>
Sunlight and laughter, trees and games. Those are the memories that all should have of their childhood. Fergussen smiled and his eyelids drooped as he recalled those happy, happy days. As he drifted back to sleep his mind replayed the time he spent with his family in the forest's of the Jaggedpine. <br>
<br>
He remembered sitting on his brother's back, waving goodbye to his father. His mother stood beside them, a knowing but sad smile on her face. It had not been the first time that Fergussen had watched his father strap on the armor of a paladin of Mithaniel Marr and answer the call of the crusade.<br>
<br>
He recalled asking if his father would be back in time for his brother's wedding. She had smiled and stroked his hair and sang softly to him in the elven tongue. The song was soothing and reassuring. His father had not returned for the wedding, but it was a beautiful ceremony. Neighbors for miles had come to view the ceremony and wish the happy couple well.<br>
<br>
All had not gone well though. That was the night that the gnolls had attacked. The bright lights of his dream quickly turned into flames and blood. 43 dead...43 INNOCENTS slaughtered by the damned gnolls! He had hid in fear, watching all those he loved being killed. Powerless......<br>
<br>
Fergussen awoke from his sleep in a cold sweat that he was used to. He uttered a quick prayer to Tunare, asking that she watch over her family in her kingdom, and praising his elven heritage that allowed him to maintain on a minimum amount of sleep.<br>
<br>
In the back of his mind he could almost touch the thoughts of the missing paladin, Centuri. He concentrated the words &quot;they will come&quot; poured over his mind. Fergussen tried harder, reaching out for his friends mind. Her emotions washed over him, drowning him, breaking the link.<br>
<br>
The ranger gently touched his wrists. He could hear that others were awake. Footsteps that could only belong to the shadowknight Soulshiver could be heard pacing back an forth in the great hall. Others moved slowly in their rooms. Kannushi's near silent prayers played across his ears.<br>
<br>
The great hawk, Swiftstrike sat silently watching his master. Fergussen bekoned him and swiftly wrote a missive to Theofrid. He opened the window and sent the bird on his mission. The ranger then silently strapped on his armor and readied his weapons.<br>
<br>
As he sat at the table in his room, Fergussen quickly wrote two more notes. And then stealthily crept out of the window. He silently slipped the first through Kannushi's window. If anyone could reach Centuri's mind, it would be her twin sister. Fergussen only hoped that the song his mother used to sing to him would bring the same comfort to Centuri as it had to him.<br>
<br>
The second note, he slipped under the door of the great hall. He hoped the others would understand that he had to move now. As Fergussen entered the forest he drew out the costly potion he had looked so hard to find. The bitter liquid sent a brief sensation of pain through his body. The rangers vision blurred and then faded away as his body was magically transported to another location.<br>
<br>
Soulshiver looked out the window to where the ranger had been standing. He then slowly read the note...<br>
<br>
&quot;My friends, you all know I am of a restless nature, as the forest itself is. I must take some action now. I have contacts near to Neriak now and go to meet them. Rest assured that I shall be there when the time comes. My friend, Swiftstrike, shall return to you shortly. Should you have need to contact me, he will know how. Until we share the field of battle and rescue our dear friend...Fergussen&quot;<br>
<br>
...........................................<br>
<br>
Fergussen snuck silently along the tunnels wall, sticking to the shadows as Theofrid had taught him so many years ago. The twisting tunnels and branches were not overly difficult for him to follow. The wind brought the stench of Neriak to him and showed him the right paths to take.<br>
<br>
The dark elves had been expanding these tuneels since he had last been here. Within the next few years, Fergussen suspected that the tunnels which wound other Neriak would reach to all of the lands of Antonica. Already their underground paths traversed under the commonlands and stretched to bloody Kithicor.<br>
<br>
Footsteps resounded down the tunnel ahead of him. Fergussen muttered the spell of camoflage and stepped deeper into the shadows. Two dark elves passed by him. The ranger did not move for a long time afterwards. He understood the risks of moving about these tunnels, but he had to know if they would allow for their entrance into Neriak when the time for the raid came.<br>
<br>
Centuri's emotional state came to him again. Fear, frustration, doubt, submission, a shred of hope which seemed to be quickly fading.....all bound together by hatred. Fergussen began moving up the tunnel again. Well did he understand the power of hate, and the dangers.......... <p><center><img src="http://www.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/84/1899584.jpg"></center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ufergussen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>fergussen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0> at: 7/12/01 2:48:20 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#353535><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ukrysaniar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>krysaniaR</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 86<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/12/01 5:53:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclefrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yin and Yang</span><hr size=1>                                                                                        Krysania had long been far away on the continent of kunark helping the brave souls fight the evil frogs in the dungeon they call Sebilis.  I only now heard about the plight that has befallen our  sister Centuri.  I wish to rush back to the halls of  Blood Circle to help with the rescue of our brave sister. I fear I will not make it in time. It is a long and dangerous journey to Neriak from here, I offer up many prayers to Tunare ask which way I should go.<br>
<br>
In the dark of night while begging Tunare to tell me what I should do I am granted a vision,  I see the pain in his eyes and feel the rage of Fergussen, as he makes his way through the evil tunnels of Neriak.  With this vision sent to me  I know I must undertake the dangerous journey into the bowels of Neriak to help heal the pain of Fergussen if he is  to succeed in his mission.  <br>
<br>
I begin the search for Intuity the mighty wizard, I know if anyone can get me there in time he can.  <br>
