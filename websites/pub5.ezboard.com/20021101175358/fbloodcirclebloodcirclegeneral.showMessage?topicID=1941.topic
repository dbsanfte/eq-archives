Barm's Tips for Melee Management <br>
<br>
There are times during your career as a shaman that you'll find yourself grouped with those crazy melee type classes. I offer the following tips for working with the gate-inhibited: <br>
<br>
Melees are poor at math and don't understand that 20 mana is less than 100 mana, thus they keep pulling. You can help the tank visualize your mana bar by keeping his health bar at the same level. Some warriors cannot comprehend this either and pull anyway. This is called natural selection. <br>
<br>
Paladins get a very annoying ability called Lay of Hands that they carry around like a personal get out of death free card. They will happily pull Venril Sathir to your right courtyard group confident that LoH will save the day. It's imperative that you &quot;fizzle&quot; a few heals, forcing them to burn this right away. Now, your group is relatively safe from your pally for one game day. <br>
<br>
Monks get a similar ability called Mend. They tend to be more selfish in its use, so make a hotkey saying “Monk, please cast MEND on %t.” and click it every two minutes. If they try to claim they can’t, tell them your brother’s 16 monk can Group Mend. Then accuse them of being ebayed. <br>
<br>
Tanks think all casters med at something like 500 mana a tick. When you report your current mana they, despite being poor at math, mentally tack on another 30% to compensate for .003 second delay your message spent traversing the internet. To correct for this, subtract 30% from all mana reports. This is called the &quot;Scotty Principle”. <br>
<br>
Rogue twinks are your enemy. They join the group with 15 hit points left dual wielding 10/10 weapons that proc Insidious Taunt and immediately demand haste. You cannot afford to heal rogues. Give them something with a boot icon -- Scale of Wolf for instance. <br>
<br>
Many people do not understand the Ranger class and think they are like that dirty, unshaven guy from Lord of the Rings. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Rangers actually follow very strict principals of honor like Shaolin priests. Under their Bushido-like code, nothing brings more shame than being healed by another. Pat Morita explained this all at the last Fan Fair. He did say they were kinda dirty. <br>
<br>
Keep your pet alive over all other group members. You can justify this by explaining that your 55 pet costs 50 mana more than Reviviscence. Be warned, they will try to confuse the issue by pointing out that you can’t even cast Reviviscence. Go into a long dissertation regarding the concept of “community mana” and the respect thereof. <br>
<br>
If melees ask for strength say something like, &quot;Yeah, that would be sweet -- maybe this drolvarg will drop it?&quot; [Optional] Then cast Maniacal Strength on your pet. <br>
<br>
Some shaman suggest casting buffs on yourself or a pet as timers so you know when to refresh. While this may sound good on paper, it does not factor in the warrior who clicks off each buff every few minutes trying to check the names. <br>
<br>
Don't get angry at the tank who responds to your &quot;OOM&quot; with &quot;haste plz&quot;. What they really mean is, &quot;Hastily get thyself to the zone while I buy you precious second with my unworthy life's blood, Good Priest.&quot; It's just hard to type all that between the crunching sounds. Respect the dying request of this proud roleplayer.  <p><center>

Grexor's tips for the Mana Dependant:<br>
<br>
We melee recognize your aversion to physical contact, we really do. Understanding that most of you caster types have never even touched a woman, much less a mob we really do have a desire to keep you safe and comfy, no need to spam us with &quot;TAUNT! GET IT OFF!&quot;<br>
<br>
Building upon this first tenant, please try to steel your nerves when this does happen, running around in circles like a baby chicken does not make my whomping of the mobs ass any easier. Remember, tanks want the mobs attention, you know we are all glory hounds.<br>
<br>
Contrary to popular caster belief, our group chat does have a built in aplifier for your voice. If you whisper, I can hear it at even the greatest distances. When pulling, if you hear a tank say &quot;Will pull till you say you need to med&quot;, feel free to speak up and actually mention when your mana is low and that you need to med. The group system will ensure you don't make your throat hoarse from screaming.<br>
<br>
Shiny things make the caster's eyes sparkle, all too often we tanks see nice messages saying that caster X or cleric Y has looked a corpse while we are still fighting. For added impulse control we suggest groups incorporate a tether and shackle. Its for the caster's own good, all that time wasted looting while were still fighting could have been better spent medding.<br>
<br>
Things that go boom. To help your caster control his fireworks, I suggest tanks give out matches only when the mob is at 25-40%. Casters don't like the attention (beating) that tanks get, after all *they* are the academy educated ones, they deserve the glory, not some meat shield. When given a chance many casters will show off, and get a subsequent beating. We reccomend letting them get the snot beat out of them before saving them, its a good lesson to be learned.<br>
<br>
Be nice to your cleric friends, they need our money, the poor chaps spend lots on gems and things to make you fight better, dont ever be stingy with your cleric.<br>

Now, I know there are certain casters, mostly wizards, who have this ridiculous aversion to seeing anything in red applied to themselves (and this sometimes is carried to the extreme of robes), but most purecasters you will find in your daily travels will know how to take a hit or two.  Some of them might even know how to tank.  (Your local enchanter or shaman is excellent at this, since they go about building huge taunt with tash/malo and slows, guaranteed to not let them sit for at least half the battle.)<br>
<br>
A little tip for mages...  If the group doesn't need your damage, undernuke.  A lot.  I've lost count of the sheer amount of times that, instead of using long-cast, high mana cost DDs I've instead sat around and summoned mod rods for the cleric and enchanter, keeping the pulls constant.  After all, what do I really need the mana for, unless they manage to get my pet killed?  hehehe  This works especially well with the rogue pets, since they put out enough extra damage over the norm to keep a mage from needing to nuke heavily in the group environment.<br>
