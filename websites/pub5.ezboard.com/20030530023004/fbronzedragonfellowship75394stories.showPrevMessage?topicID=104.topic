<br>
(IDG) -- A woman in Wisconsin is planning to file a lawsuit against Sony Online Entertainment under the charge that popular online game &quot;EverQuest&quot; made her son commit suicide in November 2001.<br>
<br>
The woman, Elizabeth Woolley of Osceola, Wisconsin, claims that her son Shawn shot himself as a direct result of the 12 hours he spent every day playing the highly addictive online game. She said that Sony had refused to give her information about her son's playing habits, which she hoped would give some insight into his suicide. <br>
<br>
&quot;Shawn was playing 12 hours a day, and he wasn't supposed to because he was epileptic, and the game would cause seizures,&quot; Woolley said. &quot;Probably the last eight times he had seizures were because of stints on the computer.&quot; <br>
<br>
Although Woolley admits that Shawn had mental problems stemming from before he began playing EverQuest, she believes some social event that occurred in the game caused her son to go over the brink. She has hired an attorney and plans to push Sony to put warning labels on their games.<br>

==============================================<br>
<br>
As I was wandering about our message board, I saw that this news story had come in today on CNN.com. Here is my question, the mother says her son spent 12 hours a day playing EQ yet she did not know about it for some reason. She called EQ to find out how many hours a day her son was playing, and they wouldn't give her the information. Here is my question...where was she during these 12 hours a day? I can understand working, but most people do not work 12 hours a day. And if you are concerned about how much time he is online...get rid of the cable modem so when you call and get a busy signal you will know he is online and most likely playing EQ! just my 2 copper pieces. Throw the responsibility on the boy and yourself ma'am, not the game. It is not Sony's job to provide a daycare for your son while you are off doing your own thing. My wife is reading this over my shoulder and says I should show at least a little sensitivity since the woman just lost her child. Here it is: &quot;Boo hoo!&quot; I know that was quick but if you missed it, just scroll back.<br>

Death of a game addict<br>
Ill Hudson man took own life after long hours on Web<br>
By STANLEY A. MILLER II<br>
of the Journal Sentinel staff<br>
Last Updated: March 30, 2002<br>
<br>
Shawn Woolley loved an online computer game so much that he played it just minutes before his suicide.<br>
The 21-year-old Hudson man was addicted to EverQuest, says his mother, Elizabeth Woolley of Osceola. He sacrificed everything so he could play for hours, ignoring his family, quitting his job and losing himself in a 3-D virtual world where more than 400,000 people worldwide adventure in a never-ending fantasy.<br>
<br>
On Thanksgiving morning last year, Shawn Woolley shot himself to death at his apartment in Hudson. His mother blames the game for her son's suicide. She is angry that Sony Online Entertainment, which owns EverQuest, won't give her the answers she desires. She has hired an attorney who plans to sue the company in an effort to get warning labels put on the games.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's like any other addiction,&quot; Elizabeth Woolley said last week. &quot;Either you die, go insane or you quit. My son died.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the virtual world of EverQuest, players control their characters through treasure-gathering, monster-slaying missions called quests. Success makes the characters stronger as they interact with other players from all over the real world.<br>
<br>
Woolley has tried tracing her son's EverQuest identity to discover what might have pushed him over the edge. Sony Online cites its privacy policy in refusing to unlock the secrets held in her son's account.<br>
<br>
She has a list of names her son scrawled while playing the game: &quot;Phargun.&quot; &quot;Occuler.&quot; &quot;Cybernine.&quot; But Woolley is not sure if they are names of online friends, places he explored in the game or treasures his character may have captured in quests.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shawn was playing 12 hours a day, and he wasn't supposed to because he was epileptic, and the game would cause seizures,&quot; she said. &quot;Probably the last eight times he had seizures were because of stints on the computer.&quot;<br>
<br>
Woolley knows her son had problems beyond EverQuest, and she tried to get him help by contacting a mental health program and trying to get him to live in a group home. A psychologist diagnosed him with depression and schizoid personality disorder, symptoms of which include a lack of desire for social relationships, little or no sex drive and a limited range of emotions in social settings.<br>
<br>
&quot;This fed right into the EverQuest playing,&quot; Woolley said. &quot;It was the perfect escape.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vulnerable to addiction<br>
Jay Parker, a chemical dependency counselor and co-founder of Internet/Computer Addiction Services in Redmond, Wash., said Woolley's mental health problems put him in a category of people more likely to be at risk of getting addicted to online games.<br>
<br>
Parker said people who are isolated, prone to boredom, lonely or sexually anorexic are much more susceptible to becoming addicted to online games. Having low self-esteem or poor body image are also important factors, he said.<br>
<br>
&quot;The manufacturer of EverQuest purposely made it in such a way that it is more intriguing to the addict,&quot; Parker said. &quot;It could be created in a less addictive way, but (that) would be the difference between powdered cocaine and crack cocaine.&quot;<br>
<br>
Parker doesn't make the narcotics analogy lightly. One client - a 21-year-old college student - stopped going to class within eight weeks after he started playing EverQuest his senior year.<br>
<br>
After playing the game for 36 hours straight, he had a psychotic break because of sleep deprivation, Parker said.<br>
<br>
&quot;He thought the characters had come out of the game and were chasing him,&quot; Parker said. &quot;He was running through his neighborhood having hallucinations. I can't think of a drug he could have taken where he would have disintegrated in 15 weeks.&quot;<br>
<br>
Common warning signs<br>
There are several questions people who think they are addicted to computers and the Internet can ask themselves to see whether they might have a problem, Parker said, including whether they can predict the amount of time they spend on the computer or have failed trying to control their computer use for an extended period of time.<br>
<br>
Parker said that any traumatic setback to Shawn Woolley's character in EverQuest could have traumatized an already vulnerable young man.<br>
<br>
It may be that the character was slain in combat and Woolley had trouble recovering him. Or, he could have lost a treasured artifact or massive wealth, or been cast out of one of the game's social clubs, called guilds.<br>
<br>
&quot;The social component is big because it gives players a false sense of relationships and identity,&quot; Parker said. &quot;They say they have friends, but they don't know their names.&quot;<br>
<br>
Elizabeth Woolley remembers when her son was betrayed by an EverQuest associate he had been adventuring with for six months. Shawn's online brother-in-arms stole all the money from his character and refused to give it back.<br>
<br>
&quot;He was so upset, he was in tears,&quot; she said. &quot;He was so depressed, and I was trying to say, 'Shawn, it's only a game.' I said he couldn't trust those people.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sony Online Entertainment declined to comment for this story, but EverQuest fans say the game is a fun diversion that is much better than watching television.<br>
<br>
'It's like an adult playground'<br>
Donna Cox of Schaumburg, Ill., has played for about two years and enjoys the adventuring and socializing. Cox and her husband, Bob, play together and team up against the game's challenges.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's like an adult playground,&quot; said Donna Cox, a professional who manages a team of computer programmers. &quot;You can become anything you want. People only see the side of you that you want them to see.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cox played about 40 hours a week at the height of her gaming but now plays only a couple of times a week. &quot;Once you get into the high-end game, it takes a a lot of time,&quot; she said.<br>
<br>
Dody Gonzales of Milwaukee has played the game for about three years and has more than a dozen characters spread across the EverQuest realm. Gonzales, who plays about four hours a night, knows EverQuest has been blamed for people's problems because it's a topic discussed in the online community.<br>
<br>
Said player Vincent Frederico of Rochester, N.Y.: &quot;It's almost like a drug. If you are not happy with your real life, you can always go in. . . . Someone who lacks social skills, they could find it much easier just to play the game instead of going out to a bar.&quot;<br>
<br>
A game without end<br>
How does it pull people in?<br>
<br>
One key component is that the game can be played indefinitely, and there are always people populating the online world. EverQuest and other online games also have a social structure.<br>
<br>
&quot;The graphics are absolutely thrilling. They just haul you in,&quot; said Parker, who has treated several people for EverQuest addiction. &quot;The other piece is that it takes time to leave the game. You have to find a place to hide to get out, and that makes people want to play longer.&quot;<br>
<br>
For people who are unhappy, socially awkward or feel unattractive, online games provide a way to reinvent themselves.<br>
<br>
Shawn Woolley - who was overweight, worked in a pizza restaurant and lived alone in an apartment the last months of his life - may have depended on EverQuest to provide the life he really wanted to live.<br>
<br>
&quot;People like to create new personas,&quot; Parker said. &quot;You see a lot of gender-bending.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hooked on 'EverCrack'<br>
Interest in online games grew in 1997 with Origin Systems' Ultima Online, now with about 225,000 players. Microsoft's Asheron's Call, with around 100,000 subscribers, provides a virtual world similar to EverQuest's. Most online games require an initial software purchase plus monthly fees of about $10.<br>
<br>
The games have roots in Dungeons &amp; Dragons, the role-playing game created in 1974 by TSR Games in Lake Geneva. But D&amp;D requires human contact to play; its digital counterparts do not.<br>
<br>
David Walsh, president of the National Institute on Media and the Family in Minneapolis, said many EverQuest players refer to it as &quot;EverCrack.&quot;<br>
<br>
Walsh, who didn't know the details of Woolley's suicide, thinks mental health problems linked to playing online games, especially EverQuest, are growing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Could a person get so engrossed that they become so distressed and distraught that it could put them over the edge?&quot; Walsh said. &quot;It probably has something to do with the game. But your average person or average gamer won't do this. It's a coming together of a number of circumstances.&quot;<br>
<br>
Walsh and Parker both said online games as a whole are not inherently bad, and Walsh compared playing online games to drinking alcohol. Both can be harmful if abused.<br>
<br>
A call for warning labels<br>
&quot;I've seen a lot of wreckage because of EverQuest,&quot; Parker said. &quot;But they are all the same. It's like cigarettes. They need to come with a warning label. 'Warning, extensive playing could be hazardous to your health.' &quot;<br>
<br>
Warning labels are exactly what Jack Thompson, a Miami attorney and vocal critic of the entertainment industry, wants to result from a lawsuit he plans to file against Sony Online Entertainment for Elizabeth Woolley.<br>
<br>
&quot;We're trying to whack them with a verdict significantly large so that they, out of fiscal self-interest, will put warning labels on,&quot; he said. &quot;We're trying to get them to act responsibly. They know this is an addictive game.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am sure we are going to find things akin to the tobacco industry memos where they say nicotine is addictive,&quot; he said. &quot;There is a possibility of a class-action lawsuit.&quot;<br>
<br>
John Kircher, a professor at Marquette University Law School and expert in personal injury law, said a negligence action might be won if plaintiffs could successfully argue EverQuest's publishers &quot;should have foreseen an unreasonable risk of harm, that people could potentially hurt themselves.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then there is the issue of First Amendment rights,&quot; Kircher said. &quot;Does the First Amendment right trump the rights of the plaintiff? If the Internet is a form of publication . . . there is a balance the courts try to strike, and it's not an easy question.&quot;<br>

<br>
Ok, here is my absolute favorite quote!!!!<br>
&quot;It's like any other addiction,&quot; Elizabeth Woolley said last week. &quot;Either you die, go insane or you quit. My son died.&quot;<br>
<br>
If I could put a poll here I would...but since I cannot.<br>
<br>
How do you plan on leaving EverQuest?<br>
<br>
1) Die<br>
<br>
2) Go Insane<br>

<br>
If that's my only choices, I guess I'll have to go with #2 also. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I really feel sorry for this guy and his family. Don't get me wrong. Losing a loved one suddenly is the hardest someone can go through. I wouldn't wish it on my most hated enemy but come on. She's going to sue SOE over her son's death?<br>
<br>
Take this:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Woolley knows her son had problems beyond EverQuest, and she tried to get him help by contacting a mental health program and trying to get him to live in a group home...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> There's good parenting for you. If your child has problems, send him away to a home. That'll cure him! Elizabeth Woolley, where were you when Shawn was playing 12 hours a day when, like you said, &quot;wasn't supposed to because he was epileptic, and the game would cause seizures...&quot;?<br>
<br>
I had a friend's son staying with us for a while so he could complete the school year before moving. He and I started playing EQ right after it was released. Within a couple of weeks, his grades started dropping and he stopped hanging out with friends because he was playing too much. What did I do? Let him cut classes so he could play 12 hours a day? Sue Sony Online Entertainment? No. I cut back on his EQ time and spent time with him doing other things. Wow, taking responsibility for another's upkeep. Novel concept, I know. Maybe I should give it a name... I know! How about parenting? I wonder if it will ever catch on??? I can only hope...<br>
<br>
Edit: Afterthoughts: I do care about the people I know through playing EQ and have even met several of them in RL. Behind the protection of the keyboard, people do let their defenses down and show more of their true selves than they realize. People can also become drawn emotionally into their online lives. Once that happens, it's hard to break that bond, and could probably be considered a form of addiction. I'm sorry his mother didn't know more about her son's online life, but that wasn't his fault. It also wasn't SOE's. If they're going to put warning labels on EQ, they'd better put them on life itself also. It's possible to get emotionally caught up in it just as much or more.<br>
<br>
Did that make sense to anyone? I don't know, and it doesn't really matter I guess. It did to me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I'm sorry if I offended anyone. This story affected me in a way I wasn't expecting... And for the sue-happy lawyers in the world: All thoughts expressed in this post are my OPINIONS. Now, please excuse me while I go put warning labels on my kids. They have been determined to be addictive and could have a severe impact on the outcome of my life.  <p><img border="0" src="http://www.goodnet.com/~saxon/full-logo.gif"><img border=0 src=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/tags/koraf.gif> </html> <BR><IMG SRC=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/academy/3a-baker.gif><IMG SRC=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/academy/3a-blacksmith.gif><IMG SRC=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/academy/3b-brewer.gif><IMG SRC=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/academy/3a-fishing.gif><IMG SRC=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/academy/3b-tailor.gif><IMG SRC=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/academy/3b-lang.gif>

<br>
Gotta be honest my first impression when I read this article was exactly the same as you (Where was the mother all this time?).  But then I got thinking about this what is the mother trying to do here?  She is trying to find someone to blame for the death of her son it is easier to blame someone else than to actually take some of the responsibility yourself.<br>
<br>
A strong willed person will take the blame and learn to live with the guilt and in many cases use that guilt to change their actions in the future for the better.  On the other hand a weak willed person will look for the easiest thing to blame to try to remove their guilt and in the process they believe that their inner torment and conflict will be lessoned as we all know this is never the case.  Still many people do this and never learn the harsh reality that you only ever have yourself to blame.<br>
<br>
It is very easy to make judgement and comments about this article without being personally invloved if however one of you were personally involved do you actually know how you would react.  The honest truth is no one does until they are knee deep in it and sinking fast only then will you know how you think you should react.  To you it will be the right reaction to many it will be the wrong one and a lot of people will have advice for you but you wont know if your the strong or the weak willed person till you are in those shoes.<br>
<br>
Anyway enough pychology for one day and I have probably given you all a big brain strain reading this and trying to understand the inner meaning but you will all get what you are meant to get when you read this, each person will see a different message thats just life and the truth that it brings.<br>

It's always easy for us to say what we would in that situation. It's another matter entirely if we were in that position. Don't ever change, Naz! <br>
<br>
I reacted the opposite of you. I was thinking of what she was trying to do and who she was trying to blame. I then reread some of the other articles and started to think about what she didn't do, like knowing what her son was doing. That's when I decided to post...<br>
<br>
Either way, I feel sorry for her and hope she can someday find peace.<br>

She finally told him Sunday morning that she is divorcing him...<br>
