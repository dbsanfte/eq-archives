<br>
Dear Diary,<br>
<br>
Something happened in the Guid Hall last night that may affect us all, <br>
It was evening, after dinner, and some of us were gathered around, just relaxing.  I remember sitting and trying to listen to Eryl playing on his lute as I was working on another bag for Masius, (he ripped a hole in his first one tracking something through a bramble thicket -that's what he said, anyhow. Personnaly, I think he just wants another one and didn't think I would give it to him.) Thorvan and Avaya were in the corner drinking, making lots of noise as always so it was hard to hear Eryl's song from where I was sitting.  A few of the others were there too, talking about the tower raid a couple days ago. It was like being among the family I lost when I was young.  I haven't been happier in a long time.  <br>
<br>
Anyhow, there we were when there was a big crash from Zarius's office. Everyone rushed down the hall all at once. There were too many people in the doorway for me to see, at first, but once everyone got straightened out..... It seems the noise was made by a couple pets that had gotten loose and had totally ripped the place apart. There were papers everywhere!  <br>
<br>
(Pets! they get into so much trouble if you don't watch them every second. Zarious really ought to ban them from the Hall.)<br>
<br>
Well, I'm still not sure who's pets were fighting in there but it's really odd because his office should have been locked and there should have been no way for them to get in.  They broke a couple vases and the statue Zarius keeps in the corner. The REALLY ugly one. He's going to be pretty upset when he finds out!<br>
<br>
Somehow,I ended up cleaning up the mess. I'm still not sure how THAT happened (I think my sister volunteered me)<br>
While I was picking up, and trying to put together some of the papers that had been chewed up, One of them caught my attention....I found as many pieces of it as I could and when I got it together, the message filled me with forboding... Here's what it said:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Zario -- of Blood Circle <br>
-------<br>
-------- regarding the --------- Guild Hall -- The --------<br>
--------------- act of Destruction ------------ most severe punishment we could devise. The threats and blood ------------ only the beginning. My name -----------.  ----- of Evil Inclination ------------traitor.  Again, ----------- you and your Guild ----------interfer---- raid. ----------------------- terms ---------- before tomorrow.<br>
<br>
Numamarin<br>
CoF </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Keep in mind, the paper was chewed up and hard to read, the scraps had coffee all over them.  But considering what happened last week, I thought it might be serious....<br>
So, I took the soggy scraps in to the main room and showed them to the officers. They seem to be taking the possible threat seriously.<br>
<br>
No one has seen Zarious since early this morning.<br>
I hope nothing has happened to him.<br>

He slowly lashed the last piece of fletching onto on arrow and stuck it into a quiver and hung it in the tree. Hinamar would know to look for them here in the morning. <br>
<br>
Below him, he could make out Centuri explaining the message she had found. It was hard to make out the exact conversations, but the winds carried the voices to him. Fergussen had been warned that trouble brewed on the horizon, and had heard rumors that treachery had been committed upon his allies. It was the rain that cried, and the wind that whispered, and the earth which trembled in fury that had led him here to see what truth there was to this all.<br>
<br>
As the conversations died, Fergussen noticed Thorvan step outside the Guild Hall. The tall barbarian slowly nodded his head once, his eyes scanning the mountain side slowly. Then his fingers traced the air and he disappeared. <br>
<br>
Fergussen stretched slowly and prepared himself. Tracking a trail as cold as this one was already was no easy task, even worse when magic was involved. But he was determined, he had promises to fulfill. He sniffed the wind and slowly made his way deeper into the mountains...<br>

<br>
It's been two days since Zarius dissapeared. No ransom demands, no clues at all. Blood Circle's Guild Leader has simply vanished from the face of Norrath. <br>
And yet, the tension still builds.  Dark forces of Hate and Anger gather around the building.  It is like the storm, building in the distance... something will break soon and the torrent shall be released.<br>
<br>
Perhaps Thorvan, meditating in Thurgadin will find the answers before it is too late.<br>
<br>
As she checks the straps of her breastplate, she reflects upon her mission... to go alone into the forest and stand a vigil.  To seek communion and guidance from the goddess. She takes a deep breath and calms her racing thoughts. <br>
 <br>
Events of the past few weeks have thrown her life into chaos. She can feel the answer to Zarious' disappearance just out of her reach, but it will not come to her. Heart-torn between duty and love, she has lost her way.  Today she will go into the forest and sing prayers, hopefully the Mother of All will assist her in regaining her center and balance.  Then, Centuri hopes, the answers will come. <br>
<br>
She dons her helm and is concious of those that watch...<br>
Her thoughts wander from her sister's quiet support and encouragement to another, who had many harsh words for her in a darkened hallway the previous evening... she can feel his dark gaze prickling the hairs on the back of her neck, right now.<br>
<br>
<br>
One last buckle and she unracks her sword from the stand in the hallway. Polished, oiled steel winks in the dawn. Preparations are complete, it is time.  With a backward glace and a small smile, she nods farewell to her Guild mates, wishes them Goddess-blessing, and leaves the hall.<br>

His mind turned over and over again the events of the last few days and the portents that the spirits spoke of. So consumed in thought was he that he barely caught the overwhelming scent of ozone filling the air of his bedchamber.<br>
<br>
But the large Barbarian had been raised in lands where missing such a scent could mean death. Almost unconsciously, at the same moment he heard the soft humm with resounded through his room, he turned his head to the side. A small portal opened about two feet in front of him and an arrow sped out of it, brushing past his hair, where his face had been moments before.<br>
<br>
The arrow imbedded itself firmly into the wall, and as Thorvan untied the note attached to it he silently reminded himself to make some changes to the potion he made which allowed Fergussen to contact him at a moments notice. He unrolled the parchment, taking a moment to examine the blood that stained the corner of it, and then slowly read it to himself....<br>
<br>
&quot;Thorvan, my brother. I fear the portents the spirits warned of are true. The trail has led me far from you Guild Hall my friend. I lost the trail briefly in the Rathe Mountains, but through some careful negotiations with the unkempt druids who make these hills their home i was able to pick up the scent once more.<br>
<br>
My network of informants are slowly covering both the lands of Kunark and the island of Faydwer. So far they have found nothing. However, your cousin, Sylvertip did report back to me with an interesting rumor floating around the tundra. Apparantley our old &quot;friend&quot; Miragul had had visitors lately. The trail led me back in the directions of our homeland, so i traveled back to halas as quickly as I could.<br>
<br>
I won't bore you with the details of my conversation with the ancient lich, more then to say that for a magalomaniac, he really isn't that bad of a guy. That, and apparently he despises this Numamarin (something or other about stealing to many of his ideas, did i mention Miragul has a tendency to rant and ramble?) Anyways, from what i was able to gather from him, it seems the trail leads one of two places. <br>
<br>
The first is Erudin, into the depths of &quot;the Hole&quot;. I hear Avaya is in that region, perhaps he has discovered something. The second ties in to more then just Miragul...I have heard rumors of big happenings within the lair of Runnyeye. I fear that pehaps there is more to what is going on with Zarious then just a simple kidnapping. <br>
<br>
I shall let you know as i find out more...should you come across anything, you know how to contact me. Oh by the way, I ran into another old friend of yours...the Glacier Bear is still creeping about, fearing your return. Be well my old friend, I must continue before the trail fades. May Tunare keep your footfalls soft and your paths clear.<br>

Itno, Soulshiver, <br>
<br>
Abbyss, and Hinamar will agree the creatures there are extemley dificult to deal with. They seem to have the constitution of the earth itself and they certainly have the look of it. These earthly elementals hit hard. It took all the strength and stamina we could muster just to make our way past the very first guards. <br>
<br>
I was able only once to catch a glimpse of the Underfoot city that exists deep within this place. <br>
<br>
We encountered a great barbarian in our travels. His name was Dugann. He was exacting his revenge on a Rock Golem. The golem was heard to posses a wonderous item...Granite Spaulders. He had no information in reguards to our missing Guild Leader. He did offer his condolences and was even kind enough to award Itno a Loam Encrusted Veil for his bravery. <br>
<br>
We battled at the entrance of this place for many hours. We could not get a single bit of information from the inhabitants we send back to the earth. It wasn't long before there were dozens of people entering this place. <br>
<br>
It apeared another guild had an issue with this deep dark place. They were here in great numbers to slay any beast they encountered. It wasn't long before the whole places was turned inside out and we chose to leave before it got out of control.<br>
<br>
I personally get a agonizing feeling that we may find our leader here. He is a master of the elements, and if he could survive the test of any dungeon it would be this one. I fear howeveer if we don't find him soon, we may find less than a lively Zarius.<br>
<br>
I will do my best to delve deeper into this hell. I will bring justice to our guild. I swear it.<br>

<br>
Though this is indeed troublesome and more than that, a big inconvience, why are we surprised that we have been dealt such a blow?  Zarius has been our leader since its inception(well, Eryl had a stint as well) and we have become mighty in the eyes of both friend and foe.  A kidnapping of one of Zarius calibur is not at all a rarity in my homeland... indeed Neriak boasts more murders, kidnapping, blackmailing, etc than even East Freeport!  What is the intent of our current foe?  What is his motive?  The &quot;Hole&quot; is a bastion of good Evil, a place I could truly call home.  I now, indeed, see why Itno lauds his homeland so.  However, what could our adversary hope to gain at Zarius's capture other than our eternal ire?  Has anyone heard from his Druidic life partner about Zariur's goings on? Avaya, as to the leads about the Hole, where might bring they us? To our deaths, assuredly, if we venture into the depths unprepared---prehaps this is the ultimate motive...<br>
<br>
As for my caustic companions who tremble with anger and fear at Zarius's missing...take Anouris's example... whoever it is will die, there is no need for raised fists in anger, for thus is life.  Zarius accepted his calling and understood the inherit dangers.  Let's hope that he is as strong in his Art as Avaya said that we might find him in one piece... if not he wasn't strong enough and Innoruuk has judged him as unworthy. As for me, death and chaos will follow in my wake; if I am truly blessed one of the many I will kill will be our common adversary...<br>

It appears as if the &quot;Light&quot; side of our family is pretty upset about these circumstances. Undoubtedly, they will all lose their lives unless we intercede. Utaldain, do you still have that contact with the Ebon Hands? Call on your contact and see what you can drum up. Itno, it appears as if we are in your &quot;Backyard&quot;, contact the Dark Masters in Paineel. You know and I know that if something sinister is afoot on Erud they know about it. We might have to cut a deal with them to have Zarius released... Anouris, are you still tied in with the Circle of Unseen Hands? If so, kill who you have to to get information. I'll provide whatever albi as necessary to lay your cover. Sinyan, the Blades of Innoruuk are not known for anything but death and carnage, but perhaps one of them might have served as an &quot;Arm&quot; for this deed, see what you can dig up too... Blacko, you practice the same Art as Zarius, has there been any rumors floating about that might somehow tie into Zarius's disappearnce? Let me know if so...<br>
Brothers, we have got to end this tiresome epic... I don't know about you, but reading the inner dialogue of someone &quot;Pure&quot; of heart turns my stomache!!! Also, though I know it is a major task, try to keep our Light half from dying...impossible as that may seem...<br>

<br>
As we talked further we had talked about the possibilities of Zarius being held captive in the Hole and he assured me that he was not there , he said he knew this because his guild was in the Hole punishing the infidel that left the message in blood on our walls . <br>
<br>
He then asked if Zarius Liked to fish ??? This struck me as odd . He said that Numamarian was planning a fishing trip but it was not for another week or two away ,he did notice that all of Mumamarian's fishing gear was gone too . <br>
<br>
I'm not sure how much I trust this guy yet ,or if he is telling me the trueth or no , so I will be checking into some of the things he had said .<br>

Could Zarius and Numamarian have gone fishing and not told anyone ??, personally I dont think so !!! <br>

I will make a sacrifice to the great Cazic Thule and I will ask for some answers .If none can be found then I shall call upon the darkness and summon forth the most evil and vile cratures possible and I will hunt down all that appose BC and cause great pain ..I will become a evil that the world has not seen in many a year this I do swear .....<br>

The winds slowly subsided and he continued his awkward climb across the dizzying chasm of the Hole. No man could survive that fall that lay below him, so he moved as quickly as he thought the precariously fastened rope would allow. Finally, he reached the small, solitary ledge that rested on the far side of the chasm, over looking the hidden entrance to the citty of Paineel.<br>
<br>
Fergussen had sent one more message to Thorvan, meerly stating that his agents had found out nothing more and that the trail was growing more and more dim. He knew better then to tell his friend what he intended to do.<br>
<br>
Slowly his breath came back to him and the dizzying feeling of vertigo subsided with the earth firmly under his feet again. In front of him sat a small alter, carved with symbols and writings of a time long ago. The wind seemed to die down as a icy voice whispered &quot;Why dost thou disturb us?&quot; what seemed like millions of other voices resounded the question, adding in their ownn sentiments.....&quot;why can not we suffer in peace?&quot;, &quot;make the pain end&quot; and so on and so forth. <br>
<br>
The voices forced their way into the rangers mind. Slowly he sank to a knee under the force of them...but refused to give in. Shakily, he spoke... &quot;I have come to seek a favor from you. I have come seeking the aid of the spirit of pain and suffering.&quot;<br>
<br>
The voices receeded from his mind...and a form slowly took shape next to the alter of Innoruk. &quot;You know the price to be paid for such as this that you ask of us mortal?&quot;<br>
<br>
Fergussen grimaced, but nodded. &quot;I do, and am willing to pay. Will you answer my question?&quot;<br>
<br>
The form ran its hand over the alter, and two shining mithril chalices appeared. &quot;First the payment, and then the answer mortal. Give to us of your essence so that the dark lord may be appeased....and we shall guide you on your path.&quot;<br>
<br>
The creature reached out and took Fergussen by his wrists, he did not struggle. It felt as if thousands of hands gripped him, as if the countless souls that made up the embodiment of pain and suffering were not in front of him as one single individual. Stabs of pain shot Fergussen's arms as the wraith placed his wrists above the chalice's. Slowly, his life's blood and energy poured out of the wounds in his wrists filling the chalices to overflowing.<br>
<br>
The wraith of pain and suffering released his arms then and the wounds slowly stopped their bleeding. Fergussen hastily wrapped the wounds to staunch them closed. The wraith turned to him and spoke in its haunting voice once more. &quot;Innoruk shall be pleased......what is thine question mortal?&quot;<br>
<br>
Fergussen spoke without hesitation, &quot;Where can I find the missing leader of the Blood Circle, Zarius Mistwalker.&quot; He spoke not another word. When dealing with a creature such as this, it was best to keep the questions simple and direct, less they expect further payment. <br>
<br>
Were Thorvan here, he would be beside himself with anger. For a shaman to deal with spirits such as these, there was much less danger. They were trained to do such. As a ranger, Fergussen dealt with spirits on a daily basis, but they were much different. The spirits of nature had no individuality to them, they were all encompassing of there aspect and held both peace and malice within them. None the less, from all he had learned from the large barbarian whom he called brother, Fergussen knew that he placed his own spirit at eternal risk by what he did now. <br>
<br>
The wraith chuckled in its myriad voices. One of the goblets disappeared from the altar. The wrait lifeted the other and dumped its contents into Fergussen's hands. A blood red stone was all that came out. &quot;If you wish to find this Zarius Mistwalker, simply find the other chalice. To the Plain of Hate you must travel. The master awaits your arrival Stormcaller, he awaits it very much.&quot; With that the spirit disipated, fleeing back into the winds that echoed through the chasm of the Hole. <br>
<br>
Fergussen stared at the Soulstone for a long time. His wrists throbbed from his wounds and he knew that these would leave more scars to remind him of the past. He had helped to interfere with many of Innoruk's dark schemes before, and had dispatched of many of his servants. The old blind seer who lived in the plains of karana had warned him he would come to terms with the dark god someday. The spirits of the wind had spoken to him of a blade which he would wield to battle the dark one.<br>
<br>
Slowly and cautiously, Fergussen Stormcaller began his treacherous climb back across the chasm. There would be time for all of that in the future. In his heart, a small part of him yearned to return to the forests and to distance himself far from the lord of hate's influence. Many a time in his youth the ranger had nearly been consumed by the flame of hatred while he waged his personal war against the gnolls of blackburrow. But that was behind him now.<br>
<br>
There was no turning back anymore, Fergussen realized. He had come to far to stop now. Besides, he had made promises...and he intended to keep them.<br>
<br>
................................<br>
deep in the plain of hate, Innoruk tasted of the blood which filled his favorite chalice and savored the taste of fear, hatred, and nobility which mingled throughout it. An evil grin crossed his face and his laughter filled his courtroom. <p><center><img src="http://www.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/84/1899584.jpg"></center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ufergussen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>fergussen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0> at: 6/5/01 1:32:28 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1E1E1E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/udohpazxorbelbeeb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dohpaz Xorbelbeeb</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 252<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/5/01 10:17:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclefrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.technodium.net/ubb/userimages/dbz5.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guild Quest</span><hr size=1> Deep inside the bowels of Ak'Anon there was a light.

<br>
Sitting at the desk in the room barely able to read the tomes of arcane knowledge scattered around the study, Dohpaz was silently learning ancient magicks that were lost from long ago.<br>
<br>
He had learned about the incident in the Hole and was now directing his attention to the Plane of Hate. Sure he had been there numerous times but he had to cram even more information in his head to prepare for the journey that was going to take place in a few days.<br>
<br>
He practiced night and day to get all his spells right. He even went in search of new spells so that he may be able to become even more powerful.<br>
<br>
But, alas going to the Plane of Hate would require more than his few friends. He would have to bring a whole army of people to claim that place and maybe have a chance to find the long lost Zarius.<br>

Let us all pray that we will emerge victorious.<br>

Deep into the fastness of the trees, she followed the whispering call, ignoring the path. Happily she let the forest sounds wash the tension and stress of the past few weeks away.  <br>
A snapped branch and scuffled footfall broke the stillness of the evening and she whirled, hand on swordhilt and ready to defend herself.<br>
Fergussen! With shock she took in the ranger's haggard appearance.  The trail-stained and torn vest, the sunken hollows in his eyes and the pinched look around his lips spoke of a horrendous trial of the spirit. What could possibly make Fergussen weary enough to stumble on a path he was able to run blindfolded? The feeling of forboding returned, twofold.  Then, her searching eyes spotted the blood-soaked rags around his wrists.  <br>
With a cry, she ran forward and took his hands into hers.  A brief, but fervent prayer to the Mother yielded that familar warmth and when she took her hands away, the bleeding gashes on his wrists were healed, fading to thin, white lines that in a few minutes would cease to exist at all.  Another prayer and some of the weariness lifted from his shoulders.<br>
He gave her a tired smile and offered to escort her back to Blood Circle's guild hall.<br>
On the way back, she listened to his story with a sinking heart.  The Plane of Hate!  For a moment, she was ready to charge off in rightious anger and wreak vengance upon those who brought harm to her new family; then common sense took over again.  Centuri shook her head. Her skills were insufficient.  At best, she would only get herself killed.  At worst, her inadequacies would take the lives of others as they tried to protect her.  She would not be able to go with the others to rescue Zarius.<br>
<br>
She left Fergussen at the door to the hall.  There would be others wanting to hear his tale.  Thorvan would most likely have a few choice words for the ranger about him endangering himself.<br>
<br>
She turned down the long, dark hallway leading to the armory, pausing in her room only long enough to select a whetstone, rag and a bottle of oil.  The armory door creaked in protest as she hauled it open.  The glitter of steel in the lantern light was a familiar and comforting sight.  As comforting in its own way as the deep forest.  For the rest of the evening and through tomorrow, she would sharpen weapons and check armor.  She made a mental note to check with the spell-casters to ensure they had all the components for their spells.<br>
 Her brothers and sisters would go into battle as well-prepared as she could make them.  As she worked, Centuri prayed that her efforts would keep most of them from dying.<br>

Fergussen, my Master bids you to come more often, something about the taste of pine needles and forest dew... can't see it though, I perfer much more the blood brewed in Felwithe.  Alas, Hate.  Interesting, for once I'm filled with an uncomfortable feeling that I could attribute to the dread I see in my victims eyes... not a place for a quiet &quot;picnic&quot; that Centuri always spoke of...<br>

It appears as if Itno is now alone in discovering our mutual enemy...perhaps it is time that I return from the solace I once sought and re-assume my birthright in order that our hapless mage might live again.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;The continual sword to shield strikes pound a discordant cadence that rings throughout the Halls of the Dead.  Soulshiver smiles, a truly horrific sight and one not often seen, as for the first time he understands the often expressed and more often ignored pleas of the Necromatic Guild's desire to seperate their chambers of Dark Arcane study from the practice grounds of young Knights in training.  With an audible sigh, Soulshiver re-collects himself and ponders anew the murders he has just commited.  The meditation does not come easily, for these murders had held a different feel and have shaken the core of the dedicated Knight sworn to blood.  He attempts to recapture the events that led to the life that he drank and the blood that he spilt in Innoruuks dread place of worship.  **&quot;Ssss-Soulshiver-rr?&quot; stammered the novice, &quot;S-sir?&quot; With a shock, Soulshiver came to his senses, &quot;My....sincere...apologies, young one.&quot;  With a grimace that tried to be a smile the novice stopped rubbing blood back to his throat and tried to look brave despite having been suspended in the air by a not fully awake Knight of Shadows who was but moments before lying prone and oblivious to any sound or touch. &quot;It has been some time since I've been able to catch some sleep...&quot;, Soulshiver said wrly. &quot;Understood, Dark One, forgive me for interupting your much needed rest&quot;, said the young novice with a voice filled with hero-worship.  Soulshiver inwardly sighed as he sought to somehow bring this young one to his conclusion, &quot;The intrusion, I'm sure, will be worth it.  Why then, would you be so willing to put your life in danger?&quot;  The novice gulped anew and quickly offered, &quot;The Priests of Hate are expecting a new shipment of Fier'dal slaves arriving from Faydwer and have requested the Hall of Dead's help in seeing them transfered....uh...safely from the hands of the Orcs to the examining pits.&quot;  Soulshiver grim visage turned more grim and the room dropped several degrees.  Noticing that his life was quickly approaching its critical end the novice quickly added, &quot;Master Dvrix knows that such duty is far below your station, Dark One, however your brother, Tyvlain, is among the Tier'dal escorts and has asked for you specifically.&quot;  The name of his brother took Soulshiver aback and the shock caused him to stop the incantation that would have stolen the novices strength.  Seeing his opprotunity, the novice started to edge for the door. &quot;Young one, tell Dvrix, that I will accept this duty, however he owes me a bottle of Rivervale's finest.&quot;  Soulshiver smiled as the novice fled after a hasty bow. &quot;Tyvlain...hmm...&quot;. ** &lt;&lt;Soulshiver shakes his head. No, no, further than that&gt;&gt; **Soulshiver does not offer a smile or any indication of greeting despite his brothers best efforts to garner any.  &quot;By the Gods these Orcs stink, how you put up with them is beyond me Tyvlain&quot;, Soulshiver said in his best Orcish.  None of the orcs hesitated or looked up from their work unloading the slaves as they swallowed the insult, trembling in their fear.  &quot;Now, now Soulshiver, let us be civil&quot;, Tyvlain said with his trademark grin.  &quot;Slaving his hardly civil, Tyvlain, and especially so when coupled with this vermin&quot;, Soulshiver replied sharply and  puncuated it by a kick to the green back side of an Orc wearing Crushbone colors.  &quot;Bah, it appears as if you were not as successful as you'd hoped Tyvlain, just a bunch of weakend gnomes, dwarves, and brownies.  Dvrix told me of some Fier'dal...&quot;  Tyvlain, smiling again, &quot;Ah, it was rumored that you've seen quite a bit of Fier'dal lately, Soul, and rumors upon rumors that you've aligned yourself with others than those of our...how should you say...Dark Persuasion?&quot;  Soulshiver hands tightend on the haft of his Wurmslayer, turning the knuckles white.  &quot;Tyvlain, brother, you tread on ground that will be not your liking.&quot;  Tyvlain smiled with an even larger grin, &quot;So it is true, Mother will not take this news lightly.  Soul, Father was right, you were meant to be a Knight despite what Mother had said, you haven't an aristocratic bone in your body.  You are an open book...Still I perfer it that way, it simply means that I will be the next Duke of the Dark all the more sooner.... upon your demise, of course.&quot;  Soulshiver, had long since stopped listening to his brothers common litany as he noticed for the first time the promised Fier'dal stepping onto the shadowed dock.  They were ragged, wasted, starved and half-dead, yet hauntlngly familiar.  The male High Elf, even in his dazed condition took great pains to see that the female made it to the docks with safety.  Tyvlain, seeing his immediate charges landed, tossed a bag of coins carelessy to the Orcan Captain, &quot;Your payment, Grloss, a pleasure doing business with you.&quot;  Grloss unashamedly opened the bag and upon veiwing its contents smiled.  In his guttural tounge he called his men and together made their way out of the dank caves from the underbelly of Neriaks 3rd Gate.** &lt;&lt;Further,,,&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
**In Innoruuk's Dread halls the slaves were seperated as to their importance of study.  The Fier'dal had captured the interest some Masters of the Dark Arts and they had sequestered them at the pinnacle of the Dark Temple.  Soulshiver had already said good-bye to his power craved brother and was heading back to the Hall when he heard horrific screams in the High Elven tongue raining down from the Temple.  Such screams were common here, but for some inexplicable reason, Soulshiver had to investigate.  There was something too familiar about that couple.  With little effort Soulshiver bounded upstairs unimpeded by the many guards stationed along the way.  Upon reaching the doors, the Skeletal pets of the Masters inside the room stood as silent sentinals as Soulshiver tried the door and found it un-locked.  Inside was an image that remains hard to re-conjure.  Upon a table laid the male Elf, with closer inspection it was easily apparent to see that he had once been a Paladin of Tunare.  Tunare's bright blazon was clear to see upon his heaving chest.  The female Elf was on a rack upright on a wall with a gnomish appearing device on her head that was enabling her to heal her companion.  It seemed odd to Soulshiver that he would be in so much pain, for it was more apparent than the male's paladinship that she was a Cleric of Tunare of significant skill.  It was then that he noticed the Necromancers taking turns on the male deliberately casting new found spells to judge their effects on a reliable continually healthy victim.  Scribes copied with much interest as each spell was catalogued.  The female form already impassioned by the torturing of her compainion begin to kick and cry out while at the same time growing noticeably weaker and weaker.  The prayers of healing were coming much slower and with much less fervor. It was obivious to Soulshiver now that the device placed on her enabled her to convert her own lifeforce for mana and she was dying as she continued to struggle to save the hapless paladin.  She then at a moment of infinite weakness said, &quot;I'm sorry,  my love, I can do no more...I shall wait for thee at Tunare's feet.&quot;  With a final momentous effort she prayed her last prayer and the chains once held taught with anger, hung slack with the wieght of her slack body.  The male, to his credit, ripped his right arm free mancle, chain, and all.  With an anguished cry, he whipped the chain with maniacal force cleaving completly the skull of the Necromancer nearest him. Almost as immediantly, the crazed, demonized pets of the Dark Masters burst through the door and swarmed the male in a frenzy and flurry that few can survive. Remarkably, calling upon the wrath of Tunare and weilding the chain with remarkable skill he fought and slew 2 of the 3 pets before succumbing to the onslaught of the battering undead hands and the dreaded chants of the Dark Masters.  Upon his dying breath, with a smile to the likes Soulshiver had never seen, he whispered, &quot;My wife, my Kannushi, my Centuri, I am coming...&quot;<br>
<br>
It was then that Soulshiver realized this cosmic irony.  Here, laid to rest at last, was the answers for all for which he'd been seeking.  Without an uttered cry, Soulshiver tore the undead monstrosity before him apart.  The pet, for the which I still have no explanation, looked surprised as it died.  The two remaing Dark Masters, looked almost white as they realized that they too would be dying today.  Out of Arcane essense, they could only scream as Soulshiver drank deeply their stolen life-forces and watch their headless corpses sink to the ground from the vantage point that Soulshiver's Wurmslayer had provided them.  The scribe, only wet-himself in fear and did not think to beg for mercy until after he had been tossed from the Temple's lofty station.  Soulshiver, once again in control of himself hastily gathered himself into the shadows and made ready his alibi.  His brother was wrong, he could play the game of the aristocrats, and he'll prove it.**  <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Master Dvrix muttered curses echo'ed again on the training courtyards re-awakening Soulshiver from his trance.  Quietly, he shouldered his pack, shield, and Wurmslayer determined to get answers.  For the one thing Soulshiver remembered most vividly, was as his heavy blade swung in its deadly arc to take the life of the last necromancer, the Dark master whipered, &quot;Blood Circle will fall, Soulshiver...and it will be accomplished by one whom ye call Brother.&quot;<br>
