Her name was Lena McLinsbane. It was said that she could best any other woman with steel. It was even rumored she could best any man as well. (those who dared face her). Lena traveled to the far reaches of Norrath, some say she wore strange crystalline armors and used a strange blade that had no equal. Many called it the Light Saber of Zallon. All who saw Lena stride proudly by, parted the way for her; her legend grew so that no one would challenge her in combat or otherwise.<br>
          On one of Lena's few trips back to her homeland, the frozen north, a withered old Barbarian Oracle stopped her. He placed his hands upon her stomach and began to mutter to himself. <br>
        Lena said, in a deep angered voice, 'Old fool, remove your hands from me at once or I'll remove your hands from you followed by what life you've left.&quot; <br>
         The old man giggled softly to himself, and spoke from deep with in as his eyes rolled back into their sockets, the shamanistic figure began to rise from the soil. From deep with in the figure, a spirit's voice followed by its presence arose from the old man. <br>
         The spirit spoke to Lena. &quot;Lena McLinsbane, feared warrior of the north, protector of Halas, I am the Heyokah Elder Spirit that inhabits this Northman known as Thalger. We the heyokah seldom show ourselves to the brutal warriors, but you Lena, you are different. Inside your womb you carry the Heyokah egg of the fearless shaman. You were not supposed to be granted the powers of heyokah birth, but our sworn enemy, Miragul has imprisoned our last hope at defeating him in the womb of a non-heyokah barer.  In doing so he believes we are defeated in that our savior spiritcaller cannot be born.  We the Heyokah believe we can transplant the other half of the fearless spiritcaller directly to the egg and we might still be saved from Miragul.  We the heyokah ask you, oh great warrior to submit to combination of heyokah halves to give birth to our greatest spirit caller ever. What say you great warrior?&quot; <br>
        Lena was taken back by the spirits tale, she responded slowly, but forcefully,&quot; I am a master of blades; I can spot the weakest point on an enemy and strike with no equal in battle. I see no use for the weaker spirit callers that crutch themselves on the Tribunal and; obviously, also on you apparitions. What is given me I will keep. Now, be off with you before I prove myself in battle once more.&quot; <br>
     With these words the great Heyokah returned deep with in Thalger, returning him to normal. Thalger shook his head trying to reorient himself, after a few moments he looks at Lena and begins his tale........<br>

The fear took over my every muscle and forced me to retreat.  On one occasion impeticular I was leading a group of adventurers into the dank lair of the dragon Trakanon.  This is before the sleeper challenged Trak to the duel that brought about the demise of his living body.  As I called the charge, I ran head-long into battle but upon the sight of Trakanon, I froze.  I had no real qualm against the dragon, my quest was one of greed.  The lore of his hoarded treasures lured my party into his lair.  The Great Heyoka that now inhabits me tells me this loss of nerve was actually my heyokah blood taking over and not allowing me to strike out at an oponent that posed me no threat until I attacked.  The heyokah assured me saying that I was Thalger, unkillable amongst the Heyokah;however, this did nothing to curtail my fear and I retreated. Leaving my every party member to die at the hands of Trakanon.  Days later, Trakanon accepted the challenge issued by the sleeper. Whilst the fight was going on, I slunk into the lair of the dragon and carried my comrades corpses out to a sacred spot where I burried them, with my blade, The Light Saber of Tallon in the area known as Chardok.  I believe if you notice, it was the sister blade to your Light Saber of Zallon. Anyway, I digress, their blood stains my tunic and my memory to this day.  I am unkillable, yet I fled like the lowly nature lover of Tunare.  I cannot die by the hands of a mortal; however, I can pass my skills on to a new generation of northman. I wish to do this with the heyokah egg of the fearless spiritcaller that has been placed inside you.  I was once a mighty warrior, steel of skin, iron of nerve and deadly in battle.  Now I practice the arts of the shaman but the heart of an insturment of death still beats violently with in my chest.  Please woman I beg you take my gift so your child, our child will be all that we will never nor could we ever be.&quot;   Lena sees the pain in his eyes and for the first time in her life, she feels compassion.  She realizes the power that can be harnesed through the joining of essences.  &quot;Halas will always have a protector. One of leathal might and pure heart.&quot; Thalger chimes in, &quot;He will have the wisdom to know when to strike and the power to remove his target from existance when he does strike.&quot;  They both nod in agreement.  &quot;For the good of Halas.&quot; says Lena.  &quot;Aye, and the good of Norrath,&quot; retorts Thalger.  Lena signals her consent and Thalger summons forth a great wind blowing from above, the wind begins to take form around him, a blue swirling cloud engulfed his body.  Then suddenly Thalger grabs hold of Lena's bare stomach and forces his essence into her womb, leaving Thalger's body an epmty shell only occupied by the heyokah great spirit.  The part that counts was now reforming in the womb of Lena McLinsbane, Fearless Hero of Halas. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ufawkesdixon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fawkes Dixon</A> at: 12/8/01 4:29:03 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1E1E1E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ufawkesdixon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fawkes Dixon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/7/01 7:58:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclefrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Birth of  a Legend</span><hr size=1> Many moons had passed since the joining of the essences and Lena continued with her life as usual.  Some things had changed, she felt the calling of Thalger almost constantly.  Thought she was with him for only a short time, she missed him for some reason even though he seemed in the back of her mind at all times speaking in whispers.  It was during her thirteenth month of pregnancy that her stomach began to show her secret.  She was at a great disadvantage now, due to her increased weight and the motherly need to protect her unborn child.  The dark followers of Innoruuk siezed their opportunity to rid Norrath of it finest hero.  Innoruuk sent down from his plane three of his chosen disciples.  These dark elves were of different stock than most.  They were equal in stature to the the mighty Lena and it is rumored that they had the power to kill with a touch, this power imbued upon them from The Prince of Hate Himself, Innoruuk.  Thalger's whispers in the back of Lena's head became shouts and screams, pleas for her to run, for her to fall away from this battle.  Lena;however, could not retreat from battle, it wasnt in her. It wasnt allowed.  Thalger knew that they were coming and warned Lena, but neither knew when or how they planed to attack.  During Lena's 19th and final month of pregnancy she decided to make the journey back to her homeland for the birth of her child.  In the mighty ocean that separated Odus from Antonica, Lena sailed onward.  Lena begain to sense the direction of the ship was changing, as though a new course had been input.  As she turned to speak with the Captain of the vessel she was engaged by one of the mighty Disciples. His death hand missed for the most part, doing minimal damage before Lena unleased all of the fury in her in one mighty fell strike severing the Disicple's head.  The other two Chosen of Hate did not falter in their quest to slay the mighty Barbarian.  They lunged as one. Lena dodged one and repostled his attack fatally; however the third touch of death landed square on Lena's forehead simultaneously she releaved him of his head.  The touch of hate flung Lena from the boat and set her body adrift on the stalwart seas.  Days had passed since Lena had been mortally wounded when she floated upon a small island.  A dwarven male noticed her near-lifeless body float up on shore.  The wee man ran as fast as his midget legs could carry him to Lena's side.  The dwarf said, &quot;you..you are the mighty Lena McLinsbane, what manner of creature has done this to you, mighty warriror?&quot;  Lena fought back the pain and uttered, &quot;Innoruuk.&quot;  The small man couldn't believe the mighty warrior could be felled by anything, even a god.  Some even believed Lena to be a god, but now she lies motionless on a sandy beach near death.  Lena produces her mighty Lightsaber from its scabbard one last time and bade the dwarf to remove her chest plate.  The dwarf did so begrudgingly.  Lena grited her teeth and drove herself into a berserkers frenzy and slashed her own stomach wide open.  With this mighty strike she dropped her blade and plucked a male Barbarian from her open womb. The child was not breathing.  The touch of hate had killed the small Barbarian that had so much promise to the salvation of Norrath.  Lena handed the still born child over to the dwarf and began to cry tears of unmatched pain and suffering and in doing so the oceans tides rose and swollowed the weeping Barbarian into the depths never to be seen again. Though still stories are told of the only time the mighty warrior ever wept and of how her tears enraged the mighty ocean.  The dwarf, confused and scared, scouped up the mighty blade and with child in arm ran to his hut. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ufawkesdixon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fawkes Dixon</A> at: 12/8/01 4:36:42 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#353535><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ufawkesdixon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fawkes Dixon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/7/01 8:38:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclefrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Birth of  a Legend</span><hr size=1> Denken the wee dwarf, baby and lightsaber in tow, ran for his hut.  Denken knew that if anyone could help this young child it would be his friend, Jhassad.  Jhassad was one of the more influential clerics in the land of Norrath. He was also known to be in constant contact with the god, Tunare.  Denken arrived at his hut and threw open the door, panting for breath. &quot;Jhassad,&quot; wheezed the dwarf, &quot;you must heal this child, it's life is now beyond the healing of Brell, its life falls to you Holy Cleric.&quot;  Jhassad quickly but calmly removed the floor board he was standing on.  He reached into the hole and extracted a mace of some sort. &quot;What manner of weapon is that and what do ye plan to do with it?&quot; questioned Denken.  It is my latest project, I have been building it using the knowledge of Tunare as my guide. &quot;What does it do?&quot; asked Denken.  &quot;No time for expainations now, Denken.&quot; and with that Jhassad said a silent prayer and the small Barbarian baby was bathed in blue light.  The baby twitched and then began to breathe normally.  He breathed, he did not cry.  &quot;Ah HA,&quot; exclaimed the two over joyed men.  &quot;Now, Denken, where did you find this small Barbarian and that light saber?&quot;  Denken replied, &quot;Lena McLinsbane bore this child with her dying breaths on the sea shore. This lightsaber was her weapon.&quot;  &quot;Did you say, Lena?!&quot;  &quot;Aye, none other than. Why?&quot;<br>
It is rumored that she was to bare a child with unequalled power to protect all of Norrath.&quot;  The two gazed in wonder upon the child.  Denken realized what he must do immediatly.  He scooped up the child, boarded his boat, and headed for Antonica.  He arrived In Qeynos later that afternoon. Denken began to walk toward the frozen North, toward Halas.  The Barbarians there would know how best to raise such a child.  In the dark lair of the Gnolls, Denken had a chance meeting with a Barbarian of the shadows.  The Barbarian was of the White Rose Clan in Halas and Denken entrusted the child to the rogue. Patchem Stachem was the rogue's name.  Denken bid Patch fairwell and began his journey back to his island.  Patch headed toward his home in Halas as a proud new papa.<br>

Most text's begin his story at the age of 4 or 5 when he was just a tiny lad, no bigger than a gnome.  Patch tought him the ways of the rogue, how to use the smallest shadows to hide with-in and stike an opponent as soon as its back was turned.  The child was a quick learner, in fact he was so adept at the skills Patch taught him, Patch decided to name the boy after one of his own rogue hero's as a child, Darien Fawkes.  Said to be a rogue of unmatched skill in theivery and piercing.  It was said that with a slight of hand Darien could take your treasures and with a slight of blade he could take your life.  The boy wore his new name very proudly.  The other children of Halas shortened his name from Darien Fawkes to simply, Fawkes.  Growing up with the rest of the Barbarian children proved to be an ease for Fawkes, things that made other childeren wet their cloth pants, Fawkes stood strong, unshakeably strong.  These acts earned him his other nickname, one that he proudly shared with his mother, even if he knew not why: Fearless.  Fawkes' father, Patch, was secretly dating Lysbith McMarrin, guild leader of the Steel Warriors of Halas. Their love affair was forbidden by the social code of the land, Rogues and Warriors didnot mix, but in her several visits to Patch's shanty in the back of Halas, Lysbith saw the undying spirit in Fawkes that was the thing of legend some years before in the Mighty warrior Lena McLinsbane.  Lysbith, with Shammus Fellagan, and other members of the Tribunal and Wolves of the North met one night in secret to discuss the prodigy child.  They all kicked around the idea that this child was the only child born of Fearless warrior and Unkillable Shamanic Heyokah but all were afraid to come out and say it until finally, Renth McMannus stepped forward and in an all knowing voice, &quot;I believe the child to be the only born son of Lena McLinsbane and Thalger, and I have the perfect way to test the young child.&quot;  All other members of this meeting leaned a tuned ear to Renth, and he continued to speak, &quot;If he is the person we think him to be he should easily be able to kill Paglan and obtain his symbol of The Wolves.&quot;  Lysbith spoke up, &quot;You mean the Lang...&quot; and was cut off by Renth, &quot;I do.  The langseax of the Wolves.&quot;  Lysbith sternly rejected the idea, &quot; I believe we should send him out to gather orc bracers or gnoll teeth as a preliminary quest.&quot;  Renth said, &quot;If he is who we believe him to be, he will slay Paglan with ease no matter his inexperience.&quot;  Shammus spoke up, &quot; I will send my brother, Jenxis, to silently watch over Fawkes, to keep him alive if he is not the protector we believe him to be.&quot;  Renth happily replied, &quot; Then it is agreed, we will send the boy out tomorrow in search of Paglan and Jenxis will watch him and protect him if the peril is too great.&quot;  The group agrees and disbands. By Dawns first light Renth and Lysbith along with Shammus and others awaken Fawkes and begin to tell him the story of the North Wolven Symbol.  After little debate Fawkes agrees to to journey.  They give him a cloth tunic, some rations, a small light to guide him through the dungeon of Black Burrow, and Short Sword.  The young adventurer waves goodbye to Patch and heads off on his journey.  Fawkes is led to a wild-eyed Barbarian warrior that has tamed a large polar bear, Tundra Jack.  Jack points young Fawkes toward the open fields of the Karana's.  While Fawkes is making this long journey Jinxis is in constant contact with Halas reporting the young ones status.  One night, while Fawkes was away, Patch became very lonely and snuck into the Pit of Doom to speak with Lysbith.  The two talked till the wee hours of dawn and Patch began to walk back to his hut, lazily he quit sneaking and stopped hiding in shadows.  The old rogue was quickly over thrown by one of the more brutal young warriors and slashed and left for dead.  Meanwhile, Fawkes was hot on the trail of Paglan in the Karana's, oblivious to the slaying of his father.  Fawkes caught up with Paglan not long after he reached the Karana's he jumped on him and took him by suprise just like Patch had taught him as a child.  But contrary to Patch's teaching Fawkes didnt evade into the shadows, he faced the elder warrior face to face and blade to blade.  The battle was of epic proportions and lasted for hours on end. Neither warrior willing to yield, until finally Fawkes saw his chance, and like a true warrior struck the weakest portion of Paglan's defence, where he could do the most damage.  THe killing blow was instant.  Shocked and in utter amazement, Jinxis gated back to Halas to tell of what he saw, even though he wasnt sure he believed it himself.  He told the other joint council members of the mighty warrior and his fearless approach of a much more powerfull enemy and told of how so many blows should have stuck the death shot but fell harmlessly to the side or did little damage.  &quot;I believe this is the proof we were all looking for,&quot; said Renth, &quot;I move that from now on Fawkes get special training, special housing, and the best armor and weapons we can provide for him.&quot;  The decision was unanimous.  Halas would now devote its existance to creating the most powerful warrior ever, and the legend of &quot;Fearless&quot; Fawkes was born in the Icy North. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ufawkesdixon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fawkes Dixon</A> at: 12/8/01 4:52:05 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#353535><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ufawkesdixon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fawkes Dixon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/7/01 10:08:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclefrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Birth of  a Legend</span><hr size=1> Upon reaching the gates of Halas the young warrior was greated with numerous well wishers and fame leeches, Fawkes strode through them all as thought he were walking on air.  Fawkes had the world by the tail, Norrath was becoming his play ground very quickly.  Fawkes went straight to his hut to see Patch and show him the grand new blade he had obtained, The Langseax of The Wolves. The blade was the symbol of the Wolves of the North and was imbued with special powers. Fawkes rounded the front door and exclaimed, &quot;Patch, I'm back and look at the blade I have looted!&quot;  Fawkes' exhuberation was met with only stagnant air and silience.  He hurried to the back room of the hut, and found Patch's decaying corpse laying on his bed. Fawkes was enraged.  He took off Patch's eye patch kissed it and swore a blessing of revenge to his father.  Fawkes walked with determined purpose into the Pit of Doom to meet with the Joint Triumvirate of Halas, they welcomed him with well wishes and congratulations.  Fawkes stared into each of their eyes with a stone gaze that set each member slightly uneased. &quot;Fawkes you have proven yourself worthy to join our Triumviarate. What say you Fawkes&quot;  said Reth.  &quot;I dont care about you're damn Triumviate!&quot; exclaimed Fawkes.  &quot;I just want to know which dead man was behind the slaying of my father while I was away.&quot;  The members spoke in mummbled whispers back and forth amongst themselves. &quot;We know nothing of this slaying, Fawkes&quot; said Lysbith, &quot;Do you mean to tell us that Patchem Stachem the Rogue is dead?&quot;  Fawkes nods his head aggreaingly.  Out of the corner of his eye Fawkes noticed a lowly warrior slinking out of the pit and toward a stealthy get away. &quot;YOU THERE!!! STOP&quot; shouts Fawkes.  Fawkes takes off in a sprint after him. As he runs away Shammus wills Fawkes to move as the wolf and suddenly Fawkes speed is increased.  Fawkes over takes the young warrior easily and drives the NorthWolven Blade straight thrugh the heart of the assassin.  &quot;Why did you kill my father?&quot; Fawkes questions the dying man. Through gurggled bits of blood the man replys, &quot;He....was a... rogue.....ungh.&quot; and the man died.  Fawkes, having avenged his fathers death swiftly as he swore he would, assumes his place in front of the Triumvirate.  &quot;Fawkes, we re-extend our invitation into the Triumviate to you.&quot; Said Renth.Fawkes, pauses and takes a few breaths, seemingly deep in thought  &quot;I, Darien Fawkes, do accept your invitation into the Steel Warriors and will hold my place as  Wolf of the North on your triumvirate, but I will do so wearing the symbol of the rogue.&quot; having said this Fawkes draws Patch's Dragoon Dirk from his belt and with a single thrust impales the Dirk deep into his right eye and then removes the dirk and places Patchem's eye patch over the new wound and walks away. His mysterious act leaves the entire room speachless. This act only added to the lore that was to be written about Darien Fawkes.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ufawkesdixon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fawkes Dixon</A> at: 12/8/01 4:56:25 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1E1E1E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ufawkesdixon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fawkes Dixon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/8/01 2:42:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclefrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Birth of  a Legend</span><hr size=1> In the days to come after Fawkes' induction into the Triumvirant many things began to change around Halas.  Fawkes,having been raised by the rogues and now holding a seat on the Triumirant, began to unify Halas like never before.  The Rogues of the White Rose opened up their vault to the rest of Halas as a sign of good faith on Fawkes' request.  This act opened new sources of trade through Halas to the rest of Norrath.  Legions of new recruits had amassed in the training guilds of Halas to work on their skills and grow up just as the mighty warrior had done.  Fawkes had brought about a new Golden Age to Halas.  Trade routes opened to Qeynos and through Qeynos then the rest of Norrath was unfolded to the Northmen. As years went by Fawkes aged and grew wiser and stronger than any warriors of equal level.  An emptiness still filled the mighty warrior as he slept in his fathers house.  It is around this time in Fawkes' life that he lead the raid on the Ice Goblin infested Permafrost Cavern  with the aid of his faithful legions that had amassed.  This raid was an over-whelming success.  Casualties were minor and no comrades were left to rot on the battle field.  After the success of the Permafrost purge, Halas bestowed a new suit of mighty armor upon Fawkes.  Now when the warrior would enter battle all would know his approach, horns in the air and shiney blue armor encased The Fearless Barbarian.  After donning this new suit of armor, Fearless Fawkes traded in his Northern Wolven Blade for the lighter and faster Crystalized Blade and the Short Sword of the Yakesha.  Both baldes of carnage and death.  Now with peace in mind and death in his eye, Fawkes became a nomad and left his Snowcoverd Northern Home and it was uncertain whether or not he would ever return.  Fawkes ran into many small Barbarian camps along his journies, in all cases his reputation preceeded him.  All doors were opened for him, mobs sood aside or paid with their blood.  When Fearless made his way to the Continent of the Lizards, he met a worthy appoinent.  The giants of the frontier.  These giants towered over Fawkes. At last, our hero could sink his blade into a worthy apponent. As Fawkes scouted the mountains of the frontier he crossed pathes with many a journey man,who, like himself, wished to put steel to the giants. On one such occassion Fawkes met a warrior hearted man of magics.  This man was Zed Dixon, the cleric of Tunare.  Fawkes became fast friends with the cleric, who like Fawkes had lost everyone he held dear.  The cleric often spoke of his father, Jhassad Dixon and the time he saved the prodigy child of the Northmen with his mighty Holy Water Sprinkler.  Instantly Fawkes understood the stories Patch had often told him as a boy of his mother and true father.  The stories werent lies afterall.  None the less this was no time to concern oneself of the trivial. Combat is at hand.  Fawkes, his dear friend Zed, and untested others had had enough of the giants.  It was time to raid and put an end to them once and for all.  As it had always been, soldiers blindly followed The Fearless One.  This day these soldiers were too green, untested and unable to perform.  The Giants all dead, save three were pulled to the outside of their unfinished fortress in the mountains.  All three recognized Fawkes as the Fearless Unkillable Heyokah Warrior.  They unleased their full fury upon him, but the mighty warrior stood strong and his warrior hearted cleric by his side feeding him blessings of Tunare. And Finally One Giant fell. But one of the two remaining discovered the other assailants that were attacking from afar.  This giant had wised up and immideatly killed a powerful mage. Druids, Wizards and others of the manald wars created mystical portals and left, all but Zed.  Retreating isnt in the warrior, he doesnt know how.  All he knows is death before dishonor, and dishonor is running away screaming blindly for help. Zed understood the code of the bladeslingers. He understood it all to well, his mother was a warrior of Qeynos and taught him much of his hand to hand and melee fighting abilities. Another Giant falls to the might. Only one left but Fawkes is injured bad, worse than he has ever been hurt before. He is covered in blood, dripping with blood. Mostly giant blood, some of his own others spots of fallen allies.  The spots help you remember, they help you concentrate, you focus on the weaknesses in the defense and let forth a mighty crippling blow to the ribs.  The giant and Fawkes are hurting and just before Fawkes falls, Zed deposits the last bit of his mana into Fawkes' life. Zed knew what that would do, he had a warriors heart, he understood the risk and knew the out come. The giant immediatly turned to Zed and laid him dead in a single blow to the head.  He knew he was going to die to save Fawkes, he gave his life knowingly and Fawkes never lets people down and there was no way he was going to start now and let Zed have died in vain.  There are different versions of this fight, none of which are remotely comprehensable, no one should be able to do that which they say Fearless Fawkes the unkillable did that day.  He reached deep within himself and pulled out a berzerkers frenzy like no other.  The giants armor didnt have chinks in it, there werent openings for a decisive slice, Fawkes saw every swing land true, the giant tried to run to no avail.  Fawkes just pointed out the internal organs of a giants in reverse alphabetical order until the over powering giant fell, face first on to the ground, for his eternal dirt nap.  Fawkes staggered to his friend's side, but alas he was no more.  Zed was a warrior with a weak spot for magic, a warrior none the less.  He understood what it means to be one, he proved it on the field that day.  Fawkes shouted at the top of his bruised lungs, &quot;I, Fearless Fawkes, shall from this day forth, be known as Fearless Fawkes Dixon, surname taken to honor the clan of Dixon, warrior hearted followers of Tunare.&quot; Immediatly, Fawkes took on the surname Dixon to honor both the Father that saved him at birth and the son that saved him in the fortress of the giants in the mountains of the frontier.  Henceforth he was called &quot;Fearless&quot; Fawkes Dixon the Unkillable Warrior of Halas, Wolf of the North.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ufawkesdixon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fawkes Dixon</A> at: 12/8/01 4:04:20 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#353535><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ufawkesdixon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fawkes Dixon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/8/01 3:59:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclefrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Birth of  a Legend</span><hr size=1> To Be Continued..... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1E1E1E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/uthorvan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thorvan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Gnoll Pup</span><br>  Posts: 679<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/9/01 9:46:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclefrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.bloodcircle.com/bcicon.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Birth of  a Legend</span><hr size=1> Holy Crap Fawkes...
