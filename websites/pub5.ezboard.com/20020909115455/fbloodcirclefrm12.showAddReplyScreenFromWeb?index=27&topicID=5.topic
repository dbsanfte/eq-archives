With an engery that hadn't been enjoyed in almost two weeks, Centuri hungerly opened her eyes to see her Guild, her Family, looking upon her with concern and love.  &quot;Centuri, you've come back to me&quot; Kannushi said in a rush, &quot;Oh, praise Tunare!! You are safe!!&quot;  Tears, unabashadly flowed, unchecked, unguarded, almost as if the tears themselved contained a type of absolution that brought with it the peace of knowing that a horrorific nightmare had been ended.  For many moments, the whole of Blood Circle surrounded their lost Sister, silently communicating their love for the newly found and the joy of knowing that she was Home.  Centuri, proudly, re-gained her feet.  Scars that would not be healed by a healer's touch were evident as if etched on her features.  She accepted her lost weapons with a nod of thanks from Fergussen.  With a mortal sigh, she asked, &quot;Where is Soulshiver?&quot;  None could meet her gaze, finally, Kannushi spoke, &quot;Sister, Soul is still in Neriak.  He said that it was necessary to tie up loose...ends.&quot;  Tears, welled in Centuri's eyes.  Not tears of fear, pity, or passion, but tears of rage.  &quot;You let my beloved convince you to let him stay?&quot;  Looks of concern seemed to shout back at Centuri...concern was not what she wanted....or needed.  &quot;You will take me to Neriak now!&quot; she uttered in a voice as still as death.  Syna, always wise, said in response, &quot;Centuri, his is a path he must walk alone.  Do not seek to alter his Fate.  Just as your Fate was to have you safe among us, it is Soulshiver's Fate to meet his Family, Neriak, and finally his own god...the God of Hate.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tyvlain whispered, &quot;Soulshiver, time to get up now!&quot;  Soulshiver, astonshing the gathered clerics and guards, stood up from the dead.  The gore and the ilk of the massacred sluiced off his armor as if a flood gate had been opened.  Soulshiver smiled grimly, &quot;Tyvlain, what an unpleasent surprise.  Fancy you here?&quot;  Tyvlain snorted in contempt, &quot;Sorry she wasn't here for the rescuing Soul, ya see, I like to keep my treasures in a far safer place than a Temple!&quot;  Soulshiver's wide grin shook Tyvlain's confidence momentarily.  Just as he was to inquire why his brother was smiling like fool despite his obvious failure to sercure his &quot;Love&quot;, a servant with the Dy'Truin crest upon his breast rushed, out of breath, into the room.  &quot;T-t-vlain, she is...gone.&quot;  The room seemed to shrink as the tension caused the temperature to drop several degree's.  &quot;Tryth, tell me carefully, that &quot;she&quot; is not Centuri.  The Fier'dal Paladin. My pet. My toy.  Tell me that you are reffering instead to my wife!&quot;  Tryth swallowed and stammered, &quot;Please m'Lord, I wan't there, I-I was just sent...I-I...&quot;  Tryth died looking into the eyes of his liege-lord.  &quot;Brother, with all of the men you've lost tonight...&quot; Soulshiver said with mock seriousness.  The look of pure hatred emanating from Tyvlain brought Soulshiver great satisfaction.  &quot;Soulshiver, you will die...&quot; Tyvlain brought his dagger in a deadly arc, barely perceptable due to the incredible speed and agility by which it was wielded; the dagger stopped, scant inches from Soulshiver's loudly beating heart.  &quot;My time has not yet arrived, Brother, soon enough, though, soon enough.  Be patient.&quot; Soulshiver turned and gazed upon his Mother.  &quot;Mother you are looking well,&quot; Soulshiver said dripping with sarcasm, &quot;it might do Tyvlain some good if you released him, he look as if he is about to pop.&quot;  The Mother of Soulshiver looked upon him with malice, &quot;Why did you involve the Council, Soulshiver?  This was a family matter!!&quot;  Tyvlain started to look desperate, his frozen form still shaped for murder.  With an impatient look the Mother of the Dy'Truin family released here youngest son from his invisible prison.  &quot;I've been directed to escort you both before the Dark Council.  Soulshiver, don't look so pleased, for I have it on good sources that you will not be given your Title, but instead called out in disgrace.  I've always known you would bring disgrace to us all.&quot;  The look of hate and malice twisted her beautiful feartures.  She uttered arcane magics and in a flash of brillant light, the three of them appeared before the Dark Council of Innoruuk.  It seemed as if every Noble house was present.  The looks of grim determination was on the face of the Eleven presiding members of the Council.  &quot;Soulshiver Dy'Truin, you stand before this Council on the very day you were to be named a member of it, with the incredible crime of treason.  The crowd gasped at this startling bit of news.  For they had been informed that something was afoot, but were not prepared for the trial of one of the Greatest Noble families of Neriak.  The crowd waited on baited breath with the expectation of watching a star fall at last to Norrath.  &quot;Soulshiver, you know how we will carry out these proceedings.  You'll will be placed under an enchantment that will enable all to see the Truth.  Thereby you will be judged for your crimes.  This is the justice of Innoruuk, if found guilty you...will...die.&quot;  Soulshiver, shivered, it was apparent to all that he seemed to collect himself, as if preparing for a duel that could result in death.  Soulshiver said softly, &quot;Seek not in me a traitor, my Brothers and Sisters.  For I have at long last discovered and accomplished my quest.  For I have learned what it is that keeps us burning with hate, envy, and greed.&quot;  The crowd began to mutter, obviously confused at Soulshivers response.  &quot;I have learned that we dance to a God who would have us believe that love is a weakness.   Yet therein, we may find greater strength and be a better people.&quot;  The crowd erupted with fury!! The shouts for Soulshivers death clammored about the Hall. &quot;Quiet!! Quiet!! The Council demands order!!&quot;, shouted Neriaks Champion.  Dark and silent messages where sent between the members of the Council.  Self-consiously, Tyvlain and Soulshiver's Mother stepped away from their Brother and Son as if for the first time they recognized for the first time some horror previously undiscovered.  &quot;Soulshiver, you mock this Council, your Family, your Race, yea, your very God!!&quot;  Soulshiver, shook his head and laughed gently, &quot;Good Braith, Innoruuk is no God of mine!  My soul was founded and tendered by the Mother of us all, yea, even Tunare.  We are, after all, her lost children.&quot;<br>
<br>
The crowd exploded, erupting like a volcano long over due for the destruction that was its due.  The guards faught valiantly to keep the mob at bay but it was apparent that they were going to lose this battle.  The Hall erupted into flames, many a dress and tunic was singed as the heat calmed the crowd into a hushed silence.  &quot;Soulshiver,&quot; Braith whispered, &quot;you have condemned yourself to an everlasting hell.  Tunare does not want you, you are Innoruuks forever.  However, instead of serving upon His Hate-filled courts, you will help provide the screams of terror that help soothe His soul.&quot;  It was apparent that Soulshiver had stopped heeding the words of the ancient councilman and it seemed that he was completly unaware of his surroundings.  He appeared to looking up to a point in the sky, a look of pure elation and rapture filled his visage.  The rapture soon became a longing so apparent that many a heart was rended as they, for the first time, witnessed a spectacle that seemed divine in nature.  Soulshiver returned his gaze upon the members of the Council and sweeping the faces of the crowd.  &quot;I go home now Brothers and Sisters, I go home.  Hail, Blood Circle!!  Hail, Tunare!!  Hail, Love!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Centuri woke later that night.  Upon her bed was a Rose.  A Rose that for her life-time, never wilted or diminished in its splendor.  And with the Rose was a whispered dream, &quot;My Light, My Light, My Light...I await thee.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thus ends the Annuals of Soulshiver Coeurdeglace<br>
<br>
May grace always be upon Blood Circle, may Norrath always provide an adventure, and may you all be ready for it!!<br>
<br>
