Not that he had really known a good night's sleep since the age of 12, two years before he began his training as a ranger. His mind drifted lazily back to those days, back to that more peaceful time. <br>
<br>
Sunlight and laughter, trees and games. Those are the memories that all should have of their childhood. Fergussen smiled and his eyelids drooped as he recalled those happy, happy days. As he drifted back to sleep his mind replayed the time he spent with his family in the forest's of the Jaggedpine. <br>
<br>
He remembered sitting on his brother's back, waving goodbye to his father. His mother stood beside them, a knowing but sad smile on her face. It had not been the first time that Fergussen had watched his father strap on the armor of a paladin of Mithaniel Marr and answer the call of the crusade.<br>
<br>
He recalled asking if his father would be back in time for his brother's wedding. She had smiled and stroked his hair and sang softly to him in the elven tongue. The song was soothing and reassuring. His father had not returned for the wedding, but it was a beautiful ceremony. Neighbors for miles had come to view the ceremony and wish the happy couple well.<br>
<br>
All had not gone well though. That was the night that the gnolls had attacked. The bright lights of his dream quickly turned into flames and blood. 43 dead...43 INNOCENTS slaughtered by the damned gnolls! He had hid in fear, watching all those he loved being killed. Powerless......<br>
<br>
Fergussen awoke from his sleep in a cold sweat that he was used to. He uttered a quick prayer to Tunare, asking that she watch over her family in her kingdom, and praising his elven heritage that allowed him to maintain on a minimum amount of sleep.<br>
<br>
In the back of his mind he could almost touch the thoughts of the missing paladin, Centuri. He concentrated the words &quot;they will come&quot; poured over his mind. Fergussen tried harder, reaching out for his friends mind. Her emotions washed over him, drowning him, breaking the link.<br>
<br>
The ranger gently touched his wrists. He could hear that others were awake. Footsteps that could only belong to the shadowknight Soulshiver could be heard pacing back an forth in the great hall. Others moved slowly in their rooms. Kannushi's near silent prayers played across his ears.<br>
<br>
The great hawk, Swiftstrike sat silently watching his master. Fergussen bekoned him and swiftly wrote a missive to Theofrid. He opened the window and sent the bird on his mission. The ranger then silently strapped on his armor and readied his weapons.<br>
<br>
As he sat at the table in his room, Fergussen quickly wrote two more notes. And then stealthily crept out of the window. He silently slipped the first through Kannushi's window. If anyone could reach Centuri's mind, it would be her twin sister. Fergussen only hoped that the song his mother used to sing to him would bring the same comfort to Centuri as it had to him.<br>
<br>
The second note, he slipped under the door of the great hall. He hoped the others would understand that he had to move now. As Fergussen entered the forest he drew out the costly potion he had looked so hard to find. The bitter liquid sent a brief sensation of pain through his body. The rangers vision blurred and then faded away as his body was magically transported to another location.<br>
<br>
Soulshiver looked out the window to where the ranger had been standing. He then slowly read the note...<br>
<br>
&quot;My friends, you all know I am of a restless nature, as the forest itself is. I must take some action now. I have contacts near to Neriak now and go to meet them. Rest assured that I shall be there when the time comes. My friend, Swiftstrike, shall return to you shortly. Should you have need to contact me, he will know how. Until we share the field of battle and rescue our dear friend...Fergussen&quot;<br>
<br>
...........................................<br>
<br>
Fergussen snuck silently along the tunnels wall, sticking to the shadows as Theofrid had taught him so many years ago. The twisting tunnels and branches were not overly difficult for him to follow. The wind brought the stench of Neriak to him and showed him the right paths to take.<br>
<br>
The dark elves had been expanding these tuneels since he had last been here. Within the next few years, Fergussen suspected that the tunnels which wound other Neriak would reach to all of the lands of Antonica. Already their underground paths traversed under the commonlands and stretched to bloody Kithicor.<br>
<br>
Footsteps resounded down the tunnel ahead of him. Fergussen muttered the spell of camoflage and stepped deeper into the shadows. Two dark elves passed by him. The ranger did not move for a long time afterwards. He understood the risks of moving about these tunnels, but he had to know if they would allow for their entrance into Neriak when the time for the raid came.<br>
<br>
Centuri's emotional state came to him again. Fear, frustration, doubt, submission, a shred of hope which seemed to be quickly fading.....all bound together by hatred. Fergussen began moving up the tunnel again. Well did he understand the power of hate, and the dangers.......... <p><center><img src="http://www.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/84/1899584.jpg"></center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ufergussen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>fergussen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0> at: 7/12/01 2:48:20 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#353535><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ukrysaniar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>krysaniaR</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 86<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/12/01 5:53:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclefrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yin and Yang</span><hr size=1>                                                                                        Krysania had long been far away on the continent of kunark helping the brave souls fight the evil frogs in the dungeon they call Sebilis.  I only now heard about the plight that has befallen our  sister Centuri.  I wish to rush back to the halls of  Blood Circle to help with the rescue of our brave sister. I fear I will not make it in time. It is a long and dangerous journey to Neriak from here, I offer up many prayers to Tunare ask which way I should go.<br>
<br>
In the dark of night while begging Tunare to tell me what I should do I am granted a vision,  I see the pain in his eyes and feel the rage of Fergussen, as he makes his way through the evil tunnels of Neriak.  With this vision sent to me  I know I must undertake the dangerous journey into the bowels of Neriak to help heal the pain of Fergussen if he is  to succeed in his mission.  <br>
<br>
I begin the search for Intuity the mighty wizard, I know if anyone can get me there in time he can.  <br>

The sleeping drought Anouris had given him was more than effective.  For the first time in comprehensive memory, Soulshiver slept uninterrupted and experienced a dreamless sleep.  Feeling fully refreshed, he cocked his ear toward the Main Hall as the sounds for preparations for the rescue were underway.  Soulshiver sat in quiet contemplation as he re-visited the feelings of peace and of harmony whenever he thought upon his Brothers and Sisters.  Loyalty to this degree is rare, he silently affirmed.  He heard the loud Northern accents of the Barbarians, laughing loudly enough to split the eardrums of any un-desensitized individual in the room.  He could here the melodic, hushed voices of Krysania, Gzale, and Kannushi, as they prayed their morning prayers.  The voice of Itno came readily, speaking in Teir’Dal, with others, in hopes to accomplish the not easily gained accent of the Neriakian Common Quarter.  Blacko’s frustration evident by a strained voice as he again tried to teach his pupils some tell-tale mistakes they were making, in the Dark Elven tongue.  Soulshiver shook his head.  “I shouldn’t have involved them in this,” he muttered under his breath.  It was then that he noticed a note that had been left under his door.  Soulshiver, shivered as he realized that deep sleep had its price.  He cautiously went and picked up the note.  He quickly recognized Fergussens’s hand, and shook his head anew as he realized that he would have gotten help, whether or not he brought up Centuri’s plight a night ago or not.  More was at foot here than just Centuri’s capture and Tyvlain’s bid for power.  He tried to see the tangled skeins of the web that was being woven, but was aware that until he had Centuri safe and free from the clutches of his brother, life wasn’t going to get any clearer.  He sighed audibly and with deftness donned his armor.  Soulshiver paused a moment before opening his door.  As a Knight of Innoruuk, Soulshiver had always saluted his God for the strength and power that he provided him.  The litany taught to him as a youth, almost came unbidden to his lips as it had been a habit for nigh, 987 years.  He bit his lips as he quivered with rage, “Innoruuk, Dark Bastard.  Feel my Hate. Feel my Rage. The Night shall come where thou shalt die by my hands.  May that Night draw near. May I live to see thy blood.  This is my Prayer.”<br>
<br>
The forest of Netkulos provided comfort and solace for Soulshiver.  He spent his earliest years accomplishing tasks for his Masters in the gloom and murk the forest always provided.  The spiderling and skeleton infested place held many a nightmare for the young Shadow Knight and truly taught him the skills necessary to survive the many dangers of Norrath.  He looked over his shoulder to where five full, six member groups waited anxiously.  Kamal had just been gifted with the gift of the Spirit of the Wolf and was comically running around in circles, faster and faster, as he shouted, “Luk whad I kan du, Luk wad I kan du.”  His antics came to a sudden stop as slammed with significant force into a tree trunk that was twice his size.  He picked himself off the ground with a smile and said with a grin, “Me wishin’ dat tree wuz a Troooll.”  Soulshiver smiled at the young troll warrior and said, “Kamal, it is time.  Grab Kkallel and commence the Raid.” Incantations were whispered as the main of Blood Circle disappeared from view.  From his vantage point he watched with much amusement as Kamal and Kkallel gathered every insect, skeleton, and bear in a 3 mile radius.  Kamal was shouting, “Spiders!! Spiders!! Evewewhere!!!”  After amassing a literal horde of the creatures the troll and the ogre ran screaming and flailing wildly toward Neriak’s Main entrance.  The guards looked up from their watch with a look of horror as the wave of troll, ogre, and creature engulfed them in a rising tide.  As the picked themselves off the trampled ground and hurried after the tsunami of creatures, they had no chance noticing the 30 invisible companions entering Neriak. <br>
The watch and alarm was sounded as guards poured from every corner of Neriak.  Kamal and Kkallel continued the shouting and screaming until finally, a Wizard tired of the noise disturbing his meditation, rooted Kamal and Kkallel in place.  Thinking he had finally quieted his noisy disturbances, he re-opened his spell book to the page he had been studying.  He had just completed his first Rune when the troll and ogre shrieked in terrible fear as over 300 spiderling swarmed over them completely obscuring them from sight.  The Wizard quickly gated to a quiet and considerably safe location.  After about a minute of the spiderling attack, Kamal and Kkallel could bear no more, the fell to the floor crushing dozens of spiderling, laughing until tears came, saying to one another, “My dat be a nice spider dreess you do be weeern’.”  Guards went about the foreign quarter attempting to contain the creeping menace and keep them from entering Neriak’s Commons.  Shouts and screams echoed throughout the city as the alarm disturbed many a sleep.  The denizens of Neriak couldn’t remember the last time that such a public disturbance had been created.  The rescue of Centuri had commenced, the plan was in motion and all the world will see that nothing is stronger than Brotherhood, nothing….<br>

The noisy disturbance in the foreign quarter does not penetrate this deeply into the mountain.  Here stands the Halls of the Dead.  Home of Necromancers and Shadow Knights, there is very little in this place to inspire cheer or happiness.<br>
<br>
Centuri shivered almost uncontrollably as the weight of her time in this place pressed down upon her.  She stood once more before the door of Tyvlain Dy'Truin's rooms, rooms she suspected once belonged to Soulshiver.  Her two Orc guards were trying to stand as far away from her as they could in the narrow corridor, while still appearing to have her under their complete control.  She smiled grimly. They weren't very successful at it.  She had built up a certain reputation for violence amongst Tyvlain's guards.  There were many of them that would most likely never bear offspring because of her.  Centuri couldn't help but think that was a good thing.   She looked up at the crest on the solid door in front of her.  Violence would not save her from this tormenter.  Self-loathing at her own cowardice engulfed her once more as she recalled how she had surrendered to him a few days before.  On her knees, on the stone floor of the prison, in front of a cell full of children, she had called him &quot;Master&quot;.  Only because she could not bear to watch the deaths of those innocent children.  Children that he would most likely kill anyhow.  <br>
<br>
The drugs the Dark Masters had given her still clouded her mind and made it difficult to think.  If she only had a sword, she would kill that manipulating bastard, Tyvlain.  But her sword was gone.  Idly she wondered where it was.  Did Tyvlain have it hanging over his mantle, always within sight but just out of her reach?  It would be like him to torture her that way.  Or had he just tossed it in the smelter and destroyed it completely?  Either way, at least he would not be able to use the sword himself.  Goddess-blessed, only the Koada'dal Paladin of Tunare who's name was etched in the hilt with magical runes could wield the Falchion.  A sword that would never be sold or traded, the blade would be buried with the paladin who wielded it.   Centuri's hand clenched on the empty air at her side.  Tyvlain had stripped away her defenses as he had stripped away her sword. <br>

He made his way from the Commons and the sewer entrance deep inside the &quot;underground&quot;, a dark decrepit place filled with all manners of businesses.  Now he crossed the main street of Neriak's 3rd Gate.  He entered the &quot;Cuisine Excelsior&quot;, a tavern known for it's sale of all liquors of Norrath.  Dressed as a Dark Elf Officer and with the aid of his mask, he ordered a private table in a corner that put both the main entrance and the kitchen door, the only means of entering the tavern, in plain sight.  He ordered an Erudite Brandy and gave the few onlookers a scowl of, &quot;I wish to drink alone&quot;, and let his mind go deep into his own thoughts.<br>
  The last message he had received from his good friend Fergussen had mentioned the Blood Circle's resolve in a rescue attempt and that they would act soon.  He had quickly made his plans that night in the Nektulos Forest, for he knew he had to assist this &quot;raid&quot; to free the Elven Paladin Centuri, not just out of friendship to his ranger friend, nor for the honor of fighting beside the brave members of the BC.  Not even out of his own sense of what is right and good in the Paladin of Tunare.  No, he was here for revenge.  A deeper frown crossed his face.  It is the chance to take more from those who had taken everything from him in his early life.  His family, his home, his childhood, yes, it was these Dark Elves themselves that had shaped their own fate this night.  He would be one of those who would bring down one of the most powerful houses in Neriak and it was them that had made him who he was today.  <br>
Theofrid drank from his brandy to wash the taste of something from his mouth.  &quot;Odd,&quot; he thought to himself, &quot;Is this guilt I taste?&quot;  He took another drought from the smooth liquid and turned his thoughts to his preparations.  <br>
After he had taken down the Dark Elf Necromancer, Theofrid had stripped him of many papers.  He had found in them, for his own ability to understand the dark elf tongue was well established, a letter from House Dy'truin, asking that House J'Narus be aware that they had &quot;a sacrifice&quot; that would elevate them to the number one House and their allies would reap the rewards also.  Theofrid smiled to himself, &quot;House Dy'truin was making a power play within Neriak, and it's current ruler, Tyvlain was thinking that this was his time.  Ahh, but not if I can help in it's ruin.&quot;  Theofrid also knew from Bithnira, the Inky whore in the deeper underground of Neriak, just when and where they planned the execution of the Elven paladin.  So he had acted quickly, traveling thru the dark forest to one of the many hidden entrances to the tunnels leading into the city.  He had silently dropped down behind the Dark Elf guard posted at the entrance and with a well placed poisoned dagger, passed back into the city.  He had removed his Dragoon Lieutenants' uniform earlier and had placed that with others items to aid his ranger friend in entering the city less noticeably down in the tunnels.  He had then had gone into the commons area, to the Forge House, a tavern of favor to the Dragoons of the city.  There he patiently waited, singling out a specific officer, just a little drunker than most, and waited for him to make his way to leave.  Shortly, in a ally wrapped in shadows, Theofrid emerged dressed like a dragoon Captain of the House Dy'Truin.  Then he turned up the street in the direction of Neriak's 3rd Gate.<br>
So now he drank again from his brandy.  Theofrid glanced at the candle on his table and realized how much time had passed.  &quot;Hmmm, he should be here any time now, if all went well.&quot;, he thought to himself.  Theofrid tossed down the last of his drink as the door opened and a dragoon officer entered.  He raised his head in acknowledgement when the eyes of the newcomer fell upon him.  Fergussen crossed the room and slowly took a seat next to Theofrid.  &quot;I am glad to see the new uniform fits you so well.&quot;, Theofrid said in the Dark tongue, just a hint of a smile in his face.  &quot;Time for one short drink to this eve and our success.&quot;  Theofrid raised his hand ordering two more of the Erudite Liquor.  &quot;We must be about our business, for the night draws late.&quot;  <br>
  The two dragoons rose from the table, crossed the tavern to the door and stepped into the thick oily air of the streets.  No words were spoken as the two made their way towards the House of Dy'Truin.<br>

For many moments, the whole of Blood Circle surrounded their lost Sister, silently communicating their love for the newly found and the joy of knowing that she was Home.  Centuri, proudly, re-gained her feet.  Scars that would not be healed by a healer's touch were evident as if etched on her features.  She accepted her lost weapons with a nod of thanks from Fergussen.  With a mortal sigh, she asked, &quot;Where is Soulshiver?&quot;  None could meet her gaze, finally, Kannushi spoke, &quot;Sister, Soul is still in Neriak.  He said that it was necessary to tie up loose...ends.&quot;  Tears, welled in Centuri's eyes.  Not tears of fear, pity, or passion, but tears of rage.  &quot;You let my beloved convince you to let him stay?&quot;  Looks of concern seemed to shout back at Centuri...concern was not what she wanted....or needed.  &quot;You will take me to Neriak now!&quot; she uttered in a voice as still as death.  Syna, always wise, said in response, &quot;Centuri, his is a path he must walk alone.  Do not seek to alter his Fate.  Just as your Fate was to have you safe among us, it is Soulshiver's Fate to meet his Family, Neriak, and finally his own god...the God of Hate.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tyvlain whispered, &quot;Soulshiver, time to get up now!&quot;  Soulshiver, astonshing the gathered clerics and guards, stood up from the dead.  The gore and the ilk of the massacred sluiced off his armor as if a flood gate had been opened.  Soulshiver smiled grimly, &quot;Tyvlain, what an unpleasent surprise.  Fancy you here?&quot;  Tyvlain snorted in contempt, &quot;Sorry she wasn't here for the rescuing Soul, ya see, I like to keep my treasures in a far safer place than a Temple!&quot;  Soulshiver's wide grin shook Tyvlain's confidence momentarily.  Just as he was to inquire why his brother was smiling like fool despite his obvious failure to sercure his &quot;Love&quot;, a servant with the Dy'Truin crest upon his breast rushed, out of breath, into the room.  &quot;T-t-vlain, she is...gone.&quot;  The room seemed to shrink as the tension caused the temperature to drop several degree's.  &quot;Tryth, tell me carefully, that &quot;she&quot; is not Centuri.  The Fier'dal Paladin. My pet. My toy.  Tell me that you are reffering instead to my wife!&quot;  Tryth swallowed and stammered, &quot;Please m'Lord, I wan't there, I-I was just sent...I-I...&quot;  Tryth died looking into the eyes of his liege-lord.  &quot;Brother, with all of the men you've lost tonight...&quot; Soulshiver said with mock seriousness.  The look of pure hatred emanating from Tyvlain brought Soulshiver great satisfaction.  &quot;Soulshiver, you will die...&quot; Tyvlain brought his dagger in a deadly arc, barely perceptable due to the incredible speed and agility by which it was wielded; the dagger stopped, scant inches from Soulshiver's loudly beating heart.  &quot;My time has not yet arrived, Brother, soon enough, though, soon enough.  Be patient.&quot; Soulshiver turned and gazed upon his Mother.  &quot;Mother you are looking well,&quot; Soulshiver said dripping with sarcasm, &quot;it might do Tyvlain some good if you released him, he look as if he is about to pop.&quot;  The Mother of Soulshiver looked upon him with malice, &quot;Why did you involve the Council, Soulshiver?  This was a family matter!!&quot;  Tyvlain started to look desperate, his frozen form still shaped for murder.  With an impatient look the Mother of the Dy'Truin family released here youngest son from his invisible prison.  &quot;I've been directed to escort you both before the Dark Council.  Soulshiver, don't look so pleased, for I have it on good sources that you will not be given your Title, but instead called out in disgrace.  I've always known you would bring disgrace to us all.&quot;  The look of hate and malice twisted her beautiful feartures.  She uttered arcane magics and in a flash of brillant light, the three of them appeared before the Dark Council of Innoruuk.  It seemed as if every Noble house was present.  The looks of grim determination was on the face of the Eleven presiding members of the Council.  &quot;Soulshiver Dy'Truin, you stand before this Council on the very day you were to be named a member of it, with the incredible crime of treason.  The crowd gasped at this startling bit of news.  For they had been informed that something was afoot, but were not prepared for the trial of one of the Greatest Noble families of Neriak.  The crowd waited on baited breath with the expectation of watching a star fall at last to Norrath.  &quot;Soulshiver, you know how we will carry out these proceedings.  You'll will be placed under an enchantment that will enable all to see the Truth.  Thereby you will be judged for your crimes.  This is the justice of Innoruuk, if found guilty you...will...die.&quot;  Soulshiver, shivered, it was apparent to all that he seemed to collect himself, as if preparing for a duel that could result in death.  Soulshiver said softly, &quot;Seek not in me a traitor, my Brothers and Sisters.  For I have at long last discovered and accomplished my quest.  For I have learned what it is that keeps us burning with hate, envy, and greed.&quot;  The crowd began to mutter, obviously confused at Soulshivers response.  &quot;I have learned that we dance to a God who would have us believe that love is a weakness.   Yet therein, we may find greater strength and be a better people.&quot;  The crowd erupted with fury!! The shouts for Soulshivers death clammored about the Hall. &quot;Quiet!! Quiet!! The Council demands order!!&quot;, shouted Neriaks Champion.  Dark and silent messages where sent between the members of the Council.  Self-consiously, Tyvlain and Soulshiver's Mother stepped away from their Brother and Son as if for the first time they recognized for the first time some horror previously undiscovered.  &quot;Soulshiver, you mock this Council, your Family, your Race, yea, your very God!!&quot;  Soulshiver, shook his head and laughed gently, &quot;Good Braith, Innoruuk is no God of mine!  My soul was founded and tendered by the Mother of us all, yea, even Tunare.  We are, after all, her lost children.&quot;<br>
<br>
The crowd exploded, erupting like a volcano long over due for the destruction that was its due.  The guards faught valiantly to keep the mob at bay but it was apparent that they were going to lose this battle.  The Hall erupted into flames, many a dress and tunic was singed as the heat calmed the crowd into a hushed silence.  &quot;Soulshiver,&quot; Braith whispered, &quot;you have condemned yourself to an everlasting hell.  Tunare does not want you, you are Innoruuks forever.  However, instead of serving upon His Hate-filled courts, you will help provide the screams of terror that help soothe His soul.&quot;  It was apparent that Soulshiver had stopped heeding the words of the ancient councilman and it seemed that he was completly unaware of his surroundings.  He appeared to looking up to a point in the sky, a look of pure elation and rapture filled his visage.  The rapture soon became a longing so apparent that many a heart was rended as they, for the first time, witnessed a spectacle that seemed divine in nature.  Soulshiver returned his gaze upon the members of the Council and sweeping the faces of the crowd.  &quot;I go home now Brothers and Sisters, I go home.  Hail, Blood Circle!!  Hail, Tunare!!  Hail, Love!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Centuri woke later that night.  Upon her bed was a Rose.  A Rose that for her life-time, never wilted or diminished in its splendor.  And with the Rose was a whispered dream, &quot;My Light, My Light, My Light...I await thee.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thus ends the Annuals of Soulshiver Coeurdeglace<br>
<br>
May grace always be upon Blood Circle, may Norrath always provide an adventure, and may you all be ready for it!!<br>
<br>

<br>
The bodies were scattered everywhere. There wasn't any other word to describe it. It was carnage.<br>
<br>
In his rage he had become one with the magic and unleashed such a hellstorm that even the gods took notice of his actions.<br>
<br>
Scattered body parts that would've easily made him gag before were just another part of the scenery. He stood in the middle. He was the source of everything. He was the fury that had made the storm.<br>
<br>
He knew Soulshiver had much honor and would not turn against his own kind even though they had betrayed him to the highest degree.<br>
<br>
But the little magician called Dohpaz Xorbelbeeb was not as honorable, deep inside him he had the heart of a killer.<br>
<br>
He hadn't thought twice about it. He had avenged the death of his blood-brother Soulshiver.<br>
<br>
As the council lay there on the floor motionless, Dohpaz summoned back his elemental that was slaying everything in sight.<br>
<br>
He lifted his arms in the air and in one quick motion brought everything within 15 feet of him ablaze. <br>
<br>
He was the fire that burned, the fire that cleansed, he was the flame of vengeance.<br>
<br>
The council was dead, Neriak would return to anarchy as it was before. Blood Circle would no longer feel the pain that the council inflicted upon them.<br>
<br>
High atop their clouds, the Gods argued what to do with this little gnome that had channeled the power of the God's themselves. They were frightened of him.<br>
<br>
Innorukk stood up and shouted at the others.<br>
<br>
- &quot;It is time that we end his life. He will be a thorn in our side from this day forth until he is dead!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
The mother of all stood and calmly waved her hand.<br>
<br>
- &quot;There is another solution to our problem apart from killing this little one. We could always open a gateway to another world and let him choose wether to stay or go. If he stays you can have your way Innorukk, but it must be his choice, he must decide his fate without us intervening.&quot;<br>
<br>
All of the gods agreed and gathered together to cast the runes to open the portal...<br>
<br>
<br>
Dohpaz felt a magical force in front of him. He had never seen something as complex before and had never thought something like this could be done.<br>
<br>
Before him stood now a window. It wasn't a gate. A gate could only take you across this world. This was a window to another dimension. Having avenged his blood brother, Dohpaz would surely be hunted down by the followers of the council. He did not plan on hiding for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>
As he approached the window, he could hear a faint whisper. A voice filled with soothing melodies and that seemed to smell like honey.<br>
<br>
- &quot;You... have... chosen... wisely.... little one...&quot;<br>
<br>
Dohpaz smiled and stepped through.<br>
<br>
<br>
