By it's very nature, it edifies that you simply don't know the subject matter. There are levels of decency, though.<br>
<br>
---Let me give you a tiny bit of history before I begin to rant. We have a user (we're an ISP and computer repair shop, among other things) who likes to come in from time to time and ask us if we have any used Pentium IIIs and used 19&quot; monitors for chump change. He never actually buys anything, but he likes to ask.<br>
<br>
---Last month he called on the phone and actually wanted me to explain to him how to make a web database and make it work... over the phone, real quick. He knows NOTHING AT ALL about this stuff. He probably heard the word &quot;database&quot; from television. Anyway, he wanted me to make a web-based business for him and let him make all the money, regardless of the fact he had no idea what he was asking, talking about or insinuating. He didn't even know what he would put in this &quot;database&quot;. He's a get-rich-quick kind of guy who MIGHT have graduated highschool. He wanted all this on the phone, for no money, as if this was normal tech support question material.<br>
<br>
---Today he calls me up and asks how to connect two computers together via a phone line. I ask a little further and he delves into this...<br>
<br>
&quot;I want to make an ISP, but I don't think I know how.&quot;<br>
<br>
---Honest to the Lord Almighty, he thought he could run an ISP off his 486 with his regular old phone line at HOME.<br>

But seriously... he also forgot why you, being an ISP, would want to teach him (who wants to be an ISP) how to compete against you...<br>
<br>
Go ahead and sell him a toaster. Tell him its a CISCO 7000. It might work. Or alternatively, sell him two NICs and a roll of wire and give him what he wants... &quot;two computers joined together&quot; (customer is always right eh?).<br>
<br>
We should swop war stories... I had a customer who thought a firewall is some magical device.

But really, my friend Klayen is baffled about always freezing while play'in his games. He has gone as far as reformating his hard drive and is stumped. He feels it is a hardware problem or conflict now. He hasn't been play'in fer 'bout a month now and has put his problem across tech help sites but to no avail. No one has responded. I'll get him over here with all his computer info and maybe ya'll can help him out. I want him to come over anyway to show me how to change the large pic files to jpg cause I have no way of knowing how to acess ma video editor. Ya'll might not be able to help him without actually having access to his hardware but maybe a hint as to where to start. I'll post again after we get all his info. Any particular stuff we might need before we post again?<br>

After checking her internet logs, she was terminated a few days later for having about 13k worth of page hits in a 40 hour work week, and 70% of them being porn. <br>

To be honest, every little thing in your computer could, potentially, cause the computer to lock up. More specifically, though, if it's not one device, it's the way that one device interacts with another.<br>
<br>
---If your friend is using Win9x, they can go to My Computer &gt; Control Panel &gt; Sytem. In the new window, there's a tab called Device Manager that they should click on. If ANY of the icons there, or those within the subsections) show an exclaimatino point as part of the icon there is a potential conflict that COULD be causing the lock ups. Conversely, If &quot;Computer&quot; is selected once at the top of the list, have them select the Properties button down below. It should open a new window with a list of devices in your computer, each with their own number. If two items are using the same number, that could POTENTIALLY cause a problem, but not necessarily. You'd ned a technician, first-hand, decide that.<br>
<br>
---Way back in the day, I played Fallout on this computer. The game (and only that game-- no others) would lock up my entire computer. Considering it was a new game at the time, I presumed it was the game and patiently waited for a Patch from their website. No go. Eventually, I replaced my Network Card and the problems went away, despite the fact that my NIC worked fine otherwise and the fact that this game never used that card. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.premiernet.net/~chandler/images/newmaclogo3.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/utormodmaclear.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tormod MacLear</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Chief</span><br>  Posts: 421<br> <font color=#330000>(7/29/01 4:35:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmacleargeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1123.topic&index=6>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.clanmaclear.com/images/tormod.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: So dumb, it actually baffles me.</span><hr size=1> After reading this you all may conclude that I am demented, but over the years since I left the belly of the beast, I have found great riches and fortune in being so.

<br>
You gentlemen are wizards, mages, magicians. Is as if the legends have come to life. You may think of what you do in technical terms, but what are the many programs you use but spells (you even have to spell each word, literally)? You have the magic words to inscribe that are necessary to bring the various spells (programs) together with the required reagents (hardware) to make mystic things happen. Fortunately for the rest of us, you have the capability to make some of the spells fairly persistant (like this message board) and are good enough to let us know the mystic words of passing that allow us to &quot;come&quot; to this board in the nether realms where physical beings may not venture to pass etheral messages to one another instantly without need for physical contact.<br>
<br>
If you will allow your viewpoint to change just a bit you will recognize that you are in indeed workers of true magic. You simply have a problem with the tricksters that have not studied the arcane books yet attempt to use either real or false reagents and seek your mystic knowledge without the labor and sacrifice necessary.<br>
<br>
There are even evil mages about, the crackers who would destroy the spells you have woven so carefully and even the reagents themselves. Against them you place counter spells and counter spell reagents throughout your etheral realm.<br>
<br>
This is something just beginning, in the years to come those like you will have power to topple even those who think they govern.<br>
<br>
I recently had the opportunity to meet a warrior mage. Tormod the Younger was up until recently employed by the Air Intelligence Agency. One of his friends there is an officer (knight) who's job was to attack friendly computer systems both from without and within. We set up a firewall and the most sophisticated protection we could think of and he was through it in about thirty seconds. <br>
<br>
He told us that the next war would at least start with informations systems warfare utilizing people like him on both sides in the attempt to destroy the command, control, and intelligence systems of the other. He suggsted that the day might come when an entire war could be fought in cyberspace with the loser unable to wag war in the physical world and forced to surrender without a shot fired.<br>
<br>
He explained that he had the capability to shut down power grids, stop all air traffic, effectively prevent a government from communicating with itself or its people, and shut down the food distribution system for that too is run by computer.<br>
<br>
You good folks are are on the fringes of something as amazing and world changing as the discovery of metal forging. Let us hope that you are both very very good and very very trustworthy, for your power may be beyond our imagination. <p>For Halas! For MacLear!<BR>

Case in point....  We got a Trouble Ticket from a state-wide admin complaining that a cable modem user appears to be abusing a cgi script and we should check it out. The &quot;script&quot; in this case is srch.dll, from icq.com...which if you have ever done a user search on the webpage you would see it being used to get user details.
