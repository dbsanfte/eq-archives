If the target won't have a high MR, blind them with fast cast blinds and hit them from behind.  Another option, melee, maybe stun here and there but save mana.  When you get down, heal.  A 50 cleric, vs a 50 wizard, the cleric will win.  Stand off, let them nuke, as they cast start to cast either GHeal or Superior Heal, cleric heals are so effiecent you will have mana to possibly nuke, stun or root a wiz.  Pets are a trouble area as the melee like a warrior, and leave the caster to nuke away.  I am curious if the atone line will free the pet from the masters bond like some other spells can.  But against non pet classes, and tanks clerics are awesome.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that we have not talked about bards.  Bards are the odd man out, and break alot of the normal rules.  A bard has no chance against a caster unless they are white or blue to you, but against a melee class, they are unstoppable.  Clerics might have a hard time, since they can even out last a cleric, just need the cleric to run out of mana healing them selves.  And you can out melee a cleric any day of the week.  Pet classes, well a smart and savvy bard will target the pet, cast charm, wait for the charm is done message and re-charm.  At this point the pet caster will notice that they no longer have a pet, the bard does and if the bard moves away after pet attack on caster the pet will continue to beat the caster down even after charm breaks.  Shamans and necros (wizards may be too, but I need to get to Intuity's level for some tests first) No way I will resist Leach or Life Spike spells.  My only hope on these is to either sick his pet on him, or if no pet, fear kite him.  Shamans, the pet is mean, but can be used against them, but they can nuke, dot and you can't melee them.  They are too dam close to bard melee skill for comfort.  Load kiting load, and cure disease and poison songs (psalms) and fade in and out of fight, trying to heal and cure.  Returning to range as you remove the previous effects.<br>
<br>
Longevity as a bard is the key, a short fight usually means the bard lost badly.  A long fight means the opponent was owned. <p>Eryl Flynn Level 47 Wood Elf Bard on Prexus

Fear blind and root not to mention the stuns and a pretty healthy DD make the cleric a viable offense on top of all that healing.  I personally used to be afraid of clerics because if duels were all about numbers then clerics are indeed to be eared.  I have seen clerics punk wizards and most of the tank classes using root and shoot style but they tend to not do so hot against pet classes due to the intterupt on the good heals.  Some tips are to buff all your resists and to know what your opponent is capable of  in terms of dots and what not.  Use this tactic on buffing,  Cast a lame ass level 1 buff on yourself first then cast all your other buffs,  when you are ready to duel cancel the level one buff leaving the first buff slot open that way if you do get a non poison/disease dot on you  then you can cast cancel magic to remove it before it eats your heart out.   Be prepared to cure off any ailments and you will do fine! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#353535><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/uzarius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zarius</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://media.xoom.com/website/animated-gifs/design-sets/electric/etc/elcmisc3.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guild Leader</span><br>  Posts: 417<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/26/00 11:26:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclefrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://media.xoom.com/website/animated-gifs/design-sets/electric/etc/elcmisc3.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What about the cleric?</span><hr size=1> Well my own opinion on clerics is this:<br>
<br>
A cleric is prolly one of the best classes to play in a duel. Against a caster the cleric rocks. Against hybrids the cleric will edge a victory in if hes carefull. <br>
<br>
The downside is that fighting tanks will be a pain. Tanks you'll have to melee. The key to dueling is you have to be able to damage you opponent. Clerics are ok tanks until about level 16. Beyond that you better sit back and med to heal(hunting for exp that is). Now this is ok for groups but when its one on one the tank isn't gonna wait while you med. This means your gonna have to tank as well. OR... You caN root and shoot. That is your best option against a tank. <br>
<br>
<br>
Vs. Tanks:<br>
<br>
Start with Root, Blind, and Fear in that order. When the tank is running away he can't hit you and you can finally hit him. When he breaks fear do it all over. You should be able to get a root off before he gets back to kickin your but cause he will have to reorient himself and find you first. This gives you the time you need to root again. If this tactic is goin well and you feel you can beat him with it....continue until heas dead. If he resists or breaks fear alot or you have a hard time casting spells on him(and you might) then resort to root blind and attack from behind. You have got to be able to wear him down. Clerics dont do enough damage with spells to be effective against tanks. Make extra sure you save enough mana for heals if its leaning his way. Be ready to try a few tactics if things don't go well. The best dueler is the one who can adjust to different styles of fighting. Keep in mind that 2 different people might fare differently against the same clerice. Some people are just not destined to duel. Other can make the best of the slightest mistake you make. <br>
<br>
Vs. Casters:<br>
<br>
My suggestion against a caster is to beat him down and heal while he spends mana trying to nuke you away. <br>
<br>
Mages, Necros, and Enchanters will have a pet for you to deal with so I'll start with the wizard.<br>
<br>
Wizards have no defense other than a good offense. Root is anoying but a cleric of comperable level will always have more healing power than the wizard has nuking power ..... Whats a wizard without mana? Dead! You sit back heal off his nukes then when hes OOM you can just beat him down. He will try to root you to begin with and for this tactic you can reward his efforts with a devine aura while you sit and med. This will only turn out better for you. A smart wizard will try to run so he can sit and med. He knows it will be a battle of mana. If he can kill you before he runs out of mana he wins. If your mana last longer than his..hes dead. <br>
<br>
<br>
Mages, necros, and enchanter now are different. Reguardless what anyone thinks...my opinion is &quot;ignore the pet&quot; Fighting with a pet will only give them med time and the chance to nuke you down. Maybe start the fight by rooting the pet but don't waste any effort on it after that. The pet is worthless once his master is dead. But if you try to kill the pet...you'll still have to kill the master when hes dead. The biggest problem will be mages. Thier earth pet roots. This is a problem cause it will effect your ability to melee the mage (interupting spells will save your life) You can try to fear pets but it never seems to pan out very well and its a long spell to cast. The best way to handle pets is to root them and forget them. If they are a real problem then deal with it but don't waste any more mana than a root or two. Necros will try to suck the life out of you but this will work out in your favor. Thier spells are not as efficient in dealing out the damage. They are meant more as a utility spell for the necro. The enchanter pets will hit fast and seem to be more aggressive but wont do as much damge. A good tactic to go with is to root the pet, stun the caster, then beat him down.<br>
<br>
Vs. Hybrids<br>
<br>
Hybrids will prolly cause you the most grief. The will have some of both worlds and will force you to really consider each duel seperately. Think about the weapons he has and how well you can defend against them. Also consider your best offense and what he can do to nutralize it. Use this info to decide what you want to do in the fight and make sure to have a back up plan. Always!<br>
<br>
Hope this helps a little<br>
