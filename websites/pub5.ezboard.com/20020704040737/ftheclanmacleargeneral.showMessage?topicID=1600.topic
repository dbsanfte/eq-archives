With his fishing pole over his shoulder, he makes he way to the pond to catch The General, the largest and most elusive fish in the pond.<br>
<br>
He sits on the soft grass and pulls a Stormguard Root Beer from out of his backpack. He enjoys the taste of the Root Beer but it is so rare in the Glade that he saves them for <br>
special days. Today is special, his parents will be returning from his trip to the Ranger Guild in Kelethin. It has been many moons since he last saw them but his uncle has keep a <br>
watchful eye on him in their absence. He casts his line in to the water; nothing would make him happier than the look on his fathers face when he sees his son holding The General. <br>
<br>
The young lad misses fishing with his father, for it was something that they shared every weekend, after the chores were completed. He attached another fishing grub to the line and cast it out again. <br>
<br>
The young lad could hear Hager Sureshot teaching the young rangers the skills of the bow. The sounds of arrows flying through the air could be heard if you listened carefully. He <br>
knew that one day he would be attending the class, his father promised that he would begin his training when he returned. <br>
<br>
The day wore on, the lad wondered how many rusty dagger could possibly be in the water for him to catch. He finally gave up and returned to his uncle's home to wait for his parents. He waited up as late as he could before he finally fell asleep.<br>
<br>
In the morning, he woke up and began to look around but his parents had still not arrived. He was sad but his uncle assured him that they probably just hit some bad weather and would <br>
be arriving soon. He then decided to try his luck again at catching The General. <br>
<br>
He made his way past Hager Sureshot and his students. He sat at the pond and continued where he left off the day before, catching rusty daggers. He grew bored and walked over to watch Hager Sureshot teach the young rangers the art of the bow. During a break, Hager approached the young lad and told him that he was to begin the class in two days. The young one asked why and Hager told him that his father had arranged it before he left. <br>
<br>
All excited, the young lad ran back to his uncle's house to grab his practice bow. He decided that The General would have to wait for another day, he had training to complete!<br>
A week went by with no news of his parents and the young lad started to become worried. There was much whispering around the Glade of rumors of what might have happened to them. A search party was assembled to seek out the missing couple.<br>
<br>
It was the eve of his graduation from Hager's school and still no news had been heard. He was nervous and decided to calm himself down by going to the pond to fish.<br>
<br>
As he sat by the water, he felt a heavy tug and his pole was almost pull out of his hands. He realized that he might have just snagged The General. He began his fight with the ancient <br>
fish until a skeletal bird carrying a missive landed next to him.<br>
The bird crumbled to pieces upon reaching the young ranger. All that was written on the note was a name... Brutredblade.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The Ranger sits up in his bed in a cold sweat. He quickly lights a lantern and looks around to gather his senses. The dreams have become a nightly event. And he was getting <br>
little rest. He drank a small glass of water and blew out the lantern.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
