I have no plans to leave EQ anytime soon, though (too many things left to do!).  DAoC has an interesting premise.  The realm wars, random quest generators, mobs tailoring themselves to your current situation (harder for groups, not as hard if you engage them solo), player made weapons and armor that is better than what you can loot(with exceptions, of course), rangers and pally's won't be POS's (woohoo!), and customized guild emblems that you can smith or tailor onto your armor and cloaks.  The one downside I see in the inability to play in more than one realm on a server.  This may limit some people who want to play with RL friends and such, but the realms are pretty equal in terms of classes (each realm has basicly the same classes, just different names).  Keep us informed, Soulshiver.<br>

In DoAC, ALL melee'ers have techniques that work similiar to spells, those that are &quot;pure&quot; warriors gain more and gain them quickly.  From this point you are able to assign specific skill points in the type of melee'er you wish to be, ie:  You wish to be more defensive based, so you train with techniques involving the shield, Guard, and Protect....or....you wish to dole out massive amounts of damage so you concentrate on 2h weapons and all of the offensive skills...or...you wish to be a little of both and spread your skills, redifining as you level.  Basically, anyone that swings a sword, will not only be casting spells, but laying on graphic damage due to the techniques they mastered.  The effects of some of these techniques are awesome.  The Dual-weilding Rangers, Mercenaries, Berserkers, and Rogue-types look awesome!  Anyway, enjoy the article!<br>

Dark Age of Camelot<br>
Interview with Matt Firor <br>
There are so many MMORPG about to be published, that it´s easy to get lost in the crowd. It would be a shame, because a few of them seem to be pretty interesting, and Dark Age of Camelot is one of them. We still didn´t have the chance to try it, so we decided to send some questions to Matt Firor of Mythic Entertainment to find out what it´s about.<br>
<br>
Could you explain the story behind the game? How did you came up with the idea of making an universe inspired by the Arthurian legends? <br>
<br>
We were originally going to make a 3D version of Darkness Falls: Crusade, our text-based Realm-vs-Realm RPG game. That game is based on standard fantasy classes and ideas; and would have been a good, but standard idea behind a game. However, our President, Mark Jacobs, came up with the idea of basing the game on the King Arthur legends. Obviously, one of the Realms had to be Arthurian England, and after that the other two Realms (Midgard and Hibernia) fell right into place.<br>
<br>
Why did you think Dark Age of Camelot is different from other online RPGs?<br>
<br>
We have five major design goals with Camelot to help differentiate us from other online RPGs. First, our Realm vs. Realm combat system, with territorial conquest and Relic protection gives the player a context for wanting to fight other Realms – it’s not just a wild free-for-all. Second, our questing system is designed to be as flexible as possible, and not offer the same path for every player who is questing for the same goal. Third, we want our combat system to be as engaging and fun as possible – with the addition of great animations, combat styles that are usable at different points in combat based on what your opponent is doing, and other features. Fourth, we don’t want to fall into the “camping” trap that other online RPGs often find themselves. Camelot encourages players to move around the world and to not stay in the same place for too long. Finally, we have an integrated economy and trade skill system that allows players to actively participate as merchants and crafters, if they wish to do so.<br>
<br>
What are the differences between the three realms? Why Relics are so important for them? <br>
<br>
The differences between the Realms is primarily the mythology that the Realm is based on. For example, in Albion, the kingdom of Arthur, the classes have an Arthurian/Medieval English feel to them. Midgard is based on Norse gods and legends, and Hibernia is based on a mix of fantasy “undermountain” lore as well as Celtic mythology. Relics are important to each Realm, they are the powerful items that control how good the Realm fights, cast spells, and general well-being. Realms will want to keep their Relics nice and safe, away from enemy hands.<br>
<br>
Could you explain the class and guild system you’re using for the characters? What kind of options will be? <br>
<br>
In all three Realms, characters start out as a base class (such as fighter, mage, cleric, rogue). At 5th level, they can then choose which type of their base class they want to be (for example in Albion, fighters at 5th level can choose to be Armsmen, Mercenaries, or Paladins). Once a player has chosen their class, they can then further differentiate themselves by choosing which skills to train in – most classes have at least two paths they can follow, which they do by training in different skills.<br>
<br>
What happens when a character dies? <br>
<br>
Death systems in online RPG games are often maligned, criticized, scorned, and outright hated. However, they fulfill a critical aspect of games that is almost always overlooked by the player: having something bad happen when your character dies imparts a sense of tension and excitement. There is simply no excitement in adventuring through a world where loss of life is meaningless – a game with no or little penalty for death will soon be fully explored, and become boring. <br>
In Camelot, we balance the good of excitement and tension with the bad of having a death penalty. There is no death penalty for characters under 6th level. When your character dies, over 5th level, no equipment will be lost – but he will lose experience and a small number of constitution points. Even with the exp loss, your character will never “lose” a level based on the death exp loss – instead he will just remain at the beginning of the current level. <br>
To mitigate the experience point loss, when a player dies, a gravestone is erected at the death spot. When the player goes back and prays at this marker, half of the experience that was lost will be returned. Also the first death the player has (per level) will be at half experience point loss. <br>
If a dead player is resurrected by a PC Cleric, Priest, or Druid, he will lose half the normal amount of exp point loss, and will not lose any constitution points. Constitution points can be bought back from NPC healers.<br>
<br>
Could you explain the PVP system you are using? What is the difference with other RPGs? <br>
<br>
We are using our own custom-created Realm vs Realm combat system. The main difference between Camelot’s RvR combat and the wide-open conflict of other games is that Camelot gives the player a context and reason why he is engaging in combat with enemies. <br>
<br>
What about the weapons and equipment? How will the buy/upgrade system work? <br>
<br>
All weapons and armor in Camelot degrade over time. Players will have to either repair their equipment themselves, or find a player who is skilled in item repair (or of course pay an NPC smith to fix it). Eventually, though, all items will have to be replaced. Players can find new weapons by questing for them, or by having them made by a player craftsman, or purchase them from an NPC merchant. <br>
<br>
What kind of quests will there be? How are you going to avoid redefinition <br>
<br>
Our questing system is quite large and innovative. We have randomness built into quests that ensure that two players who perform the same quest do not do the same steps in the same order. Also, players must perform one step before they can move onto the next. If they try to skip a step, for example by killing the final monster in the quest, the monster will not drop the quest item unless the player has done all the other steps in order.<br>
Camelot also has a “task” system built in, which is a randomly-generated quest that lets the player gain some quick experience and/or money. <br>
We expect Camelot players to be able to generate 35-50% of the experience required to level each level by quests and tasks.<br>
<br>
Which are the main features of the engine?<br>
<br>
Camelot features a custom-created engine built on the NetImmerse API from NDL, inc. It has all the great graphical features you would expect of a modern game – high res textures and great models, animations, and a beautiful terrain system. <br>
<br>
Do you have plans to expand Dark Age of Camelot with add-on packs after the release? <br>
<br>
We plan on having add-on packs, but we want to finish the main game first! <br>
<br>
What feature do you think will blow people away? <br>
<br>
The graphical appearance of the game, along with the different “feels” that each Realm has. We’ve done a lot of work to make each Realm seem different from one another. <br>
