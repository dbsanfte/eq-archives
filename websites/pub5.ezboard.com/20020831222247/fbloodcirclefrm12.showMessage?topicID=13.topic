Vorphuix the Great Wizard yelled &quot;its a boy!&quot; Asphyx was Born. The Family lived together in a small house in the City of Felwithe. Vorphuix hunted Orcs to feed their family while his wife Aspen cooked and took care of the kid. Vorphuix and Aspen Dragonblood had another baby by the name of Xanthurok. One day Vorphuix was told by the Wizard Hall to travel to Erudin to get some new spells. He traveled to Freeport, He traveled to Qeynos, He traveled to Erudin in search of wisdom and to bring new spells back to his homeland Faydark. During this time Asphyx grew into a fine young man. Since Xanthurok was still a baby and his father was away his duties was to keep the house clean and obey his mother, but not all was well. His mother was killed while Vorphuix was away. She went with a few friends to collect flowers in lesser faydark when vampires killed them all. The Wizard Guild was outraged by this news and took Asphyx and Xanthurok till Vorphuix returned.<br>
<br>
Vorphuix found his spells in Erudin but still haven't heard of the bad news of his wife's death. He left Erudin and came back to Qeynos when he was told of what happened. He traveled back to freeport and got onto the boat. He didn't know it would be his last ride. It was a stormy ride across the ocean. The boat came to a dock and was attacked by Seafury Cyclop's. His Corpse was never found.<br>
<br>
The Wizard Guild tryed to explain all this to a young boy, and wanted him to follow in his fathers footsteps of becoming a great Wizard. Asphyx left quite angry and didn't listen. He went straight to the general and told them to revenge his mother's and father's death, But the General was too busy to help, Felwithe, and Ak'non found another island and had to many troops away to take over Mistmoore Castle. But the General gave Asphyx a suit of full bronze armor and a claymore. Asphyx set out to take matters into his own hands.<br>
<br>
Knowing he was the eldest of the brothers he didn't have a choice of learning patiently the art of arcane magic. He had to hunt for food for him and his young brother. Xanthurok stayed at the wizard guild and began to learn the science. Asphyx was ripping orcs apart so he and his brother could survive. And this kid was making a name for himself quickly.<br>

Xanthurok greeted him and showed him some of the magic he has learned. The shadowstep, the teleports, Asphyx just smiled. For he wasn't going to hide. For he was going to let his face be shown. His sword guide his way. To preserve the Dragonblood name. Asphyx left Felwithe and went to lesser faydark, he went to Castle Mistmoore alone at age 20 to revenge his mothers death. He killed over 500 darkelf followers, but left one alive. He told him to go back and tell his leader one day your castle will fall, he will come wearing Golden Armor, wielding the Sword of Tunare.<br>
<br>
Xanthurok was sad to hear the news that Asphyx was leaving Faydark. Asphyx told Xanthurok to follow in their fathers footsteps of becoming a Wizard. Xanthurok promised his elder brother he would do so. Asphyx left. The same boat his father was killed on, he rode. He traveled past the seafury cyclops. He made it safely to Freeport.<br>
<br>
In Freeport the city was alot bigger, and some turmoil was happening there. Asphyx didn't like the city and traveled west. Their he came upon a forest. It was alot like the forest of his back home. He traveled thru and found a hillside and was attacked by orcs. These Orcs had no chance. Asphyx killed them all, and moved on. He came to a city called HighKeep. There he met the Captain who was having problems with the goblins of Runnyeye. Asphyx took the offer to slay them. And when he was done, he went to Runnyeye and killed them. In the gorge he was attacked by Evil Eyes, thru the night they battled only to barely survive. As he left the gorge the king attacked, but was not a challenge. Asphyx killed over the years all over Antonica, and returned to Freeport.<br>
<br>
Back in Freeport he was told that a man named Sir Lucan was carrying out evil deeds. Asphyx did not care about this Lucan. But he gives a great sword as a reward, Asphyx didn't care about this sword. Only thing he cared about was either dead, or his brother back at Felwithe. Asphyx didn't know of love. Till one night. The mother of all Tunare came to Asphyx in a dream. She said one day he will find happiness and find a wife, and also warned him of the trouble on new lands and to the south. She blessed him and smiled down on him.<br>
<br>
One day while Asphyx was fighting south, he came across a man. He told him of a guild that could use him. Asphyx accepted and joined this new guild. Legion of Kings. He hunted with them for awhile, but they worried about little things, Asphyx had to move on. The Guild and Asphyx parted, and Asphyx traveled to a Iceland. The continent of Velious. Here is where he perfected his skills in combat, fighting alone, not knowing of friends.<br>
<br>
Back in Felwithe Xanthurok was learning more everyday. He began to fight the orcs. They was no match for his intense power. He too became bored with the orcs and moved on. He teleported all over the world exploring new places. Meeting new people. He still hasn't found his brother. His new home is in Highkeep where he fights the goblins and learns new magic. Xanthurok has surpassed his father in magic. Becoming a Great Wizard.<br>
<br>
The snow blowing hard in Velious is no place for a man to be alone. Asphyx stayed with the Tizmak in the caves thru the storm. The Tizmak told him storys of the Giants and of the Dragons, but mostly of the ones who call them selves Guardians in the city of Skyshrine. Asphyx thought it was a great idea. He left the Tizmaks and sneaked thru the giant city. He came to Skyshrine. This he thought was a great new experience. To learn more. To become a knight under them, but once he entered the city he was attacked. They fought hard and almost killed him. But thru the pain and blood Asphyx fought back. He slayed them all. He killed everything and the pool that use to be clear turned to blood. Asphyx left and teleported back to the freeport area.<br>
<br>
Back at freeport he encountered another strange person. Hello Friend he said. Asphyx looked at him strange. Would you like to join our fight against all evil? Asphyx accepted. The Guild Blood Circle has a new member. One who wont back down, One who wont quit, One who will become a Knight. Perhaps one day he will find a wife to mend his broken heart. And on that day... Vorphuix, Aspen, and Tunare will smile in heaven. Till then Asphyx is still in his everquest for Justice. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclefrm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=13.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclefrm12.showNextMessage?topicID=13.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclefrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.tj3systems.com/bloodcircle/forumimages/bc_addrpy.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclefrm12.threadControl?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclefrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=13.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclefrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=13.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub5.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="bloodcirclebloodcirclegeneral">Blood Circle General<option value="bloodcirclefrm9">Blood Circle Raids & Events<option value="bloodcirclebloodcirclefriends">Blood Circle Friends<option value="bloodcirclebloodcirclefoes">Blood Circle Foes<option value="bloodcirclefrm11">Blood Circle Bank and Trades<option value="bloodcirclefrm15">Member Only Access Requests<option value="bloodcirclefrm14">Membership Applications<option value="bloodcirclefrm12">Blood Circle Tales<option value="bloodcircleguildwar">Officers Discussion<option value="bloodcirclefrm6">Members Only<option value="bloodcirclefrm16">The Blood Circle Library</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/bbloodcircle>Blood Circle</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclefrm12>Blood Circle Tales</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.bloodcircle.org/">Blood Circle Home Page</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <SCRIPT language='javascript' src='http://www.smartcal.com/calendar/external/1560137?eview=ExternalReminder&inlining=true'>
