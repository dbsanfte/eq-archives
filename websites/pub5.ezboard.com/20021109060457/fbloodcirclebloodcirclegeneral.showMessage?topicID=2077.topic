We even gave Marcus a call (some of you know him as Snarlfist) and he came even though he hates oriental food and isn't in to import jpop and anime and shyte like that, but he just wanted a reason to drive around and smoke cigs all day or some shit...<br>
<br>
So i'm cleaning out the years worth or trash and soda cans that have piled up in the escort to make some leg room for the guys and i trip on brians fuct up driveway thats all cracked and mangled and shit, so i twisted my ankle hardcore and developed a noce POS limp for the duration of the day <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
well after a days worth of walking around the market my ankles swolen to shit and marcus has the genious idea to go drink some beers at mavericks by the time we got back at 7pm, and im still fallin over every 5 minutes cause my foot feels like its fallin off... wtf i dont get out to mavs that often so despite the fact that im already limping all over like a 3 legged poodle, i tell him ill go.<br>
<br>
well brians all pissy and moany cuz hes tired and he wants to go home and marcus is bitching cuz he wants me to stay so im like wtf...  well when i fist came into mavs (we frequent the place a lot) chris the FVCKTARD tending bar asks me if im gonna get all shitfaced tonight and im like, no man im tired and gonna leave pretty soon but hes all fvck that and he pulls his other jerkoff bartender buddies to the side and decides they gonna fvck with me bad tonight, of all nights...<br>
<br>
Lets take this time quick to explain some things about mavs... at any given time a tender will walk up to you and stick his fist in your face, meaning you gotta rock paper scissors him and loser buys the shot...  if you get fisted, you take a shot.. pay for it or not, they dont give a damn...<br>
<br>
so christ fists me, i win he buys shot... they he forces a game of bar dice on me and funky (marcus) and we all take a shot, then more dice, more dice, more dice.... lots of dice... lots of shots, then will the other jerk at the bar fists me, i win he buys shot.... then dino fists me i lose... shots on me.. lame... then about 5 more games of dice, 5 more shots and all the while im drinking buds like nobodies business THEN, dino, will, chris, and kathy all come up to me and QUAD FIST ME, thats like a first in mavs history.. i had to paper rock scissors all 4 of the asswholes....  get this i win ALL FOUR ROUNDS... 4 free shots... so its like 9:30, im down 15 bucks on bud, and a few bucks for lost shots... ive been at mavs for an hour and have at least 15 shots and 5 buds... thats like not safe... and im not the most hardcore drinker on the planet...  im just pist they all tag teamed me and i was all plannin on leavin early <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
so like im SOOOOO shitfaced and brians like fuckit im taking you home and marcus stayed to flirt with some nasty ass chick with a bunch of kids or something... so im cut off after a fvcking HOUR, i didnt even wanna get drunk and its 9:30!!!!  i look like a BITCH now... to top it off when me and brin are walking back to my can i slip and bust me shit YET AGAIN.... same damn ankle... now im like all innebrated and i got a broke ass ankle and this is the first time in my life i got cut off before 2am...  nothing else could go wrong tonight unless lighning strikes my house and kills me...<br>

If it is just a sprain then keep it iced and apply no heat whatsoever.  What I do on my soccer team for ankles is to fill a bucket with ice water then keep my foot in there for 15 mins take it out and wait a few minutes and put it back in then repeat.  That will keep down the swelling and the pain.  I would also suggest not putting too much pressure on it for a few days.  When I screwed my ankle in soccer, I messed around on it and ended up playing my first 2 weeks back from my injury with a hurt ankle and it never actually got better till this summer after baseball.<br>

If you ankle feels weak you can stretch it out to make it stronger and go on a light jog.  Just don't do any juking or cutting.

I on the other hand seem to get kicked out of a place of consumption at least every fifth time that I venture out and if you knew how much I go out you'd know that it happens quite frequently within living memory.  It would seem that I had develoveped a special mental complex for falling in temporary love with others peoples prize winnings or at least what they call their own depending on how much alcohol I consumed on that givin night divided by the ratio of women to men in that particular establishment.  Needless to say I have been &quot;escorted&quot; from no less than 50 establishments on not so friendly terms with the locals LOL.  The nice thing about life is that you never really run out of new places to exhibit your patronage and to pay homage to the local brewery.  <br>
<br>
You know you have a probelem though when even the establishments of female flesh exhibitions begin to take part in the rejection olympics!  It would seem at times that the safest place for one and ones urges is at home playing games with a bunch of faceless strangers but that is not always the case for sometimes at least according to the news these lost souls also happen to find one another in RL.  Wish all I would my princess of the online world never found me with or without beer.  The closest I ever came to a successful online pairing was me reluctantly agreeing to meet with an individual without prior photo swaps etc... I knew what was coming and sure enough it was the worst of all possible cases hehe an ogre shadowknight was there awaiting me at her apartment... As a person of high moral charachter (not) i took her to the local watering hole and played it cool.  In the end however I wound up with a slobbering oaf trying to test the breeding compatibility between a human and ogre mix.  In real life such things just don't work.  So anyhow I forgot the initial point of this communication so I'll just leave the rest to your imagination <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#353535><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/uthemaunster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>the Maunster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 129<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/8/02 8:41:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclebloodcirclegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2077.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Beer is the meaning of life</span><hr size=1> Actually...<br>

I have been booted from a bar.  Once for telling the bouncer to f*** off (because he was being mean to my girl), and once nearly, for getting caught stealing from the beer cooler at the front entrance (tee hee).  I also got cut off once, and then after having a friend buy for me, nearly having to hand over my drink to the bouncer.  But my friend and I ducked through the crowd, avoiding that.  <br>
