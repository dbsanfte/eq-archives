There are various badges given to members of the United States Army for serving in combat, the Combat Infantry badge and the Combat medic badge are just two of many.  I'd go into the honor behind these badges and respect I have the those that wear them...but it's not really relevant to this subject at hand.  <br><br>My suggestion.  To be eligible for the new Rank/Title one must be nominated by four members kin or higher for actions bringing pride upon the Siol Lear clan in RvR combat.  Nominations are then passed to the High Council for approval.  Upon approval the new Rank/Title is given.  Now as for any duties or responsibilities that this new Rank/Title should be given?  I say that stay that of what are for kin.

But if there are 10 rankings within the guild, surely we do not need all 10 of them for standard guild rankings.  Perhaps 3 of them could be set aside solely for the purpose of RvR titles within Siol Lear if that is important to the guild as a whole.

This rank can be given a title, and Loden picked the title &quot;chief&quot; for this position. Unlike the other ranks, the in-game capabilities for this rank cannot be altered, and there are a few abilities that only the Guildmaster can have.<br><br>The &quot;normal&quot; hierarchy consists of ranks 1 to 9.  Each rank can be given a name.  Each rank is also given various permissions.<br><br>[Editor's note: This information subject to change by Loden, but accurate as of 7:00est 12/13/2001.]<br><br>1.

Also, the numbers associated with ranks don't really have any intrinsic meaning, except that those with promotion privileges can only promote below themselves. For example, rank 6 could actually have more privileges than rank 5. my point is that there could be a couple of ranks with distinct roles that don't have to be thought of as one &quot;above&quot; the other.<br><br>I hope this helps the discussion.<br>           -- Gisli<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/utorgeirr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Torgeirr</A> at: 12/14/01 7:02:55 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#676767><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/btheclanmaclear.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=jenguss>Jenguss</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lad/Lass</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#F2CF7E>(12/14/01 7:00:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmaclearfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=161.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kinship</span><hr size=1> Well since the structure is there how long is one an Applicant before they move into the Lad/Lass category? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4F4F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ulodenmaclear.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loden MacLear</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Chief of Siol Lear</span><br>  Posts: 122<br> <font color=#F2CF7E>(12/14/01 8:07:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmaclearfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=161.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kinship</span><hr size=1> One is an applicant until an application is received and there are at least two members in good standing or one officer vouch for the applicant.<br><br>A similiar procedure applies to Kinship.

I did not interpret his post as there being some kind of hard, exact realm point requirement for promotion. I read it as there being some kind of guideline or affect of realm points.<br><br>This game is about RvR- plain and simple. The way for a clan to make a name for itself is RvR. Thus, it is important that we stress RvR as a clan. One way to do this is to reward people who participate in RvR and show themselves as willing to heed the words and leadership of clan officers. RvR is one of the best ways to demonstrate this.<br><br>I definitely feel that people should not be eligible for promotions if they are not at least moderately active in RvR. This game just isn't about PvE. In 2 or 3 months, almost everyone in the clan will have a level 50 character. Then the fact that RvR is the most important part of this game will become even clearer. <p>-Glamis Askamelodi, Thane of Thor<BR>http://www.threshold-rpg.com</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#676767><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/btheclanmaclear.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ronod>Ronod</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lad/Lass</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#F2CF7E>(12/15/01 4:56:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmaclearfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=161.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> View from the Bottom</span><hr size=1> If ye dont recognize my name, its because I'm one of the newer members, and havent yet had a chance to meet all of the famed &quot;Old Guard&quot; of this Noble family... yet.
