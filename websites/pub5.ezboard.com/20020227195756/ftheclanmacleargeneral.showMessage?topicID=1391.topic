1) Do we wish to use it?<br>
2) If so, do we want it separated into categories?<br>
- Money (and what would the money be used for?)<br>
- Tradeskill Items<br>
- Spells and Research<br>
- Armor<br>
- Misc<br>
3) I have an open character slot and am willing to create a druid for the purpose of actually holding the items.  It is possible that one character may run out of room.  Are you willing to use a character slot for this purpose? <p><a href="//home.attbi.com/~geist22/lanadena2.jpg"><center>

If everyone is in agreement that it should be used, then I'll take Ethroth up on his offer of of creating a druid.  I spent some time working on one yesterday, but just couldn't find the right name so scrapped for the moment.  Then we can have two &quot;bankers&quot; so to speak. <p><a href="//home.attbi.com/~geist22/lanadena2.jpg"><center>

You probably will end up overlooking people who are perfectly trustworthy and may be more willing or able to assist than many of higher status.  Some of us may never gain guild rank, because we don't level enough to be able to complete the quests on which that rank is based, and/or don't get enough play time to do so.  This could be/become the basis for an unhealthy attitude, or more likely could lead to the erroneous perception of an unhealthy attitude.  Status isn't everything, and every time something comes down to a matter of status (be it actual clan rank, or simply some other form of status) somebody's feelings get hurt.  Look at all the fuss we had over who should be admitted to the Inner Court, for example.  Often such actions of basing things like this on status lead to the &quot;younger&quot; members feeling unappreciated or just plain left out. As a member of the &quot;younger&quot; demographic, and someone who has been in the clan for a relatively long time, I can certainly say it's hard to find ways in which I can feel usefull to the clan (with the exception of being the comic relief <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) You know the people here, you know who you can trust without a doubt and who maybe needs a little more time to prove themselves (not saying that anyone in our group is dishonest, just that some may not yet really be well known to everyone).  I agree that such a thing should be handled by someone trustworthy and someone who the majority of the clan can vouch for.  But don't judge us by our status...&quot;Spectamur Agendo&quot;.<br>

Just my view from down here, <br>

I am not comfortable handing 1k pp items over to anyone for them to hold. Call me old and jaded, but I've been screwed by clan vaults before. And what happens when someone leaves the guild? What do they have rights to take with them, and what belongs to MacLear? It's a messy political thing, and leads to a lot of bad feelings and anger. I think that's why we haven't had one up to this point, because it causes too much confusion. If we were a huge guild, I could see it but other than that we are a small hard working group and I'd hate to see that get messed up on this. It doesn't matter if the guild banker is the guild leader, or a brand new member... the risks could potentially be the same. I know of an uber guild that lost an account with 2 characters full of items on eBay, and that person was an officer and a founding member. <br>
<br>
I guess what I am saying is this: I think listing the items is good. I think that keeping them on someone's character is bad. I personally won't use a clan vault/banker for my own jaded reasons.  <p><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~geist22/engelsign.jpg> </img><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/btheclanmaclear.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ravnanger>Ravnanger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>High Shaman and Noble</span><br>  Posts: 215<br> <font color=#330000>(2/11/02 12:55:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmacleargeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1391.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guild Vaults</span><hr size=1> Hmmmm... Of course Rank does not mean eveything. In regard to what i said..You are right we do not know each other very well and with all the new members we do need some way to measure who would get the hassle of being a bank. A thane has put some time into the guild, so has (theoretically) a bigger stake in the guild. Saying that though I KNOW there are people who are not of any rank who are perfectly suited for the job and have been around a long time. People who have shown to be of great character.  So what to do.....There is always a chance to get burned letting someone have these items and moneys to hold. If we are going to have a banker we need some criteria that pleases the majority of MacLears. Thane status was just a place to start, but doesn't have to be.<br>
<br>
I could be trusted to hold ANY  amount of Plat or items and see that it remains Clan material...But you all do not know that. Personally I do not want to be the  bank character, even though I offered, because I can foresee trouble. <br>
<br>
The reality is, if we are going to have a bank and and acounting of clan donated stuff we need a banker. Some how someone has to be trusted enough to use him/her as a bank. I WANT someone Honest and trustworthy (MacLear qualities anyway). Whom ever that is, Chieftess, HC, Thane, Noble, Regular member, I don't care as long as its someone right.<br>
<br>
So we have a list and we have a banker. Those that wish to hold their property and PP can but still list the stuff. Those that have no room and trust the banker give it to him/her and list the stuff. I really do not think there will ever be anything really valuable in it anyway. (fungi, shammy epic, etc) None of us are sooo rich we can  afford to not  sell our equipment. (for the most part) If yer worried about stuff going missing, then give it to Lana or one of the HC and they can post it in guildmagic and then give it to the banker.<br>
<br>
Well theres a couple more copper from me. Post some more..tis why Lanadena put this idea here me thinks. lets discuss this out so we are all happy. <p><a
