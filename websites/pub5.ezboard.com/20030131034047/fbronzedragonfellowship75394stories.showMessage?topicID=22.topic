<br>
Mother Tunare was truly blessing Norrath this day with a beautiful sunrise.  Standing on the hill enjoying the morning, Phyllis thinks back to the days she had spent with Mezllo Quantemp, if anyone had been close enough they would have seen a small smile quickly vanish, but that is another time and place.<br>
<br>
She had completed her morning lessons and now she wanted to see what Norrath has in store for her, Mother Tunare willing.<br>
<br>
Making her way towards the Inn, a common stop for most travelers who were heading out into the wilds of the Commonlands, Phyllis spotted a fellow Bronze Dragon Fellowship member known as Rowin, another paladin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tis a good sight you are to my eyes Phyllis&quot; Rowin said while approaching.<br>
<br>
Phyllis could easily see that he had been in some type of fight, &quot;I see. What happened to you Rowin, did you make yet another enemy or perhaps your girlfriend finally realized you are not the type to settle down?&quot;<br>
<br>
Grumbling to no one in particular, &quot;Humph, my girl friend. I should be so lucky,&quot; leaning forward and hugging Phyllis he continued with her towards the inn. &quot;I have been having other troubles though. A witch by the name of Iszabelle has been making accusations about our guild members and me. Her tongue drips venom.&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly feeling a chill run up her spine Phyllis glances around looking for someone or thing, but there was nothing around. &quot;Hum&quot; thinking out loud. <br>
<br>
&quot;What is it?&quot; Rowin inquired. <br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing sweetie&quot; stopping to open the inn door.' &quot;Now Rowin how can I help?&quot; said Phyllis<br>
<br>
Stepping in and waiting for Phyllis to follow Rowin continued, &quot;As I was saying the lady by the name of Iszabelle had a message for a female paladin within our guild. As fate would have it I ran into you good Phyllis for you see, the message she gave was meant for you!&quot;<br>
<br>
Raising an eyebrow, &quot;Me&quot; Phyllis looking interested, yet puzzled.  &quot;What was this message?&quot; she asked while handing the merchant a list of items she needed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Iszabelle told me that you have something of hers she wanted back&quot; pausing to look around, &quot;and that she would kill you to have it in her possession once again!&quot; Rowin said.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have nothing of value&quot; Phyllis answered back, &quot;you know we can not horde money and such. For it is against our vows.&quot;<br>
<br>
Turning quickly around facing the closed door with her blade ready, Phyllis scanned the area for any signs of someone hidden by magic, nothing. Shaking her head Phyllis was sure she had felt the breath of someone on the nape of her neck.<br>
<br>
Phyllis<br>

Iszabelle seemed surprised that Phyllis had not returned home with the news of her father's death.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hum&quot; thinking to herself, &quot;the poor girl must not have received the news yet.&quot; This would be one more weapon she could use against the righteous paladin to break her with.<br>
Iszabelle watched as Phyllis and Rowin entered the Inn and could barely contain her excitement.<br>
<br>
She moved up closer to Phyllis. She was so close to Phyllis that she could smell the mild perfumes she had used earlier that morning. Iszabelle took a breath and kissed Phyllis on the nape of her neck. A tradition that her former master did right before she took their life.<br>
<br>
The shadows twisted and melted away from Iszabelle as she revealed herself. Rowin's eyes grew wide as he saw Iszabelle appear before Phyllis.<br>
<br>
Phyllis said, &quot;Greetings&quot;.<br>
<br>
Iszabelle grinned at Rowin and said &quot;Thanks for luring Phyllis here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rowin stood up straight and grumble &quot;I did no such thing.&quot;<br>
<br>
Phyllis said &quot;He didn't lure me here and don't attack my friend with such accusations you venomous pit viper!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Phyllis don't be blinded by Rowins supposed good deeds&quot; trying her best to look honest, Iszabelle continued, &quot;you call me a pit viper and such is he!&quot;<br>
<br>
Seeing the look of anger on Rowin's face she pressed her point, &quot;Phyllis darling, he will turn against the guild as sure as day turns into night.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You foul witch,&quot; Rowin states firmly as he pulls forth his blade, &quot;you shall pay with your life for spreading such lies!&quot;<br>
<br>
Phyllis quickly steppes between the two, &quot;Do not let her words poison your thoughts Rowin, sheath thy blade.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Remember this! I shall only say it once. The Plague has come and it's our duty to wipe you and those of the light from the lands of Norrath, &quot; shouted Iszabelle.<br>
<br>
&quot;We shall cure this land of the blight called Plague Bringers. Pray thee Iszabelle that I can not get the guilds to unite against your kind,&quot; Phyllis says with the watchful eye of a trained warrior.<br>
<br>
Seeing that Phyllis was looking for an excuse to wield her blade against her, Iszabelle stepped back and the shadows swallowed her up.<br>
<br>
Phyllis' muscles visibly rippled as adrenaline pumped through her body in anticipation of battle.  Phyllis shouted out in anger &quot;Evil Spawn of Chaos show yourself! My blade shall drip with your blood and the Plague Bringers<br>
shall fall from the grace of their gods. Let the rivers run red with your blood so that others can see that your ways are wrong.&quot;<br>
<br>
Phyllis took a deep breath and shouted out &quot;You foul witch, I shall help you find your grave!&quot;<br>
<br>
Isazabelle spat out, &quot;'Tis my grave that gives me comfort. What shall I put on your tome!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You world is a web which entraps you more firmly as you struggle to control your pitiful, worthless life. And in the center of the web sits the Great Spider of your greed.  As it touches the strands of the web, you jerk like a<br>
puppet, and vainly believe that it is you who is in control of your destiny&quot;<br>
<br>
Phyllis shouts &quot;Then show yourself Iszabelle! Don't hide in the shadows! Lord Erollisi Mar shall judge thee!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Lies, Paladin! For even your greatest success is your ultimate failure. Your life is all but a mere illusion, wealth, fame, fortune are but fleeting things,&quot; Iszabelle said.<br>
<br>
Phyllis spat out in return,  &quot;My god protects me from your foul magic. I shall never become a ghoul who serves evil. Come Necro, I have a blade waiting to taste your blood.&quot;<br>
<br>
A tendril of thought crept into Iszabelle's mind.  Glancing around for a wizard or some other who might have might have charming magic. &quot;Vril, how dare you bother me now,&quot; almost dropping her veil of darkness Iszabelle forces her mind to focus and the shadows gather around her once again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Leave me be, Vril, &quot;Iszabelle's replies to Vril through the tenuous tendril of thought the weak wizard had established, &quot;I am going to finish off Connor's last daughter tonight.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But Milady,&quot; Vril replied in a concerned manner, &quot;you must return. I can not explain, but you must.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sensing his anxiety, Iszabelle folds the shadows around herself. Reality parts and she gates.<br>

She was very pleased with the response from the audience today.  Kelee sat at the bar and had a few drinks too many.  Her words began to slur. She thought to herself, &quot;I didn't mean to drink that much.&quot;  She grabbed her backpack and headed out the door but mistakenly she went through the window.<br>
<br>
&quot;KELEE&quot; shouted the bartender.  Kelee quickly pulled her drums out and sang Selo's to make a quick escape.  <br>
<br>
Kelee had enter the Commonland. It was such a beautiful day. Kelee took the time to walk to the nearby inn near the mountian. She noticed that many travelers were speaking of a possible fight near the inn.  Kelee being curious had began to sing Selo's to catch the action.<br>
<br>
As Kelee approached the end.  She had noticed a few of her fellow guild members.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Greetings Phyllis and Rowin&quot; Kelee said with a smile on her face as she hugged them both. &quot;What is this fight I hear about that is to take place?&quot; <br>
<br>
Phyllis's face was flushed. You could see the anger that grew. &quot;Phyllis let the angry go. Anger is a seed to the evil side.&quot; Kelee said as she started to sing Kelin's Lugubrious Lament to calm her down and for her to realize what was happening.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now what happened?&quot; Kelee raising and eyebrow.<br>
<br>
&quot;She gated just like that. We were to much competiton for her&quot; Rowin said loudly. <br>
<br>
&quot;Who?&quot; Kelee replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;Iszabelle is her name. All I know that she's evil and said that I have something of her's that she would kill for&quot; Phyllis said as she sat on the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have heard of Iszabelle; however, I have not met this person. I will have to do some research to see if I can help you Phyllis&quot;  Kelee said as she place her hands on Phyllis's shoulders.<br>

She heard from traveling bards that there was a gathering at Runnyeye.  She was nearby and decided to stop and take a look around.<br>
<br>
Iszabelle had enter a dark sinster dungeon. She could smell the dirty gnolls. Magic glistened around Iszbelle as she casted and she disappeared into the dark.  She was protected by the dark blanket and begun to explore the dungeon. She heard a group near the King's room.  Iszabelle recongized the guild name and was beginning to enjoy the night that she may able to take a soul. She had walked into the room.<br>
<br>
Iszabelle shouted &quot;I have come to take a soul.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Not as long as I am here!&quot; Molina shouted defensely. &quot;You'll have to go through me first.&quot;<br>
<br>
Iszabelle thinking to herself 'that can be arranged Molina'.<br>
<br>
Iszabelle laid eyes upon a wizard named Warpoet.  He was stunning. She begins to chant and a mystical light mist blanket the room.  Finally the room had cleared, Izabelle and Warpoet were alone. She begins to chant again. Warpoet aware of his action and unable to resist the spell, he leaned over and kissed Iszabelle.  Iszabelle giggled and was thinking 'I love this'. The light mist started to fade and members were returning.  In the shadow, a wolf appeared. Tweani grumbled, &quot;If Kelee was here, she would rip you apart&quot; as she lifted her paw to scratch behind her right ear.<br>

She had returned home and laid down to rest. She fell asleep not knowing what was about to happen.  <br>
<br>
Iszabelle waiting for the right moment to begin Molina's turmoil.  Realizing that she was fast asleep, Iszabelle began to chant.  The room filled with heavy blue mist, Molina began to dream.<br>
<br>
Molina had found herself wandering the woods. It was dark and cold.  She didn't recognize the area. In the distance, she caught a light flickering.  She slowly headed in that direction. She approached and notice a wood elf stripped of her armor. The wood elf moaned near the fire.  Three entities had surrounded the wood elf and lifted her upon the alter.  Molina stood frozen unable to move or help the wood elf. A Teir'dal came out and had tied the wood elf down and then he began to take out tools.  The wood elf released a cry of pain.  The Teir'dal began to carve a marking into the wood elf's shoulder. Molina recognized Iszabelle when she was her in the background watching.  Molina had to urged to jump and and to defend the wood elf but she was unable to.  Molina watched Iszabelle slowly walked to the wood elf.  Iszabelle had raise a bright glowing stone and placed it on the shoulder where the Teri'dal had finished carving.  The wood elf let a scream and had passed out.  Molina could feel the pain that she was going through.<br>
<br>
Molina tossing and turning in her sleep had awakened to a scream.  Molina's shoulder was burning.<br>

With my body still shaking and my mind still foggy, I stumble toward my armor, as I quickly dress, I call upon my family. &quot;Greeting this day to all of this wonderful family&quot; I shouted within the confines of the guild. As, everyone took the moment to bid me good morning, and I inquire as to if anything strange happened in their dreams last night, I received several unsteady responses, all stating they had dreamt the same as I. I then thought I needed to locate Kelee and speak with her about this. <br>
<br>
I found Kelee, wandering the lands of a new world called &quot;The Dreadlands&quot;. &quot;Kelee, my sister&quot; I greeted with warmth and a hug. In a tight voice I told my sister of the the guild, we needed to talk. &quot;Aye&quot;, Kelee responds. &quot;I have dreamt of a wood elf, one of our brethren, being used as a tool for Iszabelle's vile ways.&quot; Kelee, with a sad look in her eye, responds &quot;as have I&quot;. <br>
<br>
I, then tell Kelee that I must gather our family and find this vile creature and rid the world of her. &quot;Have you found any information in your travels, as to where her lair might be? how many followers she has?&quot; While Kelee was, giving me what little information she had, I suddenly felt the hairs on the back of my neck rise. I draw my sword and whip and took my battle stance, Kelee see's my reaction and also starts to sing her song of battle. &quot;What is it, sister&quot; Kelee implores. &quot;She is close&quot; I spat out between clenched teeth. <br>
<br>
From the shadows Izsabelle steps into sight, cackling her menacing laugh. &quot;So, I finally, meet the one called, Kelee&quot;. With a roar, I lunge at her as she steps back into the shadows, laughing at my feeble attempt. <br>
<br>
Izsabelle, with her evil smile, says &quot;After I have take then soul of Conner's last living child I shall go for the one you love most, Kelee&quot;. &quot;He shall be mine.&quot; &quot;I will use them as my puppets, to destroy this guild which you both hold so dear.&quot; Izsabelle, steps into the shadows again and disappears, even with my tracking abilities, her shadows protect her well. <br>
<br>
&quot;We must get to Warpoet, whispers Kelee, both of us still trembling with the thought of her taking even one life of our family. &quot;No, we must first get to Phyllis, find out what it is that Izsabelle wants with her.&quot; <br>
<br>
As I tell Kelee to go travel the lands more, find out what she can to be of use, I call upon, Chantrelle, a druid with magical powers that can transport us quickly all over the kingdom and Khaldron, a cleric that can help restore the health of those in trouble. I warn the family to travel together, to hunt in groups and watch one anothers backs. <br>

&quot;Before you track Chantrelle down, Can you give this to Elewin.&quot; as Kelee handed Molina a scroll. &quot;See what she can make of this letter.  My skills in that language is poor.&quot;<br>

<br>
Heard from the druid ring where Kelee, Molina, Khaldron, and Chantrelle in the Western part of the Commonlads, they look over to find a pillar if fire in the camp of the deadly Dervish Cutthroats.  There were only a few close by outside the pillar... a half elven male, a wood elven female, and a high elven female... all looking as if they've been through a war and about to die.  With them was what looked like an earth elemental.<br>
<br>
The fire dies, and who emerges from it is a gent of only 3 feet in hieght wearing  a spectacular looking robe.  As the flames die down more, lying on the ground were 6 different cutthroats who appearantly surrounded the gnome.  They looked quite dead and burnt to a crisp.<br>
<br>
From a larger tent, a Dervish Thug emerges.  A massive ogre, built like a mountain and 8 times the gnomes size at least.  He looks around, seeing his dead comrads, then glaresa at the little magi.  &quot;You....&quot;, he growls at the gnome.  &quot;You did this... you kill me fweinds!  I KILL YOU NOW!&quot;  The gnome cockily replies, &quot;Bring it on, Ugly!&quot;  The gnome turns to the earth elemental while pointing at the Thug.  &quot;Kobenk!&quot;, he shouts.  &quot;ATTACK!  Give 'em all ya got!&quot;  Kobenk says, &quot;You got it Mildikin.&quot;, then punched his fist into the palm of his other hand, turns to the Thug and says, &quot;Let's rock!&quot;<br>
<br>
The Thug tries to defent himself, but Kobenk handily leads the fight with a series of punches and kicks you could almost see a monk doing.  Then the gnome hollars, &quot;Kobenk, immobilize him and move it!&quot;  Kobenk begins to use his abilities, and the Thugs feet sink into the ground.  &quot;GWAH!  I can't move!&quot;, shouts the Thug.  The gnome lets a low chuckle as he begins to chant softly.  Swirls of fire emerge from his tiny hands.  The ogre looks and his eyes widen, know good and well that whatever's coming, he can't run.  The gnome raises his arms and flings them to teh Thug yelling &quot;FLAAAAAAAAAME BOLT!&quot;.  Just then, a fireball the size of the gnome fires straight toward the Thug, and as the large Dervish mass gets engulfed in the fire he emits a blood curdling cry.. then falls face first into the ground.<br>
<br>
The small party of BDF members watches this from the druid ring and Molina grins.  &quot;That can only be one guy who'd cause that much chaos against evil.&quot;  Kelee can't help but to chuckle a bit at the remark.  They make thier way to the Dervish camp.  Molina shouts as they arrive, &quot;Hi, Mildikin!&quot;  Mildikin looks up from looking over the bystanders, seeing if they were okay.  &quot;Well well well, it's been a while Mo, and the rest of ya.  How've ya been?&quot;, Mildikin says in his usual genius tone.  He then turns to Khaldron.  &quot;Oh, good thing you're around.&quot;  He points to the three elffolk sitting on the ground hurting.  &quot;They were mobbed by those Dervish nasties I just cooked....&quot;  Khaldoren nods and grins.  &quot;Say no more, little guy.&quot;  He heals the elved, despite thier obvious shock that a dark elf is actually helping them.  Nonetheless they thank the BDF there for the help, and move on towards Freeport.<br>
<br>
Discussion of the recent events are told to Mildikin, to which he offers a helping hand.  &quot;I've never had trouble with the followers of the Plaguebringer, but someone's gotta make them fry if they try anything on you guys.  And that Isza...&quot; Just then Kobenk interrupts, &quot;Oh, yeah!  And you saw how I took down that big, slobbering, ugly oger with my bare hands!  If it weren't for ME representing Mildikin and I, he'd have gotten his arse handed to him!&quot;  Mildikin turns to Kobenk the plit second he finishes.<br>
  &quot;EXCUSE ME?  Who summoned who, you twit!&quot;<br>
  &quot;You're nothing without my braun, runt!&quot;<br>
  &quot;I can send you back to Brell and tell him you misbehaving, lout!&quot;<br>
  &quot;Gah!  Fine...&quot;  Kobenk throws a light fit as he just lost in a battle of wits.  &quot;Sorry, I'll shut up now...&quot;<br>
<br>
Kelee looks at Mildikin and his pet with her eyes crossed for a moment, then shakes her head saying under her breath, &quot;Okay.... Anyhow,&quot; she continues at a normal volume to Mildikin.  &quot;We are looking for Phyllis to let her know about Iszabelle's dark plan.  You are welcome to join us.&quot;  Mildikin nods.  &quot;I think I might.  Not only does she need to be stopped, but it gives me a chance to field test a few things I've recently tinkered together.&quot;  Chantrelle smiles and says to Mildikin, &quot;Leave it to you to find a reason to show off your gadgetry.&quot;  &quot;Hey, it's the other thing I do best!&quot;, beems Mildikin.  Molina says, &quot;Then what's the first hing you do best.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Blasting baddies to smitherines!&quot;<br>
<br>
This brought up a good chuckle, but what made it more entertaining was the fact the Mildikin could prove this rather well, even though he's been known to get in over his head many of times.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, we haven't time to spare, unfortunately.&quot; Kelee states.  &quot;Mildikin, have you seen Phillys recently.&quot;  Mildikin replies, &quot;Nope, but if I were her and I needed time to think and plan, I'd go and stay in the quarters in Highkeep.  The gaurds there are trained very well and they lot no one eveil come through without days upon days of proving themselves by killing orcs and gnolls.&quot;  The rest of the party nods and Khaldron says, &quot;Let's go there then.  We don't have a moment to lose.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mildikin nods, &quot;Right.  But we gotta be careful.  We have to run through Kithikor forest... &quot; He then looks to the darkening sky.  Darkening with the night. &quot;... and it's getting dark...&quot; <p>Mildikin Quartzworth<BR>

Roots that seem to be desperately grasping for something, anything that would give them a strong foundation to grow upon.<br>
<br>
A warrior in blackened armor, stands with in the small cave entrance.  Her matted hair resembles the roots around her and she too seems to be looking for something.  Turning to face the darkness below Phyllis begins the descent into the depths of the earth in search of an ancient relic.  A relic that could, if used properly, rip all of the mana from a spell caster, leaving them defenseless.  A relic that the great nation of Erudin tried to burry and forget about, a relic that was so successfully forgotten about that it has no known name, nor is the creator know.  Nevertheless, it is a relic that could destroy those that bring chaos upon the land.  It could destroy those who killed her family members…<br>
<br>
Elsewhere…<br>
        A swirling mist in a boiling cauldron suddenly solidifies taking the shape of a small devilish creature. An Imp, a creature that many wizards use to guard their treasures and collect information through out Norrath.  Jumping down to the floor the small creature scuttles off into the shadows of a long forgotten wizards tower in High Pass.<br>
<br>
Moments Later…<br>
        “Yes Safvas, what have you found,” a hooded figure says while looking up from an ancient text.<br>
“Yes, master in time I shall tell you, but first the price you must pay for my service,” looking up at O’Berton, Safvas the Imp licks its lips.<br>
“Fine,” O’Berton says as he roles up one of his robes sleeves and reveals an arm with tiny little scars all along its length.  Safvas moves so fast that to most, he would have been a blur.  Landing on O’Bertons exposed flesh he opens his mouth and bites down on the arm.  As he consumes the lifeblood of O’Berton Safvas looks at the dazed human.  Humans seem to almost get a certain twisted pleasure from this he has noticed.  Some even seek his kind out for the experience.  <br>
<br>
O’Berton, not wanting to expire from lack of blood pushes Safvas away. “Now, what is it that you have seen?”<br>
<br>
Moving to the table Safvas laps up ale from a large tankard and continues, “ The one who walks among shadows has begun as you predicted Master.  Her prey has taken an unexpected move though.  The one who walks among light has sought out the most feared relic by spell casters…  I fear she has discovered its former resting place…  She will most likely figure out who has it now…”<br>
<br>
“Master, I would prepare…”<br>

I had been teleporting those adventurers who needed safe and quick passage from this land to that all morning.  <br>
<br>
I had run into a monk that needed to be in West Commons he had died there and Mother Tunare saw fit to resurrect him in Qeynos.  I met him at the boarder, tired and clothed in cloth rags.  He had been told he had a limited amount of time to collect his things or they would be cast to the winds.   <br>
<br>
I took it as my mission that morning to help this lost soul and off we went into West Commons where upon arrival he tried to pay me I waved him off,  asked him to remember this kindness as a gift of Mother Tunare herself and to pass it to another needy soul should he happen upon one.<br>
<br>
I turned around to go when off in the distance there by the Dervish Cutthroats camp I heard familiar voices.  &quot;Could it be so far from home?  Why, yes&quot;, there was Mildikin boasting of his talents as a Wizard.  By his side stood the Lovely Lady Kelee, a wonderful bard, she played most beautifully and Lady Molina, an experience Druid, along with friends Khaldorn, Chantrelle and Kobenk.<br>
<br>
As I approached the group I could see the mood change from light to apprehensive.  Worry crossed every ones face.  I over heard them say they would travel to High Hold to find Phyllis. <br>
<br>
I reached them just as they turned to leave.  &quot;Oh, hello Kat.&quot; Mildikin said &quot;No time for pleasantries now, you must find all you can who serve in the Bronze Dragon Fellowship and explain to them the evil that is afoot&quot;. I must have had a look of shock and confusion as he bid me to follow as he explained the situation as we walked towards the dark forbidding woods know as Kithor forest.<br>
<br>
As we reached the path that lead deep into the heart of Kithor. I was sent on my way to warn others of the impending danger that awaited all of us.  My mind reeled with the thoughts that someone or something would do harm to even on of my brother en, I who had never in anger taken a life, vowed that if ever met with this Izsabelle that it would be with caution and a resolve to find someway to kill this evil thing.<br>
<br>
However, Molina had warned me not to challenge her but to go for help as quickly as possible should this occur. That I could be used against my own should she catch me in a weak moment.  In great respect for her, I would do as told. <br>
<br>
I was off uneasy about the task at hand, who was this Izsabelle would I recognize her? Or would I not see her coming.  All of my talents and training were now needed to follow through, to take this to the High Lord Rashek himself. Simple enough a task, but then again even the most simple of task could hold dangers untold if one were not wary.  I told myself &quot;No distractions, no other paths must I take till this one was completed. Life and the Light were at stake here&quot;.    <br>

It had been a long weary day of fighting. It seemed that evil had lurked<br>
<br>
round every corner and in every dark shadow this day. My arms aching<br>
from<br>
welding my staff and my bags heavy with the spoils of war I trudged on.<br>
Just a little ways farther and i could sell my booty, then off to camp<br>
for the night. Ah ahead at last the druid ring that I have sold my<br>
spoils<br>
before. Will I get a far price today. I cast spirit of snake just to be<br>
sure. the little druid girl cant resist my charisma when I use that. How<br>
<br>
much will you give for this rusty old sword I ask. She looks apon me<br>
warmly and we begin to bargain. I sell my goodies and  buy some supplies<br>
and some fine wine<br>
and bid her farewell. Now off to make camp in the nearby hills.<br>
Quickly I make camp and yell out loud good night dragons and safe<br>
journeys<br>
home to those that you love. Faint whispers of thanks return to my ears<br>
I<br>
suppose not many venturing out in these woods this late at night.<br>
 Resting my head and closing my eyes sleep begins to make its way<br>
throughout my aching body. just at that point  where imagination becomes<br>
<br>
as if real a sound stirs my senses back to life, a leaf? or twig?  no  a<br>
<br>
foot step soft but real no not a dream. Slowly I grasp my staff every<br>
mussel tense and ready to battle. Then softly like the wend a voice<br>
calls to me from the dark,<br>
Slaor is that you?<br>
Could it be I thought could it rely be her.<br>
the one that so long ago thought me the ways of the light of tunar? She<br>
had left so quickly I didn't have time thank her for all she had don nor<br>
<br>
to tell her of my feelings of love that had grown. Could it be after all<br>
<br>
this time? Quietly the words came from my lips sounding strange to my<br>
own ears<br>
Kat is that you?<br>
Yes dear Slaor it is I Katreena. I heard you yell out good night to the<br>
guild and came quick as i could.<br>
 Why did you not answer back? I asked.<br>
 I was farad that I might be discovered she replied.<br>
These woods are safe I cleared them my self i said. But no sooner<br>
did the words leave my mouth then I saw  it in her eyes. Those bright<br>
sparkling little druid eyes of hers full of wonder and adventure had<br>
changed. What I saw at that moment was not bright wonderment but<br>
something else. I knew that look I knew it too well. although she would<br>
never admit it. It was there I could see it. It was the look of fear.<br>
What has shaken this innocent ilf and chased from her the joy of life I<br>
wondered.<br>
 Anger began to rise in me as i pondered this question. For it was plane<br>
to see that that this fear ran true and deep.<br>
 I said to her, Come share some of my wine and warm yourself by my fire<br>
Katreena, tell me of your journeys.<br>
A cold chill went down my spine as these words left my lips, isn't that<br>
what I had said so many seasons ago, in the cold dark night of the<br>
frosty tundra. She was so cold and<br>
looked so out of place in that barren land.<br>
We spent many nights by that fire with stories of far away lands. By day<br>
she would teach and by night I would protect.<br>
Yes I am weary of travel and need some rest Slaor you have always been<br>
so kind. I can only stay a short while though I have an important<br>
message to deliver.<br>
A message? I asked. To who?<br>
Lord Rashek himself. she replied.<br>
He is in Lavastorm. I said. A difficult task for you. who sent you on<br>
this journey?<br>
Molina and Lady Kelee. Im a little nervous about this delivery though.<br>
She continued. Lord Rashek is a powerful man.<br>
 You have met lord Rashek before. I can not believe that that is what<br>
has unnerved you so. Tell me now the truth What is it that has shaken<br>
you? You have always been<br>
honest with me Kat do not stop now.<br>
I had hoped to spare you of this news Slaor. But first we must talk of<br>
our love for each other.<br>
This caught me by surprise and I flinched but said nothing.<br>
As she laid her head on my chest she continued. I have known of your<br>
love for me for some time now. Ever sense the time we spent together in<br>
everfrost.<br>
You left so suddenly and with out a word. I said<br>
Don't interrupt! This is hard enough, she snapped. Taking a deep breath<br>
she continued. I realized that I loved you too Slaor. And that is why I<br>
left.<br>
 I felt a tear run down my chest as she spoke<br>
I was too young for love of this depth,  my hart and my head were<br>
spinning in chaos. You a Barbarian and me an ilf what would the rest of<br>
the world think? I had to run. I had<br>
to have time to think.<br>
As more tears ran down my chest I knew that she had held this a deep<br>
secret and never before admitted it aloud.<br>
She continued, I wandered here and there fighting with many others<br>
trying to keep my mind off of you. Then one day I fought with this brave<br>
warrior. He had a lust for<br>
adventure such as none I had known, and in him I could hide from my<br>
feelings.<br>
Soon however those feelings came back. Those feelings of love. This time<br>
I was ready I had had time to prepair. This love had blossomed slowly<br>
and grown strong with time.<br>
You  see Slaor I am to be wed in 2 days time.<br>
My hart in agony and my mind in a blur all I could do was wisper, go on<br>
tell me who this brave warrior may be.<br>
More tears ran down my chest.<br>
Do not be angry Slaor. she continued more labored than before, You know<br>
him well.<br>
Caddil. I gasped, that bastard, my best friend!<br>
It all fit now. He had told me he was in love but kept secret her name.<br>
Rage flew through my mind but was stopped dead in its track as I felt<br>
more tears from run down my side. She lifted her head and her gaze met<br>
mine.<br>
Do not be angry with him Slaor it's not his fault. It was I who asked<br>
him not to tell you. I wanted to spare you the pain.<br>
<br>
I told him of my love for you and he was with you all this time. How could I be so blind<br>
<br>
Please Slaor  please turn your anger to me for I made him give his word not to tell you <br>
knowing hi was an honerable man.

Dusk has just settled into the night.  They could hear from a distance in the forest the wild, chilling cackle of the undead.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; grumbles Mildikin.  &quot;That's a laugh only a mother could love.&quot;<br>
<br>
Katreena nods at the remark, and the entire lot of use were obviously nervous.  &quot;Her's the deal, gang.&quot; Mildikin starts. &quot;We either wait out the night and give that witch a chance to cause more trouble, or we prepare to high tail it while those of you that follow religion pray we make it though alive.&quot;  Kelee nods and states as she pulls out her drum, &quot;The safes route would be to run along the edge of the forest past Rivervale's enterence.&quot;  Mildikin nods in agreement.  Chantrelle says wearily, &quot;So, are we ready?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;YAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
We turned to the yell just in time to see Kobenk in melee with a torture healer, and the torture healer swinging with the worn staff it had, hitting Kobenk, and shattering the earthly mass he is (or in this case, was) to nothing more then bits of rock and pebble.  Molina mubmles, &quot;Oh, my god... it killed Kobenk...&quot;  Then Khaldron adds, &quot;That bastard.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;MY PET!&quot;  Mildikin shouts.  &quot;NOOOOO!&quot;  Then the torture healer looks to the group, eyes glowing with darkness, a smile thirsty for blood, and a heart hungry for death.  Kelee starts playing the drum and says rapidly, &quot;Follow me!&quot;<br>
<br>
They litterally dash thier way through the edge of the forest as Kelee beated to the sounds of Selo's Accelorando, and they managed to outrun the vile undead and pass Rivervale's enterence before they knew it.<br>
<br>
Shortly after, we reach the stone walkway leading to Highhold Pass.  The grumble of the residant orcs filled that particular area.  As they walked into the Pass, the orcs were doing battle with an intrepid group.  Mildikin says, &quot;Okay, we can get by as long as that party is a distraction to the orcs.&quot;  They make it passed thier easily and sit to rest a spell.<br>
<br>
A small fire was set up and the party had a bite to eat and some rest.  Mildikin starts to set a small round object with what seems to be a wheel on the bottom.  The front of this strange little metal thing has a small hole on top and a larger hole with glass in the front.  &quot;What is that little thing?&quot; asks Molina.  &quot;It looks strange.&quot;   Mildikin chuckles and replies, &quot;It's one of my stalking probes.  Made it myself!  I'll be using it to scout the road ahead for any potential dangers.&quot;  He, then, closes his eyes, holds a hand out and snaps his fingers.  The probe immediately starts to move on its wheel down the chasmway of the Pass.<br>
<br>
The stalking probe moves its way past the guards and citizens who look at the thing oddly.  The stalking probe stops to view a male wood elven bard.  The probe hums in Mildikin's mind, &quot;Known humanoid being detected.... Verify identification...&quot;.  The haunting and romantic voice of the bard as he sings and plays his mandolin  and his shy dimeanor is what makes him truely distinguishable form any other bard in Norrath.  Mildikin says, &quot;Ah... I see.  Probe, return.&quot;  The probe comes back to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is it you saw?&quot;, Khaldoren inquires.  Mildikin mumbles, &quot;Never thought I'd see him anytime soon.  Heh...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Who?  Who?&quot;, Molina asks in anticipation.  &quot;Who did you see?&quot;<br>
<br>
Mildikin looks down the way and grins.  &quot;Lyrick's just around the corner.&quot;<br>
<br>
Just that moment, Lyrick runs around the corner and spots the BDF group.  He smiles, his deep dark brown eye glimmering with the light of the morning sun, looking slightly galiant and quite handsome.  &quot;Ah, I figured the metal thing was your's, Mildikin.  How do you all do?&quot;  He grins shyly.  &quot;It's nice to see you all again.&quot;, Lyrick says in his normal, quiet soothing voice. <p>Mildikin Quartzworth<BR>

Kelee went to the inn to see if the bartender would have any information about Phyllis.  Phyllis visited this place quite often.  <br>
<br>
The noise of music and people laughing make Kelee smile. She knew how the two mix so well to make life a bit easier.  As Kelee entered the inn, she notices O'berton in the far right corner overlooking the water. <br>
<br>
&quot;Greeting O'berton&quot; as Kelee laid her hand on his shoulder.<br>
&quot;Hello Milady,What brings you to these mountains,&quot; as O'berton looked back to the water.<br>
&quot;You look troubled, O'berton,&quot; as she grabbed a chair and sat down. <br>
&quot;Aye, that I am,&quot; as he ran his hand through his hair. &quot;I'm afraid that the news that I have given to Phyllis was not pleasant.&quot; <br>
&quot;Oh my! Does she know about her father's death?&quot; as Kelee leaned forward to hear the answer.<br>
Oberton looked down and nod. &quot;She does know and she said this death will not effect her...but she's hurting. Damn I know she's hurting.  She would not admitt to that.  She's a strong will lady.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kelee grabbed O'berton's hand and said we will help her through this.  &quot;Do you know where I can find her?&quot;<br>
<br>
O'berton sighed. &quot;I'm afraid not.  She left town immediately.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I see.&quot; Kelee stood up to stretch.  We have to track her. <br>
<br>
&quot;Kelee, she did mention something about swamps.&quot; as O'berton took a sip of his Ale.<br>
<br>
A look of curiosity came over Kelee's face. Kelee rejoined the crew at the camp. <p><img src=http://www.mmpog.net/images/kelee%20logo.gif></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cac3ab><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/umolinaeverlost.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Molina Everlost</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>BDF Officer, Sister of the Initiates</span><br>   <font color=#c54400>(8/1/00 2:51:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: HighHold Keep</span><hr size=1> As, Kelee went off to talk with the man O'berton, I talked with the group standing here. &quot;By the look on Kelee's face, she must have some news for us&quot;, I said. <br>
<br>
While waiting on Kelee, I told the others I needed to stock up on some supplies and find the others, so they know of our journey and what we must do. With a link built of love, friendship and trust, I closed my eyes and sought to locate, Rashek, the one that brought all these mights warriors together, to do just as we were doing, to banish the world of evil. Rashek had not been heard from in several days and I needed his guidance. As I ran inside the keep to seek my supplies, I whisper &quot;Rashek, my dear friend, we need you, come to us.&quot; With a weak reply from Rashek, &quot;Kelee has told me of your quest, and I shall be with you soon, I must finish here in Lavastorm and then Chantrelle can bring you to me.&quot; In return I asked if Kuvanu with with him and he replied with a smile. <br>
<br>
Feeling better that I knew the whereabouts of our leader, I got the supplies I sought and heard a cry from below my feet. &quot;There are 3 cries, Xelus&quot; I smile to myself at this new brave enchanter that has just recently joined our family. I tell the, Khaldron, Chantrelle and Mildikin to inform Kelee that I am going to bid our newest member a good day and let him know of the vile creature seeking out to destory our family. <br>
<br>
As I head to the basement of the keep, Kelee in her light, airy voice, tells me as not to worry the others &quot;Molina, we must hurry, I think I know where Phyllis had gone and she is in danger I fear&quot;. I close my eyes as my arms starts to ache with the mark on my shouler, &quot;ok Sister, where do you think she has gone?&quot; &quot;To the swamp&quot;, Kelee replies. &quot;Sister, go to her, don't let her be alone&quot;, I make it to Xelus, as they are engaged in battle and infor him of the happenings. &quot;Do not fight alone, young one, there is evil about, in the name of Iszabelle&quot; he nods his agreement and I tell the other's, &quot;I have sent Kelee to find Phyllis while we go find, Rashek and Kuvuan and bring them with us. We need to be strong and prepared&quot;. <br>
<br>
With the ache in my shoulder growing stronger and my body feeling weaker and weaker. I start so shiver as I turn to walk back to the other, feeling cold and hot at the same time. In a weak voice, I whisper to the frist waiting in Highpass for me &quot;Khaldron...&quot;<br>

Eldoren though that he'd die of the smell if he didn't find a clean inn.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why hello young elf!&quot;  Said the inn keeper as Eldoren walked through the door holding his nose.  &quot;Where have you traveled from son?&quot;  asked the inn keeper.<br>
<br>
&quot;From the Faydark, sir.&quot; said Eldoren still trying to catch his breath from the stench of Freeport.  &quot;Where am I anyway?&quot; asked Eldoren.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well shaw, you're in the East Commonlands son!&quot;  said the inn keeper.  &quot;How could you not know that?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Just got here by a teleporting druid.&quot; Said Eldoren in a sleepy tone.  &quot;Look, you have any beds?  I'm quite tired.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Right this way, son&quot;<br>
<br>
Eldoren got up from his bed exausted, but he had the urge to explore this land that he had been brought to.  He left the inn with a quick dash.  After many hours of exploration Eldoren found a large orc camp.  He had seen blue orcs before but never green ones.  He looked at the people fighting these creatures and asked to join them for he knew that orcs were bad everywhere.  He had a wonderful time sliting orc throat, but then he noticed that some people belonged to different guilds.  He asked how to get into guilds and figured that he had to get into one.  He had met a wood elf bardess by the name of Laylani in  the Commonlands and saw the name of her guild.  He read the name out loud.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Bronze Dragon Fellowship&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes it is a great guild with many good people&quot; said the female elf thatt reminded Eldoren so much of home.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Could I join this guild?&quot; Eldoren asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let me ask Kelee.&quot; she said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who is Kelee?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;One of the officers of the guild.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, ok.&quot; said Eldoren in excitment.<br>
<br>
&quot;She'll be here in a little while&quot; said Laylani.<br>
<br>
Eldoren talked with Laylani for a hour or so and learned more about her and the Bronze Dragons.  Finally Kelee arrived and she also was a female wood elf bardess.<br>
<br>
&quot;So you wish to join the Bronze Dragon Fellowship?&quot; said Kelee.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I do.&quot; <br>
<br>

Caddil had done much for Marr this day, slaying the undead creatures of the night.  However, he was still not satisfied, he was looking for something.  Marr would reveal his destiny to himself in time he thought.  <br>
   Suddenly he saw flashes of purple light whip fast across the terrains ahead of him.  &quot;Only one person that could be causing that&quot; Caddil said wiht a smirk.  He ran after the light, although his Spirit of the Wolf was no match for it.  Hours later, he finally caught up with the mystical beats of a hand drum.  &quot;Hello there Kelee!, ahhh and Molina, Khaldron, and Mildikin! What brings you all here my friends.&quot;  <br>
   What a lucky night, Caddil thought to himself.  Kelee, one of the loveliest and captivating bards he knew. Molina, another elven beauty, and she knew it, that little tease he chuckles.  Mildikin, the quirky, but always reasonable and battle ready gnome. And Khaldron, one of the very few Caddil trusted to support him in heavy battle.  &quot;We are here on a quest of lightbringing,&quot; Kelee said soothingly.  &quot;Ahhh, this may be my big break,&quot; Caddil said.<br>
&quot;As a warrior of Marr, I volunteer my services to all that is truthful,&quot; Caddil said, in his noblest voice.  &quot;There are others that we will need friends, a party of six will not be able to overcome this foe, no matter how pure our hearts.&quot;  <br>
    The night faded away, as plans were made, and old times were thought upon...<br>
<br>
    Elsewhere, a greater threat was growing, waiting for our adventurers to stumble unexpectedly into it.

Noticing for the first time, the throbing of malignant magic eminating from her shoulder.  Laying her gently upon the ground at his feet, he gently pulled back the cloth and armor to reveal an angry red swelling.  Growling, he opened himself up to the power of the gods, placing his hands over the welt, he closed his eyes, and reached out with his spirit.  &quot;Looking&quot; at the wound, he saw an inscription in his native tongue.  His clerical powers, not being strong enough to abolish the blight to Molina's body, he wrapped in a shroud of energy to try to hold back the effects.  Pouring energy into her wounds, he closed that which he could, though the blight still remained.  Growling with renewed effort, he sectioned it off again with the last of his energy, and withdrew his presence, watching her breathe more easily.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With a look of determination in his eye, Khaldron stood, and lifted Molina to a nearby bed.  After covering her with blankets, and smoothing her hair, he turned to his companions.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I've done what I can,&quot; he said with a sigh.  &quot;But I can only do so much.  This is a powerful curse laid upon her, and I can not combat it alone.  Watch her.  See that no harm comes to her.  Kelee, sing to her your songs which mend the flesh and the soul.  She needs all the help she can get.  What I've done drains both myself and her, so she will sleep until her energy is replenished.  See that her rest is not disturbed.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sitting at the end of the bed, he closed his eyes, and once again, reached out to the gods, only this time, rather than drawing thier power into himself, he released his spirit to them.  He sought counsel with the gods.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp First, he sought Innoruuk, Prince of Hate, though he doubted anything would be revealed by him.  His spirit strolling through Innoruuk's tower in the plane of Hate, he shuddered at the sights he saw, but knew that showing any weakness would detfeat all purpose of coming here.  He half walked, half glided into Innoruuk's throne room, and as the Prince of Hatred's gaze fell upon him, he felt a shiver of apprehension and awe shake his spine.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What brings you to me?&quot; Innoruuk spat seeing the priest who once called him master.  &quot;If you think I'll show you mercy for your kindness and let you back into the fold, be at easy that no soul would give me more pleasure to torment than yours.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Khaldron knew that Innoruuk would not give him any information willingly.  Wit, and quick thinking would be nessecary to learn anything from him.  He picked his words carefully to try to pry as much information as he could.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ah, Lord of Hate, you taught me better than that, when I was in your service.  I came not to ask anything of you, but to tell you of my grand accomplishment.  I have defeated a powerful curse, wroght by your own creations, and written in your name.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Laughing spitefully, he described what he knew of the curse, careful not to make any statements that might lead Innoruuk to see through his ruse.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You have failed in this quest little one,&quot;  Innoruuk chuckled, &quot;For while you may have beaten back the symptom, you've not yet cured the disease.  The stone was the key, and without it, your friend will never be free.  You can not pierce the viel between dreams and reality, you've lost this round!  Now be gone from my presence, the smell of kindness offends me.&quot;  With these words, Innoruuk waved a hand, and Khaldron was pushed from the room, and his spirit floated free in the void between the planes.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Next, he swept his soul to the temple of Rodcet Nife, and swam in the lakes, with the Kolandil Fish, until he approached one with a gleam intelligence in it's eye.  This one he swam up to, and queried.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hello, Prime Healer?&quot; He asked hopefully, &quot;I've need of one of your knowledge in combatting an evil curse.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The fish looked at him quizically and then dipped it's head, and then Khaldron was floating in a small cozy room, with two large comfortable chairs, and cheery fire crackling in a fireplace.  In one of these chairs sat Rodcet Nife, he motioned for Khaldorn to take the other.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Tell me of the curse, child,&quot; the god told him.  &quot;And I will tell you what I can.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Khaldron began his tale, describing the runes and sharing the information that Innoruuk unknowingly gave to him.  He told of his sleeping companion, and what he knew of the circumstances which lead to his trip to the gods.  In the magnificent presence of the god, he found barriers of emotion broken down, and discovered himself telling things that he'd spoken to no one about, having nothing to do with his mission.  He told of his childhood, of the guilt he felt for all of his prior evil deeds, he spoke of the feelings of rejection from the people as he tried to make them see him for what he was.  All of these things poured from him to hang in the air.  After telling his tales, he felt strangely relieved, as if a wieght had been lifted from his shoulders.  For the first time since he'd begun talking he truely looked at the god before him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Khaldron, this curse you've spoken of is very powerful.  You must find this stone which Innoruuk speaks of, and bring it to your friend.  Only with it's power might you turn back the curse.  You have done well in preventing it from spreading, and for that I commend you.  You must continue to watch, for it will spread if left untended.  This must not be allowed to happen.  Continue your vigil, and seek out the one who has caused this.  Only then will you be able to counteract such a curse, and see her healed.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Khaldron thanked the diety, and stood.  He closed his etheric eyes, and found his body, his link to the physical realm.  Willing himself down into his form, he snapped his eyes open, looking around to get his bearings.  As he stood, Molina stirred in the bed.  He walked to the bedside, and took his friends hand, looking into her sleepy eyes.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Soon, we'll have you better.  Soon...&quot; <p><html>

There was nothing I could do as I sank into darkness, expect hear the evil laughter of Iszabelle, in the land between dreams and reality. <br>
<br>
With Khaldron doing his best to ease the throb, asked Lady Kelee  to sing her sweet music. Kelee says, &quot;I shall sing for now, find Lyrick, for he has the same ability to mend her flesh and soul as I, and I must seek out Phyllis before she too has been infected by this plague that Iszabelle uses to destroy us.&quot; <br>
<br>
Off in Lavastorm, Lady Kuvanu at the side of Lord Rashek says &quot;what information comes from our daughter Molina?&quot; &quot;The link was cut short, my dear, something must be wrong, we must get to our family and help them. Evil is stalking us and we need to be united&quot;.<br>
<br>
As I lay in my unrestful sleep, in the world between dreams and reality, I beg of Mother Tunare, to give me strength to go on, to help those that need me. In a shimmering form she lays her hand on my sore shoulder, and in a airy voice says &quot;the evil she has places within your flesh is beep, you will be able to continue, but you must find the cure quickly, keep your family close as the love you share with them will keep you strong&quot;. With those parting words I hear the voices of those around me, talking about what battles lie ahead.....<br>
<br>
&quot;Find the others&quot; I whisper, as I slowly come back to the world or life. &quot;Iszabelle is gathering more people to her side, she now has a cleric of your same abilities, working with her, someone I have met in the past and will support Iszabelle's cause.&quot; &quot;Arye is her name and she wishes us the same evil, her master does, be as weary of her as the others&quot;, I say as my body drifts back into the land of dreams..... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ada07e><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/urasheklightedge.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rashek Lightedge</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lord Rashek, Guild Master</span><br>   <font color=#c54400>(8/4/00 2:54:48 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.goodnet.com/~saxon/minirash.jpg width=120 height=120></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: SHADOWS</span><hr size=1> Rashek stood at the edge of the Dark-Elven realm.  His eyes still stung from the noxious gases of the lavastorm.  The curse had begun.  The deep down fear that evil was taking a form had come to fruition.  That form had a name, &quot;Plague Bringers.&quot;<br>
<br>
That bitch Iszabelle was up to her old tricks.  That woman would continue to do what she did until someone stop her. Until someone snuffed out the filthy light of her existence once and for all.  Rashek's dearest wish was that he be the one to complete that joyous task.<br>
<br>
For now though, he needed his forces rallied behind him.  As they had dispersed across the land, bringing good, they had inadvertantly made themselves weak.  The smaller groups and individuals had become targets.  This could not be allowed to remain so.  Even now, Molina still lay weakened from the fetid touch of Iszabelle.  Rashek saw this to be his fault, his doing by want of his actions.<br>
<br>
He set forth now, his wife at his side, to bring his people together, and to hunt down and destroy Iszabelle and her diseased kin.  First port of call was to be his daughter and Khaldron, they would be the first needed.  Molina pure of heart, and Khaldron fighting valiantly with the Demons of his past.  Both equaly important to his plans.<br>
<br>
Light, as always, was dim in Nektulous.  Now was not the time to linger.  Righteous as he was, this was not a place to be, and hope to live for long.  Forces of darkness were strong here, a miriad of twisted souls inhabited the shadows around him.<br>
<br>
No, now was not the time to fight, the fight would be on his terms, not on those of the Plague Bringers.  Now was the time to decide what his terms would be.<br>

<br>
&quot;KHALDRON YOU SHALL PAY FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!&quot;<br>
<br>
Dekaarn clutched his staffs so tightly that splinters were pressing into his palms. Blood was running in rivulets down the deformed wood, mixing with the dried blood already there. His own, and others'. He stood there arms spread wide as in crucifixion, indeed the expression on his face would have matched the victim of such a fate. Of course, the victim wouldn't have had the gleam in his eyes that only pure hatred can bring. Dekaarn knew this because he had seen the expressions on the faces of his countless victims.<br>
<br>
Khaldron was an abomination. The bastard child of the Tier Dhal had forsaken his one true master, his one true family. FOR WHAT! for the friendship of the weak? the support of those ridiculous Fellowship fools?<br>
<br>
Of course the answer was yes. That was part of what seethed through Dekaarn's very blood. The rest was rage at what Khaldron had done. The treachorous little weasel had directly interfered with the actions of Iszabelle. <br>
<br>
Iszabelle, the one person Dekaarn respected. The one person Dekaarn saw any worth in. Iszabelle had been there when his family had been slain by those of the light. She had been there to guide his ways, to shape his mind. She had recognized pure unadulterated talent and intelligence and brutally shaped it to her needs. Rather than hate her for this, Dekaarn love her (as much as love had any meaning to him). She had given him purpose, direction. She had a vision he shared, a vision of hate.<br>
<br>
As Dekaarn shook with rage he heard his pet shifting behind him, it's bones almost creaking with the desire to rend flesh, any flesh.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's ok my sweet&quot; he said, the time has come. You shall have your flesh. <br>
<br>
&quot;Khaldron&quot; he whispered, shaking &quot;you will watch as I destroy those you love. You shall listen as they scream. And you shall stand by, helples, as I send their souls one by one to the netherworld.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;When you dream at night I will be there, When you walk in shadow I'll be there. When you think you are alone, you won't be. Fear me I tell you, because I am death incarnate!&quot; <br>

It came to Norrath through twisted magic’s that fey sorcerers had harnessed.  These very sorcerers did not seek this magic to help others, but to control all magic of this realm.  Deep, their magical incantations delved into the nether world seeking a source of power to animate the unbinder. Innoruuk , a selfish god with an acute hatred for the other prime powers, felt the fey sorcerers magical delving and opened up himself to it… As the sorcerers magical tendrils reached out, so did Innoruuk’s. Resulting in the death of all but one of the fey sorcerers, the chosen one. The war that ravaged the lands of Odus was all but forgotten, but by a few chosen.  Their existence has been unknown to all except the gods.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The water boiled up, spraying hot mud about scorching lesser beings to death, scaring all others with hideous burns.  Stones began to rise up from the muck, slowing assembling themselves into a towering monstrosity.  Phyllis, peering upward through trees and a magical field watched as her death slowly awoke.  <br>
<br>
“The Mother of ALL, please protect me and guide me to the truth.  Guide my blade to the heart of my enemies and smite them down with thy anger.  Guard my back and protect my soul, so that I might bring about your wishes…  The Mother of All, I pray to thee, “ Phyllis whispers to herself as she lowers her protective shield to begin combat…<br>
<br>
The sound of grating stones could be heard coming from the towering monstrosity.  A sound that resembled a voice, “You that has come to my resting place shall die if you fail my test!”  A giant foot of stone crashed down upon a tree next to Phyllis, knocking her off of her feet.  “Who are you, “ the giant stone golem asked?<br>
<br>
“I am Phyllis, first blood of the O’Connor family.  I claim the right of blood to that which you have,” shouting back to be heard over the grating sound of stone approaching her.<br>
<br>
“Tis a claim many have made and my swamp now flows with their blood, “ the giant stone golem stops its approach, “come and give your blood to me.  If you fail the test your blood shall join the others!”<br>
