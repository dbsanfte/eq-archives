They are random numbers, pure and simple.<br>
<br>
I have very few hard data points to give you, but here's a some things to consider.<br>
<br>
1) As of Saturday when we we began our raid, we had about 28K RP.  At that time, Jaga Draken had about 123K RP (I asked a friend).  Since Saturday, we've raised ourselves to over 51K RP.  That's great progress, but we've got a lot of catching up to do before we rank among the top guilds, and we can never expect to be *the* top guild in RP, or even close.<br>
<br>
2) There are individuals who are reported to have 30K or more realm points of their own.  I got that information several days ago, when 30K was more than our entire guild had.<br>
<br>
3) Do a reality check, by looking at levels.  Its hard to get more than a trivial number of realm points before level 30.  From there, the ability to acquire points goes up greatly with level.  The top 5 RP people in our guild hold more than half of our total points, I think. And guess what levels they are. You need to be about L35 to have an impact on keep raids (you can't even hit the door if you are not at least L30, and can't hit the Lord if you are not at least L35).  Not that keep raids have much to do with realm points. :-)  As of a week ago, we only had a handful of people L35 and over.  Things have greatly improved recently.   I believe that we now have one person over L40, about 10 at L35+, and another 10 to 15 at L30+. So we can start doing some great things. It might not be long before we're strong enough to take an (unguarded) keep on our own. On the other hand, Odin's Fury has been about 10 levels ahead of us all along, and still is.  They have a huge number of folks 30+, 35+, 40+, and rack up the points accordingly. We don't have the mindset to compete at that level, and wouldn't want to change ourselves to be like them. Nothing wrong with that, it means that most of us have a life outside of DAoC.  <br>
<br>
We have a pretty large guild, and we are coming along in levels.  But there are quite a few guilds that are much stronger.  Its a bit hard to tell where we stand using /who since many high-level players are going anonymous for RvR.  I think that Jaga Draken is one of the strongest guilds, and so its good that we have joined with them. Possibly they are even the #2 guild after Odin's Fury?  Does anyone have a good sense of this? We'll have a much better idea once Mythic fixes the RP posting at The Herald site. Until the &quot;top 20&quot; list has been re-instituted on the realmwar status page, you should completely disregard the numbers posted at the guild database pages. I'm pretty confident that we are in the top 20, though before the recent push to 50K I was feeling doubtful.  If we keep at it, I hope we can get into the top 10 before too long, but its speculative at this point where we really are.<br>
<br>
Please don't take any of this to be a criticism of the guild, or complaining in any way.  I'm having a lot of fun these days, and we are strong enough to do stuff even if we aren't #1 by objective measures of strength. And if the alliance works, we'll be able to do even more stuff. I just want folks to be realistic in their view of the world.<br>
<br>
I'd like to see us organize a little better. Especially I'd like to see us help each other out more by making sure nobody's left out of groups, and have the higher level folks do a better job of moving the lower level folks along by taking time to group with them or get them into higher-level groups. I've had several mid-level people complain that they have trouble getting picked up by other Siol Lear folks for groups. People will log on during peak hours and ask for a group with no response. We really should work on this, so that nobody feels left out in the cold. This is becoming an important issue for some, and if we don't take some steps we might start losing a few folks. But aside from that, I don't think we need to change anything fundamental about &quot;who we are&quot; to eventually make an impact in the realm. <br>

Those numbers seem to be coming from out of thin air.  A friend (who I trust) in 'Fist of the North' told me that they have about 180k RPs. <br>

Siol Lear ranks number 7 in Midgard. Pretty damn impressive if you ask me. MacLear, since I've been involved with it, has never been viewed as a large or powerful guild, but as this shows, we are a force in DAoC. Odin's Fury leads the way for the entire server (over 100,000 more than the nearest guild). I'm not about numbers, but I'm proud to see Siol Lear listed as number 7. <br>

<br>
As of this morning (Monday, 12/17/2001) we stood at 73,645 realm points.  This put us in 7th place in Midgard, with Einherjar having a comfortable lead over us at 87,550 and Warhost of the Aesir breathing down our necks at 70,825.  We are 21st on the server... within shooting distance of Nemesis (an Albion guild) with 79,901.  As I said, Warhost is right behind us.  After that, in all three realms, the next closest guild is quite distant.  Ahead of Nemesis, there are about 5 guilds in the 85-88K range, server-wide.  So, with some effort, we could get over the hump to score in the top 20.  With a LOT of effort we might get into the next tier of guilds.  Below the top 22 guilds, there is quite a drop-off.<br>
<br>
Saturday a week ago, when we had our big guild RvR night, we started the day at 28K and ended at 42K.  In the 8 days following, we made a pretty steady 4K realm points per day.  That should give you a sense of our prospects.  A few good nights could move us up pretty well.<br>
