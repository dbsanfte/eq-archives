Norrath provides all that is needed to roleplay. The majority of the players, however, don't choose to. If one was to roleplay at every turn they took in Norrath, they'd meet many that would accept them for what they do and treat them well. Others, of course, would laugh and make fun of it. A roleplaying game is only as good as the roleplayer himself. I play D&amp;D every other Sunday. When I am the GM, there is no such thing as OOC or other comments that can be made, or penalties apply. When others GM, it's not so strictly enforce. If I wanted to sit around and roll a dice every minute of the day, I wouldn't bother going to a friends house and sitting on a hard chair ta do it. But, if I took that same game and strictly roleplayed while there, I would have a good time. To me, it's up to the person to roleplay his character as he sees fit. I don't believe it's up to Verant to provide everything for me. This of course is just my opinion, and a biased one at that since I still love this game.  <p>Haladek Durgalann<br>

NOt so much on any of the normal servers, but it is starting to take shape on that new deity pvp server, Sullon Zek.  I started a character on that server, hoping that it would have much better options for PR.  As is, if you see an &quot;evil&quot; character, usually dark elves, ogres, trolls, iksars, you could attack them as if they were your enemy, as it should be.  This server has an INCREDIBLE potential for PRing because of the pvp system that is in it, the problem arises when they allow every player to use the server.  Well over 90% of the people there were only in it to be able to hack and slash at other players.  My character was a dwarf, and dwarves are &quot;neutral&quot;.  You guys would not believe me if i told you how many dwarves ran over to the Faydark and killed the elves.  Elves are &quot;good&quot; alligned, so they can be killed by neutrals and evils, but if anyone was even trying to RP, they would know that the &quot;evil&quot; is the enemy, and the &quot;good&quot; is the ally.  <br>
<br>
I think that an RP server could have the potential to work, but to do so, they would have to find some way of keeping all the bloodthirsty, teenage, immature bastards out of it.  I know some of us are teens (myself included) but it is my experience that of all the people who play this game, just about EVERYONE over the age of 25 tends to be an RP oriented person.  Most of the &quot;kewl d00dz&quot; and &quot;phat l3wt&quot; seekers are teens.  I guess in a way this game is like every other great venture in human history.  It has the potential to be great, so long as only good people get to use it.  <br>
<br>
I gotta be honest, unles Verant finds some way of screening the people who get to play on this server, i don't think it will never get past it's infant stages.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The more a designer does to shape the game, the less the player can do to shape their own game. In EQ, you have a very definable character face and body type. I tried to play a bald, dark-skinned human, but it's kind of hard. =) I tried to play as a barbaric Human Monk, but it doesn't really exist. I had a choice of a handful of Gods, but none of them are barbaric. In fact, the only God of War that EQ has is more of a bloodthirsty God than what I wanted. I found myself ignoring the in-game religion. I spent so much time soloing in EQ because I refused to group with SKs or Necros. EQ was designed, however, to make use of, at least, the Necro spells. I felt like a jerk telling people that if they invited that SK or Necro, then I'd have to leave. In fact, that was the very last thing I ever did in EQ... I left a group graciously because they invited a Necro. I wasn't met with hostility-- more like confusion. I didn't mind the fact that 99.99999% of EQ's players *don't* RP... for some reason that didn't affect me. It was simply the fact that, for Verant to get the game they wanted, they had to make some concessions. I can't fault them for that.<br>
<br>
---UO didn't really do that. They didn't have predefined Gods or anything like that. I could roleplay any way I wanted. As expected in any MMOG, the majority of players took advantage of this &quot;free style&quot; of play. I contend that a roleplaying environment can only thrive (I say &quot;thrive&quot; rather than simply &quot;exist&quot;) in an open, unrestrained environment. Can we have such an environment in an MMOG? Well, we'll see. =) <p><IMG SRC="http://www.premiernet.net/~chandler/images/newmaclogo3.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/upeldor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Peldor</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Thane</span><br>  Posts: 270<br> <font color=#330000>(7/19/01 10:27:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmacleargeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1106.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Another Poll out of boredom</span><hr size=1> Well, I can somewhat counter that. Ever play D&amp;D where the GM made your character and wrote his/her history and then sprang it on you and told you to roleplay it? In my eyes, it's not what you can do with what you want, it's what you can do with what is there. Yes, EQ has a bad selection of gods. Hell, as a dwarf I have to worship Brell Sirilis, ever read the info in the manual on him? Not so easy being a dwarven paladin of Brell, at least in my eyes of what a paladin is. But, if you read the manual on who the gods are, and roleplay the GAME, not what you think the game should be, it's a good system. If the game we played were set in the world from The Wheel of Time, is it horrible that you can't worship gods from Dragonlance? To me it's only right that you can't. This is thier world, it's not the best it could be in my opinion, but it's still pretty darned good. And, with the right attitude, it can be roleplayed fairly well. I have yet to meet two people that can agree on what roleplaying is and should be. Everyone has a different opinion. I wouldn't dare try to make a game based on what I thought was the best for roleplaying, I'd probably be the only one that agreed. There's already some examples of what I'm saying in this thread. Agravaine says that neutral dwarves should consider good elves as allies and evil ogres as enemies. Why? If that were the case, why would dwarves be neutral? He has his opinion on what it should be, and it differs from mine. I think if you asked everyone here to send an email to you and explain what they felt roleplaying is and what it should be, you'd have quite a few different responses. Noone can cater to that. And yes, EQ designers made it near impossible ta not join an &quot;evil&quot; character at some point in the game, and for that I say they did wrong. But, that can still be roleplayed as well. I just try to make the best of what I can with what I have. That's me side of the story.<br>
<br>
And yes, I played UO for quite some time. I tried to roleplay me arse off....but at every corner someone with a name like L33t D3wD and his friends attacked and killed me. Wasn't very fun in my opinion.<br>

As a Monk of Quellious, did you know the Temple of Quellios wouldn't talk to me? There are no Monks of Rallos Zek. In their world, it's an impossiblity.<br>
<br>
---MacLear has already had to rewrite most of it's charter because of the concessions Verant mad for this game. It's not a bad game. It just doesn't let me roleplay the way I want. No, I never played a pen and paper game where my character was dictated to me. This is fortunate, because I would never have accepted that.<br>
<br>
---I did start EQ as a Monk of Quellios, where I acted like a Monk of Quellios. I met MacLear, though, and that totall screwed up the whole thing. A Monk cannot properly act like a MacLear in EQ. Not once was I ever able to get the Barbarian NPCs to even look at me as neutral. Roleplay can &quot;exist&quot; on EQ, but it certainly doesn't thrive there. Heck, AC was worse. I've never seen anyone RP there. Even at that, the players aren't at fault, per se. It's the structure of the game. AC COULD have had roleplayers, but it just didn't kick in. I, personally, think it was because of all the prewritten backstory. If the game designers hadn't written a story, I could have written my own. I mean, I wrote one for EQ about a year before it came live, but there was no facilitation for it.<br>

It sounds to me like you have roleplaying and getting everything exactly how you want it mixed up.  I wonder how far DeNiro would have gotten if he said, &quot;I can't play this role, I don't like your backstory!&quot;.  We are not artists here, we are not the architects of this world.  We are poor, simple thespians acting out our roles in the great theater which is Norrath.  In some ways I concur with your sentiments, no MMORPG has yet to ever facilitate what I consider roleplaying to be.  However, I don't lay the blame on the programmers, conceptual artists, story writers, and other staff members of the companies which produce them; I lay it on the hordes of prepubescent mongoloids who insist on being contrary and degrading those of us who do roleplay.  And as far as UO being more conducive to RP, you must have played a different game than I did.  I do not remember a game of roleplaying, but rather one where my poor tailor couldn't even kill a rabbit for his hide without being overrun by Psychodewd and his legion of red named thugs.  Nevertheless I founded a guild built on roleplaying and we did just that.  My point is that whining over the game makes no sense, no gaming atmosphere, backstory, or rules system is going to be precisely as you want it unless you are the one who designed it (and for me at least, that doesn't even always help).  Asked my opinion I would say EQ sucks, I do not like the game.  However, I don't roleplay with the game.  I roleplay with the people in it, most notably my clan. And despite the fact that I hate how Verant designed a game which requires camping and raiding to achieve the higher levels and upper end gear (In fact I despise all the upper end gear itself), I still play it my way.  I fight green critters, wander about and take pictures of the landscape, and chat with my friends.  I am Gwenllian the Bloody Handed, born of Halfling stock but raised in Halas.  Did the game let me take the last name &quot;the Bloody Handed&quot;? No.  Did it let me start in Halas? No.  BUt that doesn't mean I can't pretend I did, I can call myself what I wish and claim what lineage I may.  Will I ever make 60th Level and have my epic weapon? Probably not. Does that bother me? Not in the least, wouldn't bother me if I stayed 23rd for the rest of my life and never got a better weapon then the one which I'm now toting about now.  In any case, I've gone on far longer than I initially intended to and will leave it at that.  Just my view from down here.<br>

We are not architects of &quot;this&quot; world. As for Mr. Deniro; actors choose the roles they play. If he doesn't like it, he doesn't do it. As an actor of 22 years, I only take parts I want.<br>
<br>
---When I stated that UO was more condusive to roleplay, I didn't mean to infer that the players actually participated in it. I meant that the game's soil was plowed and ready for a roleplayer. If I wanted to roleplay a swindler, I could. Mad wizard? Sure. Displaced halfling... with some effort. Former Necormancer, since resurrected, amnesiatic, dark-skinned, bald guy that lives with a clan of barbarians? Done it. =) It was the LACK of in-game backstory that facilitated this. In EQ, I've only met two people who were in character almost the whole time.<br>
<br>
---I wasn't aware I was whining, and I'm sorry if it came across that way. I wouldn't infer that EQ totally stifles RP, as you and I have both &quot;made do&quot; with the forks Verant gave us. I've always championed and lampooned EQ for what it was... and is. A game for gamers. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.premiernet.net/~chandler/images/newmaclogo3.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/uhyfaidd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hyfaidd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lad/Lass</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#330000>(7/27/01 7:13:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmacleargeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1106.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Another Poll out of boredom</span><hr size=1> What RP games require is a GM that the players know and who knows the players that can &quot;adjust&quot; the game to meet whatever the playing group requires. So if a monk wants to be a barbarian, the NPC reaction is adjusted. If a halfling is raised in Halas then everyone there knows it, rare enough for nearly everyone in that small city to have heard about it afterall. As that GM I would have required MacLear to have proper adoption cermonies etc. A world with lots of backstory can work for RP. Golanthra, (RuneQuest and Hero Wars) has a massive backstory, which my not very RP players loved for all the guides it gave them and my Massive RP loved for all the options they could do. BUT the GM (me) adjusted the world for them too. MMOGs will be fine when they have 1 admin for every 10 players.
