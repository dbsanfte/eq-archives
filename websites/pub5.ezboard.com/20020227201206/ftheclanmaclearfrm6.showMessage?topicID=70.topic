<br>
Ethrenoth picks up the letter. To her shock she read the name of the sender Ethroth!!!! She ran from the gate to the senate chambers and politely knocked on the door. Lanadena opened the door. Ethrenoth bowed and handed her the letter it was quite bulky with many pages. She new Ethroth had much to tell the Clan. <br>
<br>
The note read:<br>
         Hail MacLear I first must assure you that I am well. I am hiding myself from the people of halas for the seventh hammers possession over me has threatened lives. He continues to grow in power. I have made an elixir of protection but with limited supplies it will only last until December 13th 8 CST 9 EST. MacLear must form but I have much to tell first.<br>
<br>
          There is a know presence to the seventh hammer's presence. After much meditation and thought I have come to the understanding that my dear father is dead. The reason he has died is due to the magic experimentation in the nexus on luclin. It released a portal at one point which released a weakened seventh hammer. The hammer then attack my father who was guarding the mages in the nexus. It tore his soul from his body taking his great warrior spirit and empowering itself and after a wizard I had met made connection with luclin it let the hammer to Norrath in which he found me. Thats when my visions of my father began.<br>
<br>
       The vision distilled a part of my mind which slowly allowed the seventh hammer the key to it. He can come and go with little resistance and he has the power to enslave others. I have also learned that the power of my father and my own power affect his own. <br>
<br>
       I myself am a shaman of the 30th season my father Enldoth Wolfcazter was a 60th season warrior and leader of the wolfcazter clan. He lead his clan to destroy Vox and after a extrmely well fought battle Vox had slain my mother and the rest of the wolfcazter clan and sent my father to the ringed moon of luclin. Leaving on Eldorth and myself to group up on our own. Thus we merged into MacLear to acctually have a family. <br>
<br>
      Now this seventh hammer has become quite powerful. He can now distroy Halas in a whim and the rest of Norrath soon after. I have perfected the enchantment to stop him. It requires a mass amount of people all bound by some common goodness. The main purpose of this spell would be to have 6 Maclear step forward and become embodied with the 6 hammers. As from research on god taking human bodies their power shapes to the season of the person they take. This may only seem like the high season maclear are needed for this event but that is incorrect. Encircling myself and the other 6 persons must be MacLear of pure hearts who stand for goodness. Even if they cannot control magic they will aid in empowering the tribunal. The 6 of the tribunal will stand against my possessed body and challenge seventh hammer in combat. From there the tribunal will merely let the seventh hammer attempt attacks until they can bind me to the ground then send away the seventh hammer. After that is accomplished my body will be freed halas will be saved  and my fathers soul can be put to rest. My fate rest now in Maclears hands.  Remeber 8 pm CST 9 pm EST december 13th In the Everfrost new quester area.<br>
<br>
                                                      Ethroth Wolfcazter<br>
                                 Noble and 30th shaman of Maclear<br>
<br>
If anyone wishes to send a message to me my charmed wolf. Roams in the tundra not far from the MacLear Halls. Also if anyone knows they can make it send me a message as well.<br>

Leaning against her writing table, she lightly places her hand upon her heart.  Looking down, she closes her eyes and whispers, &quot;My battle with The Seventh Hammer has not ended, just as I suspected.  I can feel the blackness he struck into my heart begin to wend its way through my system.  I pray the MacLears will assist in this last fight.&quot;   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/btheclanmaclear.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ravnanger>Ravnanger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lad/Lass</span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#330000>(12/11/01 9:39:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmaclearfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=70.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A note read and seen</span><hr size=1> Ravnanger walks the battlements, pacing from one end of the south wall to the other. Ethroths message clear in his mind. A foul warm unseasonal breeze blows in from the south. &quot;an Ill omen &quot; he mutters to himself.<br>
Below he watches the young messngers leaving on there way to the many lands of the realm and one or two heading to other realms. With a sadness he turns away. Some will never make it back.<br>
Across the courtyard he see Lanadena walking on her way to Halas. Something is wrong. He can see it. A pain in her eys and the occasional wince when shouldering her pack. She is too proud to say anything though. A sadness there.<br>
 Grasping his symbol of the tribunal Ravnanger begins the mutterings of an oath......<br>
 &quot;By my life Halas shall not fall to the darkness. No brother or sister of MacLear will perish. The seventh hammer will not reign its terror on us!&quot; &quot;I will see to this or you may have my life!&quot; Casting a spell and leaping off the wall he runs off into the night. Quickly the darkness swallows him. <br>
Behind him in the shadows of the battlement a spirit lurks ,watching him depart.  &quot;Come snowflake we have work to do&quot; The spirit says to the wolf. turning they both head into Halas following in Lanadenas tracks.<br>
<br>
