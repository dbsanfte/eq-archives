<td>Ok, now that he can't hear me, let me try to tell you what I have learned
from this experience. There really is no way to describe what the birth
of a child, especially your own child is like. Everyone told me how great
it was, but words just can't describe it, I was completely unprepared for
the experience and the emotions.&nbsp;
<p>I can say this, and maybe it will help folks to if not understand the
experience for themselves, it will at least illustrate one of my feelings
about it.&nbsp;
<p>Everyone in my life that I love or have loved, people, animals, souls
took some time before I loved them. Time to get to know them, time to develop
a relationship and time to trust and gain trust. Even though I am an Aquarian,
and prone to love quickly, unconditionally and forever, nothing compares
to the instaneous, unconditional and infinate love that I feel for my son.
Jamie says the same thing. Maybe this is the one thing I can say that might
illustrate a bit of the feelings I have. I have heard of some parents that
say they didn't feel this right away, and I can't imagine it.
<p>The delivery itself was sureal. Even though it was just 4 of us in there,
I felt others. Maybe past loved ones, or loved ones yet to be, but we weren't
alone. Days before the delivery I felt someone put a reassuring hand on
my spiritual shoulder late one night as I sat contemplating the upcoming
event. As I think back about the delivery, it brings images of sailing
through a storm, and working so hard to keep everything in control and
to stay on course that I was blind to much of what was going on. I don't
care how much science, medicine and technology invade and assist our lives,
I know there is magic, and everyday I grow more aware of it and the patterns
it draws in our lives. I see it in my son, in my wife, in the trees, animals
and stones. I hope that everyone gets to know this, and finds a similar
path to follow that reveals the patterns of nature.
<p>Bright Blessings to each of you.
<p>Boon</td>
