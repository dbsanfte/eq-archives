<b><u><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+4>Guidelines
for Guild Events</font></font></font></u></b>
<p><b><u><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+2>Event
Organization</font></font></font></u></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>Anyone
can organize a guild event, whether they are officers or not. Non-officers
that organize events stand a better chance of becoming officers. Officers
are expected to actively organize and participate in events.</font></font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>Details
of events are best planned out on our message board. When plans are finalized,
the date, time and place of the event shall be posted on the Calendar.
Navox or myself can assist in the calendar posting if needed.</font></font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>Whoever
organized the event is the <u>EVENT LEADER</u>. Event Leaders will determine
<u>GROUP
LEADERS</u> as the event gathers forces (if there are multiple Groups),
and he/she will also organize who shall be in each group. This should be
done according to level and need of each group to achieve balance, i.e.:
healer, tank, evac, etc.</font></font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>The
Group Leaders will determine and dictate the job of each member according
to their class and group need. Who heals, who tanks, who pulls, who snares,
who blasts, etc. Anyone not sticking to their task risks the lives of the
other members and they will be warned to perform their function or leave.</font></font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>It
is up to you to know how to play your role, please do your best to learn
all you can about your class and take pride in playing it well. There are
links on our main page for each class that may help.</font></font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>If
you find you are unable to perform the function given you, can't keep up
with the heals needed or whatnot, it is your responsibility to inform the
Group Leader and they will then redistribute jobs or coach you to med more,
tank less and whatnot.</font></font></font></b></li>
</ul>
<b><u><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+2>Loot
Order</font></font></font></u></b>
<br><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>Loot
arrangements and guidelines are to be set forth by the Event Leader prior
to the Event and posted on the message board. Below are some guidelines
but some things need to be specified and are up to the discretion of the
Event Leader, such as how long late arrivals must participate before being
included in the loot rotation. This may be something that cannot be specified
before the event due to unknown factors such as breaking spawn, corpse
retrievals, amount of drops and such. That is why they are at the discretion
of the Event Leader.</font></font></font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>Need
before Greed means just that. If you do not already own the item that drops,
and you have the ability to use the item, and WILL use the item then you
are eligible to /random for the item. That is what "need" means. Not that
you need the money from selling the item. Your "other" characters do not
fall into the "need" category.</font></font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>Once
all those who fall into the "Need" category have received their reward,
then everyone else can random for it. Once you have one of a particular
item, you cannot /random for it again until EVERYONE has received one of
that particular item. Once everyone has one of a particular item, then
all future drops are /randomed by everyone.</font></font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>Those
people that do win the items have a responsibility to make sure everyone
is rewarded, and the Event Leader needs to be sure everyone is taken care
of, or they may not attend events in the future. The group/s should chip
in to see that those the don't win, get something. If you don't get something,
but feel you deserve something, bring it up with the Event Leader. Keep
in mind that sacrificing for little reward means everyone is more likely
to help you in the future to get items you need.</font></font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>Junk
Looting&nbsp; should be specified by the Event Leader, whether it is "Friendly"
or "Alphabetical and whether you have auto-split on or off.</font></font></font></b></li>
</ul>
<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>I hate
that these things need to be specified, but as we are getting higher level,
starting to gather for such events more often, some guidelines were in
order. These will be expanded on as we start dragon and plane raids. At
that time even those people that are not actually at an event may earn
an item for all their past work and effort. Work hard, it will not be overlooked.
If you feel these guidelines need adjusting, please contact me.</font></font></font></b>
