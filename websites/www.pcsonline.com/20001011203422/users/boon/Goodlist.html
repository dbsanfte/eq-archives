<td>I have wanted to add this person for a long time but have not been
able to because he was in my guild. He has since parted ways with us and
continues to set THE example of good deeds and favor. I have watched him
run his little Gnome feet across whole continents to rez people he didn't
even know. I have personally gated him to areas and watched him work to
ressurect 15+ people at a time, most of whom he didn't even know. Palos
was a "Born Again" character, finding a more deserving player as he entered
his mid 30's, the first player that got him to that level was a known KSer,
making it even more incredible for his reputation to have become one of
the most respected on the whole server. To his current player, I salute
you, as do lots of people, as I recieve many, very many requests to add
you.
<br>I feel like Palos is the best example of a "Lawful/Good" character
I've ever seen.</td>

<td VALIGN=BASELINE><b>Malory</b></td>

<td>Malory too is someone who has deserved to be on here for a long time,
but was in my guild and I was biased. She has since moved on and I recieve
tons of emails asking she be added here. Here is one of many about her
and Palos:
<p>Dear Sir,
<br>I write to thee to commend two of the finest people I've ever had the&nbsp;
<br>pleasure of meeting on Everquest.&nbsp; I beleive they are of your
guild, Palos&nbsp;
<br>and Malory.&nbsp; It was about 6 or 7 weeks ago that they helped me
and at the&nbsp;
<br>time I didn't know about your list of "Favorite people" or I would
have&nbsp;
<br>written you earlier.&nbsp;
<br>I was in Lower Guk and I and my honorable friend, Pazidua died by the&nbsp;
<br>dastardly hand of the minions of the Fort.&nbsp; Dispite my pleas within
the&nbsp;
<br>dungeon there weren't any clerics willing to help me in my plight.&nbsp;
I had&nbsp;
<br>lost my level and my group had spontaneously disbanded leaving me and
my&nbsp;
<br>friend somewhat in a dire mess.&nbsp;
<br>I did a /who all cleric and found a number of people online who could&nbsp;
<br>possibly help us.&nbsp; I messaged one, then another, then yet another
and all the&nbsp;
<br>responses were the same.&nbsp; "Sorry, I'm busy".&nbsp; Disheartened,
I continued and&nbsp;
<br>kept at it and came to Malory.&nbsp; I messaged her and got back a
AFK message.&nbsp;
<br>So I continued on and messaged a few others, Palos was one of them.&nbsp;
Palos&nbsp;
<br>also had an AFK message.&nbsp; I didn't think much of it and went down
the entire&nbsp;
<br>list of clerics that were of a level to help me.&nbsp; I had all but
given up hope&nbsp;
<br>when about 5 minutes later I got a /tell from Malory asking me my plight.&nbsp;
I&nbsp;
<br>explained to her what had happened and she was so sweet and said she
would be&nbsp;
<br>happy to help me if I could get her a ride closer to Guk as she was
in South&nbsp;
<br>Karana helping a guildmate.&nbsp; I tried my hardest to get her a ride
but&nbsp;
<br>couldn't find one.&nbsp; She said not to worry, that she would see
if she could&nbsp;
<br>get a ride from someone in her guild - alas no one was on that could
help&nbsp;
<br>her.&nbsp; I sighed and thanked her for her time and was resigned to
having to&nbsp;
<br>forfeit my level and have to wait to get my body back.&nbsp; My friend
had gone&nbsp;
<br>linkdead and hadn't returned so I was alone and at a loss as to how
to get my&nbsp;
<br>body back.&nbsp; I wasn't familiar with the maze down there so I couldn't
just go&nbsp;
<br>invise and get it.&nbsp;
<br>I'll never forget the kindness that they showed me.&nbsp; She said
"Don't worry,&nbsp;
<br>hon.&nbsp; We will help you get your body back :)"&nbsp; I asked her
"We?" and she&nbsp;
<br>replied that Palos was going to help me too as he knew Guk very well.&nbsp;
<br>I know I am rambling so I'll finish quickly.&nbsp; What ended up happening
was&nbsp;
<br>they ran from Qeynos to Guk on foot.&nbsp; They got here and Malory
went and got&nbsp;
<br>out another character of hers, a level 16 druid!&nbsp; She invised
Palos and in&nbsp;
<br>her tiny little Druid she ran into the depths of the evil dungeon with
Palos&nbsp;
<br>as her guide and they both retrieved me and my friend's body (he had
returned&nbsp;
<br>by this time) and brought it back to a safe place to perform the&nbsp;
<br>resurrections.&nbsp; Palos was such a funny little Dwarf he kept commenting
about&nbsp;
<br>my nakedness.&nbsp; A bit of a scamp but a heart of gold.&nbsp; His
magic whirled&nbsp;
<br>around us and tho sickened and weakened, I found myself returned to
my former&nbsp;
<br>level and I was very very happy.&nbsp; My friend was thrilled as well.&nbsp;
<br>After all was said and done, I tried to hand Palos some money for his
trouble&nbsp;
<br>as it was indeed quite a trial getting to us.&nbsp; He gave me a wink
and shook&nbsp;
<br>his head saying that he wouldn't think of taking even a copper for
what he&nbsp;
<br>did.&nbsp; I tried to give it to Malory and she told me she didn't
accept payment&nbsp;
<br>for her gift of healing.&nbsp;
<br>Those 2 made my day!&nbsp; They made my month.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there
were 2 people more&nbsp;
<br>deserving of going on your favorite list it would be these two.&nbsp;
I don't know&nbsp;
<br>if you can as they are in the same guild as you but please consider
them.&nbsp;
<p>Thank you,
<br>Midnight</td>

it out with a sliver of health left...only to find himself zoning into
lava on the other side. He ended back in Halas, and I had no idea where
in LS his corpse would be found.&nbsp;
<br>I /ooc'd if anyone was available to do a res when and if we got the
corpse and Nicole was kind enough to offer. Kind enough in fact, that she
was there doing 2 other rezzes before his. She also knew exactly where
his
<br>corpse would be found and directed one of my party members to that
spot near Nek zone.
<br>Short version of the story: guide came and rezzed Baloo himself, thus
Nicole did not resurrect him. I am grateful however that she was there
and willing even after spending enormous amounts of mana on previous
<br>resurrections."</td>
