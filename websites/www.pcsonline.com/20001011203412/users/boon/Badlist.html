<p><b><u><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#004040"><font size=+3>The
Rathe Druid Council's "Beware List"</font></font></font></u></b>
<p><font face="times new roman"><font size=+1>These people have consistently
alienated themselves from their fellow hunters on The Rathe Server. How
do they get here? Some think it's from Kill Stealing, that may be part
of it, but mostly folks end up here because they seem to have either missed
or forgotten the lessons from their parents about how to treat others.
I think the anonymity of the Internet make the more insecure people strike
back against all the bullying they endured as children, even if they are
becoming bullies themselves. I cannot stand idly by and watch these jerks
victimize others within this society. This is the stand I make, with the
power of the Druid Council and all supporting guilds.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="times new roman"><font size=+1>Are you on here? Don't want
to be? Easy enough, quit treating others as if they are NPCs! Your actions
create REAL feelings of victimization and that makes this virtual world
something real, ugly, but real. Instead, lets make it real by creating
feelings of friendship and caring and kindness.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="times new roman"><font size=+1>I have seen children misbehave
and apparently feel no shame for their actions, they only felt bad that
they were caught. If you hurt someone else, you should feel ashamed of
your actions, whether you are online or not. If you don't feel ashamed,
please call your parents and explain to them that they failed and then
seek therapy.</font></font>
<p><font face="times new roman"><font size=+1>The Druid Council asks that
all Druids, and any others with a concern for justice to do your best to
not assist these folks in any way, this includes grouping and trading.
Let them know you have seen their names here and you will not help them.
Names are not casually added here. There must be multiple substantiated
reports. That means that once we get several reports, our agents will observe
the person. Are we the Moral Majority? No, but we can make sure people
consider the way they victimize others since the gods can't/won't. If a
substantial number of&nbsp; reports come in for a person for the "Good
List," a vote will be brought before the Council to remove a person's name
from here.</font></font>
<p><font face="times new roman"><font size=+1>Want to report someone?&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="times new roman"><font size=+1>Send an email <a href="mailto:boon@pcsonline.com">here
</a>and
it will be documented. Please state your character's name, the offending
character's name, other characters they play if you know them, and give
specific detail of the incident. Screen shots and log files are appreciated.</font></font></center>

with her, this is one of the most respected and respectful people and guilds
in all of Norrath:
<p><i>I post this message to you with a weary hand for I know not how to
explain How a guild member of Reavers of the Forbidden treated me last
eve. I was in the Oasis with many low level members of our guild and DragonsDynasty,
we were helping and assiting all people on the beach, When alas a yell
comes from Tyrek warrning of incomming Spector. there where in fact Two
spectors, they indeed attacked Tyrek who led them to the far back of the
beach so that the lower levels would remian safe.. I called a warrning
to entire beach that there were spectors incomming, we did in fact kill
the wrethced things and in doing so Tyrek gave his life to save many others,
The next thing I get in /tells is a rude voice telling me what kind of
person that I am, it was not pleasant, I will not post the screen shots
for the language that was used was terrible. I asked this person whose
name was Bosifis why he was calling me those names when I had done nothing
to him, he continued to haras me to the point I had to contact a GM.. For
those who know me and of my guild we are most honorable and would do nothing
to deserve what I experienced last night. I have to believe that if this
guild carries members of such actions than I shall have nothing to do with
them. To be a new guild in Norath this is not the way to get respect from
others.</i><i></i>
<p>I have seen the screen shots, and she is right, it is beyond what I
can post here, but suffice it to say, this person has no resepect for others
and deserves no respect from anyone else.</td>

like he was roleplaying, but that's just sick, he needs to be banned. I
got 4 seperate reports about him.
<br>Maybe it's time we started petitioning Zatozia to ban some of the people
that end up with their names here repeatedly, that would teach them to
be a little more considerate.
<p>From Quinne:

to move</i>
<br><i>her corpse or bring her things to her, not sure which. What I AM
sure of is</i>
<br><i>that Highrider admitted to knowingly stealing her items, and I am
POSITIVE</i>
<br><i>from speaking to her that this was not supposed to transpire. Here
is the</i>

<td VALIGN=BASELINE><b>Vishivia</b>
<br>(I apologize for posting so much about her, but her demands that it's
all a lie warrant posting more info than normal.)</td>

<td>(1/2/2000) Vishivia admitted to Palos that she is in fact powerleveling
to sell the account, even though she told me otherwise, and that she knew
it would be easier to sell with a good reputation. Should have thought
about that before you started treating people like crap.
<p>(12/23) - Several reports of KSing in SolB.
<p>Vishivia was recently removed from this list due to the words of trust
and assurance from the esteemed Quinne of Order of Polaris and from Vishivia's
own urging. Since that time Quinne has spoken with the noble Lady Toythunder
of Dragonslayers and has retracted any responsibility or trust in Vishivia.
It is with great respect for these individuals that the Druid Council adds
Vishivia back to the Beware List.&nbsp;
<br>Her reasons for being on the list includes, but is not limited to,
observed KSing in the past by myself and recently from a respected officer
of The Dragonslayers, extreme rudeness and a general lack of concern for
other's feelings as seen by members of Dragon Dynasty, Keepers of Oak and
non-guilded players. She seems to have fooled many as there are numerous
folks that claim she is a good person. The evidence presented proves otherwise
and shows her ability to dupe others. She may blame the people and guilds
that reported her, but she should blame herself.&nbsp;
<p>(12/16) This just in from Raene:
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#003300"><font size=-1>This
is from one of the DS Officers that had a "Vishivia Encounter". Ihaveasked
if he wants to put a name to her warrior alt mentioned herein andgot no
response, so am forwarding you his story:</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#003300"><font size=-1>---------</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#003300"><font size=-1>Ok
hon here it is. The whole deal.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#003300"><font size=-1>Upon
meeting Vishivia during the Role playing event, she was quite abrasive
and rude. She had made sure I knew I was a peon, an underling who was to
kneel before her any time she crossed my path. I did this for the "cause
" I was helping to serve. Her language on channel and on ooc was worse</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#003300"><font size=-1>than
I had heard in my many years as a Warehouse manager working on the docks.
Just one example of a shout on ooc, in lower guk. Please excuse the vulgarity.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#003300"><font size=-1>Vishivia
shouts " You have been hit for 3200 damage by a froglock Dick". To me there
is no need to shout this and it just shows her true character, and perhaps
age is also a factor here.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#003300"><font size=-1>The
worst ordeal came the next day when she called upon me as she played her
level 14 warrior. She sent me a tell from lesser Fay where she was hunting
I was in innohthule swamp. She desperately needed my help and commanded
me to report to N Ro to meet Vishivia there for a TP to G</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#003300"><font size=-1>Faydark.
Again I did this for the Army of Light. Upon arriving in lesser faydark
she told me of her "dilema" and her plan. She claims a higher level magician
had stolen her spawn spot where the 3 sisters spawned and we were there
to make sure no one got any kills.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#003300"><font size=-1>This
went against the way that I play the game, but I did it so I did not blow
my cover. When we arrived there was a mid 20 level magician there and several
newbies. I soon realized that if I did not attack quick enough that the
magician and his pet were able to take a kill every now and then</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#003300"><font size=-1>from
Vishivia.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#003300"><font size=-1>This
angered her. She began verbally abusing me. "Whats wrong with you, You
have to be quicker." So I concocted a plan and told the magician of it
during his next tell to me asking me why I was doing what I was doing.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#003300"><font size=-1>I would
loot as much as I could and turn all of the money over to him. He explained
that he had come to help two newbie friends clear the camp so they could
hunt there and Vishivia came along and told them to get lost</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#003300"><font size=-1>.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#003300"><font size=-1>She
refused to share the spawn. I told him that there were reasons I had to
do this but he would get all the money and every other kill, and that I
would explain why in 2 weeks when event was over.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#003300"><font size=-1>Through
all of this the magician remained calm and he trusted me earning my trust
to the point where I tolde him everything about the event and me being
a spy. I swore to him when this event was over I would hunt Vishivia down
and make her pay for her actions. By telling my story I believe</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#003300"><font size=-1>she
will be made to pay. She continued this behavior for over an hour hoping
the magician would leave. I told her the magicians friends were willing
to share the spawn. Again she refused, but maybe 15 minutes after that
she said she had to go and abruptly gated me to neriak.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#003300"><font size=-1>I sought
out the magician and apologized again and turned over all the money I had
looted. I Wish I could remember his name , and I did have it written down
somewhere. This evening upset me to the point That I called our Queen Toythunder
the next morning and told her of all of this and</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#003300"><font size=-1>how
it really upset me to be used in this manner. I will find her and challenge
her to a duel one day. She may very well win but I feel I must to restore
my honor.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
