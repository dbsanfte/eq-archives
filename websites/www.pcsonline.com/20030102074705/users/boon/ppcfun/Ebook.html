Ok, from the link I have listed below I've started reading "Bridgette Jones
Diary." I've not seen the movie, I didn't see any decapitations, car chases
or explosions in the trailer so immediately wrote it off. The book has
made me laugh more than a few times though. I think though, that in being
the shallow and thoughtless male that I am, I'm probably laughing "at"
Bridgette more than I'm laughing "with" her. Perhaps this book, in letting
us see into the soul and personal thoughts of Bridgette, will let us see
into the souls and drives of our significant others a bit better. *thinks
a moment....*&nbsp; Nah!&nbsp; *burp*

was hoping someone would sell. He has the Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, Bridgette
Jones Diary and a bunch of those silly Harry Potter Books. Check it out
