<p><b><u><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+2>First
things first</font></font></font></u></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>We
are a mature guild and any kids we have had in the guild have usually left
unhappy because we roleplay and don't typically powergame.</font></font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>We
often have guild events for fun where no one gains exp. If this bothers
you, then there are other guilds for ye.</font></font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>We
are a group of friends and as such, if you are not recommended by a current
member, you have very little chance of getting into the guild.</font></font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>We
are a neutral guild, seeking Balance in the world. You cannot have Light
without Dark so we embrace good and evil races.</font></font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>All
members are expected to be a social participant from time to time. We all
have times where we like to be alone, but we love to have folks get involved.</font></font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>We
discourage "twinking" of lower level members with items, but will aid you
to get those items yourself when you are a high enough level. We do hold
events where "hand-me-down" items can be won or earned by lower level members,
but these will not be extreme items. (This does not limit twinking your
own, secondary characters, so long as it is role-played in some way: child
support, helping a sibling/lover/cousin, repaying old debts, righting past
wrongs).</font></font></font></b></li>
</ul>
<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>Failing
any of these means that this is not the guild for you.</font></font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="Charter"></a><b><u><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+2>Our
Charter</font></font></font></u></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>We
seek Balance!</font></font></font></b></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>This
means that it is okay to kill those things considered "Good" if it helps
to balance out those things that are "Evil." For balance in nature, there
must be both. So far we have seen an overpopulation of Evil in our world
and find little, if any need to control the population of "Good" creatures.</font></font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>The
killing of animals, even Bears and Wolves is ok in moderation as their
populations growth has resulted in the lack of grazing animals in our world.
This imbalance occurred before my birth, and the birth of my father.</font></font></font></b></li>
</ul>

<li>
<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>It
is wrong to kill <u>any</u> guards to the point that there is no protection
of the youngsters. The killing of guards or NPCs of your own race and alignment
is considered odd, but if it assists in Balance, is acceptable.</font></font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>Dropping
whatever you are doing to help others is almost always the right thing
to do, if doing so does not endanger others. This is not just for guild
members, but everyone, provided they are respectful, polite and it aids
Balance.</font></font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>We
discourage the killing of good aligned NPCs even though sometimes we understand
that balance is served by diminishing the powers of "Good."</font></font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>The
fair Treants deserve our respect and protection, (Grizzleknot however is
an abomination). We are after all, The Keepers of Oak.</font></font></font></b></li>
</ul>
<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>&nbsp;If
you are still interested then here are your steps.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>1.
Your first task is to leave a biography on our message board of your character.
Not your stats and equipment, if you feel inclined to do that, then again,
this is not the guild for you. Instead tell us where you (your character)
were born and how you were raised. Tells us a bit about the things that
occurred in your life that shaped you into the personality you are today.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>2.
You must perform an assigned task or quest given by your Guild Officer.
Read on for details.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>Here
is how the guild is set up:</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>We
have Officers assigned to each race. He or She will be your leader and
first contact in the guild. These officers are assigned the task of first
determining if you are a good candidate for The Keepers of Oak and then
of assigning your introductory Quest. If your officer is not available
another will serve in their place.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>The
screening is done by doing a quick survey to see if anyone in the Guild
or in the Druid Council has reports of your lack of honor or maturity.
Yes we are particular about maturity. We are a fun guild but expect folks
to know how to behave and treat others. Constantly failing to use vowels
(U R, plz, pplz, and such) is impolite and not acceptable. People in Norrath
aren't "Dudes, Dewds, Biatch, bro, cool, kewl" or so forth. Use of these
terms is sign of a drunkard and a knave. We aren't hard-core role-players,
but we expect courtesy, treat people as people, not NPCs.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>The
quest assigned to you will be race and level appropriate and someone from
the guild will probably go with you to get to know you better. These quests
can be anything from gathering High Quality Lion Pelts to acquiring the
Borxx Cornea Lens. Whatever is acquired in the quest becomes guild property
and will be used for guild members, probably even yourself.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>There
will be a period after completion of the quest where you may be observed
after which, the officers will vote to accept you or not. We wish you luck.
You can check our <a href="keomem.html">members page</a> to see the Officer
for each race.</font></font></font></b>
