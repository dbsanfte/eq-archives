<p><b><font size=+1>You don't have to put up with it ANYMORE!</font></b>
<br>Are you tired of being circled by shark noobie beggars every time you
go to town? Are they rude to you when you don't give them anything, and
even when you do? Maybe you are sick of people apparently incapable of
politely asking for a favor as opposed to the short and rude, "SoW me plz."
How horribly maimed are they that they can't type "please?"
<p>Why are they like this? Where did they learn that it's ok to behave
this way??
<br>I'll tell you where, from you and me and from the success it has given
them. They beg and pester and are rude because it works!!
<p>Well this is the start of a Campaign to turn the Noobie Beggar around.
<p>This call goes out to all responsible and reasonable EQ players across
<b>all
servers</b>, and especially to our Guides, GMs, guild leaders and event
coordinators. If we refuse to give to them, not matter how much they pester,
cuss and whine, they will actually have to start playing the game and maybe
even become a worthwhile hunting partner.
<p><b><font size=+1>"What can I do?" you may ask...</font></b>
<p>We will begin this campaign by setting some standards. Although you
may think tricking a Noobie Beggar into dueling you is funny and it may
actually be satisfying using the old "declare your loyalty" trick, it may
get you a warning from the GMs. You may think teleporting them to Tox and
leaving them there is fun and exciting, but that too can be worse for you
than it is for them. Instead, lets just all say the same thing to them
and stand strong in our efforts to "really" help them. Try this:
<p><b>"I do not give to beggars for it only encourages their dishonorable
behavior,"</b> if they persist, say the same thing over and over until
they move on. Hot key it even. After enough people stand up to them, they
will learn to group, to hunt and to be stronger citizens of Norrath. Tell
them it is part of the "Campaign to Stop the Noobie Beggars" if it adds
strength to your efforts.
<p>For rudeness in requesting buffs, rezzes, SoW, teleports and such, just
give them the standard:
<br><b>"If you are asking for my aid, you would do well to speak more clearly,
and with more kindness."</b>
<br>This will undoubtedly get you some cursing and ranting. Just /report
them and move on. After they encounter enough of us giving them the same
answer, they will change, but it takes a unified effort to make social
changes of this nature.
<p><b><font size=+1>Let me Clarify!</font></b>
<br>Buff those in need, help those that are working to succeed, but&nbsp;
DON'T REWARD THE LAZY!

<p><b><font size=+1>"Why are you doing this Brennos?" you may ask...</font></b>
<p>Because I started at a time when the world was young and had to earn
my own way. I'd like to not cheat others of the self esteem derived from
making it without begging.
<br>Because I am tired of being treated like an NPC by people who feel
immune from me wrapping my hands around their throats and squeezing the
miserable life from them.
<br>Because I'm tired of hearing my friends and loved ones feeling afraid
to go to town because of the beggars, or being victimized by rude people.
<p>This is the best and most effective way to stop this behavior, but it
requires us all. If you care about being treated like a person and not
like an NPC then join us now in the Campaign to Stop the Noobie Beggars!!
