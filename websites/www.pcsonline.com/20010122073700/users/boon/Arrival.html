<td>We arrived at <a href="../../www.smh.com">Sarasota Memorial Hospital</a>
at 2:00 PM on March 21st, 2000. We were escorted into our labor and delivery
room, filled out some paperwork in the room, and got comfy. After some
technical glitches with some monitors they moved us to another room which
had more light, we liked it better. The grandparents found that the family
room in the nearby Cardiac area was way better than the closet they had
for the Labor and Delivery area so they set up camp there, each with a
book and a cell phone, ready to spread the news.&nbsp;
<p>After a lot of prep work the Doctor told the staff to give Jamie some
medicine that might start her contractions, this is a real light drug,
not Pitocen. It really didn't seem to work but after awhile, on it's own,
Jamie's water broke, and then the fun began. Jamie was nauseous and was
sick frequently, hurting too much to talk, she and I developed a series
of hand signals to help me provide for her. She also developed a deep attachment
to my lucky red shirt, with her fist wrapped in it. She later told me later
it felt really good to have hold of it. Some of the faces she made and
the obvious pain she was in terrified me. I would have done anything to
have relieved her of that pain.&nbsp;
<p>Well, although Jamie early on thought she didn't want the Epideral to
decrease the pain, I knew months ago that she would change her mind, and
I'm glad she did. She did pre-register for the Epideral which is a requirement.
Minutes after she got it, she stopped spinning her head around, speaking
in tongues and spitting pea soup. I saw my wife before me again, the exorcism
was a success.&nbsp;
<p>For those of you with concerns about the Epideral, as I had, please
don't discount the ease with which this is applied and the enormous benefit.
Jamie was still very capable of feeling what was going on, and the only
part of the joy of childbirth she missed, was some of the torturous pain.
She has had no back problems and judging by how well it was applied, I
can't imagine she ever will. I am a convert, and after seeing my wife in
that pain, anything I can do to ease that even a bit, I would do.
<p>After the Epideral, Jamie and I both were able to sleep for an hour
or so. She was given a Pitocen drip to increase her contractions and thus
the dilation of the cervix. The drip was increased until finally we started
practicing pushing at 2:30 AM. Neither Jamie nor myself cared very much
for the nurse we had at this point and I found out later, someone right
before us had requested not to get her. She seemed competent, but was kind
of mumbly and hard to understand. We figured Doctor Jardno would be there
soon and we wouldn't have to deal with her much and we were right. She
tried to teach Jamie how to push, but it wasn't until Doctor Jardno got
there that we really got the hang of it. This was around 3:30 AM.&nbsp;
<p>Once the pushing started, Jamie was in pain again, but not even close
to what it would have been without the Epideral. We could watch the contractions
on a monitor and then get her pushing. I used my old martial arts teaching
voice to do loud eight counts for her and keep her focused. I was later
told I was welcome to come back and volunteer coach anytime. Doctor Jardno
was going to avoid doing an episiotomy and performed perineal massage throughout
the delivery which I think helped a lot. When the monitor was removed from
Jamie, Doctor Jardno told her to tell us when a contraction started, as
we could no longer tell. I could tell Jamie wasn't waiting on the contractions,
she just wanted that little Troll out of her. After 3 sets of pushing,
Doctor Jardno got all ready to catch, and I could tell Jamie knew she only
had one more to go. Sure enough, one good push and the head came out, Brennon's
mouth and nose were cleared before they even got the rest of him out. Jamie
later told me his shoulder really hurt her, that may have been when she
was lacerated. It only required a couple of stitches. He was quickly cleaned
and given to Jamie, I did get a picture of the moment, but will save that
captured moment just for us. Jamie was still in a lot of pain as she delivered
the placenta. Brennon was then given a full bath while Doctor Jardno gave
Jamie all her attention. After the placenta was delivered, Jamie obviously
felt a lot better, but was still very uncomfortable, and I feared, in shock,
but her strength and determination allowed her to recover quickly.
<p>We were then moved upstairs to the Mother Baby Unit where all of us
got some sleep for a few hours after the grandparents went home. The day
went by quickly and Jamie got to feeling better fast. We expected to go
home the next day, but in reality, it is more common to stay another night.
Going home early meant we would have to return to get the PKU blood test
and the circumcision, but we were anxious to get home. The night before
we left we got a great surprise as The Tallahassee Shawvers arrived after
a long drive to share the joy with us. Adam and Beth also came for a visit,
I can't wait for them to have this same joy. We learned a lot in the Discharge
Class about things Jamie needed to do to recover and they gave us a lot
of great information for Brennon too.
<p>Brennon was given the "OK" by the pediatrician, Doctor Weiss, and Jamie
was given the "OK" from Doctor Jardno, although she seemed pleasantly surprised
at how quickly Jamie recovered. Grandmama Brown was waiting for us as we
got home with balloons and hugs. She helped us and we got settled in and
comfortable. Grandma Shawver brought us a great dinner which was priceless
considering our tiredness. All of our animals, <a href="Dogs.jpg">2 dogs,
Timber and Onyx</a>, 3 cats, Blade Muffin and Baby and our Parrot, Cougar
seemed interested in Brennon, but not jealous. Onyx actually seemed to
want to mother him, it must be the maternity instinct in all females.&nbsp;
<p>We are currently adjusting ourselves, the animals and the house to accommodate
this little guy. Don't let him fool you, he isn't nearly as bossy or demanding
as he sounds. So far he's been a delight, only having difficulty adjusting
his sleep schedule to a night time schedule, and falling asleep during
feeding.</td>
