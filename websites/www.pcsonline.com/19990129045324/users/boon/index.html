Net Warriors and welcome to my home page. I'm not sure how you got here,
but since you're here, let's get to know each other, me first. Born in
Dalton, GA, Feb 1st, 1964 where I was raised largely on a farm until middle
school. Much of my childhood was spent in the mountains and forests. When
we moved to Bradenton, FL it took some time for me to adjust to the beach
and ocean. Since then I've been a lifeguard, swimming, sailing and windsurfing
instructor, recreation therapist and school teacher.</FONT></CENTER>


<P><IMG SRC="Sunart.gif" HEIGHT=111 WIDTH=90 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=+1>This
was the martial arts school I owned for many, many years where I developed
and instructed a program based on Tae Kwon Do, Hapkido and Kum Do (a Korean
version of sword fighting). I still train a few days a week, but it was
too difficult competing, business wise with all the belt factories and
martial arts schools that were really day cares, so I decided to do something
that would allow me to build for a family and still live the Warrior Ideal.
I am giving some consideration to starting a private martial arts school
only for those dedicated to real martial arts education.</FONT>
