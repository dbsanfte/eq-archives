<td>This past week:
<p>Fun for everyone. I took everyone's' name and level, set up a T.A.G.
(<b>T</b>he <b>A</b>ssassination <b>G</b>ame) List and assigned everyone
someone to hunt down, duel and hopefully kill (or make them yield). Only
the High level person had no one to hunt, and only the low level person
had no one hunting them. Here I am setting up the list.</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>As with all T.A.G. events, it boiled down to two people, usually both
pretty tired from the process to get here. This one was no different. The
Duels were done at various locations and I got no pictures. All fought
bravely and seemed to enjoy this very different event.
<p>The final one ended up being between Daveian and Tashim. Tashim waited
on him in the Arena, this might give him an upper hand.&nbsp;</td>

<td><a href="Tag1.jpg"><img SRC="Tag1.jpg" height=300 width=400></a></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>There was a lot of mesmerizing and some blasting whenever Daveian could
break the Mez. Although the fight seemed slow, with a lot of sitting while
Tashim medded and Daveian was mezzed, it was an edge of your seat fight.</td>

<td><a href="Tag2.jpg"><img SRC="Tag2.jpg" height=300 width=400></a></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Tashim chose a strategy of mezzing and trying to blast when he could,
instead of just power nuking him. Being higher level, that might have been
a better strategy, but Daveian's patience was indomitable.</td>

<td><a href="Tag3.jpg"><img SRC="Tag3.jpg" height=300 width=400></a></td>

<tr>
<td>A few of us got to the Arena to watch the fight, it was very exciting.</td>

<td><a href="Tag4.jpg"><img SRC="Tag4.jpg" height=300 width=400></a></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>In the end, it turned into a blast party on both ends, each blasting
and praying they got the other first. Both got very low in hit points and
it looked as if they both might go down, but Daveian got the final blast
that brought the brave Tashim down.
<p>It was an amazing battle and both do their class, race and this guild
proud.&nbsp;</td>

<td><a href="Tag5.jpg"><img SRC="Tag5.jpg" height=300 width=400></a></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Afterwards they discussed their strategies and commended each other
on a great fight, they even discussed what they had learned from each other.
<p>In the end they headed off to Paw to hunt together, with a hearty congratulations
from all involved.</td>

<p>Some good old fashioned fun in the sand. We had two groups, all Keepers
killing anything Rana and Dask could pull.</td>

<td>We hunted Sand Giants, some seriously pissed off goblins from the lake
and even killed several specters at one time, Thanks to Tashim mezzing
them. Now that I think about it, I believe we were trained there, but with
a good enchanter, no one knew..</td>
