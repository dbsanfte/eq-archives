<FONT COLOR="#003300"><FONT SIZE=+1>Have problems with thieves or murderers?&nbsp;
We have found that they are less of a problem if ye spend time with others,
so come hunt or explore with us. We also can teach thee the best tactics
to discourage them.</FONT></FONT></LI>

more dangerous places, but know that no matter how good ye are, yer nay
a match for the beasts that roam there.&nbsp; We hunt in those places often
and find them invigorating, lucrative and surprisingly clear of thieves
and looters. Going as a team makes this possible, come join the team!</FONT></FONT></LI>
