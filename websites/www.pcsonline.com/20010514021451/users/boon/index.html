<br><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>Hello Net Warriors and welcome
to my home page. I'm not sure how you got here, but since you're here,
let's get to know each other, me first. Born in Dalton, GA, Feb 1st, 1964
where I was raised largely on a farm until middle school. Much of my childhood
was spent in the mountains and forests. When we moved to Bradenton, FL
it took some time for me to adjust to the beach and ocean. Since then I've
been a lifeguard, swimming, sailing and windsurfing instructor, recreation
therapist and school teacher.</font></font></center>

<p><img SRC="Sunart.gif" height=111 width=90 align=LEFT><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>This
was the martial arts school I owned for many, many years where I developed
and instructed a program based on Tae Kwon Do, Hapkido and Kum Do (a Korean
version of sword fighting). I still train a few days a week, but it was
too difficult competing, business wise with all the belt factories and
martial arts schools that were really day cares, so I decided to do something
that would allow me to build for a family and still live the Warrior Ideal.
I am giving some consideration to starting a private martial arts school
only for those dedicated to real martial arts education but instead of
in the Oriental tradition, I will develop it in the tradition of the Celtic
Fianna.</font></font>
<p><font color="#003300"><font size=+1>I have a great job as the Network
Administrator of <a href="http://www.southtrust.com">Southtrust Bank</a>
on the Suncoast. Prior to this I was a Sr. Customer Service Engineer for
<a href="http://www.teltronics.com/">Teltronics.</a>&nbsp; I sepcialize
in Windows NT (4.0 &amp; 3.51), Windows 95/98, SQL, all Microsoft products,</font>
<font size=+1>PC hardware and I am a Cerified ATM LAN Engineer. I am currently
working in a Novel environment and enjoying it more than I thought I would.
I obviously love web design and even built a small Intranet for Teltronics.</font></font>
