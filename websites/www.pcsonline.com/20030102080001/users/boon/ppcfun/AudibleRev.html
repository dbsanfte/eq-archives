<br>As a follow-up to what I wrote below about Susie Bright, she has started
including an interview with each episode of her subscription and that makes
them nearly an hour long now. She is so far from the mainstream (at least
for those of us that may consider ourselves liberal here in Florida), with
her background in San Francisco, that she can get some wild people to interview.
check it out. I also get the impression that because she is doing so well
and her subscription is popular, and that Audible.com is becoming popular,
that her subscription rates will probably go up soon.
<p>Also, I got Margaret Cho's comedy routine from Audible, "Drunk with
Power." She's a freak, cracks me up. I'm thinking of getting George Carlin's
this month, He is hilarious. It shocked me when my son was watching that
Thomas the Train show and George was narrating it. OMFG!
<p>Archive Below:
<br>(4/1/02)
<br>Lately I've been checking out The Hobbit and enjoying some of Susie
Bright's subscriptions. This is the time of year when everyone's fancy
turns to ... well, to be romantic about it...boinking. Check out all the
erotic works at Audible, I highly suggest "26 Nights: A Sexual Adventure
(Unabridged)," for you and your partner.

<br>If you don't subscribe to <a href="http://www.audible.com/">Audible.com</a>
then you are missing one of the biggest and best parts of owning a Pocket
PC. I'm not kidding. Some people listen to them through their Microsoft
Reader and that does work, but I've had much better success with using
the Audible.com Manager that you can download from their page for free.
<p>Now I commute about 30 minutes one way per day and I hate listening
to repetitive idiot boy bands (bands?!?! if they are bands, where are their
instruments?!), ignorant opinionated talk radio and especially 30 minutes
of commercials with a song or two thrown in. So I bought a tiny set of
Sony speakers and plug those into my Pocket PC and listen to my Audible
Subscriptions and Books. Here is how it works, for less than $10.00 a month
you can download any one Audible book (some priced over $30.00 if you were
to buy them), AND...you get any one subscription.
<p>Subscriptions vary but many are NPR Radio shows that you might be able
to get elsewhere, I can't. The best ones for your entertainment bucks in
my opinion are <u>In Bed with Susie Bright</u>, and <u>Robin Williams Interviews</u>.
Susie's show is always fun and always informative. She has a vast history
as being a "sexpert" and has a sense of humor that really shows too. Robin's
show consists of him interviewing different people. There are usually two
shows for each victim, err, interviewee. Robin often gets wild but is sometimes
very serious, but he is always fun. My favorite is still him and Billy
Crystal. One does Mohammed Ali and the other does Howard Cossel, they play
off each other unlike any two people ever could.
<p>The Book selection is vast and gets more so on a daily basis. I remember
buying audible books on tape at Cracker Barrel restaurants, listening to
them on the trip, then trading them in for others (at a loss) at another
Cracker Barrel restaurant down the road. It's way better than radio. I've
been an Audible.com basic member for a long time and have listened to some
great stuff. <u>Memoirs of a Geisha</u> (unabridged) by Arthur Golden was
great, although a bit heavy. It tells the tale of a girl sold into the
world of the Geisha prior to W.W.II. It follows her life and struggles
through the war as well as into this country. <u>John Adams</u> by David
McCullough tales the biography of our second president and clearly illustrates
the world in which he lived. Much of the book is written by John himself
from letters he wrote to his wife, son and friends. It is remarkable to
hear the grasp of language these people had that we have so horribly destroyed
in our time.
<p>I enjoy action and mystery so I picked up <u>Last Man Standing</u> (Unabridged)
by David Baldacci. This tells a strange story of Web London. He is on the
FBI Assault Task Force. The book opens with a planned assault that turns
into an ambush in which everyone on his team is killed...except for him.
The book follows his path, personal and professional as he solves the mystery
of who killed his team and why. This is a very well written book and at
no point did I feel like Baldacci was rushing through a chapter to get
to the ending like I did in both <u>Roses are Red</u> and <u>Violets are
Blue</u> by James Patterson. More than a few times was I tired of hearing
Detective Alex Cross' drone on and on, pondering the why's and who's of
crimes committed when, even without the hints given by the author, I would
have figured them out. Cross is supposed to be smart and gifted with accurate
"gut feelings," but he seemed to skip past vital evidence and logic to
instead complain incessantly about this or that. Even the names of the
books seem to me like Patterson was rushing. Probably the best in this
genre that I've listened to so far is <u>The Lion's Game</u> by Nelson
DeMille. The unabridged version would be $41.95 if you bought it, so that
Audible membership is very nice. This book was written before September
11th and has kind of some spooky foreshadowing in it. The writing style
is exquisite as everything dealing with our hero, cynical New York Cop
John Corey, is written in first person, the rest is written in third person.
A style I see emerging quite a bit in literature lately. John works on
the Anti Terrorist Task Force in conjunction with the FBI and CIA. They
are hunting a terrorist that arrived "like Dracula," on a plane that landed
on autopilot because everyone on board was a corpse already. There is a
lot of reality in this book, a lot of insight to the fanatical terrorist
mind, there is romance and there is a lot of humor. The lead character
is quick with the smart-ass-attacks and more than a few times had me laughing
out loud.
<p>What am I listening to now? Well, I've never been much of a Ann Rice
fan, not because I don't think she is talented, she most certainly is,
but because I was never really into the whole goth/vamp thing, it just
bugs me. Real men don't wear satin and you'll never see a goth hiking the
Florida trail or windsurfing in the Gulf of Mexico. As I mentioned above
I finished <u>Violets are Blue</u> by James Patterson and a part of the
story revolves around these idiots that believe they are vampires and the
murders they commit. Got my interest peeked so I rented and watched <u>Interview
with a Vampire</u> again, quickly read a used copy of <u>Queen of the Damned</u>
(also in theaters now I hear) and then downloaded <u>Blood and Gold</u>.
So far the lead character is a Norseman that goes by Thorn and he is sitting
and listening to Marius tell him of his long life. Now, I'd almost be bored
but I love history and I love a good story. Rice knows how to draw fiction
from history so you can really feel like these people had been alive since
the Golden Age of Rome. She also does a great job describing the magic
and special gifts the Vampires have without going into detail. Details
about such things would spoil the fun. Now the best thing about this book,
besides Rice's skill at writing, and that it is unabridged, is that it
is read by Robert Rees. His accent is such that you feel like when Marius
is speaking that you are listening to someone with thousands of years of
education and refinement. He portrays Thorn in a Germanic way that you
can almost hear being shouted at Cassius Caesar across the battlefield.
I'm greatly enjoying it, much more so than the Alex Cross books.
