<p>Day Twentyone-Twentyfour: Sea to Shining Sea
<p>The Eastern Commonlands, are a mix of savannah and desert, and a beautiful
place indeed, with the warm breezes flowing off the hot sands. I traveled
along the base of the mountains, past the entrance to the dungeon known
as Befallen, and into the Western Commonlands. At the very edge of the
East Commonlands I came upon <b><a href="desruins.jpg">ruins of an ancient
monument</a></b>. I was stunned, for this monument had the very same markings
as those found on the ones back in Kobald valley in Faydwer.&nbsp; Had
some culture sprang up that had at some time in the distant past dominated
two of the continents of Norrath? Or perhaps it was a religion? Would I
eventually see such monuments in Kunark or Vellious, should I ever venture
to those far off and dangerous places? I will have to wonder for my journey
carried me quickly past the ruins and I did not stop to make an extensive
examination. Perhaps on my way back home.
<p>The Western Commonlands are made up of light forest and have their share
of dangers. Griffawns, Griffins, Giant Spiders, and such, were as easily
avoided as I had done the Hill Giants of the East Commonlands, through
the use of my Invisibility spell. I found the pass and entered into the
Kithicor Forest. The <b><a href="kithicor.jpg">Kithicor</a></b> is much
like the Faydark, but has less of a canopy. On the other hand it has no
real settlements, but ample signs of failed ones. The burned out remains
of houses and farms litter the forest. The place seems haunted to me although
I came to no harm traveling through it. I had traveled for most of the
day by the time I passed through the Kithicor and into <b><a href="riverval.jpg">Rivervale</a></b>.
Here I decided to rest at an Inn for the night.
<p>Originally the directions given me by Mysteria Whitestaff would have
taken me onwards through Misty Thicket and eventually through both RunnyEye
Citadel, home of the Goblins, and through an area known only as the Beholders
Maze. As I was leaving town though I bumped into a Halfling Druid by the
name of Rayvin, who was headed to Eastern Karana, a place further along
the route given me by Mysteria. He told me that he was going to go via
the HighHold Pass, a mining town and keep that controlled a shorter though
no less dangerous route across the mountains known as the Serpent's Spine.
It took us a bit of a while to get organized, since he was recently resurrected
and hungry and without food.&nbsp; In fact that was his reason for going
to East Karana; to reclaim his belongings. Apparently a lioness had killed
him recently. In any event we didn't leave Rivervale till past noon and
by the time we approached the pass it was dark.
<p>The journey through HighHold Pass was a blur of fixed images and shifting
shadows. We raced the moon, me following Rayvin as well as I could although
several times he had to stop and retrace his steps to find me. I remember
lots of ups and downs, the harsh tapping of a guards footsteps as we hid
and he passed by below us, the murmured conversations of HighHold citizens
that never saw us. A few times I felt a sudden emptiness to one side or
another and once I felt the hard rock underneath me change to wood and
felt wet mist on my cheek. I realized I was standing a few feet from the
edge of a sizable drop down into a pool, fed by a moonlit waterfall across
from me. I could easily have stumbled over the edge in the night and never
known until I drowned below. Eventually we passed through a gate and Rayvin
told me to stay to one side for the drop was on the other. We followed
the cliffs, under the peering gaze of dimly lit, deep etched faces carved
into the sides of the cliffs overlooking us. Three times we passed by teetering
towers, I would call them ruins but they were lit from within by torches,
and in one I heard what sounded like guttural voices. We did not stop in
all this time, nor speak and I sensed that although the residents of the
town were Human perhaps they were not exactly friendly ones.
<p>We reached the plains of Eastern Karana, as the sun rose, over the mountains
behind us. Following the road we eventually came to a stone <b><a href="ekarana.jpg">roadway
marker</a></b>, and two fellows, who ignored any attempts to converse with
them. Rayvin pointed me down the road and in the distance I saw a great
bridge which he said led to the plains of North Karana and eventually to
the city of Qeynos. I thanked him and started towards the bridge as he
headed off into the plains to find and loot his corpse.
<p>It seemed like only a second or two after we had parted company that
I heard a yell of rage which suddenly veered upwards to a screech of pain
and cut off suddenly. I rushed back along the road passing the complacent
and snobbish Squire and his guardian Sir Morgan, and found Rayvin sprawled
lifeless mere yards from the road. I used my thoughtspeak to call out to
him and he answered me... from back in Rivervale. I informed him I would
wait for him, it was not much more then a morale boost since I didn't know
the way back to HighHold to meet him half way with his goods, but I owed
him at least the time to wait. So I waited.&nbsp; Twice more, Rayvin made
his way though the HighHold pass into the plains of Karana, and each time
he was cut down, once by another patrolling Lion and once by a Giant of
some kind. I waited all day by the stone watching as the sun first rose
then fell. At last as the sun set behind the <b><a href="bridgset.jpg">Great
Bridge</a></b>, Rayvin came running into view with a&nbsp; zombie hot on
his trail.
<p>We raced for the bridge for the Undead have an aversion to crossing
running water, and rejoiced when we were safe on the other side, in the
Northern Plains. Rayvin thanked me for waiting and said he still had to
go back for his original corpse from yesterday. I hazed and strengthened
him and wished him luck. Had I thought of it I would have cast invisibility
on him as well but a day spent baking in the heat of the Plains, hiding
from roaming lions that crisscrossed them like Guards in a search pattern
had left me tired. I watched him cross the bridge and fade out into the
dust of the Plains, and I wonder if he succeeded in getting to his corpse
or did the Plains once again strike him down. I doubt I will ever know.
<p>It was near midnight and my instructions were to follow the river but
I chose to wait for daybreak so I would have a better chance of seeing
my surroundings. As day broke, wet and full of rain, I followed the northern
part of the Serpent river south. I came upon a great abandoned <b><a href="whitruin.jpg">Bridge</a></b>,
made of marble and stone, rising out of the fog. Although I was invisible,
I felt as though someone were watching me, and was nervous until it was
well out of view behind me.
<p>A while further, I heard voices and as I crested the next rise I saw
a large group of people standing in formation along the river. I crept
closer wondering who they were and why they were standing here near the
river. As I did so they began to cast spells upon one another, and spar
with weapons. It was quite obviously a <b><a href="raiders.jpg">training
session</a></b> of some kind but still I stayed invisible, and watching.
The leader, a large man with a&nbsp; scar across his nose, called for attention
and the group lined up. he began explaining attack plans and the group
began the usual boastful chatter of soldiers preparing for battle. As I
listened I realized these "soldiers" were nothing but common bandits and
their talk of invasions was of a small fishing village somewhere down the
river. The leader called for the group to eat, then they would march and
I began to run. I had to at least attempt to warn the fisherman did I not?
<p>There are many many good things about being a Gnome, but as I ran I
realized short legs wasn't one of them. I knew that the meal they bandits
enjoyed would be a short one and soon they would march. I also knew it
would undoubtedly take time for me to find the <b><a href="fishvill.jpg">village</a></b>,
explain and for the fisherman to leave. I hoped I had enough time. My legs
ached and I had to stop twice to work&nbsp; out a&nbsp; cramp, but I made
it, just after the rains stopped. The fisherman were most surprised when
I appeared out of nowhere in front of them, but quickly grasped what I
was trying to explain and hurried to gather their families and belongings.
A small bag of fish cakes were passed of to me as reward and the fisherman
and their families boarded small canoes and paddled off down the river.
I recast invisible on myself and continued on and it was but a half hour
later, no more, when I saw smoke rising behind me as the village burned.
<p>The rest of the trip was uneventful, pretty much. I found and followed
an sturdy stone road wide enough for a wagon into the <b><a href="longroad.jpg">rising
moon</a></b>, and soon, found myself at the <b><a href="qeynos.jpg">gates
of Qeynos</a></b>.
<br>As I entered the city, I felt happy to once more be inside sturdy stone
walls, among a friendly if somewhat tall people. I passed the market, and
headed to the piers because it simply felt right to see Erud's Crossing,
before I found an Inn for the night. At the <b><a href="qocean.jpg">docks</a></b>,
I met another Enchanter, one who had a wondrous pet. She explained to me
that an Enchanter named Pendril had created an animated sword and shield
to fight for him and that his spell was now available for all Enchanters.
I felt a warm glow inside for this was a good thing indeed.
<p>I headed towards an Inn and fell deeply into sleep. I dreamed of my
journeys so far and awoke with
<br>a light step and a happy heart.&nbsp; I soon&nbsp; heard news that
changed all that though. I had decided I would go to Erudrin to purchase
the Animation spell I had seen last night but arrived at the docks to find
consternation. The ferry to Erudrin had never returned to port after its
last docking the night before and no wreckage had been found by fishing
vessels that plied the Crossing. It was as if the vessel had simply vanished
into thin air.
<p>The second and even more disturbing news was merely a rumor, but it
had the solidity of one well told and even more importantly, one well believed.
The rumor went that some time around noon on the day after I left Rivervale,
Tholius Quey, the charming and intelligent man of faith I had conversed
with in Freeport had spoken from the top floor of the Temple of Marr to
the faithful. He had stated that the Lightbearer had deserted Norrath and
it's people, then leapt to his death seven floors below.
<br>Even more ominous, he was not resurrected by the gods.
<p>I have written before of Death, but even though it is a harsh experience,&nbsp;
most of us do not ever truly believe it to be a permanent one. Sure death
is something that eventually comes, and permanently to all beings, but
only when they are ready to move on to the next world. The idea of TRUE
DEATH, the death that takes you even though you struggle against it, the
death that is PERMANENT, is as foreign to most citizens of Norrath as the
idea of life beyond its boundaries. It is frankly, a scary thought and
the mood throughout Qeynos on this morning was as bleak as the plains of
Everfrost.
<p>I think it was here, standing on the docks, and watching the milling,
confused, scared people of Qeynos, that I first began to lose my faith.
Not per se my faith in Brell Serelis, but my faith that even he, or in
fact any God,&nbsp; mattered in the grand scheme of things. Perhaps the
Gods themselves were as helpless as we?
