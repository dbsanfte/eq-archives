<p><b><font color="#ffffff">Bear Hide Armor</font></b><br>
In the Qeynos Hills, near the Surefall Glade zoneline, you can find an NPC named Chanda
Mller. She can often be found near the campfire. Chanda can make you bear hide armor if
you provide her with a bear skin and some coin. Unless you tell her that her brother
brother named 'Baobob' sent you, she will not talk to you. Ask her about her bear hide
armor and she will fill you in on details regarding the quality and cash requirements for
each piece. (Quite possibly, depending on your faction, you do not have to say anything to
her. Just simply give her the items and she will give you the armor in return.) </p>
