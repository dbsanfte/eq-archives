<P><I>By the man himself,</I> <B><FONT SIZE="+1">stump</FONT></B>
</P>

<P>i crawled up onto the short and stout oaken stump, setting myself
in the traditional wide battle stance of my people. reaching over my
shoulders my thumbs quickly released my twin axes from the double
battle harness strapped to my back. i felt the friendly weight in my
hands and couldn't help but smile.</P>

<P>arching back i let loose a bellow to the barbarians, "my large
friends! set down your weapons and i will let you live!" one stood
holding the squirming elf, blinking confusion at me. six others
twisted about, readiing themselves for battle. they all laughed
heartily as two sauntered over to the stump where i waited, obviously
thinking me no match for them.</P>

<P>the one to my right had a battle ax that was easily three times
the size of the ones i held. he sneered as he spoke, "little one, our
fight was not with you. you should have run to your cave and let the
elfling die." he made a quick cutting motion with his free hand,
passing it over his neck. my new barbarian friends exchanged a bit of
conversation i didn't hear since i was dodging a swipe from an ax
coming from my right. the other swung his huge sword meaning to kill
me in one stroke. i quickly ducked the blade, spinning on my heel. as
he ever-extended his swing passed, i caught him with a backhanded
strike with my right ax, driving it into the back of his neck with a
satisfiing <I>thunk!</I>. he toppled, lifeless, across the path of
the other dim-witted brute, who tripped over him. the
soon-to-be-corpse fell forward, his face catching the blade of my
second ax in a stroke of luck like none other i've had. my axe dug
deep into the skull. i kicked the dead body off of my ax and
repositioned myself, adopting my clan's battle stance on the big
stump. the large leader with another ax nearly three times the size
of mine spoke quick words to the remaining three. not laughing
anymore, they slowly came abreast of the stump and began circling it.
they all shouted incoherently trying to bring fear into my heart and
perhaps the berzerker rage to themselves.</P>

<P>i shouted back, "young fools! can you not see i am from the
mountain? just as the mountain is unmovable, so am i!" and let out a
rolling laugh that bolstered my spirits.</P>

<P>they advanced as one, swinging and lunging with their weapons. i
answered their rapid attacks, spinning around on the stump while
cutting with my axes. i danced from foot to foot, twirling and
slashing til only the large leader remained.</P>

<P>i smiled triumphantly at him.</P>

<P>he hesitated a moment, tooking three steps back to gawk at his
fallen companions. a twisted look came to his face as he raised his
ax above his head, preparing for the final charge. my smile never
faded. not when he went berzerk, his veins nearly popping from his
flesh. not when he roared like the wild beast.</P>

<P>i leaned back on one foot, spread my arms wide reaching back with
my axes. as he took his first step, i snapped forward bringing my
axes around. at the end of the powerful motion, my hands let the
dwarven forged weapons loose. they spun end over end towards the huge
man charging me. the axes caught him in his chest, one to each side
of center.</P>

<P>he continued for another three steps, the rage burning inside him.
i watched blood soak his tunic. his wild drooling became red with
blood as he suddenly dropped to his knees. his ax, still held high,
fell behind him as he slumped to the side. a look of panic started to
creep into his eyes, but never totally replacing the rage. he tried
to hold himself up with the edge of the stump, clawing at me. i
watched with silent disgust as death finally claimed him and his arms
gave out. i smirked, "told you."</P>

<P>i kicked him over and retrieved my axes, cleaning them on his
deerskin tunic. there was more movement and i remembered there was
one more. damnit! i thought, thisll be the end of me!</P>

<P>i looked up to see the elf lady walking over towards me. "the
other?" i asked simply.</P>

<P>"he ran off when you killed his chief," she said as she came to my
side. after a moments pause where she studied my hardened features,
"why did you save me?"</P>

<P>"dont know, just dont like people who take advantage of smaller
folk i guess" i stammered, trying not to blush under her scrutiny.
</P>

<P>the elf lady smiled, "what is your name, oh great warrior of the
stump?" as she poked the dead chief with her toe, then sat on the
stump beside me, still watching my face. i stayed standing so i could
look down at her.</P>

<P>i sighed, then said with a frown, "i have no name, it was stripped
from me by my people. they made me leave my home in the mountain" i
looked away from her as my breath caught in my throat and tears
threatened at the thought of my beloved home.</P>

<P>she started to ask why but stopped when she saw the pain in my
eyes. the elf lady smiled again and said, "well then, i shall call
you..." she though a moment, then, with a mischievious grin: "i shall
call you, sir stump, my champion and savior."</P>

<P>"HAHAHA," i bellowed, "so shall it be, and what be your name lady
elf?" i bowed regally.</P>

<P>"i am Annolin, daughter of Endemer, please come with me, i will
take you to my home for food and a nights rest." with that, she
jumped up, grabbed my hand and began dragging me away...</P>
