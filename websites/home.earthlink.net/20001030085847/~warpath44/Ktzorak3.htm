<P>The waves of fever distorted the road ahead, concealing the dust
on the horizon. The wounded troll grunted as a stream of drool
whipped back onto his face going over the last bump. Ktzorak pulled
the cart alone, digging marks in the ground with each step. The
enchantress had yet to wake up, and Ktzorak knew she would die soon
if she did not see a shaman. On top of that, the moon was almost new,
meaning he had to get the stone up this mountain or his whole tribe
might fall. He could only hope whatever threat was on this mountain
would have attracted his tribal shaman, so that he might be near.
</P>

<P>Ktzorak felt the charred flesh on his legs growing numb, and
wondered if they would ever heal. Since the road started winding
up-hill, the task of pulling the wagon had become insanely difficult.
Feeling as if he might lose ground by shifting his weight wrong, the
troll was moving slowly. His thoughts drifted off in his delirium to
the Shadow Lord, thinking what he would look like. Was he beautiful
to behold? Or was he supremely ugly? Perhaps he did not exist at all.
Perhaps the voices where just echoes of his own thoughts. The voices
were getting louder.</P>

<P>He had vague memory of this place Eliza described as the
destination. Lots of fallen rocks that looked like a circle. Other
than that, he could be heading the wrong way, could be at the wrong
mountain and possibly had passed the circle of stones, and was
getting further away. However, there was something calling to him
here, something was close by that he could almost feel. Ktzorak's
eyes rolled up into his head for a moment, and suddenly he was
brought back to reality by the ground shaking.</P>

<P>Shaking it was, violently. Ktzorak lost his grip and he, the wagon
and the stone slid back down the road, over a large stone and into a
deep thicket. Ktzorak let out a low moan as he glanced at the broken
wagon wheels, and the half-shattered wagon hull. He laid there,
wondering if Eliza had been killed in the fall. He crawled up the
side, and glanced down at her to hear her groan and stretch. The
grimace that crossed her face matched his own feelings.</P>

<P>"<I>Wakey-wakey oomie. We at the mountain, but cannot pull the
stone.</I>" Ktzorak spoke to her. "<I>Are you ok?</I>" he asked.</P>

<P>Eliza slowly stood up and stumbled out of the wagon wreckage,
examining the scattered gold and loot, and then looking at the
half-upright black stone. It looked almost like an evil horn sticking
up out of the thicket. "Yes troll, I am ok. I am in your debt, and
will not be able to repay you. You are free to go, we will not be
able to get the stone any further. You should head north, this place
will soon be void of life according to the prophecy"</P>

<P>"<B>Is that so?"</B> boomed a voice from up the road. The
Enchantress and the Troll glanced up the road to see the human
warrior in shining armor coupled by a tall and slender high elf. The
elf was in a pure white robe that glowed in the swampy mist. "You are
certainly strange woman, keeping company with a slithering troll. I
would strike you down if I felt that you were beyond help, beyond the
savior." The holy knight led his war horse down the path. "Troll,
step away from the woman, and prepare thy soul for salvation!"</P>

<P>"Hold!" cried the elf. "This woman was professing her debt of
gratitude to the troll for saving her life, and hath commanded him to
flee the impending destruction of the valley. Nay Corwin let this one
go. If he is possessed of evil he will seek you out later and then
you can kill him."</P>

<P>The Paladin stopped, and sheathed his sword. "Aralanth, can we
move this stone with your magics alone? We may need to reconstruct
the woman's cart and have the troll pull it further." Ktzorak snorted
at the though, giving a last look at Eliza before limping down the
hill. The Elf Aralanth cried out to him.</P>

<P>"<I>Wait troll, he is right. My magics cannot pull the stone to
the sacred circle alone, but we can get it up the steep incline with
your help and my spells. Please, I offer to heal you in return for
your work." </I>He spoke in the troll's language.</P>

<P>"You speak troll like north man. Fellhorv laugh" Ktzorak chuckled
at the elf, and continues in his broken common tongue. "Fellhorv know
elf's offer is good. Elf heal Ktzorak now, then we pull rock." </P>

<P>Aralanth proceeded to summon great energies, as blue orbs of
elemental water circled his outstretched hand, making a distinct 
sound like crystals chiming but muffled by the churning of an unseen
ocean, all sounding like an echo or a memory, some what intangible.
With a word of power Aralanth brought the orbs to a glowing spin and
refracted the pale sunlight into beams of energy, restoring the burnt
flesh to new again. The orbs disappeared like airborne froth, and
even the paladin had a look of awe upon his face.

</P>

<P>The group gathered the spilled loot and wagon parts and laid out
the parts for repair. They raced against the sun, fearing the
mountain would start to shake again or some other impending doom.
They shared stories about each individuals interpretation of the
prophecy, one that told of the mountain cracking and death falling on
the lands, bringing a rain of fire and a torrent of  storms. Tales of
the earth swallowing cities whole, and the oceans swelling to fill
the space left behind. Truly each vision of the prophecy was no
better than the next. It was clear the stone must be brought to this
for mentioned circle but not clear as to what was to be done.
Unfortunately the runes on the stone itself were alien to all
present, being totally unfamiliar or like any written language or
magic. One thing was certain about the stone, the fact that it seemed
to resemble a tombstone in the runes layout like a eulogy or epitaph,
and symbols resembling the pagan god of death and the gate of souls
graced the stone as well.</P>

<P>Aralanth spent the fading light teaching Eliza a particular magic
of enchantment that would bind the wagon back together and allow them
to put the stone back in. Afterwards he started preparing the spell
to summon a mighty being of pure earth to move the stone up the steep
incline. All the while Ktzorak sat watching, hungry for food they did
not have but a glimmer of interest for the strange magics grew in his
eyes.  His mind played over the effects of Eliza's spell on him and
the distinct words of power they used, so like the riddles and mind
games of his own tribal shaman. Ktzorak for a moment thought his
whole life to present was planned for him by some dark god,
controlled by dark magics and his fate sealed by his very desire to
live. Bah.</P>

<P>Ktzorak shook his head of the thought and started to look for
animal tracks, looking for much needed food. "<I>How much longer
Eliza, before we move?</I>"<I> </I>Ktzorak grumbled, sighting some
fresh goat droppings and a set of tracks.</P>

<P>"Not long, but hunt if you must for you will need to be strong
later." She replied. The troll snatched two good stones and raced
down the hill after the goat tracks.</P>

<P>The goat was moving away from the mountain, obviously frightened
by the shaking. Ktzorak raced down the slope over to a ledge where he
could see a few goats moving at moderate speed across the next hill,
quite out of range of his stones. Ktzorak snorted and looked for the
quickest way down and to that hill, snarling at luck. His eyes
followed the narrow bare spots in the sage were deer would run,
seeing how it was the goats got there, and some movement nearby drew
his attention. Coming up the near side of this same slope was a trio
of trolls. </P>

<P>At first Ktzorak was very pleased to see them until he noticed the
red tattoo bands on each warriors arms, marking them as the residents
of the Green Skin River Tribe. Blood enemies, and no doubt very
stupid, uneducated in the ways of combat compared to the Fellhorvs.
He was certain they intended to attack his comrades, and he had to do
something. As he sunk into the brush the passing wind reminded him he
was hunting upwind of them, just as he heard them snarl at his
stench. He could not avoid the conflict now, so he summoned up a
great breath and gave war cry for the mountains to hear, calling out
the name of the great troll lord Klorskul the Cannibal, father of the
12 tribes.</P>

<P>"KLORSKUL CON VIKTA!" he bellowed, leaping down the hill with the
mace ready to strike.

</P>

<P>Corwin the Paladin stepped forth and noted how strange it was the
trolls fought amongst themselves when all four could have turned on
them and defeated the humans and the elf. "It boggles my mind as to
the nature of trolls, so primitive." He commented. Aralanth continued
his chanting, unaware of the conflict below.</P>

<P>"Trolls are very much like men Corwin, and if they taught you a
few things about monsters in your temple other than bloodletting
habits you would not be so quick to pass judgment." Eliza smirked,
and proceeded down the hill to achieve proper spell range. "Aren't
you going to help him? I thought you said we needed his help?"</P>

<P>Corwin hesitated and finally just grunted his negative reply "It
is unholy, m'lady. Your soul is in danger." The Paladin then turned
back up the hill. </P>
