<p><b>Hello my name is Zben, and this is my story.&nbsp; My father is named
Dewis Caneal, you may or may not have heard of him, especially if you travel
the darker side. He's one of the leading Necromancers in Ak'Anon and works
in the secret necromancers section of the Mines of Malfunction.&nbsp; Like
most fathers he wanted, nay expected me to follow in his footsteps. There
was just one thing wrong with that.... I can't stand the undead!</b>
<br><b>On my 16th birthday, when all young Gnomes are expected to choose
a profession, I and he had an argument, well in point of fact he nearly
killed me. I had refused to become a Necromancer and he became enraged.
When I awoke in the streets of the market, I was alone, copperless, and
had no home. All my family and&nbsp; friends, who were pretty much all
into the Undead liberation movement as they jokingly referred to it, abandoned
me too. If not for a chance encounter who knows what would have happened
to me, but that's another story....</b>
<br><b>In the end the path I chose is that of the Magic of Mind and Alteration,
Enchantment.</b>
<br><b>I am now 18 and fledgling Enchanter, after serving a two year apprenticeship
to Mistress Ulmcaller. This is my story, such as it is....</b>
