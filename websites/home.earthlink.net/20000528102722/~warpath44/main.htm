<P>We welcome you to our hall. We are the Fraterni Lux, an online
guild of Sony's promising game, EverQuest. We are a good group, who
strives to uphold the highest standards of honor in all our actions
and welcome all races and professions to join us in our quest for
justice. Our name, derived from the ancient language of the High
Elves, means Fellowship of Light in the common tongue, and similarly,
our motto translated into common speech would be, "Let Honor Not
Fail". We put a high value on friendship and activity, and look for
the most dedicated players, as well as those like to role-play. The
Fraterni Lux try to give each member the most individuality possible
within a guild structure, being a very democratic unit which focuses
more on teamwork and friendship than on guild objectives. And most of
all, we take great care to ensure that everyone enjoys themselves,
because more than anything else, we want our members to have FUN. We
take pride in our commitment to honor, family, activity, and
role-playing and hope that anyone else who shares these goals will
join us in our many adventures through the world of Norrath. Please,
read on traveler, and may the light of virtue shine upon thee,
whatever thy race or profession may be.</P>

<P><I>Flanked by two somber looking warriors clad in heavy armor
after your nearly fatal battle with a band of marauding creatures,
you are led to a clearing where upon you are given food and drink.
"Rest," they say to you, "here ye shall find only peace and
friendship, we shall protect thee traveler, for we are the Fraterni
Lux!" The name instantly conjures up rumors you have heard from
various taverns of a powerful guild composed of many peoples and
professions who roam the lands of Norrath to aid weary adventurers
such as yourself. But save these few bits of information, the group
remains largely a mystery to you, and you decide to take this
opportunity to discover more about them.</I></P>

<P><I>As you sit and drink the warm ale provided to you by the
mysterious warriors, you watch in amazement at the site that unfolds
before you. Humans, working alongside elves, without any hint of
disgust between each other. Dwarves, gnomes, and Erudites laugh and
joke as they engage in various tasks without the slightest hint of
reproach. What startles you even more is the appearance of some
Ogres, Dark Elves, and Trolls, and wonder why no one else takes
notice. As you instinctively draw your sword from the sheath, you
hear the warriors cry out to you, "Hold thy blade traveler! We are
all brethren of the Fraterni Lux, do not be alarmed at what you see!
We here work together, regardless of race and profession, to bring
justice to our troubled lands and uphold the highest standards of
honor. None of us here hold evil intentions, but follow the paths of
light and fight together in the name of all that is good. Come
closer, sit near our camp fire, and we shall teach thee our ways and
customs." Still amazed at all that has transpired, you slowly move
towards them as you notice all kinds of people's staring at you not
with contempt, but with warm smiles upon their face. As you make your
way towards the campfire, you rub your eyes once more in disbelief,
wondering if what you see is merely a dream, ever curious to learn
more about this unique group of adventurers...</I></P>
