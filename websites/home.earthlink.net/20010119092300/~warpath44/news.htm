who kills every Necromancer on site be a criminal in Qeynos. I am
quite certain this was not referring to killing within city limits,

On Monday Brad McQuaid graced us with another #everquest chat
session. Although there were a few problems in the beginning, such as
Brad being nuked twice, the meeting was for the most part informative
and productive. A log of the chat is available </FONT><FONT

and Exit Under Burning Skies. The Fraterni Lux had more members
attend than any other guild and more questions(might I add some of
the most intelligent) answered than any other individual or group. I
would like to thank everyone who attended and helped make the chat
meeting a success both for the guild and the Everquest community with
your thoughtful questions. I am honored to serve such an active,
intelligent, and devoted group such as ye and may we continue to
enrich the land of Norrath!<BR>

fellow brother Xethusael, has announced that there will be a new chat
meeting with Brad McQuaid this coming Monday. It will be held March
2nd at 8:00 pm CST on the #everquest server at Efnet. Apparently, new
information regarding beta will be revealed. Last meeting we had one
of the highest attendance rates out of any Everquest guild and
several of our member's questions were addressed by Mr. McQuaid. This
next meeting shall certainly be as informative and will shed light on
the crucial topic of beta so I encourage all of thee to attend. A log
of the entire conversation shall be posted on our site and I hope to
see all of ye there!<BR>

Since Fraterni Lux was founded we did not have a counter to track
visitors until a mere three days ago. Now that we installed the
counter we see that over a hundred people visited since. I hope this
is a clear sign that the fans of EverQuest hear our voices when we
speak and have sought us out. Hold thine head high and speak with

Test. In fact, a new section is devoted to it. This page is basically
to correct any misinformation that may be going around, nothing is
new.. However, now we have a section to point people new to EverQuest
towards, maybe that will cut down on the "How do I get into Beta"
questions.<BR>

Fraterni Lux Undergoes Major Changes<BR>

</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">As ye may have noticed,
the site has remained largely static and scarcely updated. The reason
for this is that we are currently in the process of building a much
better site. Unfortunately, it shall have to remain under a veil of
secrecy until its completion, as we do not want to release an
unfinished product. All hail WarDragon who is now in charge of our
web page development team and will be responsible for its
construction. Moreover, I have made many refinements to our current
policies and implemented a few changes to ensure overall guild
efficiency, activity, and fun. Be sure to check your mail for more
updates regarding these changes as I will soon have our guild
constitution completed. Thanks :)<BR>

Hello all, I am glad to announce my first time working on the FL web
page, and as well tell you about a few of the changes you can expect
soon. First off, I have put that nifty little counter on the index
page. Now to the enhancements you can expect. 1) As soon as I get
crypt around to doing it, he is going to redesign the site a bit,
make it better looking, and easier to navigate. 2) I am going to add
alot about the IRC RPG, and hopefully a link to both the Lux channel
and the RPG channel. </FONT></P>

Since our grand opening to the public a mere two weeks ago, we
haverecieved an enormous amount of applicants. Our guild now
encompassesmany who seek the path of light and who administer various
EQ newssites, most being active particpants in EverQuest message
boards. Dueto this outstanding growth in numbers and applicants, our
guild hasvoted on an addendum to the current membership policies. In
additionto the application and interview, applicants will then
advance tophase 3 where they shall be asked to hang around our guild
channel onEffnet #lux where they shall familiarize themselves with
members ofthe Fraterni Lux. This will make recruiting more effective,
and allowfor our members to get to know the applicants and decide
along withthe coordinators whether the particluar person is worthy of
ourorder. Although these measures make us more selective and
demandingon applicants, if your heart is true and you are a mature
candidate,then ye shall surely have a place among us : ) </FONT></P>
