<P>Magical energies pumped through Ktzorak's veins like a pagan
lotus, making his eyes glow like ten candles. Lights played on the
underside of his skin like little fire flies in his blood. The
mutilated bodies of his troll opponents were scattered everywhere,
and a vast majority had been eaten in a triumphant desecration of the
soul. He was a cannibal now, and was marked as so by inflicting a
scar upon his chest. Such a mark was a mark of bravery and one of
exclusion at the same time, for he would be hated by others of his
own tribe for eating the flesh of another troll.</P>

<P>The enchantment Eliza had called was wearing off but Ktzorak still
had a bit of froth from the blood lust dripping from his nose. Corwin
the Paladin kneeled and prayed as the troll marched back up the hill
to aid them in moving the stone. Corwin muttered something about
holding hands with Innoruk himself and cursed, stood and turned to
harness his horse to the reconstructed cart.</P>

<P>Aralanth began the summoning that would being the being of earth
to pull the large black stone up the hill. All present could tell
that the words of power were draining life from him, and it almost
appeared that the elf gained years as the spell was cast. All around
them the ground started to ripple like water, and a great shaking
took place as a large globe of liquid earth began to hover in the
air. One could hear the powerful chanting of the natives of the plane
of earth through the dimensional rift, and even the Paladin felt a
divine presence other than his own god, and shed a tear for the
beautiful sound of the earthen angels sending forth the chosen to be
summoned. Standing before them hovered a giant made of all sorts of
stones and gems, with diamonds for blood and marble facial features.
It had no sex yet it seemed to be both at the same time, the ultimate
union of power and grace witnessed in a living elemental. Aralanth
collapsed in a pool of sweat, panting yet unable to stop
concentrating on the spell.</P>

<P>The elemental took up the harness and began to pull the cart and
stone up the hill, along side the troll and horse. They made good
time, breaking the crest of the hill just as the sun began to set.
Every now and then the ground would give a little tremble, and now
they could see why. </P>

<P>A thousand yards before them lay the circle of stones in the
fable, which was now apparent to be a crater from a meteor millennia
past. The outer ring was eroded to be a crown of spires and in the
center was a smaller dome, which was surrounded by cracks. In these
cracks could be seen molten earth, a volcano surfacing quickly.</P>

<P>"And now the prophecy is understood. A volcano shall rain fire and
death upon the surrounding lands." Eliza declared. "I suppose this
black stone is going to stop the destruction?" she mused skeptically.
</P>

<P>They made a decent into the steamy pit, making a quick path to the
center where the stone would placed. As they continued to pull they
could tell the stone was staring to change, as if ancient magics were
awakened by the proximity to the circle of stones. The smell of the
smokes was down right toxic and the horse broke loose and ran, and
the paladin gave chase. They continued to the center, and a violent
surge of fire and earthquakes forced them to stop within ten feet of
the perch the stone would sit on.</P>

<P>Huge pillars of flame rose from the cracks and a huge fountain of
steam broke from the center dome, right where the stone would be
placed. Rock and magma was sent into the air with ash. Eliza gave a
scream as the ground started to sink into the pit of magma, and the
stone tipped slightly as if it might fall. </P>

<P>In the center of the dome rose from the steam and fire a mighty
demon of hades, born of pure flame and hate for the mortal plane. Its
horns were black like a sliver of the night, and his eyes were deep
and hollow like the dead. His veins were full of boiling black blood
pulsing beneath his thin stretched red skin. His maw was full of fire
and teeth like swords, and from it came a deafening roar much louder
than anyone could imagine. With his roar the volcano started to
erupt.</P>

<P>Aralanth gave the order to the elemental to attack, and the demon
cast down onto him a huge stone of smoking lime, crushing the elf
instantly. The troll gave a battle cry and charged across the
breaking rock and stones, dodging crevice and magma. Behind him rode
the paladin on his horse, charging with the determination of a man
guided by god. Eliza held aloft her mysterious amulet and cried out.
</P>

<P>"If ever you came from the forge of a true enchanter let your
power shine forth and your purpose be fulfilled!" She cried, and
tossed the amulet to Ktzorak as he passed. It began to glow, and the
runes reflected a blue hue. The demon laughed at his two new
opponents. Below him the stone was still changing, the black falling
away like dirt from glass, slowly revealing a crystal.</P>

<P>The paladin raced by Ktzorak in his brave suicide attack, bearing
his lance to attack. The demons laugher hit a pitch and a glowing
whip of fire struck the paladin, sprung forth from the demon's
fingers. The horse was struck dead and the lance turned to cinders,
but the paladin stood up again and drew steel, charging again. The
demon chuckled.</P>

<P>As the paladin's skin started to catch fire from the unearthly
heat his sword and armor suddenly shined forth a light and white
fire, and a light came from the heavens as Corwin drove the sword
into the overconfident demon, striking deep into its heart of hate
and fire. A mighty explosion took the demon and paladin to dust, and
a huge pillar of magma rose were the both stood, nearly engulfing the
stone as well. </P>

<P>Ktzorak seemed guided, as if someone was telling him where to step
and what to do. He rushed at the stone, now a glowing crystal with
bright white runes. Eliza cast the last words of power to give him
the strength to push the stone before being consumed by flame
herself. Pulsing with magic energies Ktzorak pushed the stone into
the magma, and then turned to escape. The energies of the amulet that
had allowed the Gnoll to burn his brethren to ashes protected him
from the same fire, and the troll escaped the dome. He turned to see
the light from the heavens get stronger, and finally it was more
spectacular than the fires own light, and the fires died out, leaving
a smoking black pit with a dazzling white glowing crystal in the
center. Its light was as bright as the moon or brighter, and Ktzorak
descended into the pit again. </P>

<P>Ktzorak stood before the glowing stone and looked upon the runes
again. In the light he noticed three new sets of runes at the bottom
in the troll script. He grunted in curiosity, and slowly read them
like a child reading a new sign. He smiled, realizing they were the
unspoken epitaph for Aralanth, Corwin and Eliza. He looked down and
shook his head. Were all those runes people who had died moving this
stone? Were there runes there for those he killed? Ktzorak realized
there was a great deal about magic he didn't understand, and he made
a oath to learn more from his shaman about Innoruk's teachings. Thus
began the new life of Ktzorak Fellhorv the Cannibal, Shadow Knight.

</P>

<P>He would return to his village a hero, and defeat the warlord to
become the new chieftain later in life. His wars against the other
troll tribes would earn themselves a place in even human literature,
however those are another story. </P>

<P>"See ya in da game, oomies"</P>
