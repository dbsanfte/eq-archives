had really made him shriek in his head like a gibbering baboon was the look of
both triumph and pity she had sent. Triumph because she would never have to deal
with him again and had beaten him at his own game. The look of pity was even more
infuriating though, for he had nothing to be pitied for. He knew he was a
strong, smart thief and she was nothing, a body to be used and tossed aside so
why should her look matter? Still that look had burned through him like a fire

push it that way but favors could only do so much.<span style="mso-spacerun:

a sketch of the mans face by an artist sometimes employed by the Guard for that
purpose. He also retrieved a small pinky ring from the corpse, nothing
spectacular but valuable enough to show that either the killer wasn't a thief
or that he had no time after the killing or that such a ring wasn't worth his time.<span

assumed the second or third or possibly both assumptions were true. This
