<p>Day Six: Steamfont Surprises.
<br>I fear I have neglected you Diary, but&nbsp; it is simply because I
have been busy clearing the ScrapYard of the vermin that infest it. Three
days of work, fighting innumerable Clockworks, Skeletons, and Rock Spiders,
culminating in a battle with the Infamous Red V himself. I still am not
sure what Red V was but all the indications pointed to a Rogue Clockwork
of advanced design that had taken it into his head to organize the Obsolete
Clockworks in a war against the Gnomish people. He waited under the City,
hiding, biding his time and growing stronger, but I heard rumors of him
and eventually, with the aid of a young Wizard, Macwa, we defeated the
machine not once but twice for apparently he had somehow cloned himself.
We knew that if he could clone himself once he could do it again and the
answer lies in his BlackBox, which each of us now holds a copy of. Can
we but fill this BlackBox, his data storage device, with the appropriate
items the Warriors guild has promised us recognition for our Quest. We
seek the remaining pieces even now.
<p>At some point in these battles, I achieved <b><a href="level4.jpg">Level
4</a></b>, that point at which I am skilled enough in the Enchanters Art,
that I might learn more spells.&nbsp; It was a happy moment for me and
I rushed to the bank to gather my meager savings to buy the spells I needed.
It was at the bank, I met <b><a href="banktals.jpg">Tryllian and Kilerian</a></b>.
I know not their classes but I do know that Tryllian was somewhat drunk
and slurred his speech. Both these adventurers complained of the cramped
quarters in our fine city to which I of course responded that our city
had been built for the correct height and not people with overactive pituitary
glands. Although I am sure they are hale and hearty adventurers they both
goggled at that with a blank look on their faces. I fear the education
some of the other races provide their young is lacking. All in all though,
they held up and responded well to the digs and comments of myself and
the other Gnomes and I would not mind adventuring with them at some later
date, even if they are Talls.
<p>Prices for the second rank of Spells Quadruple that of the first, but
that is not anywhere near the cost of the jump to the third rank. At third
rank, level 8,&nbsp; a single spell costs 4 Platinum plus. In all my time
here I have only saved 1 Platinum and I look forward to level 8 with trepidation.
I nearly bankrupted myself on the purchase but got all the Second rank
spells. Invisibility and Mesmerize are my favorites so far. Invisibility
is obvious and I used it much to explore, but mesmerize is a spell useful
to help someone engaged&nbsp; beyond their means in battle. With it I can
stun the creatures attacking a fellow adventurer and if the creature is
not itself being attacked when the stun wears off it will wander away harmlessly
in a daze. This spell served me well several times when I came upon
<br>overmatched adventurers.
<p>After the purchase I was basically broke and had heard many good things
about <b><a href="fishn.jpg">Fishing.</a></b> I purchased a Pole and bait
as soon as I could afford to and tried my hand at it. My luck was great
at first and I made out well. Here I am fishing and while I do so I try
out my new <b><a href="nowucme.jpg">Invisibility Spell. </a></b>unfortunately
my Pole broke due to my lack of skill at fishing and I could not afford
another so I decided to explore with my newfound powers to remain unseen.
<p>I first decided to see if I could finally get in to see King Akanon
with my newfound powers. It worked but I learned some things perhaps I
should have avoided learning. I discovered the <b><a href="drkside.jpg">darker
side</a></b> to our kingdom, and when I finally entered the <b><a href="kingak.jpg">throne
room of the King</a></b> I did not remove my invisibility, nor talk to
him for fear of what the result might be. I watched him practice his magery,
give a few orders I did not understand and then quietly left.&nbsp; My
sense of the King has now changed. Where before I would have said he was
a loving, kind King who would harm no one, today I felt as I silently watched
that he has a will like Damascus Steel and would be a very dangerous opponent
should he feel you were a threat to either himself or his Kingdom.&nbsp;
Perhaps it is simply the nature of a King to be that way. It is certainly
a duty and responsibility I am glad I will never face.
<p>I left the City invisible, and headed to the fork in the road, where
I had always gone left before.
<br>Today I took the more dangerous path and soon was in areas I had never
seen before. I camped at the Windmills, the lowest level adventurer there
and hid inside to sleep. At some point in the early dawn there was a commotion,
and a battle raged outside. A Gnomish warrior, ran inside and collapsed,
bleeding to death and I had not the skill or powers to heal him.&nbsp;
I ran outside and used what little power I had to aid the fight against
a seeming hoard of Skeletons but realized I was in far over my head, and
with a quick spell I turned invisible and ran. In the darkness I lost the
path and when dawn came I was lost in the Steamfont Mountains. I stayed
invisible all the time as I journeyed, and came upon many wondrous and
terrifying sights. I saw creatures that were hideous and powerful, like
the <b><a href="harpy.jpg">Harpy</a></b>, but that paled in comparison
to the young <b><a href="ebondrak.jpg">Ebon Drake</a></b> that passed over
my head like the edge of an executioners axe. At one point I came upon
the ruins of an ancient civilization, which strangely enough bore signs
of Gnomish origins. As I looked at the <b><a href="lostcivl.jpg">ancient
ruins</a></b>, and the foul beasts below them, I thought of Red V and wondered
if sometime in the distant past a similar Clockwork rebellion had perhaps
been more successful against an even more advanced Gnomish civilization.
I shivered at the thought of what might lay ahead&nbsp; for the Gnomish
people.
<p>After much wandering and with my food supplies dwindling I saw in the
distance a most blessed sight, the tops of the Windmills that power much
of the steam driven Mechnology we Gnomes harness for our city. Although
a dangerous place as I had learned the night before, it was also a known
place and I could get home from there. I arrived and found a few small
traces of the Battle the night before, a few skeleton bones, a Bloody gash
in the wooden wall of a windmill with what looked like cloth but wasn't
imbedded in the crease. As the screech of some beast filled the air to
the north I turned and ran down the path towards home.
<p>After a restless nights sleep I again went out ot battle today, this
time to more familiar grounds again.
<br>Soon I know I will be able to handle myself at the Windmills or even
perhaps beyond. As I think about it, judicious use of my Invisibility Spell
may in fact, allow me to travel to other races cities without harm. As
I battle the now familiar Kobalds, I think of that day and know that it
will be sooner rather then later.
