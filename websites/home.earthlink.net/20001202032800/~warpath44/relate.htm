<P>In the diplomatic affairs of Norrath, the Fraterni Lux shall take
an active part in aiding the cause of justice. We side ourselves with
those that share our beliefs and follow the path of light. However,
we do not aggressively seek alliances or treaties for we do not wish
to become entangled in any political intrigues. Only those who are
deemed worthy by our order and meet the requirements of honor set
forth by our guild shall be granted alliances and friendship. We
honor our agreements and fulfill them with unbridled dedication so
long as it serves the good of Norrath and its inhabitants. Similarly,
those who wish only destruction and malice shall never have a place
at our table, and those who wage war against us in the name of evil
will perish. For we shall fight with tremendous force and deadly fury
against all those who would call us enemies. Any treaties, alliances,
or declarations of war shall be voted upon and approved by the entire
group. However, certain requirements must be met for us to accept you
as allies, for we aid only those who espouse our beliefs in virtue
and deal only with those who side with the forces of light.</P>

<P>-Your guild must be devoid of racial or class hatred. Such
bigotry's are the mark of ignorance and are not tolerated in our
midst</P>

<P>-Your guild must share our commitment to honor and believe in the
principles of virtue. Such things are not measured by words alone,
but by actions.</P>

<P>-Your guild should be willing to render aid to us in our times of
need, as we shall do the same for thee</P>

<P>-Your guild must not have any binding ties with our enemies or
friendships with those of ill repute.</P>

<P>If your guild meets our requirements and exemplifies the values of
honor that we cherish, then fill out the following form and may we
become friends and allies in the name of Justice!</P>
