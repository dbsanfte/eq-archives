<p>Day Thirteen: Day of the Dead
<br>Dying is never a pleasant experience. I have faith in <font color="#3333FF">Brell
Serilis, The Duke of Below, and maybe because of it, or perhaps because
it amuses him to watch us, he continues to resurrect us when we make bad
choices or have accidents. Still it is never without cost both to the body
and the mind.</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">When I reached level 5 I discovered that when
I awoke after a resurrection it was naked, and that I was somewhat dazed.
I discovered that my worldly possessions stayed with my body, and that
I frequently forgot some of the things I had learned as I adventured. In
addition from the purely physical point of view dying is much like a bad,
bad hangover. The body aches, the stomach churns as though you had swallowed
some vile brew, and you feel weak as a snuffling pup.</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">I had taken the painful lessons of dying to heart
and it had been a rare occasion for me, up until what I now think of as
"The Day of the Dead", but I suppose the story actually starts the night
before. I had just achieved level 7, and was enjoying life, I was master
of the Kobald Valley, nothing in it could challenge me. Perhaps in vengeance
for their ill treatment of me in my first adventure outside Ak'Anon I had
made their own village my stomping grounds, challenging any who came to
reclaim it for their race. Here you see me weakening a <b><a href="takethat.jpg">Kobald
Shaman</a></b>, before I choke the life out of it with my spells. As I
turned from the battle I noticed a level 4 Warrior and Magician standing
behind me with somewhat despairing expressions on their faces. I could
see the hunger in their eyes to tackle the Kobalds, yet how could they
compete with me? I realized then that my time in the Kobald Valley was
over, I would cede it to the younger adventurers and try my hand at the
Windmills. I noticed as I left that some of equivalent level to myself
chose to stay and battle for level 8 on the margins of a safe and easy
foe. At the time I cursed them for hoarding the experience the younger
adventurers sought but perhaps I was the fool.</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">The next day, before the sun even rose, I&nbsp;
set out to hunt. As is my custom I first stopped at the <b><a href="abbey.jpg">Abbey
of Deep Musings</a></b>, to pay my respects. While there, Iony Gredlong,&nbsp;
the Lead Cleric and a friend of mine since my fight with my father, warned
me that the omens were not good for today and perhaps I should simply spend
the day fishing. I considered for a moment but because I was still unsure
of my decision to leave the Kobald Valley, decided I needed to go hunting
today or else I might backslide and take the easy path.</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">I left just before dawn and as I headed to the
Windmills I heard a strange yelling in the distance. It seemed to be coming
closer quickly and suddenly over the rise came Watchman Halv and Watchman
Mylz, two of our strongest guardians. It was what came between them that
struck me with fear and froze my blood. Before I could focus my mind to
capture the picture the Minotaur Hero had passed me by, Killing me without
even slowing down, and all the while with the Watchmen attacking him. I
awoke in the customary place, and ran to retrieve my corpse, <b><a href="minhero.jpg">remembering
the battle</a></b> as I did so.&nbsp; I gathered my things and in the growing
light headed towards the Windmills.</font>
<p>I arrived at the <b><a href="windmils.jpg">Windmills</a> </b>to the
sound of a fierce screeching, and cries of terror and valor. A battle between
a pair&nbsp; of comrades and a young Ebon Drake, the Drake beating at the
air with its powerful wings, sucking in air for a breath full of the stench
of brimstone and smoke. I arrived in time to see one of the pair fall under
the <b><a href="drakf1.jpg">powerful flame</a></b> from the drake but too
my surprise the other battled on, with even more vigor, perhaps to avenge
his fallen friend. With one last cast the Wizard called down a hail of&nbsp;
ice and freezing wind and the Drake at last fell silent. Unfortunately
for myself, I had been so intent on watching and memorizing the battle
that I had failed to notice the hungry Puma bearing down upon me until
it was too late. Already muggy from my previous Death my first clue
<br>of its presence was the solid thud of its mass knocking me to the ground
and its teeth sinking into my throat.
<p>I awoke again, dead twice before mid-morning. Now a smarter Gnome or
perhaps one less stubborn would have recalled the words of the Cleric and
headed for a day of peaceful but unlethal fishing. Unfortunately I am not
that Gnome and vowed on my Honor to regain all that I had lost before I
returned to Ak'Anon.&nbsp; A word to the wise; A Vow made in haste can
be a troubling thing indeed especially if Vows matter to you, as they generally
do to me. I headed back to the Windmills and there met a young Wizard named
Azeroth. He suggested that perhaps the hunting would be better in the Faydark,
the great Forest in which the Wood Elves make their home. I agreed and
we headed out, towards the pass that leads through the Steamfont mountains
into the lesser Faydark.
<p>Naturally enough, we got <b><a href="lostfayd.jpg">lost</a></b>.
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to declare another small error
on my part. I was clearly not thinking very well, because I had decided
to take this journey into an unknown part of the world, in late afternoon,
wearing my brand new and complete set of cloth armor which had set me back
over 3 full Platinum pieces. Which, to let you know, was slightly over
half of every thing I have accumulated in my time in the Steamfont. Lost
in the Faydark, wearing half my net worth, and with strange and creepy
sounds all around. Now the Faydark is never the brightest of places on
Norrath but when night falls it becomes blacker then Innoruuks heart.
<p>In the singing darkness we stumbled upon a great stone <b><a href="orcbrder.jpg">Gateway</a></b>
and thinking (hoping actually) that it marked the way to the territory
of the Elves (although deep in our hearts we knew that the rough symbols
were not likely the mark of the Elvish script) we hurried onwards. Soon
enough our hopes were dashed and our fears realized as we were attacked
by two Orc centurions. Perhaps they simply hadn't heard that we Gnomes
pride ourselves on our neutrality in the politics of the varying races,
in any case these thuggish brutes soon had killed us both.
<p>Have you ever felt desperation creeping up on you? I had lost far too
much to Death today and now I had lost half my savings. I had no idea where
my body was and in the dark I could have stumbled within a few score yards
of my cooling corpse and never seen it until it had rotted away, taking
my armor with it. I used the most basic of mental abilities, that taught
to all craftsman, fighters and mages alike and searched the auras for the
sign I sought. There! Quickly summoning my mental energies I called for
help... and was answered by Menie the Bard, a high elf no less. Let no
one disparage the Bardic class for when you need them most they can be
a lifesaver. Menie sang a quick and lilting melody and was off like a shot,
dancing lights streaking behind her. We followed as best we could on our
short legs and eventually made our way back to our corpses. We quickly
looted our corpses and followed Menie towards the city of the High Elves,
<b><a href="hielfc2.jpg">Felwithe.</a></b>
<p>After a quick stop for a late supper (we were starving) Menie pointed
us to the path towards the Wood Elf City of&nbsp; <b><a href="kel1.jpg">Kelethin</a></b>.&nbsp;
Here Azeroth took his leave of me and I went to hunt. I had made a vow
and would not break it, though as I set out to regain my lost experience
and knowledge the frightful thought came to me that Brell might take it
in mind to punish me with my own oath, and keep me from home forever. This
dire thought was banished from my head as I laid into the Orcs with a vigor
that surprised even me. My weakness spells turned their bones to jelly
and their muscles to water, and my Sphere of Suffocation choked the life
from them one by one. There were a few close encounters but I was able
to run from them&nbsp; and escape. It took over 6 straight hours of battle,
as I watched other adventurers come and go, to regain all that I had lost
but I managed it, though my very bones were tired at the end.
<p>I stepped up on the Elevator already asleep on my feet, but not so asleep
that my fear of heights didn't make itself felt. I stayed very still as
the elevator rose into the air. I heard a soft chuckle at my ear and turned
and a most strange thing occurred. I fell THRU the floor of the elevator.
As I lay there dying on the ground and watching the perfectly solid floor
of the elevator rise above me I heard a soft voice in my ear whisper,&nbsp;
"Next time I send you some advice young fool take it, do you think I have
my high cleric give personal warnings to just everyone?"&nbsp;&nbsp; I
awoke back in front of Ak'Anon, tired and ashamed. I gathered my will and
slowly trudged back to Kelethin, looted my corpse and stepped onto the
elevator again, first saying a prayer to Brell Serilis and asking his forgiveness
for ignoring his words. The elevator rose and deposited me safely in <b><a href="kel2.jpg">Kelethin</a></b>.
I had not the strength to find an inn, instead I collapsed near a merchants
stall in sight of the elevator.&nbsp; I dreamed of falling.
