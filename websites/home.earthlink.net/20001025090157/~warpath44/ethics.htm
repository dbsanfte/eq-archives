<P>Below are the moral principles by which we live by. We do not wish
slavish adherence to any of our doctrines, but any member of the
Fraterni Lux is expected to uphold the guild ethics to the best of
their abilities in all that they do. For through them, we grow only
stronger in might and spirit.</P>

<P>-A life of virtue is the goal of any Fraterni Lux. This entails
the wholehearted belief in compassion, justice, sacrifice,
generosity, kindness, and honor.</P>

<P>-Honor is the highest expression of light and virtue, therefore
our thoughts and actions must be tempered by it. Let Honor not fail
is our motto and that is the creed by which we live by.</P>

<P>-Racial prejudice or class discrimination in our ranks or towards
the world at large is the sign of ignorance and is not acceptable.
Judge by character and action, not by skill or trade.</P>

<P>-Wanton destruction, killing, and stealing are contrary to our
beliefs and therefore are not permissible.</P>

<P>-PK'ing is allowed as long as it is in self-defense or for a just
cause. Remember, use your own discretion when deciding whether a
situation warrants action by force. Try thy best to stay away from
fights, but if it is inevitable, then may ye prevail and justice be
served!</P>

<P>-All must work as best they can to perfect their chosen skills,
for we must always be on alert and ready for battle.</P>

<P>-All must be willing to work for the welfare of Fraterni Lux, and
provide economic or other resources when called upon to do so, for
only the diligent group shall prosper.</P>
