<P>The heat waves distorted the rolling Dead Hills to look like a
violent tide on the ocean shores. Then again the heat makes
everything a bit more violent these days, and Ktzorak Fellhorv was no
exception. Large, even for a troll, his black-spotted green hide and
filthy black hair stretched around his hulking frame and keen
muscles. It was only a few more days till he was back in his stomping
grounds, back where his allies were. A few more days in the
sweltering Dead Hills, a few more days...</P>

<P>Having eaten the last of the renegade humans he killed three days
ago, he was starting to wonder if he would find anything worth eating
in these hills. His eyes traced the hills searching for anything
alive, anything at all. Again he growled at the barren hills;
everything looks the same here. He might have been wandering in
circles if not for the sun to remind him of where he was headed. A
deep rumble in his stomach urged him forward to the next hill.</P>

<P>Fingers clenching longing for his axe that lay buried in the skull
of the hulking brute that had attacked him. The axe would not break
free of the fist-thick bone. Ktzorak was now bare-handed, even though
that did not stop him from snapping the limbs off the human vagabond
party he encountered. The memory of the fight came back to him in a
fever, and he fondled the large bag of loot he wrestled from them.
They fought like lost children, running in circles and hiding as each
tried in vain to strike a telling blow. If they had only learned
combat from a master like Ktzorak had, they might have learned to act
as a team. The troll chuckled to himself as he marched for the next
hill. </P>

<P>The rattling of a horse cart brought the troll to attention, and
he crouched low as the cart came into view a stones toss away. Four
horses pulled a large flat-bed cart that bore a large stone monolith
of some sort. It was black like a sliver of the new moon, and had
deep carvings in it. A bald man drove the cart, and two men in light
armor rode along side. Behind the cart rode a tan cloaked woman with
a fancy ash staff. Last over the hill was a Ogre with some sort of
strange collar around his neck. Ktzorak snorted uncontrollably in
laughter at the slaved Orge, and the horses panicked and over-tuned
the cart, spilling the large stone and the rider down the hill. The
bald man was crushed beneath the stone as it thundered down the slope
to a rest in a foot-deep swath of grass and dirt.</P>

<P>The Ogre brandished a wicked bone mace and followed the woman's
order to attack like a mindless animal. One of the horsemen leveled a
long spear to bear and charged as well. The other horseman stayed to
protect the woman, whom was preparing a spell of sorts. The horseman
drove the spear deep into the chest of the troll, but the troll
seemed to feel no pain as he swatted the man off his horse. The human
sailed through the air and landed near the Ogre. Pulling the spear
from the quickly healing wound in his chest, he tossed it like a
javelin into the leg of the Orge. </P>

<P>The woman called out many arcane words of power and suddenly
thorned vines sprung near his feet and tangled him. Ktzorak struggled
and fought at the tough green vines, tearing them out of the ground
only to have them grow back in duplicate. He gathered an arm-full and
prepared to use them as a crude weapon against the snarling Orge. The
Ogre leaped and swung the wicked mace with accuracy. </P>

<P>The first strike of the mace crushed the forearm of the trapped
troll. Ktzorak swung the torn vines and caught the second swing and
pulled the stupid Orge into the vines and bit deep into is neck. The
Ogre fought for life as the deadly troll fangs severed his life-blood
and brought darkness to his simple world. Ktzorak roared in triumph
and held the bone mace high. He ripped more vines out of the ground
in spite of the enchantress's powers.</P>

<P>"<I>How much longer can your spell hold out </I><B>oomie</B>" he
spoke to her in the trolls tongue. Even then frustration crossed her
brow as she concentrated to summon more vines to strangle the
bleeding troll. "<I>Your thorns snap like leaves on my rock hard
skin. Your vines stretch and tear around my steel arms. What say I
tear a few more out and tie each of your limbs to one of your horses
and see how loyal they are."</I></P>

<P>"What do you think it was saying Eliza?" the warrior asked. He had
drawn sword and shield and was preparing to charge the troll once the
vines had immobilized him.</P>

<P>"He said something about your horse and your mother" Eliza
replied. She had always had a sick sense of humor and her warriors
knew it.</P>

<P>"You have been working around monsters far too long wench, your
humor is dry" the warrior replied as he charged the tangled troll.
</P>

<P>Ktzorak Fellhorv waited to the exact moment to roar and lash out
of the vines, causing the horse to buck and run, leaving the warrior
to scramble for his sword on the ground. Ktzorak whipped him with the
vines until he stood. Beads of sweat ran down Eliza's head and chest
as the spell began to weaken. A dull pain formed in her abdomen as
the sweat turned to blood and she was forced to release the troll.
</P>

<P>The warrior struck quick blows as he was taught by the grand
knights of Qeynos, and adeptly severed the half healed forearm.
Ktzorak howled in a rage and swung the mace with his good arm again
and again, beating dents into the iron shield before him. The warrior
pushed the troll back with several expert swings and steps, shouting
aloud with pride at his skill. His shouts squeaked to squeals as the
severed arm grasped him from the ground, moving with an unholy thirst
for blood. It grasped him about the knee just long enough for the
mighty jaws of the troll to close around his torso.</P>

<P>Eliza scurried on the ground, too weak to run, and hid underneath
the over-turned cart. She could see her warrior flailing in the
trolls mouth, blood spraying everywhere. Quickly there was no sign of
the brave man, only blood dripping from his mouth. Already the
severed arm was growing back into place. The troll gathered the vines
laying about to fulfill his threat. His eyes gleamed with sick
pleasure as he strolled up the hill to the cart. Ktzorak took his
time, waiting for his wounds to heal. It would not be very long.</P>

<P>"<I>So ugly woman how did you get to be named after a lizard? Me
thinks that you resemble moss more than a gator, perhaps a snake with
your forked tongue." </I>Ktzorak looked for the best way to turn the
cart over so as to trap or injure his prey.</P>

<P>"I am named after a famous woman named Elizabeth, pond scum." She
had thought of a way to get his attention on something else for a
moment. Quickly a plan formed in her head. "You may want to ask me
what that stone is for before you eat me, it may end your puny little
swamp village's existence. Already your allies are probably dead or
dying, and you will die too if the stone is not taken to the
mountains this moon."</P>

<P>"<I>I like riddles wench, tell me more. Flies flies they eat at
your eyes, one man covets while another lies. Tell me sweet meat the
answer to this. What has four legs in the morning and two by
afternoon but only 3 come night?"</I></P>

<P>She searched her bags for the sour grapes and frog's tongue needed
for the spell to charm the troll like she had the Orge. "Quiet simple
pond scum. You speak of a man, whom crawls at birth on all fours,
walks upright on two legs in the mid of his life and walks with a
staff when he is near death from age, thus the third leg." She tried
to think of a riddle in return to keep him busy. One came to mind,
"What has 4 wings but cannot fly?" She asked as she gathered the
strength to cast the spell.</P>

<P>"<I>a dead dragonfly?"</I> the troll shrugged as he made ready to
flip the cart. </P>

<P>"Nay. Two birds tied together, pond scum." She swallowed the sour
grape and the frog's tongue and spoke the words of power. "You will
help me move the stone to the mountains" she commanded. </P>

<P>Eliza was fluent in the languages of many monsters and beings, but
still spoke mostly in the common tongue so that the unintelligent
beasts would not understand her as well. She knew while trolls had a
great resistance to physical magic they were rather vulnerable to
magic of the mind. You see, trolls are cunning and have wit, but they
also lack the mortal drives that resist attacks on the mind.</P>

<P>Ktzorak became subservient, but the voice of the shadow lord would
not remain quiet in his head for long. Soon he would break free, and
then he would have vengeance. </P>
