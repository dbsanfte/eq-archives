<p>The Langseax is actually a pretty easy quest if you're the right level and <br>
have a druid to help you (you'll see why in a minute).<br>
<br>
First, go to Renth McLanis in McDaniel's Smokes and Spirits in Halas.&nbsp; Ask him about
a [dangerous matter].&nbsp; He will say something about a murder and&nbsp; asked if you
will [hunt the murderer].&nbsp; (If he says something about not&nbsp; trusting you with
the information, you need to get your faction up.&nbsp; I'm a barbarian warrior and I
didn't have high enough faction with the Wolves of the North at first to do the
quest...you just need to turn in two Wrath Orc wirstbands to the lady in Mac's Kilts a few
times.) You need to get a piece of evidence from Dok in Dok's cigars, so you ask him
&quot;Where is the sweaty shirt?&quot;.&nbsp; He says he sold it to Tundra Jack to make
Iceberg a new collar.&nbsp; Skip going to ask Tundra Jack about it and head straight for
the McMannus fishing villiage in West Karana (just turn right after entering West K from
&nbsp; Qeynos Hills).&nbsp; You'll need to get the lion meat shipment from Misla McMannus
by saying, &quot;I will deliver the lion meat to Halas.&quot;&nbsp; She will give you a
package of lion meat, which you must take to Teria O'Danos in Halas (she's who sells food
right at the dock).&nbsp; Give it to her, she'll give you a few gold and a Lion Delight.
&nbsp; Now go visit Tundra Jack (usually hangs out at Megan's Tower in the tundra...if
he's not there, wait, he'll show up).&nbsp; Give the Lion Delight to ICEBERG (not Jack),
and you'll get the sweaty shirt.&nbsp; Run back to the McMannus fishing village, and make
sure you have a druid to SoW you and maybe tag along for this part.&nbsp; Give the sweaty
shirt to the dog&nbsp; Frostbite...he'll sniff the shirt and bark.&nbsp; It won't seem
like he does anything after that, but just wait, he'll take off running.&nbsp; Follow him.
&nbsp; He'll lead you out near the Ogre ruins right to the murderer.&nbsp; The murderer
will be either Paglan or Basil. Paglan is level 21, Basil is level 20.&nbsp; Kill whoever
the dog leads you to, and hope he drops a Barbarian head (I killed Basil twice...he
dropped the head the second time but not the first).&nbsp; Take the head back to Renth in
Halas and give it to him...and you have a nice new weapon, the Langseax. (6 dmg 23 dly
1hs, WAR / ALL)<br>
<br>
The Langseax works very nicely when dual wielded with either another Langseax (it's not
LORE...yet) or a Silvery War Axe.&nbsp; Good luck!<br>
