<p>Day Sixteen-Eighteen: Travellin Gnome: Butcherblock Mtns
<p>I slept the better part of two days. I was exhausted, plain and simple.
When I awoke I was ravenous and went to get something to eat, even if it
was overpriced Elvish food.
<p>I like Elves for the most part. Elves have a sort of Sing-songish quality
to their voices and pleasing features as well. Even though I am getting
a crick in my neck from looking up at them (else I'd be staring at their
unmentionables all the time and that is rude to say the least)&nbsp; and
their merchants think small means stupid as far as pricing goes, I still
like them. What I don't like is the place they live, no not the city itself,
it is a fine blend of craftsmanship and love of the forest. No, it's the
Faydark I can't stand.
<p>I'll tell you a secret diary, I get claustrophobic here. It seems silly
that a Gnome, born and bred to live in tiny tunnels under hundreds of tons
of rock would feel confined here in the open air but it's true. It's the
canopy I think. The air here is always misty and shadowy, and there is
always the rustle of the leaves. I far prefer the hiss of the steamvents
of Ak'Anon or even the incessant tick tock of the clockworks there to the
continual silent whisper of the wind shifting through the leaves here.
That's not all; there is always a fine rain of dead leaves dropping down,
cluttering the floors and sticking in your hair, getting you covered with
a sticky sap when they land. The worst though, is the smell. Especially
after a rain, the smell is a sort of damp, fetid decaying odor that makes
me think of freshly dug graves. Perhaps that and my history&nbsp; as a
child cause the feelings because no one else seems to notice it, or at
least mention it.
<p>In any case, I set off to adventure as usual, hunting from around Kelethin.
I haven't fallen through any more elevators, Brell Serelis be praised.
I am a bit more confident these days in my ability to sense my heading
and combined with my invisibility spell I can do some serious exploring.
Here I found a <b><a href="pixytowr.jpg">tower full of Pixies</a></b> and
fairy folk. They didn't seem exactly friendly though and I was attacked
by one of their maidens as I watched them. I tried to talk to her but alas
she wouldn't retreat so I had to kill her. As more pixies began to circle
me I ran for it.
<p>After a few more hours hunting I was well on my way to level 8, when
I found the <b><a href="obelisk.jpg">Obelisk</a></b>. It was in a part
of the Faydark I had never been to before and that is a good thing. As
I memorized the scene a Mummy, came up behind me and struck. I was diseased!
I staggered back attempting to run but it was too late. The force of the
decaying corpse's strikes and the draining of the disease struck me down.
I awoke back in front of Ak'Anon.&nbsp; I was torn, my past experiences
hunting in Steamfont at near my level had been relatively fruitless but
I really didn't like the Faydark. It was as I sat there memorizing my spells
again that I heard the rough voices of two Dwarves, speaking nearby of
a journey to their home of Kaladim, in the Butcherblock mountains. I had
heard of others speak of the Butcherblock mountains as a good area to hunt
and indeed part of the reason for my explorations of the Faydark was to
find the pass through the mountains to the Butcherblocks.
<p>I quickly rose to feet and perhaps rudely barged into their conversation
asking for directions. The first dwarf, a Warrior gave me a stony stare
as if judging my worth to know the location of their homeland but apparently
I measured up because he gave me directions. In return I hazed and strengthened
them and headed into town for supplies. While in town I stopped at the
Library Mechnamagica and discovered that the merchants there had two new
spells in which I could scribe.
<br>This surprised me somewhat since I had thought I had almost all the
spells that existed for my level and none had been unknown to me. I purchased
the two new spells, which were illusion spells for the <b><a href="changes.jpg">Half-Elf
and Human</a></b>, and here you see me trying them out near the Forge of
Defiance.
<p>The reason I hadn't found the pass to the Butcherblock mountains was
because it was in an area I had studiously been avoiding, the same direction
as the Orc camps that had brought myself and Azeroth down when first we
came to the Faydark. Now with clear directions I set off to the Butcherblock
mountains. It was near the entrance to the Greater Faydark that I met my
first Dark Elf. He was insane!
<p>Not the usual insanity that the cruelty of Innoruuk leaves&nbsp; in
all but a few Dark ones, no this was different. His hair, fine and pale
white was matted to his head, he stank of fear and his clothes and person
were filthy. He had a little crowd of people watching him or various races,
and as they watched he Preached of Doomsday. He told a tale of a Great
Force of Creation, Verant by name, that had made this world and all that
was in it, including the other Gods, as a sort of testing ground to fix
the flaws, and right the wrongs. He said that the Great One was satisfied
with the changes and would soon wipe the slate clean and begin anew.&nbsp;
He was babbling and drooling and sweating as he said these things and his
fear rose like a cloud of gnats around him. Not being one to delight in
the misfortunes of others, even so cruel a race as the Tier'Dal I hurried
on wondering where he got those strange Ideas. I prayed to Brell Serelis,
for him but strangely did not feel the usual comfort I normally get when
praying to the Duke of Below. Instead I felt empty.
<p>I emerged into the light of the Butcherblock Mountains and felt at home.
The only thing missing was the hiss of the steam vents. I wondered awhile
invisible, ignoring the road, and came upon a <b><a href="stndwarf.jpg">Sentry</a></b>
guarding a marker. It seemed a clear statement indeed, this was the home
of the Dwarves and let no creature forget that. As I wandered I heard the
sounds of battle over the next hill. I, still hidden came upon a <b><a href="nochance.jpg">scene
of battle</a></b> but in this case one where I was hardly needed. The lone
Goblin had no chance against the forces around him. Wonder of wonders!
Not only did this group hold Menie the Bard, who had guided me to my corpse
in a previous misadventure, butt he very first <b><a href="ogre1.jpg">Ogre</a></b>
I have ever seen. Naturally enough I reappeared and said Hello ;-)
<p>I watched for a while as Menie and her stalwart fellows defeated Goblin
after Goblin including the fierce and powerful Goblin Wizards, then asked
directions to Kaladim and was on my way. Upon arriving I was stunned. I
had always believed that Ak'Anon had a particularly proud entrance but
it was nothing compared to the huge stone Dwarf guarding the entrance to
<b><a href="kalad1.jpg">Kaladim</a></b>.
I entered the city and began to explore.
<p>Kaladim is an interesting and beautiful city, somewhat starker then
Ak'Anon but someplace a Gnome could call home should he desire. I did all
the usual tourist stuff, I saw the <b><a href="kalad2.jpg">Arena</a></b>,
and the <b><a href="mines1.jpg">Mines</a></b>. I had drank a bit to much
strong Dwarven Ale and fell off the rails into the water below. I sobered
up quickly though in the <b><a href="watergem.jpg">frigid waters</a></b>
of that mine. Wet and dripping I visited the <b><a href="shrooms.jpg">Shroom
farms</a></b> for a bite to eat and a warm fire to eat it by.&nbsp; After
a sumptuous meal I decided to check out the Palace of the <b><a href="dwrfking.jpg">Dwarven
King</a></b>. Invisible, I snuck into his throne room and watched him work.
He seemed a solid, character, gruff of voice but soft of heart. Still,
as nice as he seemed, we Gnomes are tricksters and love a good laugh and&nbsp;
when his guard was not looking I snuck into his balcony overlooking the
Arena, and sat upon his <b><a href="dwthrone.jpg">Throne</a></b>. The Guard
was somewhat upset about this but was amenable to keeping it quiet. I bet
he values his job to much to lose it for me, haha!
<p>It was at this point that I heard mention of the spell Tashan. I believe
I have mentioned Diary how our Enchanter spells are more easily resisted
then those cast by our brethren. I had long heard rumor of a spell by the
name of Tashan, which was a form of magical poison. It was an Enchanter
only spell of rank 2 and when successfully cast lowers a targets magic
resistance. In other words, dear diary, something no Enchanter should be
without. The existence of the spell was confirmed, to me by a Gnome by
the name of Buddan, the resistible Enchanter, who was level 10 at the time.
Only one small problem: It was found only in Freeport, across the sea.&nbsp;
I decided that the spell would be mine, and that I would set out at dawn
the next day.
