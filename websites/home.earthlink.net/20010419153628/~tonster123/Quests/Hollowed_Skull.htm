<p>Hollowed Skull </font></b><br>
Yiz Pon in West Karana will ask you to deliver a note to his brother in Freeport named
Hyrill Pon. Yiz Pon is running from the Dungeon of Splitpaw and some monster is after him.
After you talk to Yiz, a Splitpaw assassin will show himself. Kill the assassin and you
will loot a hollow skull container from him. Apparantly, Yiz Pon stole this skull from
within Splitpaw and tried to escape, but then had to give it to the assassin so that it
would stop hunting him. However, the assassin is still trying to kill him. Take a note
from Yiz Pon to his brother Hyrill Pon in West Freeport. Hyrill will tell you that his
brother was searching for some powerful skull which should give great power to a wizard.
To continue with the quest from Hyrill, you must find two Eyes made of rubies. One ruby is
found on Lyunga in Innothule Swamp. She is a level 32 spellcasting Troll. (Note that
killing her will more than likely give you bad faction within Grobb). The second ruby is
called a 'Ruby Pendant' and can be looted from a Gnoll Shaman named Kurrpok who spawns in
the Dungeon of Splitpaw. Once you have acquired both +1 Intelligence Ruby Eyes, put them
in the Hollowed Skull and press 'combine'. After they have all been combined, you will now
have a Jewelled skull.<br>

+5 Intelligence<br>
+20 Hit Points<br>
+20 Mana Points<br>
