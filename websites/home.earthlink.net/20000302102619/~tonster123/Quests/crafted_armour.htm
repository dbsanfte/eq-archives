<p></font><font size="3">I went looking for the Centaurs. I had a pretty good idea of
where they were at from meeting them before. For those who don&#146;t know, the LOC is
125, -2212 and is roughly near the upper eastside of the&nbsp; South Karana zone.</p>

<p>You are specifically looking for Ulan Meadowgreen and Shakrn Meadowgreen. These&#146;s
are the only named Centaurs at the Fort. Both of these Centaurs make certain pieces of the
armor. If they won&#146;t talk you try saying &#145;What about armor&#146;. This is a key
phrase that will trigger what they make. Each one makes 4 pieces. </p>

<p>Asking about the piece will trigger a speech about what they need in order to make the
item for you. Don&#146;t worry about them saying you need to prove yourself, getting the
item is the proof and the gems they ask for is the cost.</p>

<p>Below, I will list what is required for each brother:</p>

<p>Ulan Meadowgreen</p>

<p><u><b>Crafted Breastplate</b></u></p>

<p>(AC: 22, Wgt: 10, Lore Item, Class: Warrior, Race: HUM, BAR, ERU, ELF, HIE, DEF, HEF) <br>
<b>Key Phrase</b>: &#145;What about Breastplate&#146;<br>
<b>Requirement</b>: Werewolf Talon and 3 Rubies.<br>
<b>Location</b>: Mistmoore Castle<br>
<b>Mob</b>: Werewolf<br>
<b>Shonshu&#146;s Insider Tip</b>: You can find the werewolves in the basement of the
castle. Just keep killing them until it spawns a werewolf talon. You can tell it&#146;s
the one you need because all the items I&#146;ve collected so far have been Lore Item and
No Drop.</p>

<p><u><b>Crafted Greaves</b></u></p>

<p>(AC: 14, Wgt: Unknown, Class: Warrior, Race: HUM, BAR, ERU, ELF, HIE, DEF, HEF)<br>
<b>Key Phrase</b>: &#145;What about Greaves&#146;<br>
<b>Requirement</b>: Dark Circlet and 2 Star Rubies.<br>
<b>Location</b>: Najena<br>
<b>Mob</b>: Rathel? &#145;Ulan says a Necromancer who can be found in Najena&#146;<br>
<b>Shonshu&#146;s Insider Tip</b>:&nbsp; The Dark Circlet is found in the room to the
right of the bc room.....(the room with the lava pool that you can walk on and a ramp that
spawns two dark elf mages......the name of the necro is Tarzdon (something like that) and
he spawns in place of the second mage in the room....one spawns on the first landing of
ramp and the other spawns on the second landing, so make sure you kill the mages.<br>
</p>

<p><u><b>Crafted Pauldrons</b></u></p>

<p>(AC: Unknown, Wgt: Unknown, Class: Warrior, Race: HUM, BAR, ERU, ELF, HIE, DEF, HEF)<br>
<b>Key Phrase</b>: &#145;What about Pauldrons&#146;<br>
<b>Requirement</b>: The 3 pieces of the Rune of Dwarves and a Fire Emerald.<br>
<b>Location</b>: Runnyeye<br>
<b>Mob</b>: A Evil Eye<br>
<b>Shonshu&#146;s Insider Tip</b>: These can be found in the Evil Eye pit with the Dazed
Goblins. It&#146;s not a friendly place so bring a full party because you&#146;ll need it.
The evil eyes will load randomly all 3 pieces of the rune.</p>

<p><u><b>Crafted Bracers</b></u></p>

<p>(AC: Unknown, Wgt: Unknown, Class: Warrior, Race: HUM, BAR, ERU, ELF, HIE, DEF, HEF)<br>
<b>Key Phrase</b>: &#145;What about Bracer&#146;<br>
<b>Requirement</b>: Borxx&#146;s Retina and 1 Sapphire<br>
<b>Location</b>: Runnyeye<br>
<b>Mob</b>: Borxx<br>
<b>Shonshu&#146;s Insider Tip</b>: Borxx spawns in the Goblin King Room. Please refer to
Diagram A for the Random Mob spawn point. To make Borxx spawn, you must kill the random
spawn of Spawn A in the diagram. This could be from a Goblin to a Warlord to Borxx itself
and will immediately leave the room. The random mob spawns every 3 mins after the random
spawn is killed. It won&#146;t spawn again from that spawn point until it is killed. So
stay on top of it. I would also recommend a good group for this as Borxx is around 30-32.</p>

<p><strong>Shakrn Meadowgreen</strong></p>

<p><u><b>Crafted Helm</b></u></p>

<p>(AC: 14, Wgt: 6, Class: Warrior, Race: HUM, BAR, ERU, ELF, HIE, DEF, HEF)<br>
<b>Key Phrase</b>: &#145;What about Helm&#146;<br>
<b>Requirement</b>: Fire Totem and 2 Rubies<br>
<b>Location</b>: Solusek A<br>
<b>Mob</b>: Inferno Goblin Shaman<br>
<b>Shonshu&#146;s Insider Tip</b>: I found this mob in the Barroom in Solusek A. You
don&#146;t have to kill the one that spawns in the Barroom. The Barroom does provide a
easier control spot in the dungeon then anywhere else so far. Just keep killing the spawn
in the Barroom and keep killing the shaman to get the Fire Totem.</p>

<p><u><b>Crafted Gauntlets</b></u></p>

<p>(AC: 12, Wgt: 5, Class: Warrior, Race: HUM, BAR, ERU, ELF, HIE, DEF, HEF)<br>
<b>Key Phrase</b>: &#145;What about Gauntlets&#146;<br>
<b>Requirement</b>: Aviak Charm and 2 Star Rubies<br>
<b>Location</b>: South Karana<br>
<b>Mob</b>: Aviak Avocet<br>
<b>Shonshu&#146;s Insider Tip</b>: This is another full group if you&#146;re under 30. The
Avocets can be found<br>
anywhere in the Tree City and you just keep killing them till the load with an Aviak
Charm. Usually, I hear people offering an Aviak Charm on their Avocet the just killed.
This is one of the easiest items I&#146;ve gotten so far.</p>

<p><u><b>Crafted Vambraces</b></u></p>

<p>(AC: Unknown, Wgt: Unknown, Class: Warrior, Race: HUM, BAR, ERU, ELF, HIE, DEF, HEF)<br>
<b>Key Phrase</b>: &#145;What about Vambrace&#146;<br>
<b>Requirement</b>: Eye of a Griffon and 2 Fire Emeralds<br>
<b>Location</b>: North Karana<br>
<b>Mob</b>: A Griffon (Not a griffawn, griffette, or griffin but a griffon)<br>
<b>Shonshu&#146;s Insider Tip</b>: This mob wanders randomly through North Karana and
I&#146;m unsure of it&#146;s spawn point but I&#146;ve seen people hunting it just north
of the Wizard Portal next to the White Bridge. This is another tough fight so be sure of
you&#146;re a high level. I&#146;m uncertain as to the level of the griffon but I
understand that it&#146;s high (35-40).</p>

<p><u><b>Crafted Boots</b></u></p>

<p>(AC: Unknown, Wgt: Unknown, Class: Warrior, Race: HUM, BAR, ERU, ELF, HIE, DEF, HEF)<br>
<b>Key Phrase</b>: &#145;What about Boots&#146;<br>
<b>Requirement</b>: Frost Totem and 2 Sapphires<br>
<b>Location</b>: Permafrost<br>
<b>Mob</b>: Ice Goblin High Shaman/Priest?<br>
<b>Shonshu&#146;s Insider Tip</b>: This place is very dangerous. It&#146;s common
knowledge that it is so. I&#146;ve learned the location and will pass it you as it was
told to me: Upon entry to the throne room go through the door on the left. Procede slowly
through here as it&#146;s rigged with traps/pitfalls? You&#146;ll enter a room with a hole
in the wall. Go through hole and you&#146;ll descend into what is referred to as the town.
Proceed till you hit the central room with 7 mobs. One is a caster who will have the Frost
Totem. When giving Ulan and Shakryn the items, give to them all at once. The gems may be
stacked. I haven&#146;t tried handing to them unstacked. </p>

<p>Why do this quest?:&nbsp;&nbsp; It is awesome armor. It&#146;s appearance is light
blue. It&#146;s excellent armor. It&#146;s cheaper than the steel plate equivalent plus
being better in AC. The Large Steel Kilt is one AC better than greaves but 1 AC isn&#146;t
a whole lot for appearances sake and that is only available to Large Races anyways. But
the most important reason is that you get huge amount of EXP for doing these quests. At
Lvl 26 I&#146;ve received a half bubble of experience for doing this. It&#146;s awesome
EXP.</p>

<p>To obtain the Gems:</p>

<p>I have found and bought the gems in Erud. I payed 91plat for a single Star Ruby. I had
bought my Rubies in High Hold Pass and they had cost me 175plat. I&#146;ve been told that
Freeport is the cheapest place to purchase the gems you need and once I have a location I
will post the prices I payed for them. Please remember that faction and charisma plays an
important part in costs.</font></p>
