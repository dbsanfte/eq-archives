<p>Qeynos Aqueducts </font></b><br>
Within Qeynos at the bridge near the bank, there is an NPC named Zamiel. Speak to him
about the aqueducts, beasts and children. He will then give you the information you need
to starte the quest. Go down into the water where the bridge is and find the spawn point
within the sewer. Not certain where this is at but it is on upper level of Aqueducts.
&nbsp; Kill everything that spawns and at some point Cubert, a gelatinous cube, will come
out. Kill him and he will drop a tattered robe. Take the tattered robe back to Zamiel and
he will in return give you a +3 intelligence earring.</p>

<strong>Qeynos Monk Headband Quest</strong></p>
<div><font size="2">

<p>Quest begins by going up to Phin Esrinap who is usually at the guildhouse of the Silent
fist clan or nearby the N Queynos gate entrance. Target him and 'hail'&nbsp;him. He will
tell you something about '[headbands]'. Ask him what is a headband? He will tell you about
the different types of Headbands. The first three are White, Yellow and Orange in order of
difficulty.</font></p>
</div><div><font size="2">

<p>White Headband:</font></p>
</div><div><font size="2">

<p>White band is obtained by killing gnoll pups that spawn outside of N Queynos gate. Be
careful when you attack pups, sometimes if there are others near them thay might team up
and come after you. Also they spawn further away from the gate so if you start running at
lower levels you may or may not reach the guards in time. After you kill one see if it has
a gnoll scalp (it looks like its hide, just right-click on it to know for sure). Collect
all four first, if you are afraid you are going to die before you find all four put the
ones you have in the bank. Give them to him and he will give you a white headband. Make
sure you wear the white headband, just having it in your general inventory does not make a
difference. Left click on it if it is in your general inventory and then left click again
on yourself to wear it.</font></p>
</div><div><font size="2">

<p>Note: If ever you get a gnoll fang out of&nbsp;a gnoll pup (very unlikely) do not throw
it away. Find Captain Tillin, he is usually in the Arena at S Queynos. When you give gnoll
fangs to him give them one at a time only. In return you get faction, xp and a moonstone.
Go to the back room at 'Fish &amp; Ale' in S. Queynos and give the bartender named McNeal
Jocub and give him the moonstone. Again you get faction, xp and a bottle of blackburrow
stout which you can then sell for some money</font></p>
</div><div><font size="2">

<p>Yellow Headband:</font></p>
</div><div><font size="2">

<p>Do not attempt this until you are at least 8th level and teamed with a character that
can cast magic spells. Go to Surefall glade entrance and instead of entering Surefall
start walking along the right (your right) wall till it take you to the ruins. Skeletons
here spawn more at night I think than during the day. Be very careful of the putrid
skellies, as sometimes they show up with dread corpses. If such a combination comes after
you and you are by yourself run to the guard post at Surefall glade. If you are able to
kill putrid skellies and obtain 3 putrid bones (not all putrid skellies give away purtid
bones) give them at the same time to Phin Esrinap along with your white headband. Phin
Esrinap will give you a yellow headband</font></p>

<p>INT Earring Quest</p>

<p>For those that don't know, there is an easy quest that you can do in South Qeynos and
the Qeynos aquaducts.&nbsp; If you enter the catacombs through the water between the bank
and the mages area (as opposed to the water entrance directly in front of the bank) you'll
be in an area that spawns a named gelatinous cube named Cuburt (aggressive and about level
5).&nbsp;&nbsp; Other things that spawn from that same spot are normal gelatinous cubes
(non-aggressive and about level 5-6), mangy rats (aggresive and around 3rd level), and
sewer rats (non-aggressive and around 2nd level).&nbsp; The actual spawn point for all of
these is a ledge just above the froglok spawn point... you don't have to swim through any
of the aquaducts to get to this point, it is along the main walkway you reach when you pop
into the aquaducts through the above mentioned entrance.&nbsp;&nbsp; About 20% of the
time, Cuburt drops a tattered bloody dress, which is your main goal.&nbsp; You take this
back out of the aquaducts and to the guy named Zamel who stands by the bridge over the
water in front of the bank (again, this isn't the same way into the aquaducts that you
took).&nbsp; Zamel will give you a +3 INT earring (not lore or anything like that) about
3/4 times (the other times he gives you a piece of hematite), plus some faction and a few
silvers.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also supposedly take the dress to some guard commander and
you have a chance for a magical amulet of some sort (this is already documented on many of
the quest sites), but the +3 INT ring alternative hasn't been well documented.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, the frogloks down there by Cuburt's spawn point don't hurt your faction
with Guk frogloks, and occasionally drop netted equipment, making it a good spot for monks
starting in Qeynos to hunt.&nbsp; For anyone on the racewar servers, this will be an
especially good place to hunt, as monks could get netted gloves from here (something that
normally will be very tough for them to acquire).<br>
