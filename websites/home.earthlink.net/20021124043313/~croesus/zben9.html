<p>Day Thirty-two: This is the end, my friend...
<p>I sit amid the hissing steamvents and ticktocks of Ak'Anon and wait
for the end. It's amazing how quickly things can unravel; a week ago I
was worried about my future, now I know I have none.
<br>I am writing this journal entry not because I believe anyone will ever
read it; How can they?
<br>No I am doing it because my old friend Iony Gredlong says it will help
to ease the wait, and perhaps calm me for what comes. And who knows, perhaps
it will survive, legends say occasionally something does.
<p>I don't know how long I have before the Third Bell rings, so I shall
try and explain the journey home as best I can, though some things like
the burning of Qeynos I will merely mention in passing as I wasn't there
to see it happen.
<p>I guess the best place to start is the run through Everfrost. In simplest
terms it was melting. The temperature in the area had risen some 20 degrees
in the space of a single morning. By the time I was half way across Everfrost,
it was a floodplain of slush and deep and growing lakes.
<p>I reached the entrance to Blackburrow but passed through without seeing
a single Gnoll. I was to later learn that they were sacking Qeynos as I
passed through their burrows and tunnels.
<p>Oh they didn't do it alone, no they had plenty of help. A Hoard, for
that is what it was, of Trolls and Ogres, Goblins and Gnolls, Erudite Necromancers
and some other Erudites of less then good souls, a race of cat like people,
living fungi, Froglocks and other assorted monsters, had descended on Qeynos
in the space of a single day.&nbsp; The only race missing were the Dark
Ones and I learned later they were occupied elsewhere. Many of these races
were traditional enemies, yet they worked together in a harmony never before
seen by any of the "good" races.&nbsp; I heard this tale from two <b><a href="barbabes.jpg">strong
barbarian women</a></b>, who were fleeing the Qeynos hills toward the Karanas.
I told them of what I had seen in Halas and Everfrost and they appraised
me of the situation in Qeynos.
<p>We decided to journey together and made our way through the Karanas.
Somewhere in North Karana we were attacked by a lion and a wolf and Maylynn
was slain. I and Scea became separated running for our lives and I never
saw either of them again. I stumbled upon a camp of <b><a href="gypsies.jpg">Gypsies</a></b>
and spent the night under their distrustful gaze.
<p>In East Karana, I made a&nbsp; wide detour to avoid what at first looked
like smoke from a fire of immense size. From higher land though it was
a funnel, a great twister like I had heard sometimes graced the deserts
of Ro. At closest approach though I knew it was not. The funnel was not
moving and in fact the winds were blowing toward it. It marked a great
hole in the ground, a pit into which all the air and dirt and nearby vegetation
was being sucked slowly but surely. I know not where it went but it seemed
to grow larger even as I watched so I turned and headed towards HighHold
pass,&nbsp; running from what I couldn't comprehend.
<p><b><a href="hihold3.jpg">HighHold pass</a></b> was empty of all sound
and life and I was able to see for the first time the great murals carved
into the <b><a href="hihold1.jpg">cliff faces</a></b> above the pass.&nbsp;
I passed through a nearly deserted Rivervale, the few remaining old halflings
telling me the rest had joined the battle against the Dark Ones in Nektulos
forest. As I passed through the Commonlands the ground shivered and shook
and distant lightning flashed through the sky.&nbsp; I missed a battle
between Gods for which I am grateful. The combined Human and Halfling forces
defeated the Dark Ones, but at a high price. Their pyrrich victory left
them no strength to defend against the following Hoard which was moving
eastward after the destruction of Qeynos. I arrived in Freeport, also relatively
empty. I checked the mages market place and was rewarded with <b><a href="pendrils.jpg">Pendrils
Animation</a></b>. In other circumstances I would have been happy but the
rank one spell would not protect me, not at this late date and level.
<p>I caught the boat out of Freeport at midnight, the most restful part
of the journey so far. I simply <b><a href="moonship.jpg">stared out at
the ocean</a></b>, wondering what awaited me in Faydwer.
<p>Arriving on the docks in the Butcherblocks, I headed towards Kaladim
and was bound there by a friendly cleric. I wasn't actually allowed inside
Kaladim though, for the Dwarves were on a war footing and the gates were
sealed to all but other Dwarves. A combined force, an Army really, of Dwarves,
and Elves were leaving the city and heading towards the docks to place
themselves at a chokepoint between the Hoard we all knew was coming and
Kaladim. I wanted to stay, but I was unsure if perhaps my next death would
be my last and I needed to see home at least one time more. I hurried back
to Ak'Anon,&nbsp; not knowing what I expected to find.
<p>Somewhere deep in my heart, I had carried a hope. The hope that my father,
Dewis Caneal would perhaps acknowledge me now that the end was coming.
He did acknowledge me to an extent, if you consider spitting in my face
and calling me a weak fool "acknowledgment".&nbsp; My friend Iony, bound
me to the city of Ak'Anon, and let me sleep on his floor. We drank together,
talked, laughed as good friends do, and confessed our fears.
<p>Ahhh! The Second Bell! The Hoard is entering the pass from Lesser Faydark.
Time grows short.
<p>Iony was able to offer me some comfort though in an abstract way. Old
legends, oral traditions handed down by each race, told that this end wasn't
the first and wouldn't be the last. The great force I had once heard mentioned
was again named; Verant the agent of change. The legends spoke of it being
an unconscious force for change, recreating and destroying the entire universe,
in a&nbsp; ceaseless quest for some kind of perfection only it knew.&nbsp;
The Gods were always the same it appeared or at least that is what they
told their children the races of Norrath, though perhaps they lied. I was
told that the end of each cycle was always the same, the gods of fear and
hate throwing forth their powers like candles aflame at both ends; whipping
the races into a&nbsp; fever of destruction.
<br>The "good" gods it seemed never opposed this which left me wondering
why. Legends said the end was usually a time great wars and natural catastrophes
until the sky fell. What that means I know not.
<p>Enough theory and legends! I have to tell you now of the betrayal. For
when the Dwarves met the forces of the Hoard at the docks, they were attacked
from behind by a combined force of Orcs and Goblins, Kobalds and even fairy
folk. You are probably wondering why I make no mention of the Gnomes in
this battle. It is because of my fathers treachery. A respected and feared
member of our society (although had his association with Necromancy ever
been proven he would have been shunned) he had little trouble getting into
see King Ak'Anon for a late meeting. It was the next day that the King
was found dead, boiled in his own blood. A vial of poison which the Elves
often use on arrows was also found. My people are not fools. They surely
wanted to question Dewis, but he was nowhere to be found. The delay, the
confusion, and even convincing the young regent that the Elves would never
do such a thing delayed the call. The Gnomish army left Ak'Anon one day
too late. Perhaps it is for the best, for they avoided the slaughter.
<p>Beasts which are referred to only in Myths and legends worked with the
Hoard, sirens to dull the minds, Cyclops and Hill giants to crush the battle
wagons, and break through the fortifications.
<br>The attack from behind at the critical moment was the turning point.
It was a rout. The remains of the Dwarvish army fled back to Kaladim, while
the Elves regrouped at the Pass into the Faydark.&nbsp; No one thought
to wonder HOW the Crushbone legions had appeared behind the Dwarves in
Butcherblock, for surely an army passing through the Gap would have been
seen. If someone did their questions were ignored. The remains of the great
defensive army, joined too late by the Gemchoppers of Ak'Anon made their
stand, never realizing that the Crushbone orcs had tunneled and dug a new
pass through the mountains. After 2 days of waiting the Defiant as they
were taking to calling themselves heard the news. The Orcish legions had
bypassed the Gap completely and attacked the <b><a href="army3.jpg">small
band of defenders,</a>&nbsp; </b>guarding Kelethin.<b> </b>It was a slaughter,
and when the defenders were dead, the Orcs set fire to the Great trees
and burned the defenseless Kelethin to the ground.
<p>The news broke the spirit of the Elves. Where before many of them would
have stood and died to guard the Gap, now they deserted by the hundreds,
some despairing of their lost home, some throwing themselves in <b><a href="orcbatle.jpg">suicide
raids into Crushbone</a></b>, some running towards Felwithe in the hopes
of saving their families at the obvious gathering sight of refugees.&nbsp;
I left the Gemchoppers forces and joined a raid with a family of wood elves
to free a small child enslaved by the <b><a href="slaver.jpg">Orcish Slavers</a></b>.
My invisibility spell was able to get a small party of three behind the
lines and rescue their daughter and they thanked me profusely, distressed
that they had nothing to give me in reward. I calmed them for the sight
of the child's eyes when she had been re-united with her family was well
worth the risk.
<p>Trickles of&nbsp; Dwarves began to appear telling tales that Crushbone
himself had led the Hoard against Kaladim and using great magic brought
down the stones of the Butcherblocks down upon the Dwarvish City. None
of the&nbsp; escaping Dwarves knew if those in the city survived or not.
For whatever reason the Hoard paused in its advance. This allowed the High
Elves time to leave <b><a href="flwith.jpg">Felwithe</a></b>. Although
able to withstand an attack from the ground, the city of Felwithe was open
to the Sky and the drakes, griffins, and harpies of the Hoard would have
bypassed the walls and flown into the city.
<p>When the Hoard finally did arrive at Felwithe the city was deserted.
I and many other Gnomes died in the Faydark defending it.&nbsp; I was <b><a href="ogredth2.jpg">slain</a></b>
by a small group of Ogres as I spied on the advancing hoard. I awoke back
at the now bursting Ak'Anon, a city full of refugees. Not all those who
died were resurrected, in fact less then half were. I know not why some
rose and some did not.
<p>The Eldritch Collective, gathered with the remains of the Highest councils
of the Magi of the Dwarves, Wood Elves and High Elves to the Library Mechnamagika
for 12 hours in a secret conference. They emerged and began a ritual none
alive had ever seen.&nbsp; The power they drew upon were so great that
the Library itself was split asunder, its great crystalline walls shattered
and ruined. The power they drew upon slew the Orc's god, <b><a href="crshbone.jpg">Crushbone</a></b>,
where he stood, but as it did so it melted the very casters from within,
turning them to dust before our very eyes. Over half of the
<br>assembled Masters vanished into powder, screaming in agony. None resurrected.
<p>The stage is set now, the ballista of the castle and walls are drawn
tight and those same walls are lined with the finest of Elven archers.
The obsolete clockworks of the Scrapyard have been gathered together and
altered so that they will let none pass within a hundred yards of the gates.
<br>The Battle Clockworks, Mark XXXXVII, the most lethal we Gnomes posses
and whose use had been outlawed for generations are now powered and ready,
awaiting&nbsp; the Third Bell.
<p>We are as ready as we will ever be, although with the power of the Dark
Gods against us, what does it really matter. Even should we triumph, we
would only postpone the inevitable. Still, we must try for the fire of
creation burns within us as surely as that of destruction lives in the
Hoard.
<p>I hear it now. The vast booming of the Third Bell, a sound last heard
over 800 years ago at the Wars of Below. I watch for a second as the refugees
stand up and begin to grab whatever they can to use as defense, a metal
bar, a skinning knife, whatever. I can hear great blasts as the Battle
Clockworks deliver the shot of great balls of iron, using magically compressed
steam. I see Iony, heading my way and will give this Journal to my friend
to keep in the Temple for me.&nbsp; I check my spells, summon my nearly
useless Animation, and gather my mana. I am ready.&nbsp; I go now to meet
my fate.
<p>&nbsp;Zben, level 8 Enchanter, 15th day of March, 3172, old calendar.
