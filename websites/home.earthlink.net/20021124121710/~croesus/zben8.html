<p>Day Twenty-five: Call of the North
<p>During the day while the news of the death of Tholius Quey still spread,
three boats of the Fishing fleet vanished, in calm seas while searching
the Crossing for sign of the ferry. Fisherman are a superstitious lot and
by the next day not all the coins I owned could have bought me passage
to Erudrin. I certainly tried. I spent a good two hours before dawn asking
at this boat or that. Nothing.
<br>Although things had certainly changed in the week since I had left
the Ak'Anon, I was not going to just run home without achieving my goal,
Halas or Erudrin. As Erudrin was denied me, Halas it would be.
<p>I found a very nice Magician to bind me to Qeynos and left the city
and headed north, following the great stone road. I soon came to a fork
and knowing that one path led to the Karanas, I chose the other and hoped.
I was close anyway. Instead of the pits of Blackburrow, the home of the
Gnolls, and the only route through to Halas, I entered <b><a href="surfal2.jpg">Surefall
Glade</a></b>, home of the Druids and Rangers of Humankind, and a place
where bears are protected. Since I was here, I explored a bit, examining
the <b><a href="surfal3.jpg">Lodge, and Archery Range</a></b>, and even
sneaking behind the waterfall and into the caves that the bears made home.
Still I didn't stay long, and getting some quick directions left Surefall
and followed the mountains, left.
<p>The entrance to Blackburrow lies just past the ruins of an <b><a href="oldtempl.jpg">ancient
church</a></b> of some kind, and are quite easy to find. Had someone simply
told me to look for the <b><a href="blakbrow.jpg">Gnoll head shaped entrance</a></b>
I would never have ventured into Surefall Glade by accident. In any case
the stench of grease and smoke and the bodies lying near the entrance clearly
warned of the dangers ahead. As I approached I heard two warriors conversing
and warning others that some sort of summoned being was guarding the entrance
just inside the tunnel. I, already invisible crept silently past the Skeletal
being, a pet of undoubted Necromatic origins.
<p>Just passed the skeleton and around the corner I watched a small group
of warriors and magi hold off a concerted push of a large <b><a href="gnolfite.jpg">group
of Gnolls</a></b> attempting to drive them from Blackburrow. Merely watching
made me tired, for the combatants were far to strong for me to jump in
and help. I hurried past and found myself in a <b><a href="gnolpit.jpg">great
open air pit</a></b>, with passages leading off in many directions. I chose
one and started for it, then suddenly halted. A large Gnoll with a&nbsp;
very large Axe stood directly in front of me and seemed to be looking right
at me. I felt a second of panic but then verified that I was still invisible.
What was he staring at? Turning I saw a Human Druid marching forward towards
me, club at the ready. Turning back I saw that the Gnoll was headed towards
me too. Uh oh!
<p>I'm sure you've been in that situation where you and someone walk towards
each other and get your signals crossed and each step aside for the other
in the same direction? Well it's exactly what happened to me as well. Why
the Druid and the Gnoll kept veering around like drunken sailors I shall
never know but every direction I jumped they headed there too, with me
at the center of their path like some living lodestone!&nbsp; With mere
seconds to spare I leapt aside, and as I landed realized my feet were only
inches from the edge of the pit. I turned to step away from the edge in
time to see the Gnoll duck under the Druids swinging club and in time to
feel said club hit me squarely in the chest and lift me completely off
the ground. Next thing I knew I was spluttering up dank filthy water at
the bottom of the pit.
<p>Now I had a problem. It was fairly dark and in shadow, there were hungry
Razorfish swimming all around me and closing in and I had no idea if it
was even possible to get out of the pit. I saw a darker shadow against
the wall and swam for it as the first Razorfish darted&nbsp; in and began
to take pinky sized bits out of my hide. Luckily I found an entrance, but
I was at least 70 feet below the surface, and the only exit lay into the
darkness of a stinking, hole. I renewed my invisibility spell and stumbled
on into the cave.
<p>I must have spent only a few hours wandering around in the caves but
it felt like much much longer.
<br>Fear is a great survival tool, but in a situation where you have no
means of changing the cause of the fear it can be a hindrance. I wandered
up and down ramps, passing all varieties of filthy Gnolls and snakes of
various sizes. I finally found what appeared to be some sort of <b><a href="heartgn.jpg">torture
chamber</a></b> or perhaps a gladiator arena, with some human corpses scattered
about. Further on, I passed through the room of the Gnoll commander, as
he argued with his subordinates. The smell nearly made me vomit, and I
had to bite my own finger till it bled to keep myself under control. It
got easier after that as soon after the commanders room, the tunnels and
caves started slopping upwards towards the surface.
<p>I emerged back into the relatively clean air of the Pit, and looked
for help. I found it in the form of a Barbarian shaman named Tandaan. Tandaan
was familiar with the route to Halas, his home town, and needed to go there
for supplies anyway. He set a great loping pace, and I followed, not even
having time enough to restore my fading invisibility. Soon enough his sure
sense of direction led us out of Blackburrow and into the <b><a href="everfrst.jpg">plains
of Everfrost</a></b>. I have never, ever in my life felt so cold! How these
barbarians stand the cold in such skimpy clothes I will never know but
I nearly froze several important body parts off,&nbsp; I tell you! And
this was running at full speed for an extended period too!
<p>Through <b><a href="icepass.jpg">Icy winding valleys</a></b> we ran
and seeing me tiring the barbarian slowed his pace. It was a kind gesture
and one not done with any disparaging remarks, nor even mentioned, though
I am sure I slowed him down. At long last, we came upon an enclosed lake
that Tandaan told me his people had created, by damming up an underground
river, as a defense for Halas, which otherwise had no natural borders.
Absent the <b><a href="raftride.jpg">rope guided raft</a></b> we took,
any invaders of Halas would have to attack it after a freezing swim and
from the water no less. A good defense for a city built on the surface.
<p>Thanking Tandaan for his help was easily done, since I had heard great
things about <b><a href="wavemcqd.jpg">McQuaids</a></b>, a bar of sorts
famous for its dark stout ales. I bought him a few rounds and that few
turned into many.
<br>I awoke the next morning with a slightly aching head, wrapped in a
bear fur and lying in the corner of the bar, near a warm raging fire. Of
Tandaan there was no sign.
<p>I explored the city of Halas, and saw its sights, or rather I should
say, sight. Aside from McQuaids, the only other thing of interest in the
city was the so called <b><a href="pitdoom.jpg">Pit of Doom</a></b>, an
arena in which the Barbarians played their favorite game, Brawlball. The
rules as they were explained to me seem hideously complicated and designed
to cause a great number of fouls which according to the same rules must
be decided upon by brawls in the pit.&nbsp; The winner of the Brawl determines
whether there was actually a foul or not. Brutal game from its description,
and one most fitting for a people who run around naked in the freezing
snow and ice, wrestling polar bears or Ice Goblins, or whatever they wrestle
up here.
<p>If&nbsp; I sound somewhat disdaining of Halas it is because I was somewhat
disappointed. I had traveled all the way across the world and ended up
in a frozen lonely place where I was even shorter in comparison then to
humans. In addition I was lonely and homesick. Barbarians are a nice folk
but their customs, and foods (fried bear fat?) were not those I was used
to and now that I had succeeded in my initiation quest, it seemed I most
wanted to be home again and before whatever I felt was coming actually
arrived. As if a sign that I should hurry Halas suffered a tremor.
<p>In the Steamfonts, tremors are normal, after all we live in an area
of volcanic activity. Here apparently they were not because suddenly throngs
of Barbarians filled the streets and their gruff voices rumbled in consternation.
I attempted to calm them but was of course ignored. I turned and headed
to the pier and the raft ride that would begin my long journey home.
