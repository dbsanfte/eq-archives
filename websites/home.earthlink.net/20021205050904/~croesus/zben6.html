<p>Day Nineteen-Twenty: Travellin Gnome: Tashan!
<p>I rose before sunrise, and stumbled in a bleary half awake state to
the clerics hall to pray and seek the blessing of Brell Serelis before
my journey. In the cold air of the morning, I hoped to receive that internal
warmth and confidence in the knowledge of his presence, but again for the
second time in as many days, there was only a hollow emptiness inside me.
I worried for a few minutes that perhaps I had again somehow disappointed
my God, but could think of nothing I had done. I consoled myself with the
thought that surely the Duke of Below had other more important matters
to attend to.
<p>I left Kaladim as the sun crested the hills, following the directions
I had received from various Dwarves. I couldn't help but feel sad because
I had intended to stay in the Butcherblocks and hunt for many days, yet
I was leaving there far sooner then I had planned. I hoped I would soon
be back in the plentiful hunting grounds around the Dwarven homeland. Yet
as I left the sight of the city I felt it would be awhile before I set
foot in Kaladim again.
<p>As I was walking along the path, I heard my name called. I turned to
find a stout Dwarf and a tall female Woodelf. They introduced themselves
and the Woodelf, Norisha by name explained that she was a comrade of my
old friend Hystrix, from my time in the Scrapyard of Ak'Anon. Her companion
was named Heister and was a rogue of some repute in the dwarvish community.
With the <b><a href="friends.jpg">introductions</a></b> over and it being
clear we were headed the same direction we decided to travel together.
Our journey, to the docks involved many recountings of tales (some tall)
and adventures, and I look back on this entire journey as one of the most
pleasant times I have had recently. There were no fierce battles, no untoward
or meaningless deaths, just good clean air, fine companionship, and plentiful
new sights to see.
<p>In Ak'Anon the great central lake is called the Ink Sea. I now know
that the name is somewhat of an misnomer. It is a lake after all, a big
one but a lake nonetheless. My first sight of the Sea of&nbsp; Tears, stopped
my in my tracks, for I had never imagined so much water before. It seemed
to go on forever and had actual waves breaking on the shoreline. I must
have stared for a few minutes before Heister gently nudged me towards the
<b><a href="docks.jpg">docks</a></b>,
chuckling to himself at my gaping stare.
<p>We were hardly the only ones waiting for the clipper ship, in fact the
<b><a href="pier1.jpg">pier</a></b>
was full of various groups and couples, chatting away, practicing their
various magics and musics, enjoying the peace and serenity that seemed
to wash in from the Sea of Tears. I am sure that the name can fit, and
that the Sea of tears has claimed many lives, but on that day, on that
dock, it was a place of great contentment.
<p>Finally the great clipper ship hove into view, and we boarded and jostled
for space at the rail.
<br>The captain asked the blessing of Prexus on our journey and we were
off. As the ship left port, and the gentle rocking set in, I discovered
that I was feeling somewhat sick. Luckily, Norisha had a small pinch of
herbs she told me to chew on, and on doing so the sickness faded away after
a bit.&nbsp; I would like to say that the journey was exciting but it really
wasn't, after a while the vastness of the Sea overcame my sense of wonder
and became, well monotonous. It seemed to go on forever and the ship was
moving at a good pace, far quicker then even a Bard can run while singing
the Accelerando.
<p>Eventually we came to an <b><a href="frststop.jpg">Island</a></b>. I
at first thought this was our stop and nearly left the ship, but Heister
restrained me and when the ship departed only a minute later I was glad,
for I would have been stranded there for a day and a half waiting for the
next ship. It turns out there are several island stops along the way, and
several islands which the ship takes pains to avoid as well. We neared
two giant rocks, a gateway in the Sea, and at an order from the captain,
a Bard began to sign a plaintive melody, one that seemed to sap the strength
from our bones, and made us weary. My first thought was some treachery
but again, Heister and Norisha restrained me, telling me it was necessary.
<br>As we passed between the rocks, far taller then the mast of the ship,
I saw why. Upon those craggy shores, sirens sang and beckoned, and even
through the bards song I felt a maddening urge, like an itch you can't
quite scratch, to throw myself over the rail and swim over to greet the
waiting beauties. The bards song made that seem like far too much work
though, and I understand now that was its purpose, to save us all. Apparently
the bard wasn't a traveler at all, but a part of the crew.
<p>Long passed the Sirens we encountered another great beast. Our first
sign of it was the massive boulder, larger then even an ogre that fell
off the port side of the ship. We passengers hurried over to the side and
there in the distance stood a mighty <b><a href="hillgint.jpg">Hill Giant</a></b>,
staring at us as we swept farther beyond his reach. He must have been quite
frustrated at his dinner getting away, but I am sure the captain and crew
knew to the foot the exact distance of his reach and kept us beyond it
at all times.
<p>As we sailed into the <b><a href="sunset.jpg">setting sun</a></b>, the
journey wore on. It was just before sundown when we reached the docks of
Freeport, and I turned to view our transport, the <b><a href="clipper.jpg">Clipper
Ship</a></b> at berth. I found walking on dry land somewhat disorienting
after the constant roll and pitch of the ship, and it had been a long day
so we headed into town to find an Inn for the night. We passed by the entrance
to the <b><a href="arcsci.jpg">Academy of Arcane Science</a></b>, but I
was too tired to go in and haggle for the spell now. It is always smart
to haggle when you are fresh and energetic, else best not to haggle at
all.
<p>In the morning, after a breakfast of some strange eggs, that had a spicy
taste to them, I went to the <b><a href="arcsci2.jpg">Academy</a></b> to
find my spell. The merchant was a shrewd haggler and it took a good hour
to work him down to something reasonable in price. It seems that most Talls
think that because we Gnomes are shorter that we are fools when it comes
to money, quite the contrary Gnomes are stingy around money, some would
even say cheap. ;-)
<p>Eventually having secured my prize, I toured the city, thinking.&nbsp;
I found and explored the <b><a href="haltruth.jpg">Hall of Truth</a></b>,
home of the Paladins, a friendly group of humans if ever there was one.
<p>Finally, as night fell,&nbsp; I came to a truly magnificent sight, the
<b><a href="tempmarr.jpg">Temple
of Marr</a></b>. Although the humans don't generally worship the Duke of
Below, Brell Serelis is not actively opposed by Erollisi Marr, the Queen
of Love, or her brother, Mithaniel Marr, the Lightbearer, and we are encouraged
to worship where we can. I headed into the Temple. Upon entering and exploring
a bit (as I simply must do, we Gnomes are driven by curiosity in all things),
I met the lead Cleric of the temple, Tholius Quey. He was a friendly, warm
and charismatic chap, and we discussed religion, for over an hour without
getting into an argument, which is a sure sign of a patient and intelligent
being.&nbsp; I then left him to pray. And to think.
<p>Some time past the Gnomes I had met in Ak'Anon had spoken of a fellowship
called the Gnomes of Norrath, a guild to support the Gnomish peoples and
all that was good about our kind. Up until now, I had been relatively alone,
bumping into groups here and there, meeting friends etc, but no group I
could call my own. The Quest to prove your worth to become a full member
of the Guild was to travel to either Erudrin, or to the frigid plains of
Halas. As I stood here in Freeport I realized I was half way there already
(or so I thought at the time journal ). Why not save myself the trip back
here and simply head onwards to Qeynos, for Qeynos was a point I would
have to pass through to get to either Halas or Erudrin? And in that instant
my mind was made up. To Qeynos I would go.
<p>A strange urgency grew in me, the urge to leave NOW! To do so though
would be to risk unfamiliar territory, in the night. Besides I needed to
be bound to the city so that should the worst happen and I die, I would
be ressurected here instead of back in Ak'Anon. I headed towards the Inn,
passing by the <b><a href="arena.jpg">Arena</a></b> on the way, and in
the morning found a helpfull Cleric by the name of Mysteria Whitestaff,
who not only bound me to the city, but gave me directions to Qeynos as
well. The sense of urgency growing in me again, I bid her good morning
and hurried out of the Western gates of the city of Freeport. As I did
so, the city was enveloped in <b><a href="freerain.jpg">pouring rain and
fog</a></b>, a portent of things to come.
