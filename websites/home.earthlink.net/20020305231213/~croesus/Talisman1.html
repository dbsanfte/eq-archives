This story takes place in the City of Talisman, along the Mudwater River which
lies far south of Lut Gholain, on the opposite edge of the continent from the
town of Tristam and years before the events occuring in the storyline of
Diablo. It is primarily an introduction to my two primary characters in Diablo,
Silverlock the mage and The Vixen (Jade) but also contains references to the
rampant cheating <br>
(Null Magic) that occurs in the game Diablo . Anyway read on and just assume
any funny parts are meant that way and unfunny parts meant that way as well :) <br>
The story is made up of 8 chapters detailing the 7 days in the week and an
epilogue. <br>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Beyond Talisman: A

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Day One: Starday. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As the old man gasped at the fumbling sideswipe and mumbled apology, Twist
casually, carefully and with the skill of one long practiced in such arts slit
the leather cord holding the money purse on the old mans belt. No one noticed,
not the man or his equally shabbily dressed companion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Although they both appeared to be peasants and the old mans eyes searched for a
clear path through the crowd as was normal, his companions eyes were never
still, jumping from face to face, staring for a second then moving on. Hard
eyes. The eyes of a professional guard. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Still Twist was good, far better then your average thief and as smart as he was
quick, so the guard didn't have a chance to question him as the Accident
occurred. Twists partner bumped the guard and said, just a little too loudly,
&quot;Watch where you're going Peasant!&quot;. The crowd around the trio made a
sound like a soft sigh as it prepared to watch something <br>
exciting happen.&nbsp; The guard, tensed and his hand moved toward his jerkin
but then stilled as he realized his predicament. He and the courier were
supposed to be incognito, dressed as peasants, and peasants never talked back
to people wearing the kind of clothing his assailant was wearing. The clothes
of an upper middle class merchant and the arrogance of one too, expecting
obedience and respect for his stature and relative wealth from the poor who
lived in this part of&nbsp; Talisman, whether he had earned it or not. The
guards orders were to deliver the courier unharmed and unnoticed to his
destination and a confrontation with an obviously higher social class citizen
would not do that. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The guard bowed his head and said &quot;Please forgive me, Sir! I meant no
disrespect.&quot;&nbsp; The merchant looked for a second like he would continue
but then turned and walked away and the crowd again began to move in its myriad
directions and errands.&nbsp; By then of course it&nbsp; was far to late, for
Twist had already hidden the pouch in his own cotton jerkin and, using his
small size to its best advantage disappeared into the bobbing heads of the
milling throng. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Finding a convenient alley Twist examined the purse. Yes! Inside the unusual
looking bluish leather pouch, were a key, 20 gold Crowns, 6 Silver Lions, a few
dozens coppers, and a coppery looking oval stone with a series of small bumps
and holes on it. A convenient sewage pit took care of the small stone and key.
The money was more then enough to see him through at least a few weeks and a
little left over for celebration, if he had luck at the gambling table. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now to get back home, the part of town that made this poor but honest area of
Talisman look like a wealthy suburb and settle up with his partner.&nbsp; His
part of town was called Trashtown not for the filth in the streets, although
there was much of that, but for the filth that lived there, all manner of
whores, thieves, murderers and worse. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sometimes having valuables sent via courier who looked poor, as opposed to a
heavily armed escort was a safe bet to avoid theft but not always. Not ever
when Twist was involved. In addition to the sixth sense he seemed to have about
trouble and how to avoid it or transfer its wrath to others, he was a very
bright person and liked to investigate his crimes beforehand. <br>
He had long known of the various courier services in Talisman and had decided
that since such unarmed and &quot;hidden&quot; couriers had to be carrying
something worthwhile and with only one guard he had decided to become much
better acquainted with the couriers. He had spent six long months finding out
the homes and memorizing the faces and styles of each.&nbsp; Now he had a
fairly <br>
easy way to get goods, with no competition since no one appeared to have
thought of it before, and low risk. The perfect job, he thought as he smiled to
himself, practically the only time he did smile. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He met his newly acquired partner at the specified place and time to give him
the second half of his payment and to get his &quot;Merchant Clothes&quot; back
(they had cost a small fortune after all). After receiving the leather nap sack
with the clothes he paid his new found and easily forgotten partner in the
usual way. After he disposed of his ex-partners body in the customary fashion,
ie dumping him in the river, he contemplated the stupidity of people.&nbsp; It
always amazed him that God had created so many trusting fools, or that
otherwise clever men would turn their backs on him. None ever got the chance to
stop being a silent <br>
partner of Twist for he was not a man to take chances or tempt the fates. In a
few weeks time when the gold was spent and the need again arose he would scout
the bars and whore houses for a suitable new partner.&nbsp; Then like he had
with the recently dead Jug (an appropriate name since he had drank like one of
those mythical Oiliphants) he would manage an introduction in a bar, buy the man
drinks all night, tell imaginary stories and false secrets like men in their
drink sometimes do and slowly but surely gain the confidence of his newly
needed partner. Until then he was on his own again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As was usual, he felt the customary satisfaction at the killing and felt the
usual stirrings of lust in his groin as he always did after violence and death,
so he headed towards Harlots Row. Yes it had been a good day.... <o:p></o:p></span></p>
