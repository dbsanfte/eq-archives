<P>We of the Fraterni Lux may seem complex in our thoughts and
procedures, but at the very core of our beliefs is honor. The
virtuous life is held in the highest regard, and since we believe
honor is the highest expression of virtue, it is a value we cherish
most. To live a life of honor is to enrich the soul, and through this
enlightenment comes wisdom and fulfillment. Action tempered by honor
inevitably leads one down the path of light. Through this general
goodness of the heart, we embrace any and all who wish to lead a life
of virtue. For we welcome any race and profession who shares our
thirst for honor and justice, be it troll or elf, ogre or dwarf, so
long as they dedicate their lives to the paths of light, they shall
ever have a place among us. We believe that no race is born
inherently evil, rather it is how they are reared and taught which
shall determine their character and role in life. Therefore, we
encourage racial unity, and welcome all that wish to pursue the path
of goodness. Just as the noble elf is deemed good in the eyes of
many, so too can a marauding troll or scheming thief be accepted in
our midst, so long as they heed the calls of honor, recounting their
evil ways and strive to use their skills for the cause of light. This
we believe in, and only through our devotion to virtue do we move
beyond the racial bigotries and mindless slaughters that plague
Norrath. Together, we the Fraterni Lux follow the path of light, with
honor ever burning in our heart. Virtue our calling, honor our bond,
honor above all else!</P>
