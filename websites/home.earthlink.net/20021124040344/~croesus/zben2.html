<p>Day Two: A Day in the Life of a Young Adventurer.
<br><font color="#3333FF">I awoke on the morning of my second day in Ak'Anon
feeling refreshed and vowed to achieve my first kill today on the long
road to mastery of my Arts. This would not be easy. I was at the gates
to <b><a href="Akanon.jpg">Ak'Anon</a></b>. The outside had proven to be
filled with beasts that were far to strong for me at level one so I decide
to explore the city some more in search of someplace called... The Scrapyard!</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">A place where, if the rumors were true, the killing
was easy and the levels were nearly free. I, being somewhat naive actually
believed that until I got there, but I get ahead of myself. I passed through
the gates of Ak'Anon again and turned right at the Waterfall. Looking back
provides another view of the <b><a href="lakevew2.jpg">Waterfall and the
Castle</a></b> here.</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">While in the central plaza near the Forge of Defiance,
I experimented with a new spell I had learned called Minor Illusion. This
spell supposedly turns you into a duplicate of whatever you are near. Little
did I know that only meant inanimate objects. I tried to become a doppleganger
of the living Mechnamagical Merchant but succeeded in only trapping myself
in place for 5 minutes. I had turned myself into a duplicate of the merchants
<b><a href="Merug.jpg">RUG!!</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I was immobile for 5 minutes or so until the spell had worn off. Curiously
later that day the spell ceased to function at all and when I looked at
it it was now a level 61 spell! Magic sure can be confusing sometimes :(</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">Finally with the help of the friendly fisherman
slash warrior Hystrix you see in the image above I was able to find the
<b><a href="Scrapyrd.jpg">Scrapyards</a></b>.
Oh the joy!&nbsp; As you can see, I am Armored by my minor Shielding spell
and have cast my Shallow breath spell on the beastie in question. It resisted
which unfortunately for Enchanters, (who have spells which do multiple
effects so the resist chance is higher) happens more often then other magic
users. As you can see I am adept at fizzling my spells, luckily Shortee
the Wizard was there to save my posterior the first few times.</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">I stuck to rock snakes and soon made level 2.
WOOHOO! Only 48 more to go! Shouldn't take much more then a few weeks,
well maybe months. Finally I am tough enough to at least venture outside
the Scrapyards and outside Ak'Anon itself. I leave town with Hystrix, the
mighty Gnome warrior and we exit the caves and tunnels of Ak'Anon just
as the sun begins to set. Here is the view as we head out into the <b><a href="dusk.jpg">fading
sunlight</a></b>.&nbsp; Here is a little bit later, it's beginning to get
a might chilly out as the <b><a href="sundown.jpg">sun goes down</a></b>.</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">We battled a few Large Rats and Decaying Gnome
Skeletons (They really stink too!) and then in the distance we saw it.
Massive stones standing tall in the Dark. I immediately wanted to explore
it of course and we went closer. Here we are standing at the base of these
massive <b><a href="thestons.jpg">monuments</a></b> to some arcane and
violent god. Alas about this time just as I was beginning to copy the strange
Hieroglyphics on the stones we heard the grunts of approaching Kobalds
and knowing we were no match for them fled.</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">The world grew darker still, and <b><a href="Nitefals.jpg">true
night</a></b> began to fall upon us. What's worst we were Lost! As the
<b><a href="bluemoon.jpg">purple
moon</a></b> began to rise above the plains and hills we saw in the distance
the shimmer of lights, the yellow of torches and buildings perhaps! We
hurried onwards. The howls of the Kobalds behind us were closer and closer
and perhaps it was our fear that blinded us to the fact that those same
howls were also coming from in front of us. We ran into the camp, and in
seconds were torn to shreds as three Kobalds and a Kobald Shaman descended
upon us.</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">I awoke in front of the entrance to Ak'Anon in
the <b><a href="rainyday.jpg">pouring rain</a></b> with a headache and
resolved to learn my surroundings in the daytime when the Kobalds sleep
(mostly) so that I will be less likely to repeat that mistake again. Thanks
be to Brell Serilis, The Duke of Below for his intervention in resurrecting
me. I have heard that he will do so for all Gnomes but that he begins to
exact a price for this favor at level 5 and above. What this price is I
know not, so I shall endeavor to stay alive as much as possible. Besides
dying hurts!</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">I grew tired and my head was pounding, but I forced
myself out in the daylight and wandered until I found it. The <b><a href="kobcamp.jpg">Kobald
Camp</a></b>. From this safe distance I observed it, noted the landmarks
and vowed that the next time I visited here it would be on my own terms...
then I quickly hurried back to the safety of the caves of Ak'Anon and the
Ink Sea to rest my aching head.</font>
