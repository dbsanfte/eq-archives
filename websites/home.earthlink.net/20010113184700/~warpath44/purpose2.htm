<P>Our purpose, though intricately bound to our philosophy, is quite
simple: <I>to have fun</I>. We try hard not to infringe on the
individuality of our members, yet we highly emphasize group
activities, meeting, loyalty, and teamwork. In addition, we place
fellowship and family as one of our highest goals, and we try to
approach all aspects of the game as a tightly knit group. Our purpose
is also to maintain the most active, dedicated, and honorable guild
around. This we take seriously, and therefore are selective in who we
choose to be a member. We care more for Friendship and fun than
power, money or conquest (though if we naturally obtain these things,
so be it). We will be quite content to have a few members, or even
become a powerhouse guild so long as our commitment to family, honor,
and fun does not waver. We want to adventure together as much as
possible, to role-play as best we can, and set a chivalrous example
to others while enjoying the game. To summarize, our purpose is to
work as a close family, to adventure together, to espouse our beliefs
in virtue, and most of all, to have fun.</P>
