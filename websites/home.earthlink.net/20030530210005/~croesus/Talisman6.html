&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Day Six:&nbsp; SkyDay </p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It had been a glorious day in Talisman, spring was finally on its way.&nbsp;
The late afternoon sun streamed in the window and its warmth was welcome, as
she lay there, half awake, with a glorious feeling of drowsiness flooding her
body. &quot;Wake up!&quot;, said a strong and gruff voice beside her, and she
did.&nbsp; As her beautiful jade eyes opened and she saw the rough hewn,
gruffly handsome soldier sitting by her bed it all came back to her: the terror
of seeing the sadist in her room; the feeling of pain as the knife had sliced
clean through her throat; the salty taste of blood filling her throat and
cutting of her scream, and finally the deep remorse and regret that was her
last feeling as her life had drained away and she had looked back on her life
and realized she had not really lived but only existed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For a second she was to startled to speak, but then she ventured the
obvious..&quot;I was dead! How did I get here? Who healed me?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The soldier glanced at her as he continued the work of polishing and sharpening
the massive and much worn BattleAxe he carried, gently as if it were his child
or lover. &quot;The Mage resurrected you. I knew not that mage's had that
power, to restore life to a corpse, for you are right that is what you were. He
labored for several hours last night incanting spells and consuming and using
many potions and I thought him crazy or a liar when he claimed he could revive
you until I saw your wounds knit up of themselves and eventually you began to
breathe again.&nbsp; The mage, Silverlock is his name, looked haggard and worn
from the ordeal and left you in my charge while he went to regain his strength.
As for where we are, God only knows for we were all brought here in a flash of
light, in the manner these mages always seem to use to travel.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Why did he heal me though? I do not know him? I know no mages, at
all!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Nor he you,&quot; spoke the warrior,&quot; but when I was ready to behead
the Thief for his crime and what he had done to you, he looked at your corpse
and a funny look came over his face. He said, and don't ask me why or how he
knew this, but he said 'Her time is not yet, she has many journeys to make
yet'. Then he did his magic and your corpse was gone and here we are.&nbsp; Now
what are you giving me that stare for?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;If that sadist is still alive then take me to him. I have a score to
settle and much pain to repay him! Twist you called him, well twist I shall as
I remove his stones and shove them down his throat for dinner.&quot; A fire
burned behind her Jade green eyes and Xhorghat for the first time, noticed her
not as a whore but as a person, and one who might have the steel necessary to
carry out her threat, if not the means. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;It's not to be, Lady,&quot; he grumbled and felt instantly self conscious
in the use of the title for although he now had little doubt she had the soul
of a Lady,&nbsp; how could he call one who had opened herself for so many and
for coins a Lady?&nbsp; Yet Girl, and Whore both felt wrong as well and
condescending. &quot;He has stolen something and the mage needs it back, hell
from what <br>
I understand the whole city needs it back. Once he has finished with the swine
he has promised him to Gordo,&nbsp; for Twist has killed Gordo's son,
Jug.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At that a radiant smile swept her face and her eyes danced as she laughed, a
deep rich sound like the purr of a housecat, and one which shook her body in
most tantalizing ways. &quot;Ah that is even better! Gordo's son eh? Twist will
be flayed alive inch by inch and that will be the least of his troubles. He
deserves it to for what he has done. &quot; After a second the mirth left her
eyes and she continued, &quot;but I am not a Lady and don't deserve the title.&nbsp;
Are you a warrior?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Yes. I was a City guard until I retired and then I was a Guard for
couriers until Twist theft of the item removed me from that position. Now I
don't know what I will do. Why do you ask?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;I want you to teach me all there is about fighting, I want never to be in
the position where I cannot defend myself again. I have little money but for
payment will give you myself one night a week to do with as you wish. Is that a
fair bargain?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A deep blush spread across Xhorghat's face as she looked at him with a steady
eye, not at all ashamed of&nbsp; what she offered or the bargain she was
willing to make. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Uhhhm,... Ahhghh that is I appreciate the offer, and the payment is more
then generous but I have little to teach you. I would not make a good teacher
since I am an Axeman&nbsp; and you would not have the upper body strength to
use the axe effectively in combat.&nbsp; There are other masters in other
weapons, perhaps you could seek out a Swordsman or a Ranger?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
She looked at him steadily, and as she saw the blush cross his face, she
wondered for no man ever blushed when a harlot offered to do what was perfectly
normal for harlots to do.&nbsp; This man considered her a lady, if not in title
and history then in bearing at least.&nbsp; She softened her gaze and asked
&quot;Is there nothing you can teach me? I will be leaving town shortly and
have no time to find someone who will consent to teach a mere woman to
fight?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Xhorghat, master Axeman and seasoned veteran of the Fifth war of the MudWater
States, vanished for a second and in his place a voice he knew to be his, yet
one that sounded far more like a teens own blurted out &quot;You are leaving?
So am I! Perhaps we can travel together?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Instantly, an icy cold hand clenched in his gut as he recovered himself and
thought &quot;Dear god I am acting like a lovesick puppy? What am I
doing?&nbsp; She will never want to travel with someone who is so eager to do
so.&quot; Yet even as he spoke he heard her answer, &quot;Yes. I wouldn't mind
traveling with you. When shall we leave? Perhaps you can teach me what little I
can learn of Axes on the way?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Somewhere inside him Xhorghat wondered if perhaps she might not make a good
Axemaster, she certainly had the spirit for it.&nbsp; Somehow the thought of
leaving Talisman, the town he had spent his whole life in, which before had
seemed a tragic fate now seemed more like the beginning of an adventure.
&quot;Uhm, well we can leave as soon as the mage has recovered the He... the
stolen object, not before&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Ok&quot; she chirped happily, with a grin on her face he found himself
mirroring unconsciously, as she turned to stare out the window at the sun
slowly riding it's arc towards sunset. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
............... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The room was grim, as Silverlock made his way in and around the table to his
waiting chair, all the while sensing their eyes on him. He was bone tired. Days
of expending magical energy keeping track of Xhorghat at a distance, while
searching the ether for any glimmers the stone might have made followed by the
resurrection last night and the thought of the coming hours of torture
necessary to recover the information all weighed heavily on him. He felt he
could sleep for a week but knew he had not the time.&nbsp;&nbsp; The most
recent gnawing and queasiness in the pit of his stomach though was the real
cause for this meeting as he knew that all of his fellow Keepers felt the same.
Null magic was in use somewhere in Talisman! The eddies of rotting order, the
tatters of physical laws stretched then broken was a malaise they all felt, in
the deepest marrow in their bones.&nbsp; A sense of wrongness that the user of
the Nullmagics would long since have grown accustomed to and failed to notice,
but which swept through the soul of ever member of the Brotherhood like an icy
wind. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;We have troubles,&quot; announced Mandrake, the Red Mage, and Keeper of
the First Heart of Talisman, &quot;You all feel it! Null magic is in the air,
and we without all the Hearts together to defeat it.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As he spoke they all looked at Silverlock, as if&nbsp; blaming him for the
theft. It wasn't so of course, the ritual cleansing and blessing of the Hearts
was done each year and had been done in the same way and manner for generations
without a problem. The Hearts needed the ritual blessing and cleansing to
function yet even a Keeper could be overcome by a group of mages as he followed
it first to the spring, then to the Abbey, then back to the Temple. Without the
many protective and augmentative spells laid on the Temple over the last hundred
generations each Keeper was again just a mage. Powerful mages surely, but not
powerful enough to stop a group of other mages from attacking and possibly
wresting the Heart away.&nbsp; Since Keepers were tied to their Hearts, and
leaving the other Six less guarded to watch over the one being purified would
have been unthinkably dangerous the first founders of the ritual had devised a
method based on trickery and deceit. Nobody save a select few knew that at
seven separate weeks of the year at least one of the Hearts was gone and being
purified.&nbsp; This reliance on deception had worked for generations.&nbsp;
The Keepers were forbidden to follow the Hearts as the left the temple since
the very act of doing so would alert any other watching mages that the Heart
was no longer within the much spelled and protected temple where they <br>
usually rested. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>Still as the youngest of the seven and the Keeper for the currently
missing Heart, Silverlock knew that it was only human nature to blame him in
some way for its absence so he did not respond with anger towards the looks
merely considered the problem and confronted the others with his own solution. &quot;There
are few NullMages in this part of the world, and the only thing which would
draw one to Talisman&nbsp; is the thought of possessing one of the Hearts. I
think we must assume he knows it is no longer at the temple and has come to
seek it.&quot; <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>he said. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Yes,&quot; responded the others and a debate ensued as to what course of
action must be taken. Silverlock listened and thought but finally he could keep
silent no longer. &quot;If this mage is here to get the Heart then we must
defend it and stop him from doing so!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;But if he is using the Null magics what chance do we have against
him.&quot; said Iceman, the Blue Mage and Keeper of the Fourth Heart.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;With his Null magic,
which we dare not use,&nbsp; none of us can singly stand against him, yet one
must. We all cannot, for to do so would be against our oaths and a sure signal
to every other evil mage out there that the other Six Hearts were unprotected
in the Temple, or with us out of its protective shield.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;If he gains the Seventh Heart he can escape and over time subvert it to
his evil Nullmagic and then we would be totally unable to stop him when he
comes, as he surely will, for the remaining Six Hearts! If you on the other
hand gain the Seventh back,&quot; and here he looked at Silverlock, for it had
been decided in this speech as surely as if a vote had been taken that he and
he alone would be the one attempting to recover the Heart with no other Keepers
to aid him, &quot;it will profit you not at all since it's magic power is in
linking with the other Hearts, and singly it could not aid you in any way
without weeks of preparation! How then do we win, when all avenues are closed
to us? How!?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;I might triumph, if you will lend me a few adepts and some Guardsmen, a
little preperation and concealment, and let me follow my plan?&quot;, said
Silverlock, with a haggard smile on his face. &quot;It will be very risky, but
I have a feeling it may just work.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;What plan is that?&quot;, asked Mendelinkin, the Green Mage, Keeper of
the Third Heart. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So he told them. And as their voices raised in argument and consternation, he
knew the night was barely starting.&nbsp; Somehow, he must convince them to go
against all they held as gospel for without doing so he knew that he, they and
eventually even the fine city of Talisman, sitting like a target on the only
bridge across the MudWater river for fifty leagues in either direction, would
lose, though it would certainly take some longer to die than others. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>............... <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The debate and argument lasted for
many hours but in the end, what choice did they have? Now Silverlock,&nbsp;
stood before the table to which was strapped Twist.&nbsp; Twist was afraid, but
he still bluffed, threatening violence and death, like a cornered rat. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I need to ask you some
questions and get some answers. It will be better if you talk to me now and
will save me the trouble of torturing you, which I do not want to do, as it
will stain my soul. I do need to know where the Stone is though&quot; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What stone you, purple idiot!
I don't know what you're talking about so why don't you...&quot; at which point
he began to describe a series of actions both immoral and physically painful,
if at all possible without being very limber. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Fine, you do not know what you stole.&quot; interrupted Silver,
&quot;Still I need to know what you did with the Stone you found in the
Couriers pouch? Small, oval, copper colored, with seven small bumps on its
surface.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;What's so important about a chunk of Copper?&quot;, asked Twist, so
Silverlock told him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Now do you understand why I must get that stone back?&quot;, asked
Silverlock. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In answer a big blob of spit spattered his purple robe, and with a cackle Twist
said, &quot;You're as stupid as that whore was if you think I'm gonna help you
recover something like that. Once I get out of here I'll help myself find it
and maybe I'll sell it back to you, if you let me go right now. Maybe instead
I'll sell it to someone who can put a major hurt on you instead, eh?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With a sigh like a old man, and a muttered &quot;I&#8217;m araid not&quot;,
Silverlock began.&nbsp; Fire and healing, ask a question; fire and healing, ask
a question. Soon he had his answers but not soon enough to save what remained
of Twists sanity, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>if sanity he
ever had. When he had his questions answered Silverlock healed his subject and
attempted to spell him to sleep and forgetfulness but the blank look on his
face, said he had failed.&nbsp; That look and the echoes of Twists screams,
haunted Silverlock's dreams that night and on waking he knew that no matter
what else, once he recovered the Heart he could no longer continue as a Keeper
since Keepers had to be pure of body and soul and his soul was now stained with
the slime of his previous nights torture of Twist. He faced the dawn of the Sun
on the last day of the week, appropriately named LastDay and hoped for the best
in the coming struggle. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
