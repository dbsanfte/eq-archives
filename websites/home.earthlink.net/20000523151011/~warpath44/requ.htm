<P>&nbsp;- All members must try to attend group meetings or other
guild events. We understand the grueling demands of real life, so if
you are unable to participate, please notify the coordinators prior
to the scheduled event.</P>

<P>&nbsp;- No spamming, mailbombing, nuking or other conduct deemed
inappropriate by the greater Internet community will be allowed</P>

<P>&nbsp;- All members are expected to uphold the highest standards
of honor both in and out of the game in any chat rooms, message
boards, or any other forums. This Means no senseless flaming or
abusive replies to other flamers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;- All members are expected to abide by guild decisions and
ethics.</P>

<P>&nbsp;- All members should try and role-play their characters to
the best of their abilities as well as work hard to improve their
chosen skills.</P>

<P>&nbsp;- You may not be a member of another guild(if you have a
problem with this particular rule, please elaborate in your
application)</P>

<P>&nbsp;- No sharing or distribution of important guild information
with ANYONE outside of Fraterni Lux</P>

<P>&nbsp;- Members must try to be active at all times. If you will be
gone for a period of time, please mail the coordinators and you will
be placed in the reserves till you are able to resume being an active
participant in the guild. Inactivity without a reason why will be
frowned upon and prolonged unexplained absences will result in
expulsion. We want to keep an active guild, and only through such
measures will this be accomplished.</P>
