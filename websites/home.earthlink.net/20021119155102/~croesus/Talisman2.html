<span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Day Two: Sunday <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>As he studied the dregs of his beer, Xhorghat Axemaster pondered his
future.&nbsp; After the fiasco yesterday he was no longer a Guard and in fact
had only a week to find and recover Talisman’s Heart before he would be locked
away for a very long time doing hard labor.&nbsp; He glanced in the beaten
copper mirror and saw his watchdogs, three hardened men assigned, none too
discretely, to make sure he didn’t leave town until the Heart was recovered or
he had been sent to the salt mines. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>As he thought over the previous days journey he saw only one point
where the pouch could have been stolen, and that was when the “merchant” had
challenged him.&nbsp; Xhorghat had a memory for faces and had that one imprinted
on his brain right now. If he could find the merchant he could find the
partner, the one who had actually done the slitN’slip. Then he and his
BattleAxe would be only too happy to make this person familiar with the
penalties of crime. It would be hard to steal with no hands would it not? For
extra measure he was planning on removing the thieves stones as well, since he
had cost Xhorghat the best job he had ever had, and even if he recovered the
Heart he would never work as a courier guard again. Currently though it was
more a matter of life and death then of losing a job. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>Well, time to start calling in favors hard earned over years of work...
all of them. He needed information and he needed it yesterday. Find the
‘merchant’, make him talk then find his partner and he would find the
Heart.&nbsp; Find the Heart and he would at the least keep his life in his own
hands rather then in the hands of a Salt mine taskmaster. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>............... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>Twist was brooding. He had spent far more then he wanted to last night
most of it involuntarily.&nbsp; He had won at the tables and selected a whore
and everything had been going great until she opened her mouth. Didn’t these
sluts understand they were there to open there mouths for only one purpose and
that wasn’t to talk?&nbsp; He had warned her, a sharp slap to the face. She had
then insulted him and after that his memory got foggy. One thing for sure, the
harlot would have trouble finding work with a slashed face and breasts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Madam and the Whoremaster had both demanded payment for the lost income and
he didn’t need the Venus Guild as an enemy so half his money had gone last
night to pay them off. As for the whore, she had been replaced within the hour,
her room cleaned out of valuables while she had been forcibly removed, still
bleeding and screaming about not having anyplace else to go. She was still out
there in the street, screaming her head off, although her screams were less
strong then they had been Perhaps the loss of blood from the gashes would shut
her up soon. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Life was cruel, Twist had learned, and pity and mercy were for fools. As he sat
thinking about his next job, just daydreaming really he looked at the bed
beside him, where a voluptuous auburn haired harlot lay. She was sleeping
peacefully, and so he casually reached out and squeezed her breast hard. She
awoke with a strained face but little more then a whimper. She had been silent
all morning, except when asked a question, since taking the Screamers place and
now even though in pain she kept quiet. Her eyes were a peaceful shade of
green, like Jade but shiny with tears of pain.&nbsp; Twist liked that. This one
knew the rules, no talk unless asked a question and also knew that it could as
easily be her out there dying in the street.&nbsp; Feeling aroused again at her
pain Twist thought that perhaps he <br>
would make a game of it. Yes. She was trying so hard to be quiet so he would
make her cry out. He wouldn’t actually maim her, he couldn’t afford that, but
pain... well that was another matter. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the instant before he reached for her, her eyes widened, as if she knew the
rules had just changed and the game gotten a lot more serious. She suppressed
an involuntary shudder as he grabbed her, and pushed her over on her belly. And
then the pain began... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>............... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fate is fickle, and the MudWater river which usually flows strong and steady
through Talisman, instead of sending poor Jug’s body on a trip from which it
would never return, deposited him on the shore of a private residence on the
other, richer side of the river.&nbsp; There his bloated corpse was found by a
small girl, daughter of the house. As she ran back to the house, as fast as her
little five year old legs could carry her and screaming at the top of her
lungs, Jugs fate was no longer a secret and Jug was now far more of a threat to
Twist then Twist could ever have imagined... <br>
