<p>Everyone knows how to get the container but the locations of the rings have finally all
been found.&nbsp; The four rings come from Gynok Moltor in Befallen and High Priestess
Mitty on Kerra Isle.&nbsp; Mitty has the copper, silver, and gold rings (mostly it is
copper but don't get discouraged), and Gynok has the copper and platinum rings.&nbsp; The
end result of putting all 4 rings into the paw and hitting combine is quite nice, 9ac, +9
wis/agi, +5 mana, -5 cha, -5 sv disease.&nbsp;</p>
