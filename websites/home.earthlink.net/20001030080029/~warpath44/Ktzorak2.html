<P>Ktzorak grumbled and snarled as he pulled the horse-wagon through
the mud and grass. Even the pleasant sulfuric aroma and steamy swamp
gas did not please the slave troll. The mountain that loomed ahead
never seemed to get any closer, and the way was strewn with danger.
The swamp had been home to him but was not hospitable this trip. His
mace had been taken away from him by the enchantress that held him
and the other mules in magical chains. Along the way they had fought
off hordes of Gnolls, including a potent Gnoll Shaman. From him they
looted a powerful medallion of unknown origins. All the loot was in
the wagon with the large black monolith, weighing down the group.
</P>

<P>"<I>Sixteen stinking days without sight of the clan. What's taking
them so long?</I>" Ktzorak asked the slave troll next to him. Since
being captured Eliza had enslaved another troll, an Ogre and a mighty
Hulking Brute named Kholden. The Brute was her new personal body
guard while the Ogre and trolls were shackled and pulled the wagon.
She has been studying the medallion for the last few days, only
looking up to check progress or to give brief orders. Occasionally
she would cry out in anger or burst out in laughter unbefitting a
human.</P>

<P>"<I>Jeez Ktzor' you think they haven't tried? They are prolly all
croc meat after Gnergee Weirdboy's attack. I still swear those were
our clansmens' teeth he was wearing. If the oomie hadn't called the
bug cloud he would have lit us up for sure.</I>" Aravardak's voice
trailed off, thinking of the troll who broke free during the fight.
"<I>I can't shake the memory of seeing him burning, Ktzorak. I ain't
going out like that, I ain't I ain't!</I>"</P>

<P>The group pushed on through the evening and into the night,
looking back to the wagon waiting for Eliza to emerge and give the
order to stop for the night. She was quite distracted by her
research, and did not emerge until well past sunset. The usual
night-time routines were put underway and the group settled in for
the night to a good bowl of croc stew. The two trolls were kept apart
to discourage them from resisting her magical bonds. Eliza kept the
Ogre away from Ktzorak as well, knowing that Ktzorak had a keen taste
for ogre meat. </P>

<P>He at night would sometimes still call to him, taunting the
hothead. His name was Bargas Goreskull and supposedly he bore the
mark of an outcast ogre. Ktzorak howled with laughter whenever he
could, insisting that he was outcast for cowardice. Deep down Ktzorak
was just pulling at his magical bonds, straining to let his
beastiality loose and destroy his mortal enemies. Again and again,
Eliza's powers would foil his attempt to break the chains. This night
the moon was new, and in the black Ktzorak would try again.
<HR>
</P>

<P>Brooding at his post not far from Kholden, the troll waited until
he felt Eliza slip into unconsciousness. The bonds weakened and he
looked for the moment to charge the Ogre. He thought it over and
over, thinking how he would have to severe his neck before Kholden
was upon him. He had to have a weapon to fight the brute, it was that
simple. He grumbled and switched his weight in the mud. </P>

<P>Suddenly there was this vibration and a hum rushing through the
camp to the wagon, like an unearthly missile of sound. This followed
by the sound of a bird chirping above the trees and some frogs
leaping into the water, then nothing at all. Ktzorak let out a growl
that stopped short as no sound could be heard, not even the sound of
his own teeth grinding. The leaves moved but made no sound. Nothing..
he was deafened.. or was everyone? </P>

<P>In the rushing confusion the brute, trolls and ogre scrambled
about, clawing at their heads and mouthing words without sounds. Just
as suddenly as the silence had come came the arrows. No one was
spared an arrow but the brute seemed to be the primary target.
Ktzorak pulled the light sheaf arrows from his skin and tossed them
aside. He coughed up a spat of blood and cursed waiting for the wound
to close, looking for any sign of the attackers. Eliza was still
asleep, unaware that anything was happening.</P>

<P>Kholden seemed to pick up scent of the attackers and moved with a
motive, Bargas close behind. Aravardak had dove into the water for
cover and was nowhere to be seen in the black night. Ktzorak watched
for a second to catch a glimpse of the attackers, with no luck. He
rushed to the wagon to get his mace. He glanced in at the sleeping
woman, reaching past her to the mace, stopping to peer at the
medallion. He contemplated crushing her skull, but a stray arrow
distracted him as it hit the wagon. "<I>Would rather torture her
anyway</I>" he snorted to himself.</P>

<P>He rushed to the forefront to examine the combat, and spat. Wood
Elves. He snarled and made a quick count as he picked his target to
chase down. Seven he noted to be providing the fire fight across the
road and possibly more he could not see. Two arrows pierced his
chest, slowing the trolls charge into the brush. He pushed away the
reeds to bear down on his victim, who was making a classic blunder in
swamp land combat: second guessing a native. </P>

<P>Using his size and slippery skin to his advantage he leaped
through the knee-deep water after the elf who dived for a tree,
making a frantic climb to higher ground. True trolls cannot climb
very well but they are tall, and his mace swing caught the elves
lower half in stride. The elf sunk into the mud grasping for his thin
blade, one smash later was with his god again. The other elves
pummeled him with arrows but the trolls thick hide would not let any
strike a true hit. Ktzorak moved around the combat to pin the next
archer by the deep water.
<HR>
</P>

<P>Meanwhile Kholden was playing a a game of attrition and winning.
The agile archers could only fall back fast enough from his charge
long enough to fire once before fleeing without him reaching them. He
hurled rocks at them, but they stepped aside with ease. The elves led
him in a circle into deeper water where they would try to pin him in
a crossfire. Unfortunately for the elves, the large monster seemed to
care not for the thin arrows they filled his fur with. Kholden roared
in the silence and mauled the tree two of the archers had perched in,
ripping it from the ground. One elf landed on his back near Bargas
and the other leaped away in time to the next tree. </P>

<P>Bargas was not handling the combat as well. Unlike the
leather-skinned trolls he was rather vulnerable to arrows and was
trying to keep good cover while hurling rocks as the elves. He was
not fast enough to chase them down, but his stone toss was rather
lethal, crushing one elves head. He was wounded, and disliked the
dancing attack patterns of the wood elves. He tossed a stone at the
elf that fell from the tree, wounding him and then rushed out to
close melee. The elf drew steel and slashed at Bargas, drawing blood
and a faltering step. Bargas still managed to grab the small man kin
and proceeded to hurl him at the ground like a wet rag, stepping on
him. Bargas yelped as he stumbled from the wound, and sought the
roadside slope for cover.</P>

<P>Across the road Ktzorak closed in on the tallest of the archers,
staying low to the water as he fired at the brute. The archer felt
the water ripple and turned to face the troll and then dove into the
water to escape, without luck. Using his webbed feet and fingers
Ktzorak can swim much faster than the armored elf, like all trolls.
He took pleasure in capturing the elf and moved back to land with the
half-drowned archer to deliver a blow to enemy moral. The remaining
two archers he could see were in flight from the brute and stopped to
witness the horror as Ktzorak paid homage to the Shadow Lord by
dismembering the elf and eating him. </P>

<P>Enraged they opened fire, striking the troll well but falling
under the shadow of the brute, who swept them up and crushed them
within his huge hands. The crew looked around for sign of other elves
and then to each other to examine injuries. Ktzorak was wounded
rather badly, but it would all heal soon enough. The brute seemed
only slightly wounded aside from the loss of one eye to an expert
shot. There was no sign of the other troll, and Ktzorak spat at the
cowardice. He moved over to check on the ogre, and to motion to check
on Eliza and the loot.
<HR>
</P>

<P>Just as Bargas and Ktzorak met eye contact a rush of air brought
sound back to the world, and jut as quickly they heard the elven
tongue recite words of magic and they dived for the roadside,
scanning for the hidden spell caster. A crack of thunder boomed and
the ogre toppled, burnt by a dazzling lightning bolt from the night
sky. Smoke came up from his slack maw. A blur of color caught
Ktzorak's attention and he closed range for possible melee. The brute
also turned to face the mage.</P>

<P>For a fleeting moment one could see the elf clearly as he crossed
the road. In black and green silks with a narrow hickory rod he raced
to cover, preparing to cast again. </P>

<P>The thunder woke Eliza and she jumped to attention, bringing to
bear her staff as she rushed to the combat. She started bringing to
mind a spell to counter elven magic.</P>

<P>Ktzorak howled into the night, taunting the elf. "<I>If it isn't
the grand-daddy of all 'dem basket weavers! How many more
thunderbolts can you call, enough for us all?</I>"</P>

<P>The elf responded with a flurry of bright streaks of energy,
pummeling the troll and the surrounding area but failing to silence
the trolls rhyme. Ktzorak wailed with pain and then laughed again,
snorting in a fever of pain and blood lust. He charged the mage, who
was darting away from the brute as well. The beast inside was free at
last, and Ktzorak was gaining ground on his prey. The mage darted to
and fro but could not evade the two huge attackers for long.</P>

<P>The Elf turned to cast again, reciting the words of power to call
a wall of fire. Ktzorak slid through the mud trying to stop from
falling into the flame, and dove for the water. His legs caught on
fire and he snarled incomprehensively as he rolled into the water,
half dead. Kholden's momentum drove him through the wall of fire, and
the brute roared in agony as his fur caught fire. The walking inferno
stumbled into the deep marsh to put out his fur and died face down,
charred to the bone.</P>

<P>Just then Eliza's summoning brought forth her vines at the mage's
feet, entangling him and wrapping him up in a living tomb. The mage
quickly started to cast a spell to counter the vines with a chill
blast from his rod, and engaged Eliza in a struggle to keep him
entangled. She strained to keep the vines alive as he murmured the
words that would freeze them at the roots and set him free.</P>

<P>The enchantress and the elven wizard each strained to maintain
power over the other's spell, and each was prying for the breaking
moment that would mean victory or death. Slowly Eliza began to loose
her grip on her staff and her eyes rolled into her head as she weakly
chanted the spells words, keeping the vines alive. Blood ran from her
ears and she collapsed to the ground, too wasted by the combat with
the superior elf. </P>

<P>"Well then, what a pity. You should have spent more time
practicing how to breath when casting m'lady. You've fainted dead
away from your own lack of skill" the elf murmured to the motionless
woman, as he cast away the last blackened vine. Just as he stepped to
survey the combat field something grabbed at his leg: Bargas.</P>

<P>The ogre crawled through the mud on his last breath and grasped at
the mage, clenching his fist closed around the mage's legs and
dropping him to the ground. A quick word of power and the ogre died,
but kept a death grip on the elf. His keen ears could have heard
Ktzorak's mace-swing a half-mile away. Too bad it was much closer
than that.</P>

<P>Ktzorak brought the enchantress back to the wagon and gathered the
loot from the elf party. He would need her alive while his burn
wounds healed so he could survive the travel back home. They would
have to make a deal, cause she would die here alone too.</P>
