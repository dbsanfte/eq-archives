<p><font color="#3333FF">Day 1:</font> <font color="#3333FF">Adventures
in Ak'Anon</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">I thanked my teacher and left the Library MechnaMagika
for the last time as an apprentice. For two years</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">I had studied with and done endless chores for
Mistress Ulmcaller.&nbsp; Now my free apprenticeship was over and my whole
life ahead of me.&nbsp; Having little money, no family (who wanted to talk
to me anyway) and no idea what to do with my life I decided to sit and
think. Being naturally inclined to climb (a trait unusual in Gnomish kind)
and always looking for higher ground I eventually found myself atop the
smokestack for the great Forge of Defiance.</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF"><b><a href="hispot1.jpg">Here I am</a></b> atop
the smokestack, those are tents with merchants in them down below. The
Forge is where the Gemchoppers, the master Warriors of my people get all
their weapons from, it is said to contain Enchanted Anvils.</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">Not afraid of heights, I decide to get real close
to the <b><a href="longwydn.jpg">edge</a></b>, and stare off at the ground
far away. Unfortunately, the smoke from the Forge interrupts my thoughts
and I decide to head to the surface, I shall need income and there is copper
to be made controlling the area's pest problems.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font color="#3333FF">As I pass by the Ink Sea&nbsp; I stop and stare
out across it at knowing that soon I will be leaving my homeland.</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">I want to fix the image of the great Homeland
of the Mighty Gnomish people in my mind, so that I might always remember
home throughout my long journeys. So here is the <b><a href="cavelake.jpg">Great
Ink Sea</a></b> with the Kings Castle in the Center.</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">Finally I reach the surface world and after adjusting
to the light (How you surface dwellers stand the brightness all day I will
never know) I cast my very <b><a href="zbenspel.jpg">first spell</a></b>.
Tada!</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">I spend the day practicing and exploring the entryway
and shops of Ak'Anon, it is surely the finest city in the whole world.</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">Once I see a Gnome running for his life chased
by a whole group of smelly Kobalds. He reaches the Guards and collapses
and the Guards spring into action swiftly dispatching the Kobalds. I have
no spells to aid the fallen brother and he wears the robes of a Magician
so I stand to the side and watch. Eventually he rises and turns back toward
the valley of the Kobalds. I realize that I too must learn to hunt, must
if I am to afford new spells and books and to learn the art of Enchantment.
Yet the beasts of the Valley seem to strong for me? How will I succeed?&nbsp;
Still, it is late and the answer to that question can wait, a test for
tomorrow.</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">Not having any copper for a hostel,&nbsp; I climb
the hills over the entrance and bed down for the night near a steampipe
knowing it will keep me warm. Tomorrow will be an interesting and possibly
unpleasant day.</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">Until next time... Watch out for those smelly
Trolls and Ogres (i.e. all of them) and be well....</font>
