<p>In Toxullia Forest there are 2 named Necromancers that are not part of the Necromancer
Guild. One of them is named Elial Brook, he is about 8-10th level Necromancer
approximately. He is located along the beach in Toxullia forest.&nbsp; near the pier that
leads to Kerra Isle. Killing him gives you his bones..everytime..give his bones to
Magician Guild Leader in the palace gives you faction, exp and some money, I killed him
from 8th-10th soloing with my pet. The other Necromancer in the forest is in the way back
of the forest and travels between the skeleton temple there, and the bridge in the middle
of Tox. His name is Taligrar Eklorian, he is extremely higher level then Elial Brook, I'd
say maybe mid 20's to low 30's, I saw him kill a Lvl 21 Paladin&nbsp; with no trouble. He
always has a pet, and if you attack him near skeletons they will attack you as well.
Killing Elial Brook so many times has now made me KOS with the Necromancer Guild in
Toxullia Forest, walk past there and I'm dead. I believe all Necromancers drop bones which
may be returned to the Magician Guild Leader for money and exp and faction. Another quest
I know of&nbsp; for Necromancers which I don't know who to give it to except its one of
the&nbsp; necromancers in the guild., is Rungupp's head quest. Rungupp is a troll &nbsp;
shaman, around ...10th level I'd say...maybe less. He always shouts when he &nbsp; spawns,
All Erudites will fall before the might of Rungupp. Killing him you &nbsp; get a faction
change, I think with Frogloks of Guk, which would be good for a &nbsp; Paladin who wants
GhoulBane as I believe they are the ones who give the &nbsp; ghoulbane quest. His head can
be given to one of the necromancers in the guildbuilding. Another quest I know of, which I
have done is a quest that&nbsp; starts in Erudin Library, you must buy a bottle of
Innoruk's Kiss of Death,&nbsp; for the bookworm at the topfloor of the library next to the
one who sells,&nbsp; Magician Summon spells. Give her Innoruks Kiss, she'll give you a
bottle of&nbsp; Erud's Tonic. Get on the boat to Qeynos, go to North Qeynos, and near
the&nbsp; building Crows, which I believe is near a body of water that goes to the&nbsp;
Aqueducts and you can find a Erudite NPC named Moodoro Finharn I believe,&nbsp; give him
the tonic to recieve faction and some money and exp. There is&nbsp; another quest
involving him and his sister Nolusia Finharn who is a Enchanter&nbsp; in Erudin, but my
faction is too low with her for her to tell me anything. &nbsp; But I believe it has
something to do with pieces of a grimoire. <br>

<p>Another Erudin Quest I completed while buying spells, its a newbie quest and yields The
Gloves of the Gatecaller which are 5.5 Weight and 3 AC, they look black when you put them
on. You have to go into Erudin Palace and go to the top floor of the Magician Guild where
the Guildmaster is, in front of him is another Magician, talk to him, tell him the power
of the gatecallers is summoning, then you have to give him 2 summoned food and 2 summoned
daggers and he will give you the gloves, I think you need to have semi good faction with
the gatecallers which isn't hard to get. I had the gloves, ditched them cause they were
too heavy..but they look cool.<br>
