<P><FONT SIZE="+2">Structure</FONT></P>

<P>In the Fraterni Lux, the individual is the most integral part of
our existence. Therefore our "government" is structured in a way that
provides maximum control of the group in the hands of its members
while establishing a semblance of organization and direction. We
operate in a very democratic fashion, where virtually all major
decisions are determined by a majority vote. Any important guild
decisions will almost always be ratified and voted upon by ever
member within the group, so as to ensure that the guild is maintained
in a manner that suits its members and not the wishes of some power
mongers. However, we realize the need for some sort of "leader"
figures, to make sure that things run smoothly. Therefore, the
Fraterni Lux has two "coordinators", who do just that, coordinate.
They will be in charge of organizing various activities, proposing
plans to the guild, running the web page, and many other guild
responsibilities essential for our survival. We also realize that as
we grow in numbers, certain responsibilities will need to be
delegated to members in order to ensure effective maintenance of a
large group. Therefore, when the game finally arrives, certain
individuals will be asked to perform specific roles, such as command
of a squadron. Once again, the creation of any new positions and
election of members to those posts will be voted upon by the entire
guild. For now, our emphasis is on organization and we will not even
consider creating additional ranks or a hierarchy until the final
release or perhaps the beta, when such an organizational system
becomes necessary. Thus, our structure will remain as democratic and
decentralized as possible, so that this guild will be run by its
members, as it always should be.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Ranks</FONT></P>

<P>In other guilds, ranks are given out usually under favoritism or
as a measure of the influence that person has in the group. In the
Fraterni Lux, we define ranks differently. A rank in our group is the
measure of time, work, and effort the particular member shows. It is
not a status privilege, but an added responsibility and a recognition
of that person's dedication to the guild. As many may know from
experience, true leadership roles are neither fun nor prestigious, as
they require a great deal of time from the person's daily life and
only the most enthusiastic and capable members receive such demanding
roles. The group creates any ranks, and candidates elected to such
posts will be selected based on their merit and ability to perform
their assigned duty. No one with rank is allowed to bark orders or
impose their will on others. Rather, members will not follow them out
of robotic obedience, but out of respect for that person's ability
and qualifications for that rank. In fact, we won't even institute a
hierarchy or ranking system till the final or beta or when the need
arises for us to become more articulate and organized.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Coordinators</FONT></P>

<P>There will be two coordinators in the Fraterni Lux. Their duties
include representing the guild in diplomatic affairs, general
maintenance of guild policies, organization and planning, and the
ability to recruit or dismiss members. In addition, coordinators have
the final say in matters that can't be resolved through a democratic
process. The coordinators in no way assume dictatorial powers, but
simply exist to make sure the guild functions properly. The current
coordinators are Zealot and Ian Ash.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The Fraterni Lux has created no other ranks nor will there be any
until the need arises. Rank and such are not our main focus, and
newly created posts will be decided upon by the guild. The last thing
we want to become is a bureaucracy and we will concentrate on
friendship and family rather than promotions.</P>
