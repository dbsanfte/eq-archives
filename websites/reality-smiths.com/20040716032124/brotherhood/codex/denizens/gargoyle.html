Carved from stone and then animated by powerful magic,
the gargoyle is a fearsome foe indeed. Often mistaken
for statues until it's too late, gargoyles will strike
suddenly. Their skin being virtually impenetrable,
combined with their ability to fly, makes them almost
impossible to damage much less hit at all.
