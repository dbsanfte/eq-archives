Skulking Brute. Burrowing through the very crust of
Norrath in search of prey, the Skulking Brute is a
creature of unrelenting hunger. Many brave adventurers
have fallen beneath a Brute's onslaught of hammering
fists and gnashing teeth. From where the Skulking
Brutes originate is unknown but rumors abound. Some
say they are the creation of a mad Erudite wizard
while others claim they were made by Brell Serilis
himself. On one point all can agree: it is best to
be where a Skulking Brute isn't.
