Step carefully in the swamps of Norrath for they are the
domain of the Frogloks. Decades of slavery and persecution
have hardened these once timid amphibious creatures into
fierce guerrilla warriors. Many Troll war parties have
fallen to swift and vicious Froglok ambushes. However, if
treated with respect and well being, the Frogloks can be
the greatest ally an adventurer can have while traveling
the dangerous swamplands of Norrath.
