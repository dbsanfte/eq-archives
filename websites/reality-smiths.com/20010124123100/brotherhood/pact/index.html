<TABLE WIDTH="50%"><TR><TD>
Long ago, when Erud led his followers from the great old port
city of Qeynos, the seeds for our creation were sowed.  Not
content with the aeons long drudgery of human existance, a
few brave souls stood forth to challenge the old and stagnant
ways of civilization.  Reviled by the lords of men, Erud and
his people fled to the land of Odus, where a new city of
learning and progress was founded.  For many years, all
seemed well in the new land -- the chains of slavery were
cloven asunder, and mankind was free to learn the secrets
of creation.
<BR><BR>
Alas, too happily did the people of Erudin pursue their
goals of enlightenment -- for as they worked to forge a
new understanding of man and his place in the cosmos,
tragedy crept cravenly into the hearts of many.  The
men and women too small-minded or old and powerful to
accept continuing new truths and their fruits of discovery
turned to greater and greater introspective contemplation
of the new society.  With the passing of a single
generation, the persecution and slavery of old Antonica
had been all but forgotten. A new shroud of distrust
and stagnation settled over the greatest city of men,
Erudin.  As this miasma of foolishness and greed began
to absorb the people of Erudin, one man stood valiantly
to oppose the creeping armies of the stupid -- Miragul
the Mighty.  Close within his councils were a growing
group of powerful dweomercraefters and archmages, as
well as their faithful apprentices and journeymen.
<BR><BR>
In public council, Miragul alone stood against the new
laws limiting research and discovery.  For a time, he
held back the tide of darkness gathering at the horizon,
and his vision engendered a new renaissance of science
and metaphysics.  All too soon, however, his enemies
mass their strength and worked their evil wiles upon
the men of the city.  With Erud himself long dead, the
new leaders of the city-state of Erudin were a council
of the rich and landed -- inheriting their wealth, just
as the oppressive lords of old Qeynos in Antonica.
In a single fell swoop, these lords of decadence killed
many of the valiant men and women close to Miragul.
Fearing for their lives, the remainder of Miragul's
close circle of companions fled for their lives.
<BR><BR>
A time of darkness descended upon Erudin, where the
only light was that creeping from behind the sooty
doors of myriad pleasure halls and places of
debauchery.  The scattered remnants of Miragul's
people were hunted down and slaughtered mercilessly
as they could be found.  In time, however, the people
of Erudin tired of seeking the few remaining companions
and returned to their sport in the city.  Those of
Miragul's companions who survived began to gather
with other discontented peoples and started a new
city in the far south of Odus.
<BR><BR>
In this new city, Paineel, all things were free to
be researched and discovered.  Still fearing for their
lives, the people of Paineel took great pains to
deflect any attention from their new lives and,
as such, greatly reduced the speed of their researches.
In this time, Miragul, who had been presumed lost
during the purges of Erudin, once again returned to
his people in Paineel.  There was much rejoicing,
and those closest to his counsels reforged their
companionship anew.  This new circle of the great
minds of man was named the Brotherhood.  The sole
purpose of this Brotherhood was to seek out and
explore the mysteries of the cosmos.  Much progress
was made, with individuals venturing all over the known
world, gathering artefacts and tomes to absorb and
duplicate. Miragul himself was the Grand Hierarch
and Archivist of the Order.
<BR><BR>
In time, all good things come to an end.  Erudin,
still a great city, but reeking of corruption, had
once again gained knowledge of the peoples of
Paineel.  Frenzied with wrath, the lords of Erudin
called holy jihad upon the people of Paineel and
labelled them unholy heretics.  Rendered grim by this
new treachery, the people of Paineel prepared for
war -- intending to obliterate their implacable foes
once and for all.
<BR><BR>
The wars between Paineel and Erudin were of such a
scale that the world has never seen them before or
since.  To this day, they rage on, alternately
crushing one side or the other, but never enough
for a definitive victory.  Long ago, however,
Miragul and his Brotherhood departed both places,
moving out into the world to seek their fortune.
The Brothers and Sisters of the Order wandered the
world in search of knowledge.  It was with horror
that the news of Miragul's disappearance was
circulated amongst the thaumaturges of the Order.
Eventually, it was gleaned that he had been trapped
in an experiment gone horribly wrong.  Since that
time, many of the Brotherhood have sought out his
final resting place to undo the terrible mistake,
but Miragul remains trapped to this day.
<BR><BR>
The Pact of Miragul is the Oath that every member
of the Brotherhood takes upon Initiation.  The
Oathtaker solemnly swears to make the search for
Ultimate Enlightenment their one and only goal.
Subsequently, the Acting Grand Hierarch charges
the new initiate with the duty of saving the
true Grand Hierarch, Miragul himself.
