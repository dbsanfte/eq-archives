Of the myriad of giants that dwell in Norrath,
Sand Giants are perhaps the most curious. They, unlike
other giant-kin, are nomadic and dwell almost always in
the desert or other dry and dusty locales. And while they
are not overtly evil in their nature (one would never
find Sand Giants raiding towns or other civilized areas),
they are fiercely xenophobic. Their distrust of other
races borders on the paranoid and many adventurers have
sealed their fates in death by accidentally coming across
a Sand Giant settlement while exploring. The fact that
these settlements move and could be anywhere makes desert
questing all the more perilous.
