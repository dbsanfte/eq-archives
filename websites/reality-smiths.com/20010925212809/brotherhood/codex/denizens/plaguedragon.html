Plague Dragon. The stench of rot surrounds the lair of a
Plague Dragon and woe to any who stumble upon one uninvited.
Pray that the dragon dissects you with talons and teeth, for
if you are exposed to its breath your demise will be slow and
excruciatingly painful. Your flesh will blacken and
blister until it slides free from your bones. Yes, you'll
find yourself wishing for a quick death by claw or fang.
