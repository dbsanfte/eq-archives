Sharing the Plane of Sky with the great dragons and
drakes, the djinn are mages of immense power. But
while they are both intelligent and strong willed,
they all possess an unexplained and curious weakness;
experienced wizards and sorcerers of Norrath have been
known to summon them from their native plane and
imprison them in sealed rooms and smaller devices.
Some legends speak of fantastic rewards for those
who release a djinn, yet others speak of the
violent deaths of those who unleash them.
