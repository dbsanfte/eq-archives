Goblins are nasty scavengers. Everything they
own or work with they either discovered or stole from
somebody. Because of their lack of ingenuity, goblins are
either found raiding towns, or in their lairs, which are
typically primitive villages or damp natural caves. A
solitary goblin is rarely a threat to even the most
novice warrior, but their nature is to form clans and
strike in groups. Wise adventurers, wary of that fact,
avoid goblin settlements unless their numbers are also
great.
