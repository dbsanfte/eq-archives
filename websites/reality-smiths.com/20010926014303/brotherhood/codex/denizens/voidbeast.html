Void Beast. If this creature even exists, most would argue
it lives between the Planes, in the Great Void, leaving
this place only to hunt. But since no mortal can survive
that void, the location of the beast's lair must remain
unproven. Legend says the magical creature teleports to
its prey at night, stinging and poisoning with its
tentacles. The victim, still able to slowly move, becomes
then the toy of this feline monster, and eventually, of
course, its meal.
