Several of these small, burly, creatures have been
spotted deep in the caverns beneath Kaladim, lurking
about in the shadows, and stalking the mining crews.
Many a Dwarven Miner's disappearance has been
attributed to these foul beings, whose only fear seems
to be bright light. Rumor has it that these creatures
may actually be Dwarves -- perhaps even the missing
Miners -- that were bitten by strange bats that live
in the deep mines and caverns, inflicting their
victims with the curse of Lycanthropy. Or, maybe
the sharp claws and long, dripping, fangs of the
Werebats themselves are responsible for this curse.
