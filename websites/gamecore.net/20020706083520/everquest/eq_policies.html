<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Lost Order of Akalabeth
  is a mature, multiple-game online community. Freejack, Brimstone, Ralineth,
  Ghoti,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Brewman, Tasslehof, Zari,
  Carnifex and Avenger founded LOA in 1997. Guild members are held to a very
  strict and high<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>level of honor,
  maturity, and dedication to guild, members and other players. Above all, we
  adhere to our motto,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>&quot;Friendship
  Transcending Worlds&quot;.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">LOA is at present composed
  of three chapters, one for each of the main games we are involved with; Ultima
  Online,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Everquest, and Asheron's Call.
  In Everquest, we play on the Veeshan server. If you wish to join us, we do
  require that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>you also play on Veeshan.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">LOA is devoted to
  role-playing and to ensuring the maximum enjoyment of EverQuest for as many
  players as possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We strive to
  uphold the maturity and professionalism of our guild, both in role-playing and
  through our behavior with<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>fellow
  players. We are a guild firmly rooted in the concept of diversity for all that
  the term implies. We encourage our<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>members
  to pursue any race or class so long as they continue to be fair and honorable
  players, and to respect fellow<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>guilds
  and players.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you join the Lost Order
  of Akalabeth, you will be immersed in a tradition of friendship, honor,
  dedication and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>motivation. We truly
  enjoy the spirit of camaraderie that has grown up among us over the years,
  placing this above all<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>else. If you

  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All LOA chapters hold
  weekly on-line meetings in IRC (a client can be found at <a href="http://www.mirc.com">www.mirc.com</a>).
  Our public chat room is #Akalabeth and is used to discuss all guild-wide
  issues, meet new friends, hang out with old friends, and more. We normally
  have about 20 to 40 members online at any given time.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For our Wednesday night
  meetings (10 PM Eastern), we have a private room setup named #Hall_of_Akalabeth.
  While in this<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>room, you must be granted
  permission to speak on a topic; this helps minimize channel traffic. ANY
  member can approach the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>podium and
  voice their thoughts, concerns, opinions, etc, simply private message the
  person hosting the meeting for permission to speak.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Weekly EQ faction meetings
  are held in room #loa-eq, which is not restricted-access but may be moderated.
  If you have topics or ideas that you would like to see discussed in our
  meetings, send them to EQ Agenda<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>(eqagenda@lostorder.com).</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sometimes our chapter
  leaders are not able to make it to a meeting. When this happens, the senior
  member at each meeting<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>will be required
  to host that meeting to the best of their ability.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you are unsure about
  using IRC or registering your nickname under MYSTICAL.net, simply contact one
  of our members, or<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>post a question on

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000080"><b>The Application Process:</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Before you become an
  initiate of this guild, many things must first take place. We need you to fill
  out the application<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>form for our
  review. After that, you should meet up and party with members of the Order in
  game. This will give our members a chance to get to know and get comfortable
  with you and your play styles.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We look for several
  characteristics in a person AND his online persona. To name just a few, we
  seek those who are<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>loyal, dedicated,
  honorable, responsible, professional, caring, brave, honest, giving, and this
  list goes on and on. If you<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>believe
  in these things, you are one step ahead of becoming a member in our Order.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are three phases in
  the application process, Petitioner, Initiate and Commoner. The Petitioner
  phase lasts 7 days. In order to progress to the Initiate phase, you must
  attain three (3) positive vouches. These vouches usually come from members
  reviewing your application, so please be sure to take some time and effort
  when filling out your application.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Initiate Phase lasts
  approximately 15 days. You must receive at least six (6) positive vouches
  from people different than those who vouched for you in the Petitioner phase.
  If you are unsuccessful in receiving six positive vouches, you will go
  through another 15 day Initiate period, where you must again receive six
  positive vouches. When in IRC, append [INIT] to your nick.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Commoner Phase lasts
  approximately 30 days. You must receive at least eight (8) +1 votes during the
  three day voting period in order to be promoted to a full member. The voting
  for the Commoner phase occurs on the 14<sup>th</sup>, 15<sup>th</sup>, and 16<sup>th</sup>,
  of every month. If, because of the time you applied, you miss the mid-month
  voting period you will be voted on during the next voting period. The Commoner
  Phase is special in that you will be, for all intents and purposes, admitted
  to the guild short of gaining full membership privileges. You will be tagged
  in game. When in IRC, append [CMNR] to your nick.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you are IN game often,
  follow the guild policies, and strive to better the entire guild, you will
  find that the rewards are sweeter than you could have ever imagined. By giving
  your time and loyalty to our Order, you will find that our members will always
  be there for you, through thick and thin. If you do not put forth a strong
  effort to participate, we will drop you from the applicant process, and say
  goodbye to you. The key to this stage is getting to know our members, and
  striving to show them that you are a team player. Also, make sure that you ask
  them to report your actions and deeds to the High Council and general
  membership - this helps us keep track of your good faith and participation.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We wish you good luck,
  friend! Maybe in time, you too will wear the title of the Lost Order
  Akalabeth. Until that day, I fare thee<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>well.</font></p>

<P><FONT color=#000080 face=Verdana size=-1><B>Policy on Guard 
Killing:</B></FONT></P>
<blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In general, the LOA does
  not condone <b>repeated killing of static &quot;Guard&quot; NPC's who are
  placed in low- and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></b><b>mid-level
  zones for the protection of other players (&quot;guard camping&quot;)</b>.
  This practice is unfair to low-level<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>characters
  who rely on the guards to provide a &quot;safe spot&quot; to rest and
  meditate, as well as a spot for them to retreat<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
  </span>to when they pull more combatants then they can safely handle (ie, a
  &quot;train&quot;). It is our opinion that Norrath holds<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
  </span>plenty of options for high-level characters to gain wealth and
  experience without endangering the lives of others.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Examples of NPC's covered
  under this policy would include (but not be limited to) the Gnome, Dwarven,
  Barbarian,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Erudite, Halfling, Troll,
  Ogre, and Dark Elf guards in their respective newbie zones, High and Wood Elf
  guards in Greater<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Feydark, Human Guards
  in the Freeport, Queynos, and High Pass zones, as well as Human Guards at the
  outposts in the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Commonlands and the
  Karanas.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Given that guards may be
  encountered anywhere within a zone, it should be stated that we would never
  ask a member<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>to not act in their own
  self-defense. If a guard must be killed to save the life of a guildmate or
  friend, so be it. It is the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>intentional
  and repeated &quot;camping&quot; of guards, especially those with a static
  &quot;spawn point&quot;, which we find objectionable.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<P><FONT color=#000080 face=Verdana size=-1><B>Policy on Player 
Killing:</B></FONT></P>
<blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So long as it is within
  your character’s profile to be a murderer, social outcast, etc., and so long
  as you strive to uphold<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>the
  role-playing elements of our guild and EverQuest, you may do whatever you see
  fit within the game. Since EQ has a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>PK-switch,

  <p><FONT color=#800000 face=Verdana size=-1>First I'd like to clarify and 
  repeat the looting system that I think is fairest to use when we have a 
  full-LOA group. With mixed guild groups, the system is commonly /Rand 100 for 
  each item and nobody gets 2 items until everyone has at least one. A much 
  better system can be used with a full LOA group. When the group gets a magical 
  item, they run through a series of quick questions in order. And it can be 
  done very quickly...</FONT>
  </p>
  <P><FONT color=#800000 face=Verdana size=-1>First of all, ignore issues of 
  rarity, ignore secondary characters and everyone must get 1 item before 
  anybody gets 2.</FONT></P>

    face=Verdana size=-1> Does a party member deserve this item without

    realised they have not gotten anything in months... This could include 
    giving the item to someone for their secondary or giving it to somebody who 
    is not even in the group. This only works with a unanimous agreement and 
    anyone can nominate <I>another player</I> as being deserving. Often it is 
    obvious that someone is desperate for a particular item, make their day by 
    just giving it to them. </FONT></LI></UL>

    is meant for the character in the group who got the item and that character 
    does not already have a better item. If multiple people in the group fall 
    into this category, we randomly roll /rand 1 100 to see who gets it.</FONT>

  <P><FONT color=#800000 face=Verdana size=-1>Ok, the next element is not a 
  series of rules, but some honor guidelines.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT color=#800000 face=Verdana size=-1>First of all, if you have gotten 
  an item in a group, do not enter random rolls until you are fairly sure that 
  everyone else in the group has gotten an item as well, this could be two days 
  later... If you want an item and can wear it, but somebody else REALLY can use 
  it better, let them have it (a typical example could be a cleric and a warrior 
  both wanting a Thick Banded Belt, it would be nice of the cleric to just let 
  the Warrior have the belt).</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT color=#800000 face=Verdana size=-1>Finally, if somebody has already 
  gotten their loot for this "round" but some new item comes up that they are 
  the only one to need, they can ask the group to /rand their earlier item in 
  exchange for being given the new one. This assumes nobody else wants the item 
  under scenario 2. For example, imagine a group of 3 people, Warrior, Cleric, 
  Druid. Only the Warrior has gotten something so far under scenario 3 (it's for 
  trade/sale). They then find an item that ONLY the warrior wants under scenario 
  2. He asks if he can take the new item and the others can /rand his original 
  item between them. No problem you say, what if the first item was a crap monk 
  item but the new one is a Flowing Black Silk Sash... The other two could wear 
  or use that sash for an incredible trade and by the basic rule of "nobody gets 
  two items until everyone gets one", the warrior is theoretically eliminated 
  from the roll. It can get iffy but don't let your greed get the better of 
  you.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT color=#800000 face=Verdana size=-1>Basically, the idea is to try to 
  make sure that everyone gets something, and preferably something they want to 
  use themselves. But be generous and allow people to switch a scenario 3 item 
  for a new scenario 2 item if nobody else wants that new item under scenario 2. 
  Does this make sense? All this relies on YOU to be generous and to consider 
  your friends needs, it shouldn't be too hard... Some items are just amazing: 
  Ysehkas, Thick Banded Belts, FBSS etc. To be honorable, all those who fall 
  under scenario 2 could have the option of joining the random roll and if they 
  win, giving any previously won items back to the group to be 
  redistributed.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT color=#800000 face=Verdana size=-1>One other point, if you get an 
  item, but then trade that item away, you should NOT enter the roll for the 
  next one the group gets under scenario 2. So lets say a tank gets a FBSS one 
  day and trades it for two swords and a shield, they should not enter the roll 
  for another FBSS until everyone else who can wear it in the group has gotten 
  one. These are not rules but suggestions. The scenario 1-4 rules can be broken 
  if people agree unanimously. Its not worth ruining someone elses day by being 
  greedy... If you want an item for a secondary character, I'm afraid you'll 
  have to wait to get it under scenarios 1, 3 or 4. </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
