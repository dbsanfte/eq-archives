<BR><BR>This site was made possible with the help of Jaellman Renowned Holy Crusader of the now defunct Unrestful Knights.
<BR>Many thanks to all those on the EQ.castersrealm forums and an Extra Heaping Helping of thanks to Citra who's help has been incredible!
<BR><BR>UPDATE:  Please bear with me as I update the site, I've got a lot of info to add and I hope you'll all find it useful!

<P><B>Jeb Lumsed</B> - Burning Woods (-1200 -4000)</P>
Jeb Lumsed currently does not give you a sack even though he offers to give you one.  You may get "An Enchanter's Bag" from any of the Masters of Enchantment: Modani, Mizzle, Nadia, or Polzin.
<BR><BR>You: 'Are you Jeb Lumsed?'
<BR>A sarnak imitator: 'Yes I am. Use your most enlightened magic to seek the truth of what is around you. When that is done, you will know what you seek.
<BR><BR>You give the "<A href=stofo.html>Copy of Notes</A>" to Jeb Lumsed.
<BR>A sarnak imitator: 'I see that you have what I was waiting for. Stofo does do excellent work. It seems that you are to start on a long journey. Take this seal and it will guide you on your next step. Seek out the masters of enchantment. In time we will craft the Serpent for you. When you have collected the four parts of the staff, you must combine them in a bundle for me. If you need a sack, just let me know.'
<BR>You receive a coin called 'jeb's seal'
<BR><BR>Jeb's Seal
<BR><img src=images/seal.jpg alt="Jeb's Seal" width="310" height="122">
<BR><BR>You: 'What serpent?'
<BR>A sarnak imitator: 'The first truly powerful enchanter, Krilan Pedin, crafted the Serpent years ago. He trained his students to carry on the trade in a five-step process. Each student then became a master and chose one of their own students to pass the legacy on to. Four others and I, myself, are current practitioners of the crafting. 
<BR><BR>You: 'Who are the four other masters?'
<BR>A sarnak imitator: 'The masters are enchanters who have reached the plateau of understanding. Their names are Modani Qu'Loni, Mizzle Gepple, Nadia Starfeast, and Polzin Mrid. All are master crafters in their own right.
<BR><BR>You: 'Who is <a href=modani.html>modani</A>?'
<BR>A sarnak imitator: 'Modani is a master of illusions. You should seek him out first. Keep a careful eye out for him - he is never in his true form. The last time I spoke to him, he seemed very excited about his voyage to the elven outpost. You may or may not find more clues about his location there. 
<BR><BR>You: 'Who is <a href=mizzle.html>mizzle</A>?'
<BR>A sarnak imitator: 'Mizzle is a gnome who has mastered the use of enlightened magic. Go to him once you have spoken to Modani. Mizzle is not one to travel, so you should not have to look far from his home to find him. 
<BR><BR>You: 'Who is <A href=nadia.html>Nadia</A>?'
<BR>A sarnak imitator: 'The mistress of charm, Nadia is very beautiful. She, too, traveled with her relatives to the new land. I just recently received a letter from her. She says more and more pilgrims and explorers are arriving every day, and that the outpost is well defended now.
<BR><BR>You: 'Who is <A href=polzin.html>Polzin</A>?'
<BR>A sarnak imitator: 'Master of the Phantasms - he is the last one you will seek out. Hmm...Polzin is native to Erudin, however, after the incident near Paineel, no one has heard from him. I hope that he is well.
<BR><BR>You put the 1st Piece of Staff into an Enchanter's Bag.
<BR>You put the 2nd Piece of Staff into an Enchanter's Bag.
<BR>You put the 3rd Piece of Staff into an Enchanter's Bag.
<BR>You put the 4th Piece of Staff into an Enchanter's Bag.
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0000BB">You have fashioned the items together to create something new!</FONT>
<BR>You receive a Bundle of Staves.
<BR><BR>A Bundle of Staves.

<BR><BR>You hand Jeb Lumsed a Bundle of Staves.
<BR>A sarnak imitator: 'The path you trod was long and hard. Now you are worthy to bear the Serpent. Use it well.'
<BR>Your faction with TrueSpirits has increased!
<BR>You receive a Staff of the Serpent.
<BR><FONT color=#bbbb00>You gain experience!!</FONT>
