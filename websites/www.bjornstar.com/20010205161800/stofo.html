You: 'hail Stofo Olan'
<BR>Stofo Olan: 'Good day, I have discovered something truly wonderful! If I only had the materials required so I can copy my notes and send them to my teacher.'
<BR><BR>You: 'what materials?'
<BR>Stofo Olan: 'The materials I need are a mechanical pen, ink of the dark, and white paper. Bring me those and I will give you a copy of this information.'
<BR><BR>You: 'who is your teacher?'
<BR>Stofo Olan: 'My teacher is Jeb Lumsed. He was last seen in the regions of the newly discovered lands. If you wish to find him that is where you must seek him out.'

<BR>Stofo Olan: 'Dark illusions, thievery, and the plague of the living will guide you. These are the only hints I can provide. Safe travels and may you be protected from all maladies.'
<BR><BR>You: 'where is the <a href=stofo.html#pen>mechanical pen</A>?'
<BR>Stofo Olan: 'The answer you seek is in your question. If you are unable to figure it out, then perhaps you are not ready to travel along this path.'
<BR><BR>You: 'what is the <a href=stofo.html#pap>White paper</A>?'
<BR>Stofo Olan: 'It may seem like ordinary paper at first. However, this paper was enchanted by a friend of mine. This paper was given to a lass in the Karanas to help with her writings. The paper will guide her hands and draw forth the thoughts in her mind. I no longer have any and I have not had contact with my friend in some time. Search them out.'
<BR><BR>You: 'What did you discover?'
<BR>Stofo Olan: 'I was researching a new spell, and discovered new information concerning the history of the Serpent.'

<BR><BR>You: 'What do you know about a mechanical pen?' <BR>Rilgor Plegnog says 'Why do you want one of those contraptions. You will spend more time repairing it then you will writing with it. But if you insist on getting one, you are going to have to do a small favor.' 
<BR>Rilgor Plegnog tugs at your robe and grins evilly. Mighty nice outfit you have there. Sure beats these drab robes us three are wearing. Hmm...my favorite color is purple, in fact a shiny metallic purple would do nicely. How bad did you want that pen?'

<BR><BR>You turn in the Paper and Quill
