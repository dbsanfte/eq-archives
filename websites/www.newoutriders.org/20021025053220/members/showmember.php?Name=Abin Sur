King Abward and Queen Abina named their first child Abin. The Mist Shrouded Isles were inhabited by a race of giant elves that spent much of their time in quiet meditation. King Abward knew the responsibilities his eldest son would one-day face, and saw to it that the lad received training in a wide range of arts. The young Abin learned magic and history, swordplay and literature from the ancient giant elf Masters. The young Sur grew strong in body and mind.<br><br>One day, a young man peered out into the mists surrounding the islands. He knew there were seas and sun that called to him out beyond the gloom. Abin yearned to travel and experience the other lands he had learned about. Fortunately, the sagely king saw wisdom in this and granted Abin permission to travel with "Mad" Uncle Ludwig. (Ludwig received the title "Mad" because of his fondness for travel and exploration.) Ludwig Sur was the merchant of the family and served the crown as an ambassador to many lands. Setting sail with Uncle Ludwig and his cousins Yaz and Big, Abin looked forward to exploring the many worlds the Sailing Ships of Sur could travel.<br><br>Years passed and Abin traveled many lands, learning the ways of many peoples and having many adventures. One day Ludwig announced they would soon return to The Mist Shrouded Isles. Abin chose to stay behind in that last port of call. As he watched the ships sail away, he thought of the irony of this place's name, Port Llast Harbor. The world of NeverWinter spread out before him.<br><br>It was in NeverWinter that Abin first met members of an unusual group of people known as the New OutRiders. Abin learned the ways of this guild, hunting and socializing with its members. He felt the mission of the guild was a noble one and was granted admission to the guild. The fun and friendship of the guild made Abin feel quite at home. Then one day, The Greed grew and NeverWinter fell. Yaz and Big Sur, having heard of The Fall, sailed a ship to Port Llast to rescue their cousin. (A number of Everful Kegs of Port Llast Ale were reported to have been rescued at the same time.) Returning to the Mist Shrouded Isles, Abin spent some time with his family, but soon the wanderlust grew in him again.<br><br>Returning from his latest trip, Ludwig reported the discovery of a new land, known as The Realm. Abin knew he must see this new land for himself and was soon at sea again. Upon arriving in The Realm, the traveler soon discovered some of his NOR family had settled here after The Fall. Taking an active role in helping the guild to get settled in this new land, Abin soon rose through the ranks to become an officer of the guild. It was around this time that the young officer met and recruited a beautiful young lady named Lysandra. Abin was soon swept of his feet my Lysandra's charm, and offered his heart to her as soulmate. They were wed at a gala celebration soon after. (Little is known of the gala as court suits are still pending) The happy couple settled into life in their new home.<br><br>Abin continues to serve Lienster Duchy in The Realm, as Realm Leader and a member of the High Council of NOR.</p><p> </p>
