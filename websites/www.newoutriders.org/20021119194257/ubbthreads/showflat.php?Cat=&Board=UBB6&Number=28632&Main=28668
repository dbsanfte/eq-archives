Gregor awoke in a darkened tent.  He felt shocks of pain shooting through his body.  He had been hog-tied and leashed to the center pole of the structure.  His head ached for obvious reasons and was caked with blood.  The air smelled of food and spilled ale and the night was cool enough to make him shiver.  He had not made it to Edgeton like he promised himself, he had not killed Ganal.  He writhed and wriggled on the ground but whomever had tied him up was very, very good at knots.  His wrists and ankles started to burn, so he decided to give it a rest for awhile.<br /><br />The flap of the tent opened and in walked a man of reasonable stature.  "Sorcerer, you say?", the man remarked then kicked Gregor in his stomach repeatedly.  The blows forced the air out of Gregor's chest and before he could take another breath he was kicked again.  A man rushed in and threw open the flap.  "Stop, Hinon, before I tie you up as well!!", said another man who was even bigger than the first, "It's obvious that the man is lying, or he wouldn't be here right now.  He would have disappeared by now." He turned toward Gregor, "If this is true, traveller, why did you find it necesary to lie to us?  We would have happily granted you pasage without such boasts."  Gregor lay there not speaking, enraged and disgusted.  He would have killed Hinon if he wasn't tied up.  Hinon spat on Gregor, and left the room.<br /><br />"I do apologize for Hinon but you must realize that saying you are a sorcerer is almost a death sentence around here.  Our village was destroyed by Tyronis, a powerful sorcerer and an evil man.  Many people died and our crops were burned to ashes.  We are the Amours and come from afar to seek the help of Lord Ogthmor.", he continued, "You see, we are just farmers who as Tyronis put it; 'dared to be insubordinate to his will'.  Tell me, friend, what village do you hail from?"<br /><br />Gregor remained silent.  He was too upset to speak, too dejected to care.  The man left him to his silence and Gregor fell into an uncomfortable but much needed sleep.  He dreamt again.<br /><br />The fires of his village instantly dried his eyes and heated his face.  The horseman were racing toward him now with weapons drawn. A building suddenly fell in between him and he found himself immediatley surrounded by flames.  He coughed on every inhale and choked on every exhale as the thick smoke swirled and smelt of burnt flesh.  He heard a trumpet and then the sound of galloping horses trailing off into the distance.  <br /><br />He was beginning to suffocate and desperatley flailed his arms at the ground searching for something to press to his face and hopefully filter some of the smoke out when his hand hit a bucket full of water.  He picked it up, eyes burning, and dumped it on himself.  Then he did the only thing he could, he ran through the fire as fast as his legs would carry him.<br /><br />He luckily picked a route that the fire was only a thin wall of flame and was through in a matter of seconds.  He collapsed on the ground and saw the corpses of his children next to him.  He began to weep and sob uncontrolably.  He picked up their limp corpses and made his way to the remains of his hut.  He decided to bury them there, under the ruins of their beds, so that he would always remember where to mourn them.<br /><br />Gregor suddenly felt a cool and wet rag on the back of his head and awoke.  A woman knelt beside him, cleaning the wound to his head which was delivered by his foolish lie.  He started thrashing about and the woman jumped back obviously startled and spilled her bowl of water.  His back and legs suddenly felt cold as the water seeped into his barely dry clothes.  "Now look what you've made me do.", the woman scolded, "Flopping like a fish on the ground will get you nowhere, so please calm down."  Of course she was right so he decided to calm down.  She made a frustrated growling noise and stomped off.  She threw open the flap and a loud tearing noise was heard as the flap fell to the ground.  She instantly ran back and began to attempt to the damage that she had just done.<br /><br />"You really shouldn't be so worried about escaping and we will take care of you.  That is, unless you act stupidly and violently like you have so far.", she grabbed a knife from her waist and started boring a hole into th fabric, "You will remain our captive until we reach Edgeton where we will turn you over to the authorities there.  They they will decide what to do with you.  It has already been decided by our counsel."  She looped a leather string through the hole and through the hole on the flap to finalize the repair.  "Perhaps, if you behave, I could persuade my husband to loosen your bonds so that you may rest more peacefully."  With that she walked away leaving Gregor to himself once again.
