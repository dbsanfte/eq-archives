NOR Guild Name Policy

All members of The New OutRiders shall choose their own official Guild Name which conforms to the following rules:

1. Each member is limited to one Guild Name to be listed on the Branch Roster where they play. 

2. Members are permitted to make additional characters/screen names which are variations on their Guild Name. For example, NOR Bob can make Guild Alternate characters named NOR Bobb, NOR Bbob, and NOR Bobby, but not NOR John. All of these characters are considered one Member/Persona.

3. When a Member changes their Guild Name, all of their Guild Alternates must be changed/rerolled to match the new name if they are to still be considered Guild Alternates. For example, NOR Bob changes his name to NOR John. His Guild Alternates of NOR Bobb, NOR Bbob and NOR Bobby must be renamed to variations of his new Guild Name. Such as NOR Johnn, NOR Jjohn and NOR Johny.

4. Any Guild Alternate which is detagged as a NOR will not be permitted to be retagged.

5. Detagging of your Guild Name character is considered as a resignation from NOR.

6. All name changes require prior Branch Leader approval.
