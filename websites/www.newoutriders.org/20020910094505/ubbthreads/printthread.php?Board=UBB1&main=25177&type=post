From the Associated Press:  <br />In late breaking news...<br /><br />While Mhairtrym has yet to comment on the allegations that he was responsible for the recent "lag" issues experienced within Dark Age of Camelot, many of his guildmates within the New OutRiders have filed statements with the Justice Department implicating him not only in the recent lag issues but also in what appears to be a secret plot amongst the developers of Dark Age of Camelot to remove Blademasters from the world of Hibernia.  <br /><br />It seems that several members of the New OutRiders overheard a discussion in which Mythic Developers were urging Mhairtyrm to assault the good tastes of his realm mates in Hibernia through the vulgar use of the color  <font color="purple"> purple  </font color> on his Blademaster.  There goal appears to have been to later point towards this  <font color="purple">"purple incident"</font color> as a valid concern amongst their population base and immediately remove the bug that included the Blademaster class upon live release of the game.  Furthermore it is claimed that as a payment for these services Mhairtrym was indeed offered  <font color="red"> red button </font color> access to the servers.  <br /><br />In response to these accusations Mythic has offered the members of the New OutRiders large sums of platinum in order to withdraw their statements and maintain silence.   One member who prefers to remain anonymous said that "while the offer was very tempting the New OutRiders would not be silenced".<br /><br />
