              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Introduction<br>
              <br>
              The purpose of this document is to familiarize *NOR/ members with the procedures at&nbsp;<br>
              *NOR/ High Council (HC) meetings and to set guild lines for conduct at HC Meetings.&nbsp;<br>
              Anyone not following these guild lines will be ask to leave.<br>
              <br>
              Everyone is welcome at HC meetings, however only active HC members may make motions&nbsp;<br>
              and or vote on those motions.  The HC consists to the persons that have been&nbsp;<br>
              promoted to the rank of  Lord or Lady and one person appointed by the CDM to&nbsp;<br>
              represent the Dungeon Masters Guild, and one person from the Circle of Elders&nbsp;<br>
              to represent that Group.<br>
              <br>
              A high council member will act as moderator and conduct&nbsp;<br>
              the meeting.  A quorum of 50% of the active HC members are required for any motions&nbsp;<br>
              to be passed.  In emergencies proxies from HC member my be used to meet the quorum requirement.<br>
              An agenda is circulated to High Council members before the meeting.&nbsp;<br>
              It contains the details of what is going to be discussed at the HC meeting.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              It usually reads something like this:<br>
  1) Call to Order<br>
  2) Duchy Reports - in random order including DMG report.<br>
  3) Old Business - items that were tabled at previous meetings<br>
  4) New Business - new motions the HC wishes to discuss.<br>
  5) Meeting adjournment<br>
              <br>
              Persons below the rank of Duke or Duchess are requested to discuss any "new ideas"&nbsp;<br>
              with their Duke or Duchess before bring them up at HC meetings.  Dukes and Duchess are&nbsp;<br>
              requested to contact HC members with ideas and get discussion of these ideas placed&nbsp;<br>
              on the agenda.<br>
              <br>
              MESSAGE COLORS<br>
              In the interest of HC members retaining their sanity and eye sight certain message&nbsp;<br>
              colors are mandated.  All persons attending a HC meeting will set their background&nbsp;<br>
              message color to BLACK.  Foreground color can be of any color accept for the following:<br>
              Yellow - HC MEMBER who is moderating  the meeting.<br>
              Red - HC MEMBER.<br>
              White - DUKE or DUCHESS<br>
              Green - Dungeon Master Group<br>
              <br>
              SPEAKING AT MEETINGS<br>
              To speak at a meeting a *NOR/ member must first  be recognized by the moderator.&nbsp;<br>
              A person wishing to be recognized must type a "?" to be recognized by the moderator.&nbsp;<br>
              The moderator will then, usually in the order that people asked to be recognized,&nbsp;<br>
              state the persons name and give them the floor.<br>
              Any other discussion which occurs between *NOR/ members should be done using the&nbsp;<br>
              whisper feature.  This include greetings and good-byes.<br>
