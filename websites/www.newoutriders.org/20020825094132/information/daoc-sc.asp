      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This document SUPPLEMENTS the NOR Guild Standards and Conventions. All members are expected to comply&nbsp;<br>
      with this document as well as the NOR Guild Charter and NOR Guild Standards &amp; Conventions.<br>
      <br>
      I. STANDARDS&nbsp;<br>
      A. The Guild EPI (Epithet) shall be in all Capital {CAPS} letters and shall follow this format:<br>
      *NOR/LD-DAoC<br>
      Where:<br>
      * = Cross (Star)<br>
      NOR = The Guild<br>
      / = The Sword<br>
      LD = your rank<br>
      - = a separator<br>
      DAoC = your "home" Duchy (Host)<br>
      This format should be used when corresponding with a fellow NOR either by e-mail, or when posting&nbsp;<br>
      on the NOR Bulletin Boards, except where the use of such would interfere with a Role Playing.&nbsp;<br>
      ( e.g.: NOR Aglavalin *NOR/LD-DAoC )<br>
      <br>
      B. Names (NOR Jacket) - A NOR Jacket, "NOR &lt;Name>," is not required for affiliation and identification&nbsp;<br>
   to your NOR Brothers and Sisters within DAoC. With the naming convention in use by DAoC, the&nbsp;<br>
   Guild Tag gererated by the game will suffice.<br>
   1. All characters on the roster, regardless if wearing a Guild Tag or not, are subject to the&nbsp;<br>
      Standards and Conventions of NOR and this Branch.&nbsp;<br>
   2. Each Member shall choose one Name upon Squiring for His/Her Official NOR Roster Name.&nbsp;<br>
   3. The NOR Roster Name cannot be changed without approval of The Duke/Duchess.&nbsp;<br>
   4. Similarly spelled Alt Names are preferred to alleviate confusion but dissimilarly named&nbsp;<br>
      Alternate Characters, played by the Member, may be tagged and are considered associated&nbsp;<br>
      with the Main Character.  These Alternate Characters must receive Duke/Duchess approval&nbsp;<br>
      prior to Tagging.&nbsp;<br>
   5. All dissimilarly named Alt Characters will be listed under the Main NOR Character on the&nbsp;<br>
      Duchy Roster.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      II. CONVENTIONS<br>
      A. Greetings - A greeting of "HAIL *NOR/" should be given to all your fellow NOR upon meeting up.&nbsp;<br>
   This can be done by typing "Hail *NOR/" in the Guild channel upon entry into game.<br>
   1. When entering the Game with a dissimilarly named Alt Character, members shall announce their&nbsp;<br>
      arrival with the standard NOR Greeting and their NOR Roster Name. ie...Hail *NOR// WilhelmG's Alt.<br>
      B. Guild Emblem - Members of NOR of Squire rank or above may wear the NOR Emblem in game on any<br>
   tagged characters.  Wearing the NOR Emblem is encouraged at guild events.<br>
      C. Party Traveling - Is an important part of the fun in DAoC.  Party travel is at the discretion&nbsp;<br>
   of the party forming, but please make every effort to helps others looking for a group without&nbsp;<br>
   regard to the class they play.&nbsp;<br>
      D. Kill Stealing - Please do not attack other player's opponents unless you are asked for help or&nbsp;<br>
   they are obviously in dire need of assistance. Jumping into a fight where you are not needed is&nbsp;<br>
   rude, and reflects poorly on the guild.<br>
      E. Dying. You will die in this game but please try and keep track of where you are. Binding nearby&nbsp;<br>
   to where you will be fighting is usually the best method to speed game play along, especially&nbsp;<br>
   when in a group.<br>
