              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I. Procedure for opening a new
              *NOR/ branch in a new realm/server<br>
              <br>
              An active OFFICER of *NOR/ sends a written petition to ALL HC
              members requesting that *NOR/ open a new branch in a realm/server.
              This petition should detail existing *NOR/ members that are
              interested in helping open the new branch. The HC at a closed
              meeting discusses the petition and decides if opening a new branch
              is appropriate. If the HC wishes to proceed, the HC will decide at
              a closed meeting who will head the branch. This person must agree
              to do the following:&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              1) Attend all open HC meetings<br>
              2) Keep HC up to date on all branch issues<br>
              3) Hold regularly scheduled meetings at least once every two weeks<br>
              4) Be in the game in the new branch as much as possible, including
              being on line everyday to answer mail<br>
              5) Obtain and send to all HC ALL rules and regulations (TOS,
              sanctioned guild guidelines, etc.) concerning the new branch and
              realm/server<br>
              6) Form a tree structure, in the new branch as discussed below<br>
              7) Transfer on permanent basis to the new branch<br>
              8) Keep roster of NOR members in the new realm (he/she may
              delegate the duty to others, but the leader is responsible for the
              roster). This roster should be forwarded to all HC members and the
              HC Herald/Scribe (assuming we have one).&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              The High Council assigns one of its members to act as Realm Leader
              (RL) in the new branch. The RL must be willing to spend a
              significant amount of time in the new branch. Assuming that the
              person wishing to form the branch accepts the job, an announcement
              of the new branch forming is made on all current realm bulletin
              boards, and on the *NOR home page.<br>
              <br>
              II. New Branch Structure<br>
              <br>
              A Branch is first formed as a barony. It then grows into a County,
              then a full-fledged Duchy. Until the new branch reaches Duchy
              status, the Branch is considered provisional. Until the branch
              becomes a Duchy, every month the HC is required to review the
              Branch status and determine if the Branch is a functional part of
              *NOR/, if it should be expanded and if it should continue to
              exist. Guidelines (NOT REQUIREMENTS or GUARANTEES) for determining
              if a branch should be expanded: County - 8 members, branch is at
              least one month old. Organizes into two baronies. Duchy - 24
              members, four baronies (5-6 members each), branch is at least two
              months old. Organizes into two counties, two baronies each.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              III. Leaders of Branch&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              The leader of a new branch must be an officer of the guild (level
              4+). The leader of the branch retains his/her current rank upon
              being appointed to head the branch. He/she is promoted to match
              his/her responsibilities as the branch grows (where appropriate -
              if Baron to Count when branch grows to county). The leader of the
              branch may promote up to his/her own level (not inclusive) at
              his/her discretion.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              IV. Transfers<br>
              <br>
              Any *NOR/ member may transfer to the new branch on a permanent
              basis, with the permission of the DK/DC of his/her current duchy
              and the leader of the new branch :-)&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              V. Closing a branch<br>
              <br>
              The HC may close a branch if they feel it necessary/advisable. All
              members of the branch retain their ranks and may join other realms
              at that rank.<br>
