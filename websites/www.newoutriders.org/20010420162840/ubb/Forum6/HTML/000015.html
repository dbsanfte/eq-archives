</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">{Section One: Vaelynn's Beginning}<P>Wind brushed against leaves and flowers, catching little wisps of loose grass and dirt, swirling them gently in the air. Water lapped gently against shore, the lake tranquil, black in the light of the moon. The only sound was the gentle rustling of leaves and plants, the hoot of a night-owl. It was peaceful tonight, and beautiful as only Norrath could be.<BR>     Vaelynn stared at the still water, her eyes unfocused, her face still. Silver light bathed her, making her seem to be a spirit of the forest. Sharply defined features gave her face an exotic look; auburn hair fell over her shoulders, hiding the tell-tale pointed ears. Not that anyone could mistake what she was. At just a glance it could be seen immediately, even by those who had never met her kind, who had only heard tales and stories, handed down from generation to generation. Exaggerated versions of the truth, that's all they were. Anyone who came across her might wonder why she was there, what she was doing. But no one came across her. It was nearly midnight, and all the sensible people were asleep. The village on the other side of the lake was quiet, the only lights those that were left to allow late-night travelers to find their way. Not that very many strangers came to Resse.<BR>     "Thinking again, little one?"<BR>     The voice was soft, familiar to her as her own. Vaelynn didn't turn her head. "I couldn't sleep," she replied honestly. Her brother's chuckle was soft as he sat next to her. At a lofty twenty years of age, he had four years on her. He used those four years ruthlessly to rile her temper, but he also knew his sister knew a lot more than most her age. He had raised her since their parents had died. He was the one that pushed her on after the orcs' attack on their village, and he was the one to bring her here, the one to demand help from everyone he saw.<BR>     "The dreams again." Not a question, but a statement. Vaelynn nodded, still staring at the water. Dreams had been plaguing her for the past month. It was the same dream, with a couple variations.<BR>     Orcs raided her village, killed everyone in sight. She was in the woods at the time, at her "hiding place". She had no idea the raid had happened until she returned at her usual time, late evening. The village would be in ashes. The first body she would see was her brother's, grossly mutilated. Sometimes it was Vera's--her best friend. Or, in another variation, she would be in the village at the attack, but be overlooked because she hid in the inn's wine cellar, where she had been doing inventory.<BR>     It all ended the same. She was alone, with nothing and no one, walking along the main road, only to have a group of bandits appear. There, she knew nothing. The dream ended at the same place, every night. She was rapidly losing weight, and there were circles under her eyes the moonlight was kind enough to erase for the time being.<BR>     "I don't understand it, Dal. Why do I dream the same dream every night, every time I sleep? Is it a curse? Is it a twisted version of the past? Is it a sight of the future? I just don't know anymore." Her lips twisted bitterly as the calm she had managed to find disappeared abruptly. Standing, Vaelynn threw a pebble into the water, watching the ripples. "What have I done, to be tortured this way? Have I in some way riled the gods?<BR>     "What will bring me relief from the fear?" Her hands clenched into fists, her nails dug into her skin. She consciously, with an effort, opened her hand. Four red crescent marks stared up at her.<BR>     "I think you should see the Druid."<BR>     The statement came so calmly, so surely, it threw Dalmer's sister off guard. She turned and stared at him, green eyes wide.<BR>     "The Druid? No one can ever find the Druid. She's a myth, a legend. Surely you know that by now!" Slight scorn in her voice.<BR>     Dal smiled slightly and stood, brushing off his leather pants and shaking his head. "She's not a myth, little sister. She's simply old, and doesn't talk much with anyone. The animals are her family, the forest her home. The magic is her comfort, her life. She doesn't need us, but when we are in great need, she comes to us. If we need greatly enough."<BR>     Vae's brow furrowed. "Have you ever seen her?" she asked, still skeptical. The Druid was a myth, and everyone knew it. There was, if she wasn't a myth, only one druid near Resse. All the others were up near Kelethin, and other large cities. Exotic ones too. Like the human city. But no one ever saw her, and soon she became myth.<BR>     No one had seen her for years.<BR>     "Once. When I was a boy, eight years old. I was looking for shelter, and you were sick. I was worried that you wouldn't pass the night--you had a horrible fever and you could barely move to follow me. I had to half-carry you. It was going to rain, I knew it. I was praying that we'd find shelter, when the wolf came." His eyes looked into the distant past as he relived the memory. "I was scared, of course, but I was too worried about you to just run away like I would've if I was alone. You couldn't run, and I couldn't carry you with me if I ran. So I picked up a branch and set you on the floor. I remember telling the wolf that he wouldn't get you, and he'd have to get through me, which wasn't going to happen."<BR>     Vaelynn's smile was slight at the thought of a grubby eight-year-old orphan challenging a wolf. She tilted her head to the side. "And the wolf became the Druid," she guessed promptly.<BR>     "No." At Vae's arched eyebrow, Dal chuckled. "The wolf just stood there. He was hungry--really skinny. He was no more than a yearling, I think. It was then she came. She was dressed in green. Tunic and pants, with a big staff. Her hair was silver and her eyes were blue, and she wasn't as old as you'd think. Least, she didn't look it. She didn't even speak to me. All she did was walk up to you, and put her hand on your head. Next thing, you were perfectly fine, but sleeping. Then she picked you up and told me to follow--she had the most beautiful voice, I can remember that--and she left us near Resse. Then she was gone." His smile was bemused as he remembered. "I woke you up and didn't say anything, I just told you to follow me. Then I ran into the village yelling for help. I woke up poor Telly and the few guests at his inn. It was him who took us in, and...well, you remember the rest."<BR>     Then his smile disappeared, and he grasped her slim hand in his. "Listen to me, Vae. Seek her out. She can help you. I know she can. She has all the forest's power behind her."<BR>     "Druids are supposed to be haughty and pay no attention to peasants," Vaelynn informed him. Dal just shook his head slightly.<BR>     "Wood elves are supposed to be spirits of the forest. Are we?"<BR>     "No." The answer was grudging, and she bit her lip uncertainly.<BR>     But since Vaelynn still showed signs of doubt, he sighed and put his arm around her shoulders, hugging her close in a one-armed embrace. "Let's go home. Why don't you sleep on it?" he suggested. When his sister threw him a look filled with daggers, he held up his hands. "Okay, no sleep. Well, think about it at least," he said.<BR>     Vaelynn sighed. "I suppose," she replied grudgingly, then shook her head. "I still think she's either dead or myth, though," she muttered softly, and if Dal heard her, he said nothing. <P>------------------<BR><I>Heraldess Vaelyna Skyrunner</I><BR>   <IMG SRC="http://homepages.go.com/~sandineko/vaelyna.jpg">   <BR>     <B>44th Season Nature Walker</B><BR>     <I>Sister to Vollyra</I><BR>*NOR/HE - EQ - Xegony<p>[This message has been edited by Vaelyna (edited 03-07-2001).]</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">{Section Two: Dream Come True}<P>There was a shadow among forest life today. Vaelynn moved around quickly and silently, slipping through brush and between trees like wind through fingers. I can't believe I'm doing this. She doesn't exist.<BR>	If one were to ask Vaelynn just why she was doing this, she would answer with a shrug. Dal hadn't brought the subject of the Druid up again, but she knew he was thinking about it, every time he glanced toward her. Every time he spoke. She could almost sense the question behind his eyes, and knew just how patient her brother could be. So, this morning, she packed herself some food and water and just took off. The search for the Druid might take days, but she didn't need to take anything else.<BR>	That was the entire day ago. Now it was night, and she was tired. She had finally reached the limit of her knowledge; she didn't know where she was. Instead of running around blind, she chose to follow the road, without showing herself. <I>If the Druid's anywhere, she's got to be in the Deep Forest, where no one goes. Once I find that one trail, the one less used, that branches from this one...that's where I'll be headed.</I><BR>It took her another hour to find a likely camping spot, far enough from the road she didn't have to worry about uninvited guests and close enough she wouldn't lose the trail. She wolfed down her small dinner of biscuits and smoked meat of whatever animal Dal had successfuly hunted. Tonight was the reason she brought it; she could it eat now, but if she had brought more, it would have slowed her down. The jerky in her waist-pouch was enough for her to live on. She had done it before.<BR>	As she hadn't started a fire, Vaelynn made herself a cozy little bed of leaves and pines beneath a tree and within the circle of a bush, falling asleep almost immediately.<P>The attack came in the dead of night. No one had heard them coming, and most surely no one saw them coming now. Everyone was asleep in their beds, except for one.<BR>	Dalmer sat before the fire in his home, watching the flames. He thought only of his sister, young and untried in the forest, but there was no worry in his mind. He knew the animals would flock to her in times of danger, the same way he knew what she would be in the future. She wouldn't have the surroundings of a simple village, but the surroundings of nature and magic. She had the abilities of a ranger lying dormant in her. The only problem was, she didn't have a teacher.<BR><I>	I didn't teach her the bow, I just showed her how to use it. Despite the horrible arrows I found lying around, and used just to show her how archery was done, she still managed to get pretty close to the target. She has a natural eye and somehow she knows the balance needed. I'm good enough that I can kill something, but that's it. She has strength, too. She can lift as much as me, maybe more, thought it doesn't show. She's thin, but not too thin, like Mother. She </I>looks<I> like mother, but she </I>is<I> Father.</I><BR>	Something intruded on his thoughts. It was just a feeling, but...<P><I>She was walking along the ruins of what was once Resse. Everything was burned to the ground. Fear and anger burned in her stomach, and guilt weighed heavily on her mind. She brought the bodies to the center of the charred ashes, tears stinging her eyes but never falling. Everything was done by rote. She felt so dead inside, as she held corpses of her dearest friends, of her foster family, and her brother. Everyone was dead, down to little Artema, only a week old.<BR>	She arranged them in a circle, then brought charred wood still burning and tossed it onto the bodies. Soon flame engulfed clothing and skin and hair. Vaelynn knelt and picked up the few weapons somewhat saved from the wreck. They hadn't been taken, for whatever reason. She picked up her brother's bow and sword, sheathing one and simply carrying the other.<BR>	She began the trek, through the forest and onto the main road. Traveling, who knows where.<BR>	Then...the bandits.</I><P>"Gods!" Vaelynn bolted upright, the fear, the anger, the grief still lingering inside her. She shivered, but not in cold. "Gods." It was different. It was so different. She took great gulps of cool, crisp air, standing and stumbling out from her little shelter. A glance up at the sky; it was dawn. She picked up her pack and brushed angry tears from her eyes.<BR>	"Why do you have to torture me this way?" she whispered, tense and shaking. "Fear and anger and grief, so much of each to eat me up inside."<BR>	"It isn't torture, but a vision of what can be, will be, and has been."<BR>	Vaelynn turned sharply, her head snapping around, her eyes searching for the source of that voice. Calm and smooth, beautiful, but devoid of emotion. "Where are you?" she asked, shaking. Had she displeased the gods? Were they sending someone down, for justice to whatever wrong she had done toward them?<P>------------------<BR><I>Heraldess Vaelyna Skyrunner</I><BR>    <IMG SRC="http://homepages.go.com/~sandineko/vaelyna.jpg">    <BR>     <B>44th Season Nature Walker</B><BR>     <I>Sister to Vollyra</I><BR>*NOR/HE - EQ - Xegony<P>[This message has been edited by Vaelyna (edited 03-07-2001).]<p>[This message has been edited by Vaelyna (edited 03-07-2001).]</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">{Section Three: Pain In Truth}<P>She didn't know how it happened, but Vaelynn was sitting as calm as could be inside the Druid's tiny cabin. She was waiting for the explanations, not just of the dreams, but of...everything.<BR>	"Resse is no more."<BR>	The Druid spoke abruptly, and Vaelynn closed her eyes. She had suspected something of the sort, but she didn't believe her dreams were truly reality. The guilt burned like acid in her stomach, as she nodded slowly. "I think I knew," she said quietly, opening her eyes and staring at the older woman. She didn't know it, but the Druid approved of her. She didn't break down and weep, or go into shock. She simply absorbed it and acknowledged it. The tears, the pain, she wouldn't let it get in her way right now. She would let loose later, when she could afford to. She had the power of will.<BR>	"The different variations of your dream didn't seem to have any difference in the dream itself. But here is what they meant." The Druid turned, stared into the fire. Figures seemed to shimmer within. "If you were in the forest, you were hunting for me, for answers. I would give you what I could. A bow, a sword, arrows, and directions. Plus some spells to keep you safe for a while. That would allow you to survive the bandits that would waylay you on the way to Kelethin, where I would send you. If you had been in the winecellar, Dal wouldn't have told you about me and you would have died on the road. The reason you would be on the road...because you wanted to run away from the truth, you didn't want to face it. You were scared and didn't want to admit it.<BR>	"I know this because I had dreams of this coming. I can interpret dreams, and I've been keeping an eye on you for a long time, Vaelynn." The girl gave a little start, shocked at the use of her name. The Druid smiled slightly, humorlessly. "You have the same power I have, but with more strength of body. You can use druid magic, but you will never have the strength of one. You have the abilities of a warrior; they come to you naturally. You would be a ranger, like your father was. You will be stronger in magic. Your mother was a druid, but no one ever knew."<BR>	Vaelynn stared at the Druid, her mouth dry, her thoughts racing to keep up with reality. "Mother was a druid?" she asked slowly. She had never known, and she didn't think Dal did--had--either. Her hands clenched at the thought of her brother, and pain pierced through her. Pain immediately blocked, postponed for the moment.<BR>	"Yes." The Druid was silent, steepling her hands together and frowning into the fire. "She was my student, a bright one. Beautiful and kind, and she had the animals' love. She has given those gifts to you. Dianetta was the daughter I never had. I raised her, I taught her, I loved her. When your Father came to ask for her hand, I gave him permission. When Dalmer was born, I rejoiced. When you were born, I feared. I could sense the pain you would go through in life. I could sense the darkness you would have to fight. So, I kept an eye on you. I helped you when you needed help. I rarely appear to anyone. I haven't openly helped anyone in years, many, many years. I must stay quiet, I had to stay quiet, so that I would be here for you now. <BR>	"I must send you to Kelethin, where you will find a good friend of mine. He is a ranger, he will show you what you need to learn. You must learn, Vaelynn. But for now, you must heal." She stood gracefully, watching her charge with cool green eyes. "Any questions, little one?"<BR>	"Yes." Vaelynn stared at the woman who, if she thought about it, was kind of her grandmother. "What's your name?"<P>Vaelynn curled up in the large bed the Druid--no, Aleriana--had brought to the loft. She stared out, at the night sky, watching the silvered rays of the moon. Tears wet her cheeks, dropped onto her pillow. Pain throbbed in her. Was it possible to feel such pain, pain to rip your heart from your chest?<BR>	She wished Dalmer were here with her. She wished she had brought Dal with her. There was so many things she wished now, so many things she wanted to say to him, so many secrets she wanted to tell him. She felt guilt for not being able to say goodbye, not having said goodbye, before she had left. She hadn't known she would never see him again, but was that any excuse? She wept silently, thinking back to all the fun times she had. It wasn't just Dalmer, it ws everyone she missed. Everyone she wanted to say at least something to, to admit to something because it involved them. She wanted to tell them she loved them one more time. to tell them good-bye. But she couldn't, because they were dead. Because orcs had once more stolen all those she loved and cared for from her. Orcs had destroyed her life again. Why was it she had to go through this? Why was it that there was always pain, a constant pain throbbing within her? Why did her heart always have to bleed dry?<BR>	Nothing was fair anymore. She couldn't ever see her loved ones again. She couldn't ever laugh with them, joke around, play and have serious talks. She couldn't ever share secrets with her best friend. She could never be a child again. She very much doubted the child in her was still there. Yes, maybe she could have her fun times, but then again, maybe she couldn't. Maybe she could find close friends again, and maybe even love again...but then again, maybe not.<BR>	And now she had no one to speak with, to talk with in this desperate time...<BR><P>------------------<BR><I>Heraldess Vaelyna Skyrunner</I><BR>  <IMG SRC="http://homepages.go.com/~sandineko/vaelyna.jpg">  <BR>     <B>44th Season Nature Walker</B><BR>     <I>Sister to Vollyra</I><BR>*NOR/HE - EQ - Xegony</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">{Section Four: Training}<P>"Vaelynn! Vaelynn, come outside. I've got a surprise for you!" Aleriana shouted up the ladder, with a hint of laughter in her voice. <BR>	Vae scrambled to the edge of the loft, shoving her hair out of her face and peering down at her. "Mm?" she asked, still groggy with sleep. Green eyes blinked blearily down at her. "Wh's'it?" she mumbled, collapsing where she was.<BR>	"Get your butt down," her grandmother scolded her, with a chuckle. "Hurry up now." she disappeared out the door, and Vaelynn mumbled something as she descended the ladder carefully, glad she had slept in her tunic and shorts. Giving her head a brisk shake, she trotted out the door, peering outside in the bright sunshine.<BR>	"Surprise!" Aleriana grinned triumphantly. "Look. Remember that ranger friend from Kelethin? He came all the way down, just for you. Vaelynn, this is Raenin. Raenin, this is Vaelynn."<BR>	Vaelynn stared. This was her ranger friend? He was...huge. Silver streaked his black hair, and his ears were not pointed. "Is he...human?" she whispered, her eyes wide.<BR>	He rumbled softly with laughter. "Yes, I am. And you must be the charming Wood Elf granddaughter of this lovely lady?"<BR>	Aleriana laughed and swatted at her friend. "Rae, hush. Now, Vae, your training starts immediately. Have fun, you too!" she called out, and left them alone. Vaelynn scowled at her retreating back.<BR>	"So you're going to be a ranger." Raenin drew her attention back to him, and her chin lifted ever-so-slightly. "You're a little thin and small," he commented, pretending not to see the sudden fire sparking in her otherwise dull green eyes. Good. Temper would be nice, she needed to ease herself out of the depression that was there even when she was happy. "I don't think you'll have the strength for a real sword. Maybe I can get you something lightweight..."<BR>	"I can handle anything you throw at me," Vaelynn snapped, her eyes green fire. "I'm stronger than I look." <I>How can grandmother</I> like <I>this guy? He's a complete chauvinist, and thinks he's better than me. Just because he's big and looks strong. Well, I'm quick, strong, and smart. He probably doesn't have more brains than a toad.</I><BR>	Raenin gave her a doubtful look, ignoring the glare that would make any other man back down. But he hadn't come this far to give up. "Fine," he replied immediately, and pointed to the woodpile. "I expect to see that pile three times its size by nightfall." He nodded and walked toward the cabin with long strides.<BR>	Vaelynn gaped after him. <I>Three times its size? He's gotta be kidding. That's impossible! No one can do that!</I> Then she closed her mouth with a snap and snarled softly. <I>Well, I'll show him. He's thrown down the challenge; he'd better be ready to have it thrown back in his teeth.</I> Stiff-backed with anger, she walked to the woodpile and picked up the axe.<P>	Raenin looked outside, bemused. That girl had some willpower. Aleriana snickered softly into her cup of tea, shaking her head. "I told you," she murmured softly.<BR>	"I didn't believe you." It was barely noon, mere hours after the girl had started on the woodpile. The very large woodpile. Now it was huge. "She's got to be tiring."<BR>	"Oh, she's tiring. She's just feeding on anger and pride, and self-deprecation. She's riling herself enough that she makes her energy come up." Her laughter was amused. "So, what do you think?" she inquired, quirking a silvered brow.<BR>	"She just might do. She just might do." He nodded slowly, still watching Vaelynn.<BR>	Despite the heat, despite the sweat, despite the pain, despite the bone-deep tiredness, Vaelynn gripped the axe as surely as she had when she started. Her head was pounding, but her strokes were sure and even. She wasn't slacking one bit.<BR><I>I hope this makes him rethink his opinions,</I> she thought grimly as the axe came down on wood. <I>Men. Stupid, chauvinistc, think they know everything and know absolutely nothing. They judge by appearances, not actions. They think women are fit only for the kitchen. How </I>can<I> Aleriana like this guy?</I><BR>	She ground her teeth in frustration, but kept her face smooth. She wouldn't let him have the satisfaction of seeing her riled. Oh, no. There was no way he was going to have that to weild over her, to know he can rile her temper so easily. <I>Oh no, mister. I really don't think so.</I><P>It was nightfall. Vaelynn sat on a treestump and looked at the woodpile. <I>If that's not three times the size of it before I started, I'll eat my shoes. I don't think I'll be dining on leather anytime soon, either. </I>She felt smug satisfaction, despite the sore pain and weariness. She wanted to sleep. And she was hungry; she hadn't eaten all day. She hadn't asked for anything to eat.<BR>	"You done, little elf?" Raenin appeared at the cabin doorway. At her sharp glance, at her nod, he gave the woodpile a considering glance. "I suppose that'll do," he said after a long moment.<BR>	<I>Suppose? Only suppose?</I> Vaelynn just barely kept from glowering at him. Instead, she simply swept past him. Or tried to. He grabbed hold of her arm and frowned down at her.<BR>	"Didn't Aleriana teach you any manners, girl?" he grated between his teeth.<BR>	"No," Vaelynn replied frigidly. "She doesn't have any right to. She's not my family. My family tought me manners, but a...a...barbarian like you, who has no courtesy or chivalry toward anyone, doesn't deserve to be treated like any other kind soul!" Pulling her arm out of his grasp, she ran past her gaping grandmother to the loft. Raenin's brow rose calmly as he watched her retreating back.<BR>	"Spitfire, isn't she?" he asked the druid, with a soft chuckle.<BR>	"Yes. Yes, she is," Aleriana said, hiding her hurt and Vaelynn's words. <I>She still needs to heal. The wounds are too new, and she feels such pain. I can feel it every time I see her. That emptiness inside. Maybe this will be the cure she needs. But that doesn't ease the hurt. She looks so much like her mother...</I> Sighing softly, shaking her head, she quietly entered the cabin.<P>------------------<BR><I>Heraldess Vaelyna Skyrunner</I><BR>   <IMG SRC="http://homepages.go.com/~sandineko/vaelyna.jpg">   <BR>     <B>44th Season Nature Walker</B><BR>     <I>Sister to Vollyra</I><BR>*NOR/HE - EQ - Xegony<p>[This message has been edited by Vaelyna (edited 03-07-2001).]</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">{Section Five:  Arrival .. Departure?}<P>Vaelynn sat before the hearth, combing her hair as she listened to her grandmother and tutor talk. She had come to an uneasy truce with her tutor, at least near Aleriana. When alone, the two snapped and griped. There couldn't be silence for more than two seconds without one or the other airing out several grievances. Of course, Aleriana wasn't stupid--or blind. Or deaf. She knew exactly what was going on between the two of them, and exactly why Raenin put up with it. To bring the girl out past her depression. Already there was healthy color in her cheeks and a sparkle in her eyes.<BR>	Now she could tell them the news. It had been six months since Vaelynn came to her, and five since Raenin had become her granddaughter's tutor. A week ago, Aleriana received a letter from her sister. It only informed her that Vaelyna, her niece, would be coming to live with her and be trained as a druid. Alexana was never one to get into details, and her sister cursed that now.<BR>	"My sister wrote me," she mentioned casually. Vaelynn looked surprised. Of course, she didn't know about her grandmother's family; she hadn't shown much interest beyond her mother. Raenin only quirked a brow, a silent urge to continue. "Her daughter, Vaelyna, will be coming here to train with me, to become a druid." And maybe, just maybe, give Vaelynn a friend her own age.  Aleriana turned to Vaelynn.  "You may be wondering why your names are so similar.  Your mother named you after my mother, Vaeline, and my sister named her daughter after my mother as well."<BR>	"When is she coming?" Raenin asked, in a low rumble. Vaelynn said nothing, only nodded and stared into the fire. Aleriana bit back a sigh; the girl just wasn't interested in anything or anyone anymore.<BR>	"She'll be here by next week," Aleriana replied, then grimaced. "Hopefully she has the ability to become a druid, else she'll have little training here for her. She'd probably end up the maid or something."<BR>	Raenin shook his head, glancing toward Vaelynn. She was quiet, but not in a moody way. It was more like she was listening and observing, to try to understand just how different things would be once this stranger came. He hid a satisfied smile as Vae softly interjected a few general questions about her soon-to-be companion. The girl had a mind. If only she didn't have the temper to match..<P>Vaelynn straightened from her defensive posture at a subtle hand movement on Raenin's part. She turned as he looked in the direction of the path, her eyes narrowing against the sun and her hand coming up to shade her eyes.<BR>Two people were coming. One was blonde, slight and small. The other one was brown-haired, tall and lean, but with broad shoulders. Half Elf and Wood Elf, she thought. Probably Vaelyna and her escort. "Put away the swords, Vae," Raenin ordered. For once she did as told without any sharp remarks, entering the house and smiling as she saw her aunt, curled up in front of the fire, her nose stuck in a book.<BR>	"Grandmother, Vaelyna's here."<BR>	Aleriana glanced up, her brow raising. "Oh?" she asked, setting the book aside and standing. "Who's with her?"<BR>	"No idea. Some Half Elf, I think," Vaelynn replied as they walked out the door. Raenin was already greeting the two. Vaelyna blushed and looked at the ground. Shy, Vae thought immediately. The Half Elf was polite yet distant. To Vaelynn, it was obvious he saw Raenin as a rival. She gave Vaelyna a quick, assessing look--pretty, in a clean, refreshing way. Shy, but she definitely didn't give off the dainty, fragile aura Vaelynn so detested.<BR>	Smiling warmly, Vae stepped forward, holding out her hand first to the Half Elf, then Vaelyna. "Welcome," she murmured, grasping both hands firmly. The Half Elf hesitated before giving her hand a squeeze; Vaelyna's hold was just as firm, and their eyes met. The younger girl's smile was shy and hesitant, then warmed at the friendliness in Vaelynn's eyes.<BR>	"I'm Vaelynn, Aleriana's granddaughter. You must be Vaelyna?" A nod. "Good. This is Raenin"--she waved to him vaguely--"And that's your aunt, Aleriana." Then she turned to the escort, her smile slightly cooler but still pleasant and warm enough. 	"You would be, kind sir?"<BR>	"Denarr," came his quiet reply.<BR>	"Ah. What was the fee?" Before he could answer, Aleriana swept up and pressed a bag in his hands. There was a distinct clinking.  "Thank you, for bringing me my niece safe and sound. Take these. There is an inn not too far along the road. It is nice enough, and the food is good. The way there is safe, so there are no worries." Somehow, Aleriana pulled off shoving him down the road and waving goodbye without seeming rude. Vaelynn gave her an amused look, before turning to Vaelyna and offering to show her the lands.<P>It was barely a month after Lyn's arrival. Raenin had left, claiming he had tought Vae all he should, and that further training awaited in Kelethin when she decided to go. Lyn was learning quickly, flourishing under Aleriana's tutoring. It was soon that Aleriana wasn't teaching one, but two pupils. Lyn and Vae were close friends, speaking quietly at night before they slept, brushing each other's hair, helping each other out. Vae didn't yet have the ability to use magic, but she could learn and keep the knowledge for the future when she would need it.<BR>	Lyn was brushing her near-sister's hair as they talked quietly into the night. "Really, Vae." Lyn tugged at a lock of hair. "You shouldn't be so closed-minded. You are going to marry one day, I know it. And he'll be sweet and romantic, handsome and titled..."<BR>	"Please," Vaelynn groaned, rolling her eyes. "Marriage is a waste of time. I mean, all it does is tie you down. One day you'll get kids. Then you won't be able to do anything, go anywhere..." She shook her head. "And husbands restrict your life. 'You can't do this, you can't do that'. No way, Lyn."<BR>	Shaking her head, the blonde quickly plaited Vae's thick hair, smiling slightly. "Not all marriages are like that," she replied with a laugh. "You just don't have an ounce of romantic in you. Plenty of imagination but no romance."<BR>	"Hey. I like romance as much as any other girl, I'm not saying I don't. I'm just not going to get married." Vae turned and grinned at Lyn, her eyes dancing. "Besides, who around here is handsome and sweet and romantic and titled?"<BR>	"Good point," Lyn admitted with a chuckle. "Then again, you can always go to Kelethin. I mean, you're going to end up going there sooner or later. You need to finish your training. Admit it, you're bored here. There's no fun for you anymore."<BR>"It's not that there's no fun," Vae replied, frowning. "It's just that it's the same thing over and over. Maybe something a little different--a wounded bird or rabbit. Sometimes a badger. It's fun, but it's...monotonous. I want something more different. Every day something happens, every day an unknown."<BR>	"You want an adventure," Lyn pointed out. "And if you want that, go to Kelethin. I'll be there soon enough, after my initial training here. You heard what Aunt Leri said. Besides, if you go to Kelethin first, you can scope out all the guys for me. Show me who's worthwhile and who's great game for flirting." Her grin was wicked. "And maybe you'll find a guy of your own, when I'm not there so I don't steal him from you."<BR>	Shaking her head, Vae chuckled softly. "Yeah, but I don't want to leave. I've lived in this area all my life. Not in one place all my life, but the this general area. It holds so many memories..." Her voice trailed off. Green eyes darkened in pain. Mother, Father, Brother. Who will be next? She shuddered and shook off the thought.<BR>	"...which is exactly why you need to leave. I mean, think about it. Adventures, fun. You can go on quests and save people from almost certain death. You can travel, see more places, more people, make other friends. Who knows, maybe you'll have a title and land someday."<BR>	"Lyn..." Vaelynn shook her head, distressed. "Look, I just don't want to think about it right now. Come on, we'd better get to bed before we're too tired tomorrow to help Grandmother out on the hunt she promised us."<BR>	Biting back a sigh, Lyn nodded and snuggled into her blankets. Vaelynn had to go to Kelethin, didn't she see? Kelethin was where the healing would step into the next phase. Kelethin was where she would find her destiny. And after Kelethin...who knew? <P>------------------<BR><I>Heraldess Vaelyna Skyrunner</I><BR>  <IMG SRC="http://homepages.go.com/~sandineko/vaelyna.jpg">  <BR>     <B>44th Season Nature Walker</B><BR>     <I>Sister to Vollyra</I><BR>*NOR/HE - EQ - Xegony</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">{Vaelynn's Journal:  Journey To Kelethin}<P><I>First Entry - Leaving </I><BR>I can't say I was happy about leaving. I can't say I wanted to stay. I was torn between two choices; past or future. Memories or life. Grandmother Aleriana never mentioned my leaving, but I could sense the thoughts in her mind. I could see it in her eyes, the steady patience. She knew I was going to leave, it was really only a matter of when. <BR>And Lyn. Dear Vaelyna. She pushed, prodded, bullied, cajoled. She knew I was going to leave, but she wanted to make sure I knew as well. How long have we known each other now? All of three months. And she knows me better than I know myself. Well, at least someone's there that cares enough about me. In fact, I have two people. I'm luckier than I've ever thought. <BR>Oh, I've gone through rough patches. I'm going through one now. I'm an orphan. My parents were killed when I was quite young, and my brother was killed about nine months ago. I still mourn him, every day, with all my heart. I mourn the parents I barely knew, the parents I can't quite remember. I mourn the loss of my innocence, the loss of my purity. I am in a constant state of mourning. <BR>That, however, cannot rule my life. I must learn to depend on no one but myself, to fight when need be and hunt. I wish to become a ranger. I already have some training, enough to get me into the Ranger's Guild in Kelethin. At least, I hope I do. Raenin--the backwards barbarian who trained me--was a good teacher. Although I cannot say I like him, I do respect him. We are different, Raenin and I, but he is a good ally. Maybe one day I can even call him friend. Once he grows out of this childish phase, anyway. <BR>But that is beside the point. I am leaving because I must control my destiny, take my life into my hands. I must be able to defend myself, and avenge the lives the orcs have mercilessly taken from this world. I worship Tunare, the Mother of All. She blesses my journey. It is because of her I am still alive today; because of her I am on this road now. I have nothing but my clothes and backpack, a rusty sword and food. And yet, now that I am on my way, there is an exhilaration in my soul. <BR>There was weeping when I started out. There always is. My grandmother stood there, with tears in her eyes, as she blessed me and put protective spells on me to keep me safe on my journy. Vaelyna, my dearest friend, she who I am proud to call my near-sister, wept in my arms and whispered a prayer to keep me safe. I love them dearly, I now realize. There was a time when I thought I could never give love, no matter what kind, to another. And now there are two I cherish. They are my family. <BR>Oddly enough, the good-byes were rather quick. Maybe five, ten minutes and I was on my way. I will miss them, but Vaelyna will be in Kelethin soon enough. And Aleriana, well, she is never far. She will always be there when I need her help. She gave me a letter to give to a man called "Maesyn Trueshot", at the Ranger's Guild. It will help me get in. In fact, she almost guaranteed I would be accepted. I sure hope so; there's nothing else for me to do in Kelethin. And she urged me to take up fletching. Why, I know not, but I will take her advice. She is far wiser than I, and she has lived in the real world for almost her entire life now. Vaelyna sides with her as well, and she is far more sophisticated than I am, so obviously their advice is good. <BR>Am I getting off the subject again? What was the subject? Oh yes. My leaving. Well, I have been traveling for two days now. Lyn gave me this journal to write my "memoirs" in. I never thought I actually would, but 'tis the truth I find I am enjoying this writing. Hmm, maybe I can become a bard if all else fails. Ah, well. Idle thinking. <BR>Grandmother gave me a bunch of yarn and two sticks. What am I supposed to do with it? I know I should "knit", but how does one knit? Maybe I should look it up when I get to Kelethin. <BR>My, my, there is a great load of things for me to do when I get to Kelethin, isn't there? My world seems to revolve around Kelethin. It isn't all that much farther away. Not like, say, Qeynos. Or Freeport. Wherever they are. Aren't they on another mass of land in the ocean? Hmm, maybe I should have paid a little more attention to my studies. It looks like I'll have to learn the hard way. <BR>Or I can buy a map. That would always work. Hmm, thunder has just crashed overhead. It looks like rain has come. Well, I suppose I shall be writing in this journal more than I ever thought, but for now...farewell.<P>---------------------------<P><I>Second Entry - Furry Friends</I><P>Today was so bright and sunny. When I woke, I realized a lonely raccoon had been cold last night. He had entered my little shelter and slept on my stomach. It woke when I ran my hand over its fur, surprisingly soft. Chittering, it stood on its hind legs and peered at me intently. Then it scurried out of the shelter. It must have been hungry. Such nice little animals there were out here. I didn't even feel too lonely, without anyone with me. It was really the first time I had been truly on my own, without someone to run to. As a child, growning up, there had been Dalmer--and, for a short time, my parents. Then my grandmother, Raenin, and Vaelyna. Now there was no one. I was living on my own, with an agenda not quite my own. I felt free but last night I had cried myself to sleep. There were no talks long into the night with Lyn, or debates of one thing or another between my grandmother and I. But now I felt free and really rather cheerful. I still felt alone, but the raccoon's presence this morning had dimmed it.<BR>It was then I realized I was ravenous. I hadn't eaten yesterday, except for when I left, first starting out on the journey. Understandably, I hadn't had much appetite. But now my stomach growled. I was lucky; there was a berry bush near my little camp, and I had rations. But before I packed up to go, after eating my fill, I picked some berries to take along with me. It was better to be safe than sorry, after all, and who knew when the next time I found food would be.<BR>I had a fire going last night, but before I went to bed I had taken care of it--after all, I had no need of it in the mornings. So I just packed my backpack and made the little site to seem as though I hadn't been there, before starting off on the dirt path before me. In fact, I was even humming a little, I was so happy. There was a lightness to my steps, and I didn't even think of the little cabin in the woods I now called home. I just wondered what there was going to be waiting for me today.<BR>I saw a flash of gray in my peripheral vision. Turning, I searched for whatever it was. And lo and behold, on the trail behind me, my little raccoon was cheerfully chittering away. I laughed. I couldn't help it, it was just so funny. The raccoon climbed up my leg to my shoulder. It was small, so it wasn't too much weight. Then he gave my hair a tug and scolded me--I know he was scolding me--for just standing there. So I walked.<BR>And walked. And walked. About noon, I was getting tired and my happiness was wearing off. All I was doing was walking! And talking to the raccoon. His chittering had stopped about an hour ago, though. Then I realized he might be hungry. So I stopped when I heard water, and followed the sound to its source--a stream. I took several gulps of the cold, clean water, and the raccoon happily did the same. Then he disappeared into the bushes, probably to get his own food. I took out a piece of jerky and chewed on it absently, just sitting on the ground and staring at the water. My legs weren't sore, for I was used to walking--I did it often, despite not doing it all day long...and I hadn't been running or anything, so that was good. But my head was pounding. There wasn't much sun, but my mouth felt dry and my eyes hurt. So I sat, and pondered. It wasn't because of the heat, so what was it from?<BR>And then I rolled my eyes at my utter stupidity. Of course. Dehydration. I hadn't been drinking much, although my mouth was dry and parched. Just now I had taken a great gulp or two of water, and some at breakfast, but that was it. So I drained a flask of water, and refilled it. And drained it again. After refilling it the second time, I put it away.<BR>The stream was deep enough for me to take a quick dip, and I almost shivered at the thought. I felt kind of dusty and dirty from the night I spent outdoors--I always felt that way, no matter what. So I was rather happy to strip and enter the cold water, dunking my head and wetting my hair. My raccoon stayed at shore, eating happily. When he was finished, however, he began his scolding. I think he liked to scold, but I'm not sure. But, being as happy as I was in the water, I decided to stay in for an extra few...seconds. When the raccoon's scolding just kept going on and on, I sighed and got out of the water, drying myself off with one of my extra tunics and dressing quickly. My raccoon seemed to be happy I was out of the water, because he resumed his perch on my shoulder and made cheerful little chitters as I returned to the path.<BR>But I had a surprise for him. I was kind of tired of walking, so I informed him to put himself in my bag and hope he wouldn't lose too many brain cells. He was curious, but did as I said. Then I started out in an easy lope. He wasn't too jostled--the lucky thing--and even managed to fall asleep as I ran until the sky began to darken and the sun dipped into the horizon.<BR>I found a camp site quickly, and made a fire and a small shelter. My raccoon--I will call him Telly, because he rather reminds me of my late foster-father--is sleeping beside me. We ate dinner not too long ago. I am now just writing, just to keep myself relaxed and giving myself something to do. It is only now that I really think about Lyn and Grandmother. I hope they're doing good in Lyn's studies. I wonder when she will also be on her way to Kelethin? Hopefully soon. I can't wait to see her again. We are such good friends.<BR>It is odd. I just looked up from writing, and I see several animals coming closer to the fire. In fact, there's a little squirrel right at my feet. I love animals, but this has never happened to me before. Maybe being in Grandmother's presence for so long has had her rub off on me. Cute little buggers, they are. Maybe they'll keep me warm tonight, like Telly did last night. Of course, it would be a little funny if they acted like Telly and followed me tomorrow. I doubt they will, though. Not every animal around does. Telly's probably just a special case. He is kinda cute though, and I hope he stays to keep me company. I can at least talk to him, and pretend he knows what I'm saying. Who knows, maybe he does.<BR>Oh dear, it's getting late. And I really enjoyed writing, but I've got to get some rest so I can make some good time tomorrow. Farewell. <P>---------------------------<P><I>Third Entry - Odd Occurences</I><P>I just realized how much I've been neglecting this little book. Why, Lyn would kill me if she realized just how little I've actually been writing. But I've been rather busy. Let's see. I've tried to keep myself alive, hunt, been on the search for my little raccoon friend, and continue on my way to Kelethin all at once. Not exactly the most fun of things to do.<BR>But I have finally reached my destination. I am in my room at the Inn right now, and it's quite late at night. My raccoon decided to disappear into the forest (he doesn't like it when a lot of people are around). I hope I'll see him again someday, soon. He was a great companion. We had a lot of fun on our way here.<BR>The first two days weren't really all that exciting. I walked around. I ate. I played with a raccoon. But you already know that stuff, I've already played scribe writing it all down. And, like I've said before, I had fun writing. I've just been too tired, too busy to actually continue writing in it night after night. You forgive me, don't you? It's only been a few things you've missed, not really all that much. It's just that I've been getting a lot more tired, sore, and irritable. I'm actually a little surprised my raccoon stayed with me. Poor Telly.<BR>Off that train of thought. Now I can tell you about my near death.<BR>I was walking (as I usually was), tired and really not paying much attention to my surroundings. Unfortunately, that turned out to be a big mistake. There was this lion just sitting in a tree, waiting for some hapless traveler such as I to come wandering beneath his branch. I didn't even see his shadow, that's how stupidly tired I was. The raccoon, however, smelled him and vaulted off my shoulder into the shadows. That's when I got the inkling something was wrong.<BR>So I turned around, looking for the source of the problem. Nothing that I could see. Frowning, I took a step closer. Boy did that become the worst mistake I've made for a long time. Possibly forever, besides deciding to be born. The lion squished me beneath him when he jumped on me. Luckily, I somehow managed to hurt him enough that he moved. I bolted up and started running for all my little life was worth. The lion toyed with me, following just behind, snapping at my heels. He was growling too. But I could swear he was having fun.<BR>I got clawed a couple times. Well, more than a couple, really. Several times. I had deep gouges in my back and legs, but I was still running...just a lot slower than I was before. It was then the lion decided to keep my still. He intercepted me, and everywhere I turned he was there, biting, snarling, reaching out with his thick, sharp claws. I was bleeding from every inch of my body, I think. I could feel death, right before my eyes. I wavered.<BR>Not to say that I didn't give the lion anything to get mad about. I hit him a couple times. I didn't have anything to fight with except a dagger, so I tried to stab him, but it was swatted out of my hand. The swat was followed by claws right to my face. I let out a loud shriek at that, my hands coming up to hide my face. Blood was everywhere. I fell to my knees, knowing that it was my last breath...<BR>Have you ever felt such a complete knowledge of death that you actually felt resignation? That's what I felt in those mere seconds that passed. Not that I wanted to die, I assure you, but I knew I was going to die and, well, there was nothing I could do about it. It was then I realized, well, something was supposed to happen. I took a chance peek and blinked. The lion lay there, looking just over my shoulder, as tame as could be. Well...it certainly looked tamed. He wasn't killing me.<BR>So, I did what anyone else would do...I turned and looked. A blonde elf stood there looking so much like Lyn that I blinked, but decided it couldn't be--there wasn't that vague suggestion of fear in her eyes that was always in Lyn's, not quite blotted out; I knew why of course, but I can't write it down here.<BR>Anyhow, I knew off the bat she was a druid. Why? Because she murmured something beneath her breath and, magically, the deep rents in my skin began to close and heal so not even a scar would remain. My eyes widened. I had known Grandmother could do this but to have it done upon oneself was..unsettling.<BR>"Hail, traveler," she said rather cheerfully as the lion got to his feet and fawned all over her. Now that really unnerved me.<BR>"Hail," I replied, somewhat cautiously.<BR>Her smile was gently amused. "Where are you headed?" she asked curiously. Of course, since she saved my life, I didn't get irritated like I usually did (those questions put my back up, never did like people prying into my life. Grandmother always said I was too sensitive, but still!)<BR>"Kelethin," I replied promptly. She nodded slightly, and I went on, "How did you happen upon me just now?" So I ask the questions I don't like asked of me. She started it. That doesn't make me a hypocrite. (No, really! ... let's just drop the subject)<BR>"Wandering around in complete boredom," she said drily. "Have you ever been to Kelethin before?" I shook my head. "Well, come on. The day's wasting."<BR>We reached Kelethin in a few days. She knew every step of the way. And she helped me out a lot, showing me around Kelethin before mentioning something about a place named "Qeynos" that she wished to visit. I wished her good luck with true sincerity.<BR>That is all I can really think of writing today, and I have things that need to be done, as always. My life here is far from dull.<BR>Farewell. <P>------------------<BR><I>Heraldess Vaelyna Skyrunner</I><BR>  <IMG SRC="http://homepages.go.com/~sandineko/vaelyna.jpg">  <BR>     <B>44th Season Nature Walker</B><BR>     <I>Sister to Vollyra</I><BR>*NOR/HE - EQ - Xegony</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">{Section Six:  Reunion in Kelethin}<P>Vaelynn came back one evening from a nice round of hunting, her eyes bright with life. Kelethin seemed to be the balm she needed; time away from her home finally let her heal her wounds. There was sadness in her, yes, but it wasn't always there anymore. She even flirted here, and gained a few admirers. It was, she had to admit, fun. But not nearly as fun as it would be with Lyn here. <BR>At the thought of Lyn, she glanced down to the parchment sent to her by way of a nice, obliging bird. A nightingale in fact (Lyn always had a special fondness for them). She should be here sometime today, and would look her up. <BR>Vae had to admit she was rather impatient. It had been a long time since the two had seen each other. She frowned impatiently, before grabbing her journal for the first time in a long time and began scribbling. It helped pass the time, at least. <P>"I love Kelethin. I have made two great friends here, by the names of Haleran and Nenel. And I have been accepted into a great guild, the New OutRiders. I know Lyn would love it as well. The people are friendly and nice, and really quite helpful. It gives me a true sense of belonging. <BR>"But Haleran and Nenel are near a city called Qeynos, a place of humans. They both want me to come but I wish to spend time with my sister first. Then I will be on my way, for I know Lyn will want to come as well when it is time. In fact, right now I am waiting for my dearest friend to come. Today is the day we shall see each other again. I have missed her so! The late-night talks, the things we always did that seemed a little silly but was fun anyway." <P>She frowned slightly as she paused in her writing, staring down at the journal for a long moment. It was harder for her to write today, despite her anxiety and impatience. Being as absorbed in trying to funnel that impatience, she jumped at a knock on her door, then raced to open it. <BR>"Lyn!" She wasn't quite surprised to see the familiar face when she opened the door, and her smile was huge as she ushered her in quickly. <BR>"Oh, Vae, Kelethin is grand, isn't it?" Lyn asked excitedly, her eyes dancing, her hands moving gracefully as she spoke, a torrent of words spilling from her. "When I got here I loved it. Houses in trees. "It's just so charming! And there's something about this place, friendly and kind and warm. Not to mention all the cute guys," she added a trifle wickedly. Vaelynn sat back and laughed, her eyes dancing. <BR>"I love it too," she replied with a little giggle. "And oh, how easy it is to make friends! Why, I have so much to tell you!" <BR>In the space of mere seconds the girls' heads were bowed together as they spoke excited of what had occurred in the time they had spent away from each other, laughing at one thing and near to tears at others. If any had been there to witness the event they would have smiled at the sight...<P>------------------<BR><I>Heraldess Vaelyna Skyrunner</I><BR>  <IMG SRC="http://homepages.go.com/~sandineko/vaelyna.jpg">  <BR>     <B>44th Season Nature Walker</B><BR>     <I>Sister to Vollyra</I><BR>*NOR/HE - EQ - Xegony</FONT>
