Asheron's Call Standards & Conventions Supplement

This document SUPPLEMENTS the NOR Guild Standards and Conventions. All members are expected to comply with this document as well as the NOR Guild Charter and NOR Guild Standards & Conventions.

I. STANDARDS 
A. The Guild EPI (Epithet) shall be in all Capital {CAPS} letters and shall follow this format:
*NOR/SQ-AC
Where:
* = Cross (Star)
NOR = The Guild
/ = The Sword
SQ = your rank
- = a separator
AC = your "home" Duchy (Host)
This format should be used when corresponding with a fellow NOR either by e-mail, or when posting on the NOR Bulletin Boards, except where the use of such , would interfere with a Role Play. 
( e.g.: NOR Graywolf *NOR/BA-AC )

B. Names (NOR Jacket) - A NOR Jacket, "NOR <Name>," is required for affiliation and identification to your NOR Brothers and Sisters as well as other guild entities in Asheron's Call. The traditional 'NOR' name is turned into 'Nor' by the servers, this is accepted as the norm.
1. Because of the difficulty in starting a new character in AC, the practice of wearing a NOR Jacket will be optional to those new members with existing characters. The wearing of a NOR Jacket refers to placing NOR in front of the character's name.
2. However the player will be Required to use the NOR Jacket if he/she chooses to start a new character. All transferring NOR must use the NOR Jacket unless the above applies.
3. Members will be required to swear allegiance to a NOR member so that your Monarch is New Outriders. This identifies you as being in the Guild of NOR to everyone in the game.
4. Any character on the roster, or in the allegiance tree, regardless if they are wearing a Jacket or not, will be subject to the Standards and Conventions of NOR and this Duchy. Only one name will be allowed on the Roster. Alternates of the same character name and persona are permitted, and should join the tree to support the guild. Alternate characters of different names are not considered NOR. (I.E 'Graywolf', 'Nor Graywolf', 'NOR Graywolf II' and 'Graywolf Mule' will all be considered the same NOR member/persona.) Other alternate names will not be recognized as NOR. NOR will disavow any knowledge of association between a non-NOR alternate and the guild.

II. CONVENTIONS
A. Greetings - A greeting of "HAIL *NOR/" should be given to all your fellow NOR upon meeting up. This can be done by typing /tell <name>, Hail *NOR/. You can Add guild mates to your friends list by typing in the chat bar "/friends add <name>" This way, you will know when another NOR logs on or off and you can greet them with the "/Tell <name>, Hail *NOR/"
B. Party Traveling - Is part of the fun in the AC but there are certain rules that should be followed. They are: Party travel is at the discretion of the party forming, and depending on the situation. Individual discretion should be used at all times. 
1. Groups - *NEVER* join anyone without first asking (and receiving) permission. In AC, as in real life, it is considered very rude to join someone's group without permission.
C. Last KILL... Please try and not take the last hit in a battle unless you are fighting right along with the party. It is Very Rude to run up and take the last kill if you where not fighting in the first place. 
D. Dyeing. You will die in this game but please try and keep track of where you are. It makes it a little easier to play "Find the Body" In AC if you have a general idea of where your body is. If you keep track it makes it a little easier to get your Items back.
