</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">	The city was a filthy place.  As the women walked, skirts were hiked up to show a bit of ankle, simply to keep from staining their clothing of the mud charitably called a street.  Drunkards lay about everywhere, snoring in alleys or guzzling down their latest bit of filched spirits.  Dogs yawned in patches of sun, filthy homes for fleas and disease-carrying insects.  Barrows were pushed by malnourished farmers trying to just get enough money for that night's dinner.<P>And this was just the lower end of the middle-class town.  As the black carriage made its agonizingly slow way toward the square, the occupants spoke softly about the newest bit on the market.<P>"Prime, I tell you.  Young enough to be trained but not too young as to need attention every wakin' minute!" one said firmly.  He was a portly man, with a round, cheerful face and bright blue eyes.<P>"Too young to take punishment," came the soft reply.  This one was tall and thin, with cold, dead eyes and a mocking half-smile.  His influence was great, but everyone felt trepidation around him.  He was almost…inhuman.<P>"I hear," the shorter man said, ignoring his comment, "that she'll grow to be a great beauty."<P>"We'll see about that."<P><BR>*****************~~~~~~~~~~*****************<P><BR>She was huddled in the corner, trying to ignore the noise.  Everyone was talking, yelling, ordering, snarling words; at her, at others, at no one in particular.  Tiny hands clasped over tiny ears, eyes shut tight against the horrible sights before her.<P>This place was so different from home.  What was she doing here?  Why did he bring her here?  What was happening?  She didn't understand much of what they were saying, though she gathered this was a place where things were sold and bought, and she was to stay quiet.  There were no other little girls in this cell they shoved her in-not quite a cell but not a room either.  There were three walls, then another wall made of iron bars.  Everyone looked inside, staring, peering, then muttering among themselves.<P>And it was cold.  So very, very cold.  She shivered.  Dragged here in only her rags, she had no protection from the elements.  Her tunic had holes in it, barely covering her knees and not at all covering her arms.  Someone, another in the cell-room, she supposed, had draped a little cloak over her, thinner than her own shirt and providing little warmth, but she felt comforted.<P>The pitying looks tossed her way were missed as she tried to block out the world.  The other women to be sold whispered among themselves, saddened less by their own fate, taken for granted by now, but for hers.  She was so young, and so pretty under the dirt and grime.  Why her eyes, they were so large and such an unusual shade of green.  Her hair, they thought, was dark with streaks of red and gold.  She was also tiny for her age, but her bone structure was fine and delicate; if she was cleaned up and dressed in the proper clothes, why, she would pass for a princess.<P>"Songbird," the called her, for that was what she answered to.  When the little girl was asked her name, she looked blank for a moment before hesitating and whispering softly-so very softly-"my little songbird".<P>"All right everyone, up and on your feet!  You need your baths to look your best!" came the shout.  Everyone stood, and a couple nudged the little girl to her feet, taking her with them as they waded their way through the confusion to the baths.  It was empty, for no one wanted to be tainted by the slaves.  The water was warm, but everyone washed quickly for fear of pinches and prods by the overseers, who were legendary for their impatience.<P>Songbird hesitated by the edge of the baths, her big green eyes troubled and worried.  She was afraid of the water, having never been to a bath before, much less a pond or lake.  It seemed so deep, so imposing!<P>"In y'go!" one of the overseers snarled, shoving her in.  Being as small as she was, in a grown woman's bath, she flailed in it-not knowing how to swim, or float.  Before she had managed to take in two gulps of water, one of the women-for nearly all had their eye on the little girl, except those jealous of how much she would possibly bring on the auction block-pulled her out of the water and whispered comforting words, setting her on the edge and pulling off her soaked tunic, grabbing the soap, determined to see her washed and clean.  Hopefully she would catch the eye of someone merciful and kind.<P>"It's okay, little one," she told Songbird, smoothing a hand over the caked and matted hair, tears stinging her eyes.  She had been sold, what, ten times now?  She remembered her first selling, at ten years old-confused, worried, not understanding, and this lent her greater compassion to the child.  Songbird just stared at her, eyes wide and trusting, giving herself up to the older woman's ministrations mutely.<P>By the time the overseer called for the end of the bathing, Songbird was cleaner than she probably had ever been.  Her hair wasn't dark as they had thought, but auburn.  Her skin was pale, despite how much she must have been in the sun, and she was beautiful even at six.  The woman smiled with maternal pride, and smoothed the wet locks of hair away from Songbird's face.  "You will fetch a price, Songbird, oh aye you will," she said, blinking away tears.  <I>But, gods, she would never be free again.</I><P>The black tunics and skirts were handed out-black, to show they were harem material.  As she dressed herself and the little one in them, her heart almost broke as her hand was taken in a firm grip by a tiny replica of her own.  <I>She's just a child,</I> her heart wailed.  <I>Why would she have to be put through this hell?</I><P>As they returned to their cell-room, clean now, having been freshly scrubbed as they washed, she whispered softly in Songbird's ear, "My name is Angela.  Don't worry-everything will be all right."<P>And Songbird looked up at her, with those huge eyes and trusting, yet sad little face, "Mama?"<BR><P>------------------<BR><I>Heraldess Vaelyna Skyrunner</I><BR> <IMG SRC="http://www.dianarae.dreamhost.com/EQ/vaelyna.jpg">   <BR><B>47th Season Nature Walker</B><BR>*NOR/HE - EQ - Xegony<P>-=| <I>the coursing river is the music of the soul; peaceful and volatile, beautiful and imperfect</I> |=-<BR>..: <B>to find perfection is to be immersed in boredom; to be surrounded by imperfection is to ensure fascination</B> :..</FONT>
