I‘m not lost! Turned around maybe but not lost"</p><p>I was born on a beautiful summer day, the sky was blue and the birds were singing in the trees.  My childhood was similar to most children I think but my papa, Jnar4u, and my mama, Anaidni; both were upstanding and loyal citizens of the town of NeverWinter on the world of AOL.  My papa started teaching me how to protect myself at a very early age.  I have many happy memories of him and Uncle Brand beating each other to a pulp in Port Llast and then one or the other running back from the temple when they lost.  Uncle Brand wasn‘t really my uncle but it sure seemed like it, he was always with papa and watching his back.  I felt very safe when I was with them.<br><br>Papa took care of me because mama disappeared one day when I was around 12.  We searched and searched for her but she was never found again.  Papa thought that one of those Mechs might have stolen her for ransom but no ransom was ever asked.  I think she took a wrong turn and ran into the Beholder‘s.  I have always hated the Beholder‘s but the walk there was beautiful and mama had often gone there to meditate.<br><br>Uncle Brand was as inconsolable as papa at her loss and to ease some of the pain he decided to join a group called The New OutRiders.  He thought that would give him a chance to keep looking for mama while still exploring the land.  As I grew into my teen years Uncle Brand introduced me to many of the New OutRiders.  There was NOROldWolf, Gnicht, Kyrin, LadyGwen, NORStorm, NORKatera and many others.  As I watched and learned I came to respect this band of people.  They were friends, they helped others and they generally had a great time.  I wanted to be all of these things so when I turned 18 I asked papa if I could leave home and cast my lot with this wonderful group of people.<br><br>Papa gave his consent and I requested membership with Uncle Brand as my sponsor.  I had to take some Philosophy classes to learn more about the beliefs of the guild and then I was made a NEW member.  I worked hard and didn‘t stay NEW for long.  I was squired within a few weeks and quickly worked my way up the ranks.  I was a Squire Court when I married NOROldWolf, unfortunately the marriage did not last long due to his untimely death at the hands of the nastiest of creatures, AOLBilling.  It was a dreaded name in the land of NeverWinter and everyone shuddered when they heard it.<br><br>I was on my own again, this time I didn‘t have papa to rely on as he had re-married to LdyJnar, a wonderful person that belonged to the group called The Protectorate and they were both very busy with their new lives.  I was wandering around and someone kept following me and asking me silly questions.  He kept angering me but I stayed true to my NOR beliefs and did not rise to the bait.  I ultimately found out that this was non other than NORKyrin in disguise.  NORKyrin was a baron in the guild and we were passing acquaintances.  We had met on the day of NORStorm and NORKatera‘s wedding.  NORKyrin had kindly volunteered to escort me to the wedding.  We quickly became friends and found out we had many interests that we shared.  He taught me many quests in the land and eventually I become a Quest Master.  <br><br>We both rose in rank until one day he was the Duke of Long Saddle and I was the Countess of Triboar.  We then discovered our love for each other and we had a beautiful winter wedding that was presided over by LORDCat and standing in for me was NORKatera and for NORKyrin was our good friend NORRad.<br><br>Our happiness was short-lived as we found out that a great darkness was approaching our beloved land of NeverWinter, we would have to find a new home.  Ultima, Dark Sun and Empyriana were suggested but NORKyrin and I decided to wander in the wilderness for a while.  We landed in Dark Sun for a short while but we both found it to be a bit cold and unfriendly.  Even though our good friend NORStorm had also come to that land it just wasn‘t enough.  By this time my husband had decided to change his name back to the one he had originally had in NOR and he became NOREagle once again.  We had a child on the way and needed a more permanent that was friendly so we moved on to Empyriana, hoping that this would be our final home.  Our child was born there but Eagle had to travel to far distant places and I was unhappy being alone with the child.  In the end I ended up traveling with Eagle and the child for several years but eventually I got tired of living out of backpacks.  <br><br>We had to decide where to go and I stumbled across a message board on the outskirts of a small town in the land of Norrath.  It said that many New OutRiders had settled down in the town of Rathe.  I quickly convinced Eagle that this was where we should try to settle down and we traveled there quickly.  We found many old friends and discovered some new friends as well.  However, Eagle was totally satisfied with our new town, he no longer had a command and he missed being a leader.  When the call went out by the government of Norrath that Rathe was too large and a new town was being built in the wilderness Eagle‘s eyes lit up.  Here was his chance at leadership of his own.  He petitioned the High Council to begin a branch of NOR in the new town of Zebuxorouk and his petition was granted.  We now live there very happily and we are slowly growing larger.  Soon our child will be old enough to start learning the ways of NOR and Norrath and life will continue to be good.<br><br>Papa and his Lady settled in the town of Cazic-Thule and I occasionally pay them a visit and they are very happy there.  Life is good again.<br></p><p>Homepage: <a href="www.newoutriders.net/Zeb" target="new">www.newoutriders.net/Zeb</a><p>Previous games played in as NOR: NeverWinter Nights on AOL, Dark Sun Online, Empyriana</p><hr width=50%><p>Characters of Cnedra:</p><p><b>Cnedrann</b></p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Server played on: EQ-Zeb &nbsp; &nbsp; Class: Wizard &nbsp; &nbsp; Level: 42 &nbsp; &nbsp; Race: High Elf &nbsp; &nbsp; Gender: Female<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Current Equipment: Blackened Crystalline Robe
