      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">Here
      are some items of importance to help you within the NOR Duchies of Norrath</font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">Guild
      functions: Everquest has guild functions built right into the game! What
      does this mean to you? When you are invited to join the guild, you will
      see a yes/no selection box appear. A guild officer or GM must invite you
      while in the same game zone as yourself. Select yes to become of member of
      *NOR/ according to Everquest's guild rules. Note that your squiring
      ceremony is your true induction to the guild; the game function merely
      places the New OutRiders name over your head while you are traveling in
      Norrath.</font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">Once
      you are a member of the guild, you will be able to speak on the guild
      channel and hear others. To hear others, all you need do is have your
      guildchat filter turned ON. To speak to other members of *NOR/, simply
      type /guildsay and your message, or you can also set your default chat
      mode to &quot;guild&quot;; then everything you type without chat filter of
      /gsay /tell or /say will go to the guild channel.</font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">Everquest
      denotes one person of *NOR/ as the GM. This person will generally be the
      Duke or Duchess of the Duchy. Only the GM can appoint officers (Everquest's
      definition of officer is a member who can invite others into the guild as
      regular members). Appointed officers can invite players into the guild,
      but not as officers. Please note that this Everquest definition of officer
      is not the same as *NOR/'s definition of officer. A *NOR/ officer is any
      member of the rank Herald/Heraldess, BA/BS, CT/CS, etc. Not all officers
      of *NOR/ are denoted EQ officers. The purpose of game officers is merely
      to assist the DK/DC in tagging new members when they are far away from the
      DK/DC in the game, or when the DK/DC is not in game when someone needs to
      receive the guild tag.</font></span></p>

      <span style="color: black; layout-grid-mode: line; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">You
      can have a variety of names. Any of them can be tagged as guild members in
      game, regardless of race, class or level, as long as the names meet the
      guild naming policy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>Please refer to the Guild Naming Policy Document.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>Also note, </span>De-tagging of your Main Guild Name character will
      be considered as a resignation from NOR. Using NOR to level an alternate
      character only to remove them to another guild may be the cause of
      disciplinary action.</font></font></span></p>

      As a new player in Everquest, you will find your guildmates to be very
      helpful! This is what we do, of course. You are expected to do likewise,
      but within the limits of your race/class/level. No one is expected to give
      the shirt off his or her own back. However, while traveling about, help
      others as best you can, through buffing (casting beneficial spells upon
      them), healing, or assisting with mobs that are within your range of
      ability to combat. Answering players questions about locations, traveling,
      quests, armor, weapons and items is also a good way to show your *NOR/
      colors. We are very proud of our knowledge and skills in the game in our
      Duchies! We have a great reputation in this world, and expect everyone to
      contribute to the furthering of it. Remember that as in other games, the
      golden rule is always a good guide. Treat other players, as you would like
      to be treated in turn.</span></font></font></span>

      Kill stealing is expressly forbidden by *NOR/. If another player or party
      has attacked a mob, before you and/or your party, and has not asked for
      your help, nor appear to need it, do not attack their target. If you do
      more damage than the party, you would have gained the experience and
      stolen their kill. Respect the rights of others, but expect your own
      rights to be respected as well. If you are uncomfortable with the behavior
      of any of your party members, leave the group if you cannot convince them
      to behave better.</span></font></p>

      PvP is an optional activity. Many of our members choose to duel other
      players to hone their skills and test their abilities. You are never
      required to combat another player unless it is your choice to. Just beware
      that there are arenas in the game, places in which you become PvP,
      involuntarily, as soon as you enter them. There are such areas in the
      major cities in the game, but not only there. You will see a message
      telling you that you have entered a PvP area if you should do so.</span></font></p>

      Norrath has a unique economy. You will need loot and money to improve your
      armaments and weapons, obtain magical items, do certain quests, obtain
      food and drink, buy services from other players and buy spells if you are
      a casting class. The Duchies of NOR/ have a great reputation for
      generosity as well. Many members freely give items and money to other
      guildmates and non-NOR/ players in the game. Some donate items and money
      to the *NOR/ treasury, which was established to help out younger members,
      rebuild a character's equipment in the case of a lost character disaster,
      and to fund guild expertise in the trade skills. However, no member is
      required to give money or items to other members of the guild or to
      players in Everquest in general. You are encouraged to do so, if you have
      no need of a particular item, or a need for the cash proceeds from its
      sale.</span></font></p>

      From time to time there will be guild sponsored events. You are encouraged
      to participate in such events, as they allow you an opportunity to spend
      time with guild mates that you would not normally be able to travel with
      due to level differences. You can also plan and conduct an event of your
      own, if you have an idea for one. Any member can run an event.</span></font></p>

      find other guild members in the game, simply type /who all new for the
      Rathe Duchy or /who zeb all for the Zebuxoruk Duchy. Remember that if you
      use the anonymous function, which removes your level and class from your
      character info available to others, you also remove yourself from being
      recognized in game by other guild members.</font></span></p>

      visit our message post board often! There you will find current events in
      the Duchies, as well as news of events, items available and information
      about the various aspects of the game. Other members of *NOR/ will be glad
      to help you with obtaining information about an item or quest, but be
      advised that the web contains a wealth of information as well. Some quests
      are lengthy and involved, and it is more practical in some cases to read a
      detailed description at one of the many well-known web sites than to try
      to get this information in the game via tells. But ask your guild first,
      and you will be pointed in the right direction! Or ask on the message
      board, many of our members visit that site every day.</font></span></p>
