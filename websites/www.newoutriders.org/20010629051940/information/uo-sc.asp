      <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000080"><b>Ultima
      Online Standards &amp; Conventions
      Supplement</b></font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This document SUPPLEMENTS the NOR Guild Standards and Conventions.  All members are expected to comply with this document as well as the NOR Guild Charter and NOR Guild Standards &amp; Conventions.&nbsp;</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I. STANDARDS&nbsp;</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A. The Guild EPI (Epithet) shall be in all Capital {CAPS} letters and shall follow this format:&nbsp;<br>
   *NOR/SQ-UO</font>
      <p>   <font face="Arial" size="2">   Where:&nbsp;<br>
      *   = Cross (Star)&nbsp;<br>
      NOR = The Guild&nbsp;<br>
      /   = The Sword&nbsp;<br>
      SQ  = your rank&nbsp;<br>
      -   = a separator&nbsp;<br>
      UO = your "home" Duchy (Host)</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This format should be used when corresponding with a fellow NOR either by e-mail, or when posting on the NOR Bulletin Boards, except where the use of such , would interfere with a Role Play.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">( e.g.:  NOR Alkins *NOR/CT-UO )</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">B.  Names (NOR Jacket) - A NOR Jacket, "NOR &lt;Name>," is required for affiliation and identification to your NOR Brothers and Sisters as well as other guild entities in Ultima Online.</font>
      <p>   <font face="Arial" size="2">   1. Because of the difficulty in starting a new character in UO, the practice of wearing a NOR Jacket will be optional to those members with existing characters. The wearing of a NOR Jacket refers to placing NOR in front of the characters name.</font>
      <p>   <font face="Arial" size="2">   2.  However the player will be Required to use the NOR Jacket if he/she chooses to start a new character. All transfering NOR must use the NOR Jacket unless the above implies.</font>
      <p>   <font face="Arial" size="2">   3. Any character on the roster, regardless if they are wearing a Jacket or not , will be subject to the Standards and Conventions of NOR and this Duchy. Only one name will be allowed on the Roster. Alts will not be recognized as NOR. NOR will disavow any knowledge of association between an alt and the guild.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">II. CONVENTIONS&nbsp;</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A. Greetings -    A greeting of "HAIL *NOR" should be given to all your fellow NOR upon meeting up.  This can be done by typing HAIL *NOR [name].</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">B. Party Traveling - Is part of the fun in the UO but there are certain Rules that should be followed.  They are:  Party travel is at the discretion of the party forming and depending on the situation. and individual discretion should be used in most cases.</font>
      <p>   <font face="Arial" size="2">   1.  Groups - *NEVER* join anyone without first asking (and receiving) permission.  In UO, as in real life, it is considered very rude to join someone's group without permission.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">C.  Theft - Although NOR is a neutral guild, it's purpose is to provide ALL players with enjoyment. This prevents  NOR characters from taking part in larcenous behavior.  This in mind, no one, under ANY circumstances, should engage in trading with intent to cheat the other party, or receive goods in a trade without meeting the agreed upon conditions of said trade.  NOR characters should NOT engage in house theft or picking pockets of other player characters.  Any characters who do so and are caught will be dealt with at the discretion of the GM and the Officers of NOR not excluding the HC.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">D) PK - Player Killing is defined as the unprovoked attacking of other player characters with intent to kill or harm them, PK is expressly
      forbidden to all NOR characters, exceptions to this rule are as follows:</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">1. Actively hunting PKers will not be tolerated. ie. seeking or hunting them out specifically with the intention of attacking and/or
      killing them.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">2. The first strike attack option may only be used when a NOR in good conscience feels their safety, or those of their group, is threatened
      if a first attack is not made. (Such as randomly running across a PKer who always attacks you or other NORs on site.) If however the attacked
      player does not return fire or asks you not to pursue the attack, the attack must immediately cease.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">3. A NOR member may also initiate a first attack on any player character when in defense of personal or NOR Guild property.  If a
      player is occupying a members domicile, or is in possesion of some property belonging to that member, which was taken as a result of
      being attacked, killed or stolen from, then retrieving the items is allowed.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">4. The NOR member may recruit other NOR members for the purpose of satisfying condition number three above, within a reasonable amount
      of time from the time when the PK character first committed the act.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">5. All first strike attacks by any NOR of the ranks Squire through Champion will be reported to member's Baron/Baroness or next higher
      ranking officer, preferably one who is online at the moment so other&nbsp;<br>
      NORs can be warned if needed. Required information to be passed on is the name of the other party, date, time, location and reason for the
      attack.  This can be done via e-mail or icq.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">6. Looting will not be allowed, with the exception of retrieving items recently stolen from another NOR.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(See the UO *NOR PvP Philosophy Supplement for clarification of these rules)</font>
