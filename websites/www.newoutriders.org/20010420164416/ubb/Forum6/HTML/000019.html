</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">There were times when the storm was at its worst, when the wind would pull and tug at one's hair, coil like a whip and lash at one's body.  The moon would be hidden behind the angry barrier of the seething clouds, pelting hail at the land below, uncaring of who or what was in the way.  This was a time of anxiety and fear for many of the village people; many children would hide, for they feared this anger they felt in the air.  The woodland kin, or wood elves, were often most afraid of these storms, for sometimes light would flash in the sky, and strike at their trees, bringing the dreaded fire to their forest homes.<BR>	These storms didn't happen all too often, although rain was common.  Walkers could predict when it would come upon them, but not how fierce the storm would be.   They would have a premonition of darkness, which would be the storm; storms blocked all light, making the day seem night and the night seem more sinister than ever before.<BR>	Of course, not everywhere is dark and gloomy during these times.  There is a tavern, where laughter reigns supreme and stories are shared by a warm fire; ale and wine is a person's main course and dinner is served straight from the kitchens, hot and filling, the gentle aroma of stew and smoked venison sifting throughout the main room.  Here old friends and new meet and gather, to talk or eat in silence, it matters not; this is the tavern where many New Outriders decide to rest during their travels, as well as many friends of the Outriders.<BR>	It was during such a storm a small commotion could be heard outside, but the noises were muffled.  Those within the tavern still laughed and talked, but those nearest the door suddenly turned quiet and looked outside as they heard the racket.  Soon a small lull came over all conversations as everyone tried to locate the center of attention.<BR>	Unbeknownst to those within, a young bard was struggling through the constant pelting of hail, carrying a large, water-proof bag behind her.  Her nose was red from the cold, auburn hair plastered against her skull, her clothes soaked through.  Who was this person?  When she was to enter the tavern, it would take a second look to figure out her identity.  For now, no one saw her, until two riders came up from behind…<BR>	"Hail *NOR/!!" a familiar voice shouted nearly in her ear.  The bard stumbled to her knees and turned, squinting and putting a hand to her forehead in an effort to deter the hail.<BR>	"Hail *NOR/, sister," she managed to choke out in between catching her breath.  A slender hand helped her up, as violet eyes glanced at the bag.<BR>	"What is this, Lys?" the rider asked, arching a brow.<BR>	"Just some things for the Duke," the bard replied with a dainty shrug, and beamed a smile at the so-far quiet rider.  "Hi Tale!" she exclaimed, green eyes dancing.  "What a surprise, to see you and Volly here."<BR>	Voll's eyes danced.  "We decided to drop in, since we were passing by anyway."  A fond smile was placed upon the barbarian as he just smiled slightly and nodded to Lys.<BR>	"Hello, little sister," he murmured, dismounting to pick up her bag and toss it on the back of his mount.  "Do you want to ride?"<BR>	"No, no, I'm fine," Lys replied, finally having caught her breath, and glanced up at the sky, scowling.  "This stupid storm," she muttered softly.<BR>	"Lys we'll meet you at the tavern," Vollyra said with a grin.  "Let's see who'll win, shall we?"  With those words she nudged her mount into a canter, then a flat-out run, Tale quickly following suit.  The bard rolled her eyes with a soft laugh.<BR>	"And even then she believes she can beat me, eh?" she asked the sky, grabbing her drums.<BR>	In seconds she passed up the two riders, trailing blue-and-silver sparkles in her wake.<BR>	The commotion heard in the tavern was that of laughter and shouted mock-threats, as well as the thunderous beat of hooves.  All this became louder the closer to the tavern they came, until Lys barreled through the door, sparkling lights, drums, curses and all.  Vollyra slid in just moments later as Tale saw to the horses.<BR>	The entire tavern was treated to the sight of a druid tackling a bard, her momentum enough to slide the both of them along the floor quite a ways.<BR>	"<B>HAIL *NOR/!!!!!</B>" they both shouted in unison.  A surprised pause followed, before someone yelled,<BR>	"<B>HAIL *NOR/ HERALDESS VAELYS!</B>!"<BR>	The shouted replies were almost deafening, as Lys and Voll shoved theirselves up into a standing position.  Taledor entered then, lugging Lys's bag behind him.  Lys waved to familiar people…<BR>	<I>Tenlaar</I> and <I>Silvie</I>, waving with a smile and a laugh; <I>Kyalla</I>, sipping ale by the fire and grinning at her fondly; <I>Mavieck and Gramoran</I> involved in a heated debate with <I>Tenlaar</I> and <I>Silvie</I>, as usual.<BR>	"<B>CAW!!!!!</B>"<BR>	Vaelys turned to the door as Ravenwood, Ravenswing, and Ravenharm entered, putting her hands to her mouth and shouting back, "Caw!" in reply, running and giving them all hugs.  "Hey everyone!" she said with a laugh.<BR>	"Hey sis," Wingy replied, nodding politely to all the NOR's seated within.  "I heard you were actually traveling without your sparkly lights today!  What's up?" she asked with an arched brow.<BR>	"Welllllllllll," Lys replied with a laugh, "I decided I was going to stay slow so I could look pitiful and get a lot of help with my paperwork, but that plan went down the drain when I had to race Voll and Tale here!"<BR>	"Oh no!" Wingy snickered.  "You poor thing," she added, unsuccessfully keeping the laughter from her voice.<BR>	"Hail *NOR/!"  Gustin stepped in then, nodding politely to the Ravens and smiling at his Heraldess with a wicked twinkle in his eye.  "Have you the papers I requested?"<BR>	A scowl twitched her full lips, though an answering twinkle was in her eye.  "Aye, Your Grace.  They are in the bag over there…have fun sorting them out," she added with sugary-sweetness, indicating he had a nasty surprise awaiting him.  Gustin eyed her for a long moment before wandering to the bag, as she turned her attention back to the Ravens, Volly following behind with little skips, obviously happy with herself for ambushing Vaelys on the way there.<BR>	"Did you all hear about…" Lys began, and the little group made their way to the fire, speaking in hushed tones.  Words like tower, Iceclad Ocean, gnolls, and Shadow were heard by any near them.<P><BR>------------------<BR><I>Heraldess Vaelyna Skyrunner</I> ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ <I>Vaelys Nightingale</I>~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ <I>Vaelynn Wolfeheart</I><BR>  <IMG SRC="http://homepages.go.com/~sandineko/vaelyna.jpg">       <BR><B>47th Season Nature Walker</B>~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ <B>31st Season Songbird</B>~*~*~*~*~*~*~ <B>20th Season Nature Warder</B><BR><I>Sister to Vollyra</I><BR>*NOR/HE - EQ - Xegony<p>[This message has been edited by Vaelyna (edited 03-27-2001).]</FONT>
