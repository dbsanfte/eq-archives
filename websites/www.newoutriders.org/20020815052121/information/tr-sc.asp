      <br>
      This document SUPPLEMENTS the NOR Guild Standards and Conventions. All members are expected to comply with this document as well as the NOR Guild Charter, NOR Guild Standards &amp; Conventions.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      STANDARDS&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      A. The Guild EPI (Epithet) shall be in all Capital {CAPS} letters and shall follow this format:<br>
      <br>
      *NOR/SQ-EF-TR   (optional)<br>
      <br>
      Where:<br>
      * = Cross (Star)<br>
      NOR = The Guild<br>
      / = the sword&nbsp;<br>
      SQ = your rank<br>
      - = a separator<br>
      EF = your barony<br>
      TR = your "home" Duchy (Host)&nbsp;<br>
      (optional) = you may add the two letter designation for any award you have received, follow by a&nbsp;<br>
       "- " and a number if you've received more than 1 of the award or any additional title the&nbsp;<br>
                    individual obtained from the Order of Realm Masters. ie. *NOR/DC-TR  (KP/Mage)&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      This format should be used when corresponding with a fellow NOR either by e-mail, or when posting on the NOR Bulletin Boards, except where the use of such, would interfere with a Role Play.<br>
      <br>
      B. Names (NOR Jacket) - A NOR Jacket (Screen name), "NOR/N0R/Nor (Name)," is required for affiliation and identification to your NOR Brothers and Sisters as well as other guild entities in TRealm. Your title may be expanded to include special honors or titles, or these may optionally be included in your biography.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      C. Alternate Characters - Along with your NOR Jacket/Character, you have the ability to make additional Characters. You, as a NOR Member, should keep any and all of your Alternate Characters separate, private and confidential from your NOR Jacket. If you willingly and openly tell the guild of any Alternate Character, that Character can and will be held accountable to the laws of the NOR Guild.<br>
      <br>
      II. CONVENTIONS<br>
      <br>
      A. Greetings - A greeting of "HAIL *NOR" should be given to all your fellow NOR upon entering the NOR channel. This can be done by typing /join 47.  You will be seen entering the channel.  Members should try to maintain the NOR Channel up as often as possible.  Please keep private discussions to Tells or Groups so the guild channel can remain open for social conversation.&nbsp;<br>
      1. The Name of the Channel shall be either "NOR" or "NewOutriders" (stars, hearts, swords are optional).&nbsp;<br>
      2. The Topic of the Channel shall be NOR related (stars, hearts, swords are optional).&nbsp;<br>
      3. If the channel goes to a N/A status, it is the responsibility of all NOR on the channel to politely ask everyone in channel to leave in order to gain control of the channel.&nbsp;<br>
      4. If someone remains on the Channel, after being asked to leave, the NOR channel should move to another channel until control over the channel can be obtained, ie. 147, 247.&nbsp;<br>
      5. If the Mod for the channel is not a member of NOR, a NOR member should /t that person and politely ask him/her to give moderator privileges to the NOR in channel.  If he/she refuses to do so, the NOR channel should move to another channel until a NOR can obtain control over the  channel.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      B. Party Traveling - is part of the fun in the realms, but there are certain courtesies that should be followed.   Party travel is at the discretion of the party forming and depends on the situation.<br>
      Individual discretion should be used in most cases.  Respect the rights of others; if you are uncomfortable with the behavior of any of your party members leave the group.<br>
      <br>
      C. Groups - *NEVER* join anyone without first asking (and receiving) permission. In Realm, as in real life, it is considered very rude to join someone's group without permission.<br>
      <br>
      D. Theft - NOR is a neutral guild, it's purpose is to provide ALL players with enjoyment and prevents characters from taking part in larcenous behavior.  NOR characters may NOT engage in house theft or picking pockets of other player characters.  No one, under ANY circumstances, should engage in trading with intent to cheat the other party. Nor should they receive goods in trade without meeting the agreed upon conditions of said trade. Any character that does so and are caught will be dealt with at the discretion the Officers of The Realm not excluding the HC.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      E. Hacking &amp; Macros - The Realm's "Terms of Service" forbids hacking/macros and defines them as:&nbsp;<br>
      1. Developing or promoting programs that implement cheating or alter performance of the game.<br>
      2. Actively advocating or participating in the exploitation of bugs or loopholes in the Realm to cheat or to alter the performance of the game.<br>
      3. Using an outside program to cheat, to alter game performance, or to capitalize on bugs in the Realm.<br>
      4. Third party software is not allowed in the game to gain levels, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Hacking/macros are a TOS violation and NOR strictly prohibits their use.  If you alter the program code, or use any of the above-mentioned procedures, for any reason, you will be dismissed from the Guild.<br>
      <br>
      F. PvP - "Jumping" is defined as attacking other player characters with intent to do harm, without their having consented to player vs. player combat. Jumping by any NOR character is explicitly forbidden.  "PvP/Sparring" is defined as combat between two or more willing participants, and is perfectly acceptable under the NOR guidelines. Utmost care should be taken to ensure that all parties involved are aware of the consequences of such action. Self-defense against jumpers is acceptable also as jumping indicates consent to PvP combat.<br>
      <br>
      G) When asked by a fellow NOR, one should always respond with their Barony, Branch and the name of the Officer you report to in your Chain of Command.&nbsp;<br>

      <br>
      ADDENDUM:  The following are suggestions for party travel within The Realm (being a helpful discussion of the topic rather than a rule)<br>
      <br>
      Party Traveling Courtesies within The Realm<br>
      <br>
      1. Always ask the group members before gathering the group.  Always wait for ALL members to answer before gathering.&nbsp;<br>
      2. Group members should use the Sword icon (ALT minus sign) or type "Ready" if they are ready.  When asked if you are ready, you should respond as soon as possible.&nbsp;<br>
      3. If you are NOT ready or if you should have to go away from the keyboard for any reason, please let the group know.&nbsp;<br>
      4. If you will be afk for an extended period of time, ask the group if they mind. It is often more<br>
      courteous to leave the group and then join back up if your gonna be afk for long time.<br>
      5. Due to the jumping of beasties, the highest-level member of the group should go ahead&nbsp;<br>
      of group and summon the members into the screen for battle.<br>
      6. How the Treasure will be divided or collected should be determined at the beginning of&nbsp;<br>
      the hunt.<br>
      7. As much as possible prepare for group fighting before joining. Things such as obtaining potions and mana or repairing armor should be accomplished to the maximum extent prior to requesting a group.&nbsp;<br>
      8. It is considered polite to take care of casting protection-type spells without making others wait, i.e. cast while waiting to be summoned, waiting for party to meet in town.<br>
      9. Do not cast shields upon others without asking.  Most players have these shields enchanted on their armor.&nbsp;<br>
      10. The Golden Rule applies here!! Do not be rude or obnoxious!!! Use of obscene language is not acceptable within a group!!</font></p>
