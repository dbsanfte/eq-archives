              <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
              The &quot;Prime Directive&quot; of NOR is to have FUN!! We are in
              a Social Guild that, in comparison to some other Guilds, has very
              few rules and regulations, and we try to keep it that way. The
              Charter gives us the &quot;Goal&quot; and the Standards &amp;
              Conventions give us a &quot;Code of Conduct&quot; to follow to
              achieve that Goal. What follows is a basic idea of how NOR
              works... The What, Why, Where and How of NOR!!<br>
              <br>
              * The Guild's Objectives *<br>
              -------------------------------------<br>
              We try to make NOR a Guild for ALL people... we can't, of
              course... but we try!! And here's HOW we try...<br>
              <br>
              ** The Guild - We try to make it fun to be a member... Socializing
              and playing the games in each realm.<br>
              <br>
              ** The Advisors - An Elite Group of experienced NOR!! They provide
              help and Guidance for the entire Guild. While in some cases their
              time is limited... their knowledge of NOR is NOT!!<br>
              <br>
              ** The DMG - Each realm has its own Dungeon Masters Group, which
              is governed by their own tree structure. The goal is to learn and
              teach the game. The DMG is headed by a DME (Dungeon Master
              Emaritus, who is a member of the HC and oversees the DMG.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              ** The Officers - The most difficult job in NOR is being an
              Officer! The diverse background of NOR's members make the
              &quot;Job&quot; harder than you'll EVER try to do in RL! And NO!!
              We are NOT kidding!! It may be challenging, but NEVER boring.<br>
              <br>
              ** Promotions in NOR **<br>
              -------------------------------------<br>
              Almost everyone wants promotions! It is the PRIMARY responsibility
              of all Officers to recommend members for promotions when it's
              deserved!! Our philosophy on promotion?? Here are the basics:<br>
              <br>
              **DMG - Promotions are based on knowledge and skill in playing the
              game. If you have the knowledge and Skill Level.. you will
              progress quickly.<br>
              <br>
              **Advisors - By nomination and appointment only!! LOTSA time and
              experience in NOR are the main requirements. You must be nominated
              and approved by the HC of NOR. Don't be upset if you don't make it
              the 1st time... you must REALLY know NOR to get in there.<br>
              <br>
              **Officers - There are 2 major requirements... Time and Ability!!&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              Time - You MUST have hours to dedicate to NOR!! Obviously, 5 hours
              a week isn't enough to be an officer. And... if you are in a
              number of Guild(s) under another Character(s) your time will be
              limited. We have to know that you have enough time to devote to
              NOR to make it run smoothly!! In any case... we take each
              situation as it comes along&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              Ability - Do you have good organizational skills? Do you have good
              &quot;people&quot; skills? The &quot;Tree&quot; is designed to
              give the Duchy a basis for communicating information to all the
              members. How it is set up is up to the Duke/Duchess. They can
              modify the Tree to fit he needs of the Duchy and their own
              personal preferences. And .... You have to be able to talk to a 15
              yr. old student one minute and a 55 yr old Accountant the next...
              or maybe a 25 yr. old Chemical Engineer and a 35 yr. old
              Pharmacist!!.... etc. and communicate what you want!! Like I
              said.... challenging... but NEVER boring!! These abilities are not
              magically acquired... they are LEARNED!! The more you
              &quot;Learn&quot; or have already &quot;Learned&quot;... the
              higher you will progress in NOR. For the younger people out
              there... YES!! you CAN get there!!&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              **Members - Help your officers out. Recruit. Help with events.
              Help others learn the game (NOR and non-NOR). Behave yourself!!
              :-)<br>
              <br>
              *** General Stuff ****<br>
              **Macros - You've heard of them.... They detract from the game and
              are outlawed by most game services ..... AND NOR!!! Don't get
              caught usin' 'em!!<br>
              <br>
              **Other Guilds - There are many fine Guilds, NOR tries to maintain
              friendly relations with all of them. We do NOT consider ourselves'
              superior to them.... we are... well.... just NOR!! Period!!<br>
              <br>
              **Recruiting - We recruit ONLY those people and/or Characters that
              are NOT in any other Guild!!! Recruiting from ANY other Guild will
              NOT be sanctioned by the High Council in ANY way, shape or FORM!!
              Make sure you review your realms recruiting policy (check with
              your officer) if there is one.<br>
              <br>
              **Attitude - The Golden Rule applies here!! DO NOT be rude or
              obnoxious!! Do NOT pressure any person to join NOR!! Using obscene
              language is a SURE way to get kicked out of NOR!! Most of this is
              just common sense!!<br>
              <br>
              **Participation - Try to come on wearing your &quot;Jacket&quot;!!
              {NOR EPI} Be HERE!!! Be PROUD!!!!<br>
              <br>
              One last thing... The New OutRiders strictly prohibit hacking. If
              you alter the program code, or use hacking software for any
              reason, you will be dismissed from the Guild. If you know that
              someone in the game is hacking, just don't have anything to do
              with him/her. You want to be as far away from that person as
              possible. Please report any suspected hacking violations to your
              officer via ESP or email<br>
              .&nbsp;<br>
              This is a pretty short version of what NOR is all about.... and
              now... should you go out and recruit... hopefully you have most of
              the answers that people will ask. If you have specific
              questions... ask your DC/DK or write any HC member... they will be
              MORE that happy to answer you.<br>
