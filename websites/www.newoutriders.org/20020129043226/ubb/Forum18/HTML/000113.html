</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This post is quite long, but I think it's encessary to spell things out in this level of detail.  Please read the whole thing before commenting.  Suggestions are most welcome.<P><BR>	D R A F T<P>	Proposed Dungeon Masters Guild Structure for DAoC Realm<P>The DMG has two separate roles: trade skills, and knowledge of game <BR>mechanics and content.  The purpose of the trade skills section is to <BR>encourage the development of trade skills  and their use to benefit <BR>all members of the guild.  The purpose of the game knowledge section <BR>is to provide a home for those who enjoy playing the game in an <BR>analyzed, efficient, and disciplined manner, given that NOR is not a <BR>power gaming guild and many NORbies do not enjoy playing that way.<P><BR>NOTE ON DMG TITLES<P>The NOR charter defines DMG ranks.  These ranks are held in <BR>addition to one's true NOR rank, indicating the additional skills<BR>and responsibilities that a player takes on.  There will be three <BR>paths of advancement: class mentoring, raid (RvR) specialty, and<BR>trade skills support.  The Rank equivalencies are as follows:<P>Knight   (KP) Knight Protector, Assistant Artisan<BR>Champion (QS) Class Specialist, Raid Specialist, Guild Artisan<BR>Baron    (QM) Class Mentor, Raid Mastet, Trades Master<BR>Count    (DM) Dungeon Master<P>With the exception of DM, the DMG titles are honors held in<BR>addition to one's usual rank.  Also, multiple positions are<BR>possible (Due mainly to tradeskills).  The specific title shall be <BR>considered an "award" under the charter, and would be use in your <BR>NOR EPI as such.  For example, if Count Skorj were also a Guild<BR>Artisan (as an Armorsmith) his NOR EPI would be<P>*NOR/CT-DAoC (QS) Guild Armorer<P>If Squire Elite Aleena were an assistant guild armorer (tailoring)<BR>and Raid Master, her NOR EPI would be:<P>*NOR/SE-DAoC (QM) Raid Master, Assistant Tailor<P>DMG titles are not directy a NOR rank, as is shown, and aare specific <BR>to one branch.  However, a NORbie with a DMG title higher than his or <BR>her NOR rank will generally be earning faster advancement because of <BR>the duties of that DMG position.<P><BR>GAME KNOWLEDGE<P>(KP) Knight Protector<BR> * Understands the tactical roles of characters in combat (tank, <BR>   healer, nuker, melee damage dealer, etc).  And how to organize<BR>   an efficient party from an arbitrary collection of classes,<BR>   especially oddball combinations.<BR> * Understands his or her own class thouroughly from this <BR>   perspective, including the different spec choices available and<BR>   the consequences of these choices on the roles that character<BR>   will play.<BR> * Able to assist newbies in understanding these two elements.  Can<BR>   explain the point allocation choices available to his or her <BR>   class, and the roles that should and should not be attampted as a <BR>   result.<BR> * Has a basic understanding of game mechanics as relates to his<BR>   or her class, and can recommend  appropriate low level hunting <BR>   grounds based on armor and weapon types vs monster type and <BR>   starting location.<BR> * Participates regularly in guild raids and recruiting events,<BR>   and occasionallly organizes them.<P>(QS) Class Specialist<BR> * Thoroughly understands a class from newbie to high level, <BR>   including all class specific quests and important allocation and<BR>   faction choices.<BR> * Has a thourough understanding of the game mechanics as relates to<BR>   that class (what all the numbers mean, what changes based on the<BR>   specific details of the opponent, etc).<BR> * Follows the class-related websites and news from Mythic, informs <BR>   the guild through the message boards and other means of changes <BR>   relevant to that class.<BR> * Provides mentoring based on this knowledge to members of his or <BR>   her class.<BR> * Regularly plays alts of various levels in order to be able to <BR>   group with and assist NORbies learning the game.<BR> * Organizes recruiting events and participates in guild raids on a <BR>   regular basis.<BR> * Suggests to the appropriate Class Mentor players who should be <BR>   Knights Protector.<P>(QM) Class Mentor<BR> * Thoroughly understands a group of related classes (all melee, <BR>   healer, caster, or rogue) at the Class Specialist level.<BR> * Follows the class-related websites and news from Mythic, and <BR>   updates the guild when necessary (i.e., when no Class Specialist <BR>   for that class is active).<BR> * Is available when needed to assist a NORbie having problems with <BR>   his class, either in questing or allocation choices.  Makes this <BR>   a priority in adventuring.<BR> * Collects hand-me-down class specific items that are not currently <BR>   needed until such time as they are (or until the durability is <BR>   used up), establishing a guild vault character for this purpose.<BR> * Regularly reports to the DM the status of recruiting from that <BR>   class group, and recognizing problems if folks are leaving, along <BR>   with a roster of all DMG members in that class group.<BR> * Acts as a recruiting officer for members of that class group <BR>   (devises recruiting events and makes sure they happen regularly).<BR> * Responsible for recognizing and "promoting" up to Class <BR>   Specialist, with approval from the DM or Branch Leader.<P>(QS) Raid Specialist<BR> * Can organize and lead a multiple-group raid.  Understands how to <BR>   create effective groups from 20 or 30 people who actually show up <BR>   for a raid, whatever their class and level.<BR> * Understands the logistics of a successful raid (how to get <BR>   everyone to where they need to be at the time they need to be <BR>   there).  Works with guild craftsmen to provide seige weapons<BR>   when appropriate.<BR> * Is expert in one specialy of RvR: keep taking or defense, total<BR>   knowledge of one frontier zone, etc.  (If there is ever PvE <BR>   content at this level, the title of Quest Specialist will apply).<BR> * Regularly organizes NOR Raids, and organizes Alliance raids at <BR>   the direction of the Raid Master, and participates in rectuiting<BR>   events.<BR> * Recomends to the Raid Master players who should be Knights<BR>   Protector.<P>(QM) Raid Master<BR> * Has overall responsibility for all guild raids on a server,<BR>   although leadership of individual raids may be delegated to a <BR>   Raid Specialist.<BR> * Acts as Liaison to allied guilds (once the alliance has been<BR>   established and approved by the high council).<BR> * Responsible for keeping "raid loot" that has yet to be assigned <BR>   to a player (or guild in an alliance).  There is likely to be <BR>   much less of this unless high-level PvE is added.<BR> * Responsible for policy on use of any goodies that can be <BR>   purchased with Realm Points for use by the guild.  Responsible <BR>   for raising cash for a raid fund when necessary for building<BR>   siege equipment (or whatever) and the use of this fund.<BR> * Regularly reports to the DM the status of raids (success, <BR>   faliure, reputation of the guild), the use of the raid fund, and<BR>   a roster of DMG members involved in raids.  Maintains raid point<BR>   list if that ever becomes necessary.<BR> * Provides constructive criticism about raids afterwards to all <BR>   involved.<BR> * Provides leadership of all guild raiding activities by insuring<BR>   that raids are organized frequently, and recognizing and <BR>   "promoting" up to the level of Quest Specialist with the approval <BR>   of the DM or Branch Leader.<P>(DM) Dungeon Master<BR> * Has the knowledge to substitue for Trade, Class, and Raid Masters <BR>   as necessary.
