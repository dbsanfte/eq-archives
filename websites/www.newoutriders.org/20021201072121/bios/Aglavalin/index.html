              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Being in a new land, and friendless, was nothing new to Aglavalin. He had wandered most of his life, alone but content most of the time. Always seeking a place to call home where everyone treated others with honesty and respect. One day he happened upon a land called NeverWinter, and decided to explore it's mysteries. After wandering aimlessly for weeks in this dangerous area, he happened upon a mighty warrior who went by the name of
              MadMax.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">  "Now here is a worthy soul, and with good intentions." Thought Aglavalin to himself as he chatted with his new acquaintance. Max explained how he was a member of an ancient guild, which was new to the area, and seeking out new members. The New OutRiders it was called. Such an intriguing name, he thought to himself, as he asked the kind Max question after question. Max seemed to have a great pride in this group of adventurers calling themselves 'NOR' for short. Aglavalin requested copies of the scrolls telling about this fine guild, and stayed up all night studying them for hidden meanings and agendas. He finally concluded that the New OutRiders were truly neutral as they claimed! What joy this brought Aglavalin's heart since he had always dreamed of a place to call home, where people were just and fair.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">  After reading the history and virtues of NOR, Aglavalin decided to join the Guild of the New OutRiders, if they would have him. He mentioned this to Max, and was immediately introduced to Lady Gwen, who squired him soon after. Oh what a joy it was to have friends in this strange and wondrous land, he had not realized how lonely he had become after so many years on his own.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">  Over the months to follow, Aglavalin worked his way up the ranks until he was a Duke. With over a hundred members in NWN, NOR had split into three Duchies. Aglavalin was as happy as could be until the evil Gods took him from the land altogether!</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">  Floating in the ethereal plane, Aglavalin tried numerous times to find his way back to the fair land of NeverWinter and his NOR family, but to no avail. He ended up in other lands at times, even in the land ruled by Diablo. Finally he found his comrades from the New OutRiders again, but they were stripped away from him shortly by the evil Gods when NeverWinter was totally destroyed! Again Aglavalin wandered in search of his only family, well the only family he had for many years since his parent's deaths. Being the only child of a Wizard and a Sorceress had often made him an outcast amongst others, no matter where he had found himself over the years. He was tired of it, and refused to give up hope that his brothers and sisters of NOR were alive and well in some dimension. He did not want to return to his old ways, being alone wherever he went was not acceptable to him anymore.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">  Then one day, Aglavalin sensed something he had not felt for quite some time, the presence of NORs! He meditated with his arcane magic abilities for days to try and span the great vastness of time and space to reach his home. He finally succeeded and ended up in a land called Britannia! What a colorful and unique land it was too, filled with many creatures good and evil. What did he also find? Why, his NOR family of course!</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">  Thus ends the tale of Aglavalin's journey to the land of Britannia,
              this story will be continued soon....</font></p>
