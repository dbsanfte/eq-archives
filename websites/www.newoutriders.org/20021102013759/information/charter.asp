              <br>

              II.  HIGH COUNCIL<br>
              <br>
    A.  The duties of the High Council (HC) shall be to make decisions deemed of importance to the NOR on any subject matter.  These decisions are binding on all members of the order.<br>
              <br>
    B.  A decision to be placed upon matters of the order shall be decided upon by a majority vote of the HC when a quorum of voting members of the HC are present.<br>
              <br>
    C.  High Council members who move to Advisor Status are no longer voting members.<br>
              <br>
    D.  All members of the HC have but one vote per issue.  Members of the HC have the final voice for the order through their vote.<br>
              <br>
    E.  The office of the HC shall be reserved for those obtaining the rank of Lord or Lady in the Order.<br>
              <br>
    F.  Presiding HC members have the sole honor to select Dungeon Master Emeritus, Realm Leader, Branch Leader, Guild Master, and Assistant Guild Masters of the hosts from their number.<br>
              <br>
    G.  A vacancy upon the HC will be filled by either a current Duke/Duchess or an individual with outstanding qualities and confirmed by a majority vote of the HC with a quorum present.<br>
              <br>
    H.  Matters concerning Duchies will include the Duke/Duchess, who will have a single vote upon Duchy matters only.<br>
              <br>
    I.  The High Council shall consist of a minimum of 3 members.  The maximum number of HC members is the higher of the following numbers:<br>
        1)  15.<br>
        2)  number of members of the guild divided by 50, rounded up.<br>
        3)  At the option of the HC, a member may be added to the HC (above 15) to fill the office of Realm Leader.<br>
              <br>
    J.  An emergency session of the HC may be called by a member by emailing the members of the HC 24 hour in advance of the meeting.  Any official action taken at this session shall be ratified at the next REGULARLY SCHEDULED HC meeting (in open or closed session).<br>
              <br>
              <br>
              III.  DUNGEON MASTER GROUP (DMG)<br>
              <br>
    A.  Associating and disassociating From the DMG<br>
              <br>
        1) Any individual may petition, at any time, to become a part of the DMG.  Individuals wishing to become part of the DMG will be required to demonstrate their specific knowledge of game mechanics, and will be awarded an appropriate DMG title by the acting DM of the duchy.  Specific requirements for titles in each game should be set by the DM of that duchy, and are applicable to only the game in which they are earned.   Said title does not replace the individual's rank but is, instead, an additional title the individual may display on his/her Jacket.  (ex. NORJack/Jill *NOR/KT-UO (QS) )<br>
              <br>
        2) Members of the DMG still retain their duchy ranks and positions, but are given special recognition for their in-game knowledge and achievements.<br>
              <br>
        3) The exception to this policy is the position of Dungeon Master (DM).  The DM is appointed by the Duke/Duchess of the duchy.  The DM position should be filled by the individual generally considered most knowledgeable about game mechanics and in-game quests.  The DM is responsible for testing and evaluating the game knowledge of potential candidates for the DMG and for advising the Duke/Duchess on technical gameplay issues.  The position of DM is considered an additional duty/position, and it may be filled by a member of any rank.  Though the position does not confer any rank upon an individual, the DM is considered to be an officer of the duchy due to the tremendous responsibility conferred by the position.  The active Duke/Duchess of a duchy is the default DM until one is appointed, though does not have the option of adding the title to their guild epi.<br>
              <br>
    B. DMG Titles<br>
              <br>
        1) Knight Protector (KP) - This is the entry level DMG position.  The title of Knight Protector may be granted to individuals who have demonstrated sufficient in-game knowledge to develop their character to such an extent that they are capable of protecting and assisting weaker or less-experienced players.  Knight Protectors should also have demonstrated an ability to communicate in-game concepts well and thus teach less experienced players the basics of the game.<br>
              <br>
        2) Quest Specialist (QS)- Quest Specialists have demonstrated extensive knowledge of a single element of game play (ex. a specific profession, the quests for an entire class/race, a specific dungeon, etc.) as well as an overall knowledge sufficient to earn them a position as Knight Protector.<br>
              <br>
        3) Quest Master (QM)- In order to achieve the title of Quest Master, individuals should have met all the requirements for becoming a Quest Specialist.  Additionally, Quest Masters should be able to demonstrate extensive overall knowledge of game mechanics, geography of the game world, player factions, etc.  Quest Masters should be up to date on game mechanics issues and upcoming changes in the game as well as being informed about the game designers stance and intent on those issue and changes.<br>
              <br>
        4) Dungeon Master (DM)- The Dungeon Master should meet all the requirements of Quest Master, and should additionally be able to recognize and test the knowledge of other players for suitability for the DMG.<br>
