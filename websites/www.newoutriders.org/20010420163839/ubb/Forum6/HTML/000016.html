</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The last wagon pulled into the small camp just as the last rays of light from the dying winter’s sun fell behind the tree tops of the surrounding wood.  It had been a long journey and one not usually made before the full thaw of spring.  But then, nothing of this trip to the clan’s summerhome had been business as usual.  Raven finished brushing the moisture out of  Mermaid’s coat, she had travelled far this day and the old mare looked the worse for it. <I> “She and I both”</I> , he thought.  <P>The dark-haired man looked over at the small girl beside him.  She was taking care of her pony as he had taught her and he could not help but smile at his diminuitive charge.  “Samantha, that is enough, we need only get the rain from their coats, not rub away all of the day’s labors.”  A pair of bright green eyes shined up at him, “Okay Sir”, she replied.  For some reason the girl had taken to calling him that.  Perhaps it was due to their time in the NOR keep while he was stationed in Empyria.  There were many squires then, and he was a Baron of their order.  She was five then, and new to her life as an orphan, and now she was a girl of nearly ten.  Many things had changed....many things indeed.<P>“Sir, did.....did we come here because of me?”  She asked furtively, which was something not generally in her demeanor.  Raven knew this question would come sooner or later.  He had hoped for later.  In the five years Samantha had been in his charge they had searched many lands in search of her people.  She was a special child both he and Torcha had seen it from the first.  It was ironic that one of her enigmatic drawings had foretold the sundering of his relationship with the fire haired lady.  And now, because of those strange drawings, they were drawn to the clan’s home.  “Yes Sam, I believe that is fair to say.”  He replied curtly, hoping his tone would end the inevitable follow-up questions that all ten year old girls seemed to ask.<P>Samantha’s clan had been difficult to find.  Gypsies, vagabonds, nomads, take your pick, these people had roots like tumbleweeds.  Still, it had been important to find them, she needed to be among her people.   Her strange gifts were taken as a sign of great tidings by the clan, they had waited many years for the return of one such as she.  <P>“But why Sir, they were so glad to see me.  Mother Lysia hugged me until my eyes nearly popped out!”  She stifled the quivering of her lip and continued.  “Everyone is so serious now....an’ I just...”.<P>Raven stepped over and ruffled her dark curls.  “Sam, I don’t know why we have come to this place.  I know that your people think of the woods ahead as a sacred place, perhaps they wish to re-annoint you into their clan.”  He truly did not know the answer, and to be truthful, he was as perplexed as she.  <P>“C’mon, maybe we can sort it out after dinner.”  The two headed for the delicious smells of the cook fires.<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR><I>PS: gonna piece this out slowly..get all the boring stuff out of the way early..;&gt;</I><BR><p>[This message has been edited by Raven (edited 03-19-2001).]</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Raven sipped the brandy-laced cider from his tin cup as he watched Samantha carousing with some of the other children. <I>  “How carefree it must feel to be so young” </I>,he mused.  The girl had grown up to be a strong willed 10 year old.  He could still see the small child within her however, the child he had saved from the ravenous hunters of Empyria, and he could almost see the strands of destiny that had begun to attach themselves to her.<P>“Looks like fun doesn’t it?”, a familiar voice spoke.  Raven turned his head away from the children and nodded towards his new companion.  The man beside him was lean and weathered and his eyes had the power to hold the attention of whomever happened to gaze upon them.  <P>“Aye Brand, it does indeed.”  Raven turned and offered the man a small, ceramic jug filled with the remainder of his drink.  “Brisk evening, anything turn up?”  The man before him was considered to be a fine tracker and Raven knew that he had spent the last several hours scouting the surrounding woods to ensure the safety of the camp.<P>“Nay, nothing.  Strange though, when I say nothing, I mean NOTHING.”  Brand took a long pull from the jug, undoubtedly grateful for the warmed drink.  “I found many of the usual tracks, but not a one of them were fresh.  It’s as if everything for miles simply…left.”  He shrugged his shoulders.  “I have never been here this early, perhaps there is some migration or other that I havena’ seen before.”<P>Both men turned as they heard a hush fall over the children.  A silver-maned female stepped out of her large tent.  She nodded towards Brand, and both he and Raven began walking towards her.  Samantha’s eyes locked on Raven’s pleading with him to find answers.  He nodded and tried to smile.  As they both approached the tent a sharp voice stopped them.<P>“Not you Outrider.”  Kael’s voice was unmistakable.  Most of the people here addressed him as such; it was simply their way.  The swarthy man moved to place himself between the pair and the tent.  “What is said inside … is for the clan.”  The man’s dark eyes warned of danger and Raven knew this man held little love for him.<P>“You have no right…” Brand began to speak before Raven placed his hand upon his forearm.<P>“No Brand, he has every right, misguided or not.”   Raven paid no heed towards sparing the man before him a verbal jab.<P>The tent flap rustled as The Mother stepped out into the firelight.  “That will be quite enough, the both of ye.”  She gave both men a stern look, a look a mother gives to quarrelling boys.  “I’d say there is good reason for the Outrider to come inside, aye…good reason.”  That said, she turned and disappeared back the way she had came.<P>Kael spoke under his breath.  “You are not one of us Outrider, have a care that you do not forget it.”  Brand rolled his eyes in exasperation and the three men entered the tent.  Almost immediately Raven was assailed by the heady smells of spice and incense.  In the weeks that he and Samantha had been with the clan he had learned little about the woman they referred to as “The Mother”.  One thing he had guessed however, was that she was the spiritual leader of this nomadic clan.<P>Wasting little time Kael spoke first.  “Mother, why did you ask the clan to strike the tents?”  He left out any comment about the haste they had made, the livestock they had left behind to be sold on consignment.  But those unspoken comments were undoubtedly raging throughout the camp.  Brand shifted uncomfortably at the words as if he cared little for the tone in Kael’s voice.<P>The Mother walked over to a pile of papers and withdrew one of the sheets.  She turned over the page and the three men gazed upon a finely drawn scene.  The artist’s charcoal depicted a small child, back to the viewer, standing alone in a clearing surrounded by trees.  Alone, not quite alone, for as they looked more deeply into the picture they could see the shadowy outlines of figures, the glint of an eye here, a hint of a limb there.  “What you see here, is a place I haven’t visited since I was a young woman.”  She cleared her throat, the smoke from the tent making her voice coarse and raspy.  “Samantha drew this, and this picture holds portents too subtle and sublime to be ignored.”  <P>She turned towards Raven and spoke.  “You are not of the clan, so I don’t expect you to understand or appreciate the gravity or peril of the situation.  You see, as Samantha has the gift of foretelling the future through her drawings, so to do I have this gift, through my dreams.”  She coughed deeply and looked shaken before continuing.  “The night I laid eyes upon this picture, I received a vision, a terrible vision.   I saw many things I don’t understand but one thought, one NEED came through and that was that we MUST travel here.”  <P>“What is it we must do Mother?”  Brand spoke softly as he walked over with a cup of water for the old woman.  <P>She seemed to sag visibly as she spoke.  “Samantha….must go to them tomorrow night, when the moon is full.  It has been decided…that it is her time.”  Sadness settled in over her wizened features.<P>“But is this not a good thing Mother? Have we not finally found the one that will take your place?”  Brand looked quizzically at the Mother.  He moved closer to her to steady her as another round of coughing rattled her old bones.<P>“I don’t understand, who must she see?”  Raven spoke for the first time and a familiar feeling began to seep into his heart.  <I>”One more pluck on my lifestring eh?” </I> He mentally quipped to the mythical fates, as if they actually listened.<P>“I’m sorry Outrider, Raven, truly.  Samantha must stand before the Wendigo when the moon is full tomorrow night.  She must do so alone, else the clan will suffer the consequences.”  It was Brand that answered.  <P>“It is not her time, and I fear they have summoned her for some dark purpose.”   The Mother sat down heavily upon a pile of furs.  “She has seen many things with her gifts, and now, through me, they know of her.”   <P>Raven’s held his voice steady, letting his anger bleed away.  “You mean to tell me, that you would let her walk into such a thing, because of a few drawings?  She is a special child, indeed, that cannot be disputed.”  His jaw was set firm now as thoughts of Samantha began to fuel the fire of his anger.  “Can you not refuse this…Wendigo?”<P>Kael’s eyes widened at the words.  “Watch your tongue Outrider, you know not of what you speak.”  His large hands clenched and unclenched with each word.  “Our stories tell of a time when the clan defied the Wendigo, I will NOT see that folly visited upon us again, NOT for the sake of an orphan girl.  We would have been better served had you let her die in that far off land.”<P>It was all Raven could do to refrain from leaping upon Kael.  In the last few years he had grown to love the little girl.  “Where I come from, we protect small children.”  His tone was icy and held the invitation to violence.<P>“Enough, what will be…will be.  Kael, it is forbidden for the clan to interfere in this manner, lest we bring down the wrath of the Wendigo, make sure it is known.”  The Mother walked a fine line as she continued.  “I’m sorry Outrider, but we follow the Way of the Wendigo, and have for generations.  They have been our benefactors, our voice to the spirits of wind, earth and stream.  We have no choice, but to obey their will.”   She stood up, a signal to the three men that they should depart.  Raven stopped a little outside the tent, his thoughts troubled, heart heavy...... <P></FONT>
