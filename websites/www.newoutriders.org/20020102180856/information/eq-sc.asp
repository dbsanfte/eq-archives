      <br>
      Here are some items of importance to help you within the Norrath Duchy.<br>
      <br>
      Guild functions:  Everquest has guild functions built right into the game!  What does this mean to you?  When you are invited to join the guild, you will see a yes/no selection box appear.  A guild officer or GM must invite you while in the same game zone as yourself.   Select yes to become of member of *NOR/ according to Everquest's guild rules.   Note that your squiring ceremony is your true induction to the guild;  the game function merely places the New OutRiders name over your head while you are
      traveling in Norrath.<br>
      <br>
      Once you are a member of the guild, you will be able to speak on the guild channel and hear others.  To hear others, all you need do is have your guildchat filter turned ON.  To speak to other members of *NOR/, simply type /guildsay and your message, or you can also set your default chat mode to "guild"; then everything you type without chat filter of /gsay /tell or /say will go to the guild channel.<br>
      <br>
      Everquest denotes one person of *NOR/ as the GM.  This person will generally be the Duke or Duchess of the Duchy.  Only the GM can appoint officers (Everquest's definition of officer is a member who can invite others into the guild as regular members).  Appointed officers can invite players into the guild, but not as officers.  Please note that this Everquest definition of officer is not the same as *NOR/'s definition of officer.  A *NOR/ officer is any member of the rank Herald/Heraldess, BA/BS, CT/CS, etc.    Not all officers of *NOR/ are denoted EQ officers.  The purpose of game officers is merely to assist the DK/DC in tagging new members when they are far away from the DK/DC in the game, or when the DK/DC is not ingame when someone needs to receive the guild tag.<br>
      <br>
      Names:  You can have up to 8 names on your account.  Any of them can be tagged as guild members ingame, regardless of race, class or level, however the following guidelines are to be followed.   *NOR/ permits you (player) to have only one character, or persona, in the guild. Many people enjoy playing different race/class combinations in the world of Norrath. Therefore you will be given the privilege of having other characters tagged as *NOR/ given the following conditions:  1) The character's name is spelled very similarly to your main *NOR/ character's name, preventing any confusion about who you are, 2) the character name has been approved by the Duke or Duchess (or his/her designees) for tagging purposes, and 3) you do so with the full understanding that these similarly named alternate character(s) are in fact different manifestations of the same character/persona, your *NOR/ character.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      In addition, other characters that you play in Everquest (that are NOT your *NOR/ character or any  manifestation of that character) may also be tagged into the guild for the purpose of participating in guild chat. These alts are NOT considered  members of the guild (despite the fact that Verant's<br>
      system considers them as such). Such characters are considered visitors, or friends of *NOR/. This may be done under the following conditions:<br>
      1) It is understood that these characters are not members of *NOR/.<br>
      2) These characters will abide by our charter and standards of conduct while tagged.<br>
      3) These characters will maintain "anonymous" status ( /anon ) at ALL times. This hides the display of guild name in game graphics.<br>
      4) Each character will obtain approval of the Duke or Duchess (or his/her designees) before being tagged.<br>
      5) Each character will announce upon logging in who their *NOR/ character is (if they have one). For example, *NOR/ Frodo logs in as an alternate  character, Mordrid. He announces on guild channel Mordrid says to the guild 'Hail *NOR/, Frodo here'<br>
      6) If a player violates these guidelines with an alternate character, the Duke/Duchess may remove their privilege of having  non-guild characters on the chat channel.<br>
      <br>
      Please see the appendix to this document for more information on the persona/character/name philosophy of *NOR/.<br>
      <br>
      Helping others: As a new player in Everquest, you will find your guildmates to be very helpful!  This is what we do, of course.  You are expected to do likewise, but within the limits of your race/class/level.  No one is expected to give the shirt off his or her own back.  However7, while traveling about, help others as best you can, through buffing (casting beneficial spells upon them), healing, or assisting with mobs that are within your range of ability to combat.  Answering players questions about locations, traveling, quests, armor, weapons and items is also a good way to show your *NOR/ colors.  We are very proud of our knowledge and skills in the game in the Norrath Duchy!  We have a great reputation in this world, and expect everyone to contribute to the furthering of it.  Remember that as in other games,  the golden rule is always a good guide.  Treat other players as you would like to be treated in turn.<br>
      <br>
      Combat etiquette:  Kill stealing is expressly forbidden by *NOR/.  If another player or party has attacked a mob, before you and/or your party, and has not asked for your help, nor appear to need it, do not attack their target.  If you do more damage than the party, you would have gained the experience and stolen their kill.  Respect the rights of others, but expect your own rights to be respected as well.  If you are uncomfortable with the behavior of any of your party members, leave the group if you cannot convince them to behave better.<br>
      <br>
      PvP:  PvP is an optional activity.  Many of our members choose to duel other players to hone their skills and test their abilities.  You are never required to combat another player unless it is your choice to.  Just beware that there are arenas in the game, places in which you become PvP, involuntarily, as soon as you enter them.  There are such areas in the major cities in the game, but not only there.  You will see a message telling you that you have entered a PvP area if you should do so.<br>
      <br>
      Economy:  Norrath has a unique economy.  You will need loot and money to improve your armaments and weapons, obtain magical items, do certain quests, obtain food and drink, buy services from other players and buy spells if you are a casting class.   The Norrath Duchy of NOR/ has a great reputation for generosity as well.   Many members freely give items and money to other guildmates and non-NOR/ players in the game.  Some donate items and money to the *NOR/ treasury, which was established to help out younger members, rebuild a character's equipment in the case of a lost character disaster, and to fund guild expertise in the trade skills.  However, no member is required to give money or items to other members of the guild or to players in Everquest in general.  You are encouraged to do so, if you have no need of a particular item, nor a need for the cash proceeds from its sale.<br>
      <br>
      Events: From time to time there will be guild sponsored events.  You are encouraged to participate in such events, as they allow you an opportunity to spend time with guild mates that you would not normally be able to travel with due to level differences.  You can also plan and conduct an event of your own, if you have an idea for one.  Any member can run an event.<br>
      <br>
      To find other guild members in the game, simply type /who all new.  Remember that if you use the anonymous function, which removes your level and class from your character info available to others, you also remove yourself from being recognized ingame by other guild members.<br>
      <br>
      Please visit our message post board often!  There you will find current events in the Duchy, as well as news of events, items available and information about the various aspects of the game.  Other members of *NOR/ will be glad to help you with obtaining information about an item or quest, but be advised that the web contains a wealth of information as well.  Some quests are lengthy and involved, and it is more practical in some cases to read a detailed description at one of the many well-known web sites than to try to get this information in the game via tells.  But ask your guild first, and you will be pointed in the right direction!  Or ask on the message board, many of our members visit that site every day.<br>
      <br>
      ADDENDUM:  Gustin's essay on the approach to names and characters (being a helpful discussion of the topic rather than a guideline or rule)<br>
      <br>
      Hail *NOR/,<br>
      <br>
      This is a greeting that will become near and dear to your heart as you become more and more entwined with the extended family of the New Outriders. *NOR/ as a guild is quite different from most others you have probably experienced. Our core concepts are very similar to many others, but<br>
      something inside makes us truly unique. If you only had one or two traits to single out as *NOR/, one of them has to be our concept of persona.  This concept did not come about overnight, but went through several stages, some of them quite painful, to arrive at its current peak. Its most<br>
      primitive form took shape as simply, one player, one character.  Over time, however, this rule has of necessity been modified and molded into something far more profound than its original creators had dreamed. To meet increasingly more complex gaming systems and their ensuing limitations is not the least of the reasons behind this evolution. Now, instead of simply saying one character, one player, *NOR/ only accepts one persona. While you may have several characters of different class, race, and sex, each of these characters are simply a different manifestation of the same spirit.<br>
      <br>
      Another way to look at this:  each character (as opposed to persona) is simply another incarnation of the same personality in another physical host. All the characters still act the same, and have the same core concept, within the above allowances. The manifestation of this sameness is found in our rule that all character have the same name for all personalities (with certain prescribed variations).&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Some of you may still have a hard time understanding the need for this concept. To answer this, we have to cover two different models of RPG organizations. The one that most of us are familiar with are the various gaming societies out there that are merely a collection of players  getting together to roleplay in the various genres available to us. Thus, one person could be playing a Paladin one minute, upholding truth justice, and whatever way, and ten minutes later be playing an assassin that hates that very paladin's guts. These gaming societies range from the homegrown basement group on a Saturday night playing D&amp;D to nationwide groups over several online servers.<br>
      <br>
      The other model is one in which the character is as integral to membership as the player him or herself. To explain this, we need to look at a concrete example. Many of us are familiar with the Society for Creative Anachronisms (SCA). For those that aren't, and as a review for us others,<br>
      the SCA is an organization whose members will dress up and actually enact the roles they play, from the courtly maiden and chivalrous knight to the hardy peasant. To join, each member must assume a personality that they must maintain at all times. All promotions, benefits, and privileges are based on the actions of that personality.<br>
      <br>
      That is what *NOR/ is trying to emulate: to emphasize the equal importance of the character and the player and enhance roleplaying through both. Avid supporters of the SCA model claim this is true roleplaying, while proponents of the gaming society model claim it is too limiting. In fact, neither model is any better than the other, and *NOR/ does not attempt to declare so. Both sides have equally good roleplayers. But, quite simply, we have chosen this method as the best way to implement *NOR/'s goals with the least disruption to our members.<br>
      <br>
      In closing, it is necessary for each member to understand this unique *NOR/ trait and understand that it is not a criticism of any style of play. It's simply a conscious choice of our unique  organization to implement our own style of play. And we hope to see you as well in our ranks, helping us spread Truth, Justice, and the NOR way.</span></font></p>
