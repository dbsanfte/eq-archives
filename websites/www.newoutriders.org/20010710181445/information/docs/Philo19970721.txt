Philosophy of The New OutRiders

The "Prime Directive" of NOR is to have FUN!! We are in a Social Guild that, in comparison to some other Guilds, has very few rules and regulations, and we try to keep it that way. The Charter gives us the "Goal" and the Standards & Conventions give us a "Code of Conduct" to follow to achieve that Goal. What follows is a basic idea of how NOR works... The What, Why, Where and How of NOR!!

* The Guild's Objectives *
-------------------------------------
We try to make NOR a Guild for ALL people... we can't, of course... but we try!! And here's HOW we try...

** The Guild - We try to make it fun to be a member... Socializing and playing the games in each realm.

** The Advisors - An Elite Group of experienced NOR!! They provide help and Guidance for the entire Guild. While in some cases their time is limited... their knowledge of NOR is NOT!!

** The DMG - Each realm has its own Dungeon Masters Group, which is governed by their own tree structure. The goal is to learn and teach the game. The DMG is headed by a DME (Dungeon Master Emaritus, who is a member of the HC and oversees the DMG. 

** The Officers - The most difficult job in NOR is being an Officer! The diverse background of NOR's members make the "Job" harder than you'll EVER try to do in RL! And NO!! We are NOT kidding!! It may be challenging, but NEVER boring.

** Promotions in NOR **
-------------------------------------
Almost everyone wants promotions! It is the PRIMARY responsibility of all Officers to recommend members for promotions when it's deserved!! Our philosophy on promotion?? Here are the basics:

**DMG - Promotions are based on knowledge and skill in playing the game. If you have the knowledge and Skill Level.. you will progress quickly.

**Advisors - By nomination and appointment only!! LOTSA time and experience in NOR are the main requirements. You must be nominated and approved by the HC of NOR. Don't be upset if you don't make it the 1st time... you must REALLY know NOR to get in there.

**Officers - There are 2 major requirements... Time and Ability!! 

Time - You MUST have hours to dedicate to NOR!! Obviously, 5 hours a week isn't enough to be an officer. And... if you are in a number of Guild(s) under another Character(s) your time will be limited. We have to know that you have enough time to devote to NOR to make it run smoothly!! In any case... we take each situation as it comes along 

Ability - Do you have good organizational skills? Do you have good "people" skills? The "Tree" is designed to give the Duchy a basis for communicating information to all the members. How it is set up is up to the Duke/Duchess. They can modify the Tree to fit he needs of the Duchy and their own personal preferences. And .... You have to be able to talk to a 15 yr. old student one minute and a 55 yr old Accountant the next... or maybe a 25 yr. old Chemical Engineer and a 35 yr. old Pharmacist!!.... etc. and communicate what you want!! Like I said.... challenging... but NEVER boring!! These abilities are not magically acquired... they are LEARNED!! The more you "Learn" or have already "Learned"... the higher you will progress in NOR. For the younger people out there... YES!! you CAN get there!! 

**Members - Help your officers out. Recruit. Help with events. Help others learn the game (NOR and non-NOR). Behave yourself!! :-)

*** General Stuff ****
**Macros - You've heard of them.... They detract from the game and are outlawed by most game services ..... AND NOR!!! Don't get caught usin' 'em!!

**Other Guilds - There are many fine Guilds, NOR tries to maintain friendly relations with all of them. We do NOT consider ourselves' superior to them.... we are... well.... just NOR!! Period!!

**Recruiting - We recruit ONLY those people and/or Characters that are NOT in any other Guild!!! Recruiting from ANY other Guild will NOT be sanctioned by the High Council in ANY way, shape or FORM!! Make sure you review your realms recruiting policy (check with your officer) if there is one.

**Attitude - The Golden Rule applies here!! DO NOT be rude or obnoxious!! Do NOT pressure any person to join NOR!! Using obscene language is a SURE way to get kicked out of NOR!! Most of this is just common sense!!

**Participation - Try to come on wearing your "Jacket"!! {NOR EPI} Be HERE!!! Be PROUD!!!!

One last thing... The New OutRiders strictly prohibit hacking. If you alter the program code, or use hacking software for any reason, you will be dismissed from the Guild. If you know that someone in the game is hacking, just don't have anything to do with him/her. You want to be as far away from that person as possible. Please report any suspected hacking violations to your officer via ESP or email
. 
This is a pretty short version of what NOR is all about.... and now... should you go out and recruit... hopefully you have most of the answers that people will ask. If you have specific questions... ask your DC/DK or write any HC member... they will be MORE that happy to answer you.
