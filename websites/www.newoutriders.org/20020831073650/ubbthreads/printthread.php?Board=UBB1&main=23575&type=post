The first IWD used mostly second Ed with a few third Ed rules mixed in.  IWD2, which is almost done, is 3E all the way.  The first game that was 3E was Pool of Radiance (the one that recently came out, not the original ;P<br /><br />I played NWN all yesterday evening and some this morning, so far I like it alot.  Installed no problem for me.  The only thing I am finding anoying, well two things, is (are) the pathfinding sucks, and because of the pathfinding, my NPC followers don''t  do thing right away and have to be told again after I mvoe out of the way.  That doesn't seem like a big deal, but they keep repeating the same things over and over and over "Aye, It's done""Aye, It's done""Aye, It's done""Aye, It's done""Aye, It's done""Aye, It's done"  Kinda anyoing, I suppose I could turn it off, but the voices/sounds/music make up alot of the enjoyment of the game.<br /><br />Combat has been cool so far <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/ninja1.gif" alt="" /> , as long as I remember to save, hehe.  So far most fights I could just run in swingin, but there have been 3 so far that doing that wiped out my NPC and me.  Sorcerers do alot of dmg! <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/scared.gif" alt="" />  hehe<br /><br />The music is pretty good as well.  I actually listen to it, instead of turning it off and playing MP3s in the background. <img src="/ubbthreads/images/icons/smile.gif" alt="" /><br /><br />I won't mention the graphics except to say that Bioware has always had great artists on their side, and there's no disapointing this time either. <img src="/ubbthreads/images/icons/smile.gif" alt="" /><br /><br />I think I will have to try multiplayer soon and see how that is.<br /><br />
