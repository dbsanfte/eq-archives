                  <p><span class="largetext">Once again we find our Queenie at her Vanity. A knock at the door breaks her concentration. She opens it, one of the Knight’s messengers with a scroll in his hand for her. Knowing most of the time these notes aren’t always good news, she takes it with a weary smile and thanks the young gnome for delivering it. 
<br />

<br />
She tosses the scroll on her bed along side the rest of her adventures gear. She walks to her drawing table. Looking down at her newest project, a portrait of a fearless paladin Balgonoff, she beings to hum while she sketches. Misty floats over to her and hands Areilla the scroll. With a look she sits up and breaks the wax seal of the KoA on the scroll but on closer examination of the seal she notices it’s the “old” seal. She had just updated the KoA seal a few months ago. This intrigued her even more so she quickly opened the scroll and noticed the familiar handwriting and hopped off the stool where she’d been sitting. She quickly mumbles a spell and begins to float out of her room down the hall to the Hero’s room while reading her message.
<br />

<br />
Once in the Hero’s hall without looking up she stops mid- air in front of a portrait of a beautiful high elf in purple armor. Areilla looks up with eyes welled up with tears at the beloved cleric and says “Misty shes coming home!” With tears starting to stream down her face she floats off towards the sensei’s room. 
<br />

<br />
“Leezard, leezard!!” she shouts “Chob are you here?”
<br />

<br />
From almost out of nowhere he steps in front of her with his all knowing Iskar eyes.
<br />
“You bellowed for me Areilla?” he says as he turns and gives his autograph to Misty. Misty floats to the other side of the room rolling his eye as if to say why does this lizard do that.
<br />

<br />
“YES, darling I did. I just got this note. Here, SHE COMING HOME!” she jumps up and down with excitement and then her spell breaks and she drops to the floor in a pile of red robes giggling.
<br />

<br />
Chobothe shakes his head and smiles. Only his queen would be so <span style="font-style: italic">graceful</span>
<br />

<br />
“Are you ok A?” he says with a smirk
<br />

<br />
“yes im fine.” Flustered, she tries to hand him the scroll that shes crushed in her hand. “Read it!! Read it!! Read it!! Read it!!”
<br />

<br />
“Ok A you need to calm down and tell me why are you so excited? Who’s coming home….” Choboathe stops in-mid sentence. He was trying to explain to his queen, how her overexcitement has confused him. As he said the words him self he realized the only girl that would ever be coming home that would make Areilla like this. Is it none other than….
<br />

<br />
“No” he says almost breathless. With tears still streaming down her face she answers, “YES!” She stood up and smoothed down her robes and rubbed her rump, thankful that the lizard’s quarters is a dojo and the floors were cushioned. Then she wiped the tears from her face and threw her arms around her good friend Choboathe. And she whispers again “yes shes coming home hun, get your heat rock ready” they both smile. 
<br />

<br />
Misty clears his throat loudly as if to break them from the embrace. She looks over at Misty and says “you can’t bug me today. I am to to to happy” and snorts at him with a giggle following it.
<br />

<br />
She spins around and faces Chob again and says “Should we tell the others?” “No, her journey was long and dangerous. I don’t want to jeopardize her journey home” Spoken as a wise monk. “Ok but we can send a few Knights out to meet her and….and … and.. bring her safely to the castle….. No?.... We should get the other Officers….. MISTY!!!” Choboathe cringes at the bellow that comes out of this tiny Elf. He makes a mental note small body BIG mouth.
<br />

<br />
“Yes, Master” answered her faithful elemental. “Would you tell all the Officers to meet me in the Hero’s hall in an hour please K thanks” she said with a smile and a twinkle in her eye.
<br />

<br />
“Yes, Master” Misty nodded. He floated out of the room. She told Chob she needed to get ready for the meeting and she would be back. She stood on her tippy toes and kisses his scaly cheek gently. She mutters a spell and begins to float again and floats out of the dojo off to her room.
<br />

<br />
In her room, she sits at her desk and writes a note. Seals it with her signature purple wax and starts to bellow for Misty and remembers he’s off already doing her bidding. “Hmm I can’t wait till I learn how to have that multiple pet thingie like Gonjinnx the Suicidal Shammie.” She leaves the scroll on her desk and goes to her vanity to primp for the meeting. With a smile from pointy ear to pointy ear she hums as she fixes her red hair. To excited to sit she floats around her room humming and dancing. 
<br />

<br />
She had forgotten to close her door all the way. Zabor on his was to the hero’s hall hears singing coming from his Queen’s room he knocks on the already open door “My Queen?” Areilla Swings the door open and chants a spells and Zabor begins to float of the ground. She grabs his hands and begins to dance with him around her room. “Oh M’lord I’ve just gotten the best news. I am so happy” 
<br />

<br />
Though he’s happy to see his queen smile and laugh and dance again he did wonder what news would bring her such great joy! Would this have to do anything to do with why he was summoned to the Hero’s hall for an Officers meeting?.....
<br />

<br />
“Areilla what’s going on?’ he asked concerned. “You’ll Find out soon enough and you can celebrate with me!” then She gasps as if something startled her Zabor reached to his sword and unsheathe it as to protect his Queen. “A celebration YES that’s it!!! I will have to plan a huge celebration for her arrival” she points up in the air as if she just realized she had forgotten something important. Shaking his head he put his sword back and become more confused.
<br />

<br />
“Areilla” he says sternly as if to snap her out of a spell. She looks down at him with happy big blue eyes. “What is happening?” Not wanting to upset her general she says “you will know at the meeting.” She leans down and kisses him on top of his head and floats out of her room.
<br />

<br />
Shaking his head he signs “that woman will be the death of me someday…………”<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.brellrants.net/knightsofareilla/index.php" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://www.southbronx.net/~fubar/WoW/springsig.jpg" border="0"></a>
