                  <p>Okay. Here's the lowdown.</p>
                  <p>You are paying for a service. The service is provided 'as-is.' 
                    The service is an online system, allowing persons to create, 
                    join and participate in discussion groups over the Internet. 
                    MMOGBB assumes no responsibility for service outages or interruptions, 
                    the unavailability of particular boards, features or services, 
                    the inability to access the service, the failure or inability 
                    to post materials to the Service, the deletion of materials 
                    posted to the service or the failure to store materials posted 
                    to the service.</p>

                    of your board account.</p>
                  <p>All content posted to an MMOGBB message board is the sole
