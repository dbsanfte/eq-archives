                  <p>Hi. My name's Brian. I've played Everquest on the Brell Serilis 
                    server since February of 2000. (You may find me online as 
                    Relbeek Einre if I'm on.) </p>
                  <p>For the last year, I've been the administrator of <a href="http://www.brellrants.net/forum">one 
                    of Brell Serilis' community boards</a>. Before that I served 
                    as one of its moderators.</p>
                  <p>As with many of Everquest's message boards, we were originally 
                    located on EZBoard. EZBoard is a good service, but we found 
                    the price had been climbing too high to continue to host our 
                    message boards there. I did some searching and found that 
                    we could host our own service at a small fraction of the cost 
                    of what EZBoard was charging us.</p>
                  <p>As a believer in open-source software, I settled on <a href="www.phpbb.com">phpBB</a> 
                    as our software package. But phpBB has its limitations, and 
                    so a few fellow Brellians and friends decided to add features 
                    and functionality to the system, to make it what we needed. 
                    When the other <a href="http://www.brellrants.net/brell">Brell 
                    Serilis community board's</a> administrator saw his upcoming 
                    fee for renewing EZBoard, he made the decision to move over 
                    to the new server I'd set up.</p>
                  <p>This presented us with the first major hurdle: allowing two 
                    different phpbb-based message boards to share a single user 
                    database. This has always been the major advantage of EZBoard 
                    over other systems: register with EZBoard and all message 
                    boards it hosts will use that registration. So we resolved 
                    to modify the phpBB software to properly handle multiple message 
                    boards that share a single user table. And for a couple months 
                    we reworked the software.</p>
                  <p>The result is what we want to share to the rest of the online 
                    gaming community. We can provide this full-featured message 
                    board service at a fraction of the cost of EZBoard and other 
                    services, and we get to promote and enhance the overall online 
                    gaming community. And we call it MMOGBB - Massively Multiplayer 
                    Online Gaming Bulletin Boards.</p>
                  <p>We invite you to explore MMOGBB.com and to host your message 
                    board with us. Please email me, <a href="mailto:relbeek@brellrants.net">relbeek@brellrants.net</a>, 
                    if you have any questions about our service.</p>
