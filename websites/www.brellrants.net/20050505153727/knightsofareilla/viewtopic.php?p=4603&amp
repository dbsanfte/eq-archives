                  <p><span class="largetext">Only a few days left she thinks to herself. Knowing she better get cracking there isn't much time left. Areilla sits at her desk with her quill in hand and begins to write. She stops and stares off towards Misty and says.
<br />

<br />
"An audience with Queen Areilla is requested?...that sounds so darn stuffy. I don't know why can't I just tell them to start traveling to the castle for the celebration. Every thing's always got to be protected" she sighs not knowing what to write she crumbles up the parchment and throws it at Misty with a giggle as he floats out of the way.
<br />

<br />
Areilla laughs at Misty. He was her Silent companion she could talk for hours to him and he would only answer her "Yes, Master" However, Misty was good with facial expressions and Areilla knew them well. She knew when he disapproved of something she was doing or thinking. Like the face he had now.
<br />

<br />
" Oh poo on you I just want to shout it around the whole castle .. But nooooo I cant" she says with a pout. She knew The Queensguard was right and has always kept her safe.
<br />

<br />
"oh Ill write Suvim and tell him" she tells Misty. She begins to write:
<br />

~
<br />
Dearest Suvim Airwalker Psycho Stormwarden,
<br />

<br />
I hope this message find you in good health and not being chased by a train of whatever mobs you and the Warriors of Wraith have been fighting as of late.
<br />

<br />
I would like to you to come to Castle KoA for a meeting if you can tear yourself away from the many wenches and ale you and Louski tend to frequent. By the way, bring the erudite with you as well.
<br />

<br />
I know the journey may be out of your way but trust me my good druid it will be worth wile.
<br />

<br />
I look forward to your arrival at Castle KoA promptly.
<br />

<br />
Your friend,
<br />

<br />
Queenie
<br />

<br />

<br />
She blows on the ink dry and rolls the parchment up and seals it. She places it next to the other scrolls she wrote earlier today. She looks up at Misty with a smile "Your gonna have a busy eve Misty hun"
<br />

<br />
"Hmmm ok Next letter. Oh I remember who now"
<br />

<br />
~
<br />
Dearest Sithiss (I can't pronounce your last name) Druid of the smurfy kind,
<br />

<br />
Hello Darling,
<br />

<br />
I hope all is well and you haven't gotten to lost out there exploring new
<br />
lands and finding yourself.
<br />

<br />
I need to chat with you. Can you find your self really quickly and come by
<br />
Castle KoA when you have a chance.
<br />

<br />
Bring the Oggy with you please.
<br />

<br />
And give him a kiss for me, I miss him so!
<br />

<br />
Love always.
<br />

<br />
Queenie

<br />
She continues to write.. on yet another parchment
<br />

<br />
Dearest Cerasmuerto "Gramps",
<br />

<br />
I know it's been a while and I'm sorry I haven't written before now. I hope all is going well with Honor Within and Life has been good for to you.
<br />

<br />
I have a message for you. However, security reasons do not allow me to mention it to you in this note.
<br />
I would like to invite you back to the Bar we have always enjoyed here at Castle KoA.
<br />

<br />
I hope you can find the time in your very busy schedule to pay us a visit. I look forward to hearing from you.
<br />

<br />
Be safe,
<br />

<br />
Lady Areilla Elentari

<br />
"Hmm is that it Misty?" I know I'm missing
<br />
 someone.
<br />

<br />
"OH!" She shouted!
<br />
~~
<br />

<br />
*Deliver to the Ranger Guild Of Norrath*
<br />

<br />
Dearest Elrador & Archlingel,
<br />

<br />
I know it has been a while since we have spoken. For that, I am sorry but I do not have time for long apologies here. I need both of you to come home to Castle KoA as soon as possible. Due to The general's security I must be vague but please find it in your hearts to forgive me for my mouth, my over reactions and emotions. 
<br />

<br />
Humbly yours,
<br />

<br />
Queenie 
<br />

<br />
~
<br />

<br />
As she sealed the last scroll, she can felt a chill enter her room. She smiles to herself. She knows it's her Undertaker who has come to see her. A light knock at her open window brings her attend to him. 
<br />

<br />
"You wished to see me my queen?" He said. "Yes, darling! The General’s security won't let me advise our friends outside the castle as to when she will arrive. Would you please do me a favor and find The Stoneknights and Banadurk and have them return to Castle KoA?? I know she would love to see them at the celebration!”
<br />

<br />
With a nod and a mischievous smirk he shimmers into the shadows nodding. The chill returned for a second and then her skin felt warm again.
<br />

<br />
A rapid knock on her door brought her attention to her front door. With a sigh she whispers under her breathe "never a dull moment around here" She waved her hand to Misty signaling him to deliver the letters.
<br />

<br />
She floated to her door and opened it to her favorite wizzy Khadgarr! 
<br />

<br />
"Queenie?" he says with a sensual human smile. 
<br />

<br />
"Would you put on one of your WONDERFUL light shows for the party for me?" she asks him in a sugary sweet voice
<br />

<br />
"As you wish!" he answers with a grin and a slight bow. They shared a silent moment and he left her chambers..
<br />

<br />
Felling tired from the long emotional day she had, Areilla climbs into her bed still wearing her outside robes and cuddles up to sleep.
<br />

<br />
She hasn't slept without Misty in a long time but today’s events have tired her so she drifts off to sleep…
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Early the next morn you see Areilla bustling around the castle preparing for the grand celebration. The buzzing of the rumors are as far fetched as a Knights imagination can go. Whispers in the air catch Areilla’s pointy elven ears. She giggles to herself at them.
<br />

<br />
She heads down the the hall away from the kitchen towards The Brell’s
<br />
Paladin Wing where The General resides.
<br />

<br />
She softly knocks on his door. No answer. She thinks to herself. "Ah" she should have known better. With that thought she walks back to her room to get her cloak and out of the castle. Floating out onto the courtyard where The Guards and Knights train. She can see swords unsheathe and sparring between Dexstier and Gryphyn. A smile came to her face happy to see her Knights having fun together.
<br />

<br />
Zabor see’s his queen and kneels before her in respect. She motions for him to stand. “M’lord may I have a word with you?” she asks him.
<br />

<br />
Rowdy from the fight Gryph shouts “OoooO Zab’s in trouble”
<br />

<br />
Areilla laughs loudly at Gryph’s playfulness and shakes her head. “Yes my Queen” Zabor answered with a sparkle in the one good eye he had left.
<br />

<br />
She bends down close to his dwarven ear and whispers “Is the guard prepared for the arrival M’lord?” lock of red hair falls loose from the hood of her cloak and brushes his cheek while she is speaking. Lost in the sensation of her soft hair touching his cheek he answers her almost breathlessly “Y…y…yes your majesty”.
<br />

<br />
“Very well! I will leave you to your work. Thank you for taking the time to humor me!” she says with a smile. “u… your welcome my queen” She snickers, knowing her effect on him and kisses his cheek as she straights herself and cast her levitation spell again. “Be Safe my Knights” she shouts with a wave and blows a kiss in the air towards the them.
<br />

<br />
The afternoon sun brings a chill with it. She hears a commotion in the guild hall. She thinks to herself that Aabe must have fallen over or into a barrel of Ale again.
<br />

<br />
She enters the room and sees none other than the gruesome twosome Suvim and Louski Of the Warriors Of Wrath.
<br />

<br />
“Hey Areilla, What’s with all the cloak and dagger girl?”
<br />

<br />
She floats over to them and hugs both Suvim and Louski. “Oh its so good to see both of you. I’m so glad you can make it! I didn’t expect you for at least another 2 hours. You must have skipped a LOT of wench's and taverns to get here so quickly” The 3 old friends laugh in agreement.
<br />

<br />
“So what’s up?” Louski says directly
<br />

<br />
She looks around to many in the room preparing for this evening celebration. “Follow me to my private quarters. I will fill you in there.” she says and before either of them can say anything she adds “and no smart remarks outta either of you!”
<br />

<br />
She opens the door to her visiting room and sitting on a chair in the far corner was a drood dressed is all the same color blue with a smirk on his face. Areilla smiles brightly and hops on his lap and kisses him on the cheek and hugs him and squeals “Sithiss you made it!!”
<br />

<br />
Louski jealously says “Hey Suvim we didn’t get a greeting like that. huh? Hmph!”
<br />

<br />
“Did you bring my oggy?” She says with wide eyes filled with excitement like a child.
<br />

<br />
“He’s to slow. I think I lost him in L Fay. But he’s on his way” Sithiss nodded a greeting to the other men whom entered with her. 
<br />

<br />
“Oh Goody!” Areilla says. “So what’s going on sugar? Why the cryptic letter? The Lizard givin’ ya a hard time?” Sithiss questions
<br />

<br />
“No Choboathe is fine! Everyone is fine! I didn’t ask you here for myself either. I have received this letter.” 
<br />

<br />
She reaches inside her robes near her heart where she has kept the letter since she received it. She hands the letter to Louski the other druids look over his shoulders. Within moments they read the scrolls and look up at her in unison they say “Is this for real?”
<br />

<br />
With a proud smile she says “Yes, its for real sillies. The arrival should be this very night…..”<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.brellrants.net/knightsofareilla/index.php" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://www.southbronx.net/~fubar/WoW/springsig.jpg" border="0"></a>
