                  <p><span class="largetext">"Clumsy elf!" she mumbles to herself as she picks up her purple helmet buried in the newly fallen leaves.  It's been so long since she has been on any kind of adventure like this, and is starting to rethink the idea to come alone on such a long journey.  Maybe she should have sent word to the Queen and the General to organize a party to escort her but quickly ignores that thought. "You have to trust yourself" she thinks to herself.
<br />
    
<br />
   "We don't have much longer love, we are getting closer," she whispers brushing her companions hair out of his eyes.
<br />
    "You have been strong for me on this journey.  I knew that silly gnomer was thinking straight when he bought you for me so long ago," she giggles.
<br />

<br />
    She looks around and senses a strange familiarity.  She glances down and realizes the rock she just tripped over was not quite a rock, but more like a clump of dirt. "Rocky!" she runs over to the pet she missed so much.
<br />
    "What are you doing so far out her without that silly mage of yours?" He looks at her and shrugs, clearly confused.
<br />
   
<br />
 "Not too bright are ya?" she smirks. "Now I know we are getting closer."
<br />

<br />
     She continures on the path knowing she is getting closer and closer to the place she called home, and the people she called family.  With Rocky ahead and her horse following close behind her mind drifts as she remembers adventures passed.
<br />

<br />
     She remembers the many battles she has foughts alongside of her fellow Knights from the early Kael raids to the later battles with Doomshade.  Even the disappointing first adventure into Chardok holds a special place in her heart. Helping with epic fights for Sithiss, Louski, Iwean, Brillian, and many others always got her excited.  And how could she forget the many Beastlord epic battles, and vowing to only help Loganaich, her father figure, with his in the future.  With all the battles, good or bad she was standing by her fellow Knights until the end.
<br />

<br />
     She remembers the light hearted moments like "Girls Gone Wild" in PoK during a Plane of Sky raid, and the first anniversary party held in the bazaar.  She recalls the many plate fittings she had to endure due to the bon-bon sessions in the Nexus with the Queen.
<br />
     
<br />
 She giggles as she remembers the times in Solusek A with Areilla and Xello waiting for that evil goblin and his ring.  The times in Skyfire hunting shards for Louski with Areilla, Spinepuller, Xello, and her favorite druid Suvim warms her heart.  Of course her own adventures in Skyfire with Choboathe and his heated rock she can not forget.  She giggles as she recalls acting like goobs in themany trips to Maidens Eye, Sebilis and to the Plane of Nightmare with fellow Knights and friends.  She can't help but get excited about future adventures with all of the Knights of past and present.
<br />
    
<br />
 Thinking of her friends tears begin to flow from her eyes.  She asks herself, "How could I have left?" Then she remembers quickly how much she needed her family back in Felwithe.  She wonders how much the guild has change since she has been gone. Who has left? Who has come back? Is there still a place for me?
<br />
     
<br />
 She's knocked out of her trance by the sound of familiar laughter and chatter coming from the building to the west of her.  She looks around for Rocky but he has obviously deserted her.  "Hmph...dumb rock, " she grumbles. She looks wide-eyed from underneath her helmet, and there embedded in the building is the emblem that represents everything she believes in.
<br />
     
<br />
She sighs with relief, "Whew, so I wasn't that lost, and maybe I do have some ranger skills in me, Elrador and Archlingel would be so proud."
<br />
      
<br />
The building ahead looked so warm and inviting, so with a tug of her horses' bridle and a gleam in her eye she whispers, "Well love, lets go home."</span><span class="smalltext"></span></p>

                  <p><span class="largetext">High atop the castle of KoA a lonely figure stands a wolf by his side. He carefully looks in all directions North, South, East, & West as the Sun slowly sinks in the sea and the Moon rises over the land. He stares once more towards Felwithe as the light fails straining for one last glimpse in the hope of seeing a figure on horseback making it's way towards what he now calls home. Used to being alone with his wolf having grown up in Everfrost and made his fortune in Great Divide he still looks strangely forlorn. What can possibly bring tears to such a fierce and Savage Lord only the wolf by his side could tell as he never lets anyone see his emotions so plainly exhibted here in the evening atop the castle.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="icon_cry.gif" border="0" /> The wolf moves closer to his Master and gently pushes his hand with his nose as if to say I understand Master and I am here to help the time pass. He gently pets his wolf and then looks around one last time to be sure he is alone. Then he reaches under his cloak and removes a candle. He places it where it can be seen from afar and lights it as he does every evening he is home in the castle. He looks one more time as light fades and says to his wolf. Call to her and tell her to hurry home. The castle is not the same without it's Princess here to warm the halls with laughter and song. Hurry home Sweetheart of the KoA your Knight's await your return to the safety only we can provide to you. He sighs and leaves the top of the castle his job done for another day telling his wolf to guard here. As you wish Master I guard this castle with my life. A light is lit for the safe return of our Princess.</span><span class="smalltext"></span></p>

                  <p><span class="largetext">Though the Crypt is guarded by the Keepers of the Crypt, Necromancers, Shadow Knights, Dark Clerics and Shadow Rogues I feel as if I am alone here in the depths of my home.  The entry to the Crypt is located in the Royal Graveyard and yet like my chosen profession it delves deep into the earth. And though I return here to my office and home every night, it is in the Castle and Guild Hall above where I feel most welcome and never alone.
<br />

<br />
The wind tonight is omnious and cold on its journey thru KoA's lands.  And on the chill it carries a faint scent as well as a silver laughter.  Word from my Queen had said that the Princess was returning home.  In fact I have watched the General snap his troops into shape in very short time.  Ahh how my Keepers would love to go to battle with the Generals Queensguard  Knights and Clergy.  It shows how much Power and Love the Queen herself holds for two different factions to reside on the same grounds, and hold the same purpose of Duty and Loyalty to the Queen and not tear each others throats out.  Perhaps someday, but not this night for I have some of that Duty I speak of to attend to.
<br />

<br />
I invoke a soft magic that will carry my voice to my four Senior Apprentices.  At the same time they appear before me as if they are one and say in unison, "Yes Master?".  Ahh Famine, Pestilance, Decay, and Destruction how each one vies for my approval, and yet know they will never recieve it.  "The four of you send out some of your Keepers and ensure that the Princess returns home unmolested by any Undead, Bandits, or Assassins.  If any harm comes to Her I will hold you all personally responsible as if you were the ones who did the harm to Her. Also have the Royal Graveyard above cleaned spotless as if the Queen herself was doing the inspection.  I am sure the General will have some of his Queensguard Knights out as well, remind the troops to not interfere or engage his troops in any manner or I will feed them to my Pet." They stand there in silence like good hounds and when silence ensues they answer again in unison, "Yes Master, your will is our command."
<br />

<br />
After my apprentices leave I finish up my latest logs on the graves above.  I lock my valuables away and send a telepathic link to my pet Mortis informing him that I will be above in the Guild Hall and to kill anything that trys to enter.  I then shadow step into my predestined spot against the wall of the Guild Hall behind the Queen's chair.  From here I can watch the whole hall and still be in reach to protect our Queen should any harm befall her here. 
<br />

<br />
I slowly grin evilly thinking no wishing someone would try and harm our Queen here.  The so called Assassin or Army would find out quickly and deadly how fast and furious these Knights of Areilla would react to that kind of action against thier Queen.  Even the dullard Aabe whom a lot of individuals think he is passed out drunk &lt;even though I know he is not, for no amount of Alcohol will knock that dwarf out of his senses&gt; would jump in defense to his Queen and show these new found Berserker's what a Paladin of Brell can do when foaming and spitting at the mouth.
<br />

<br />
I watch my Queen engage her Knights around the table with laughter of a woman who feels secure in her home and not a care in the world on her mind.  It does my cold heart good to see her warm smile and to know that when she is smiling there is peace in the Castle and Guild Hall of the KoA.  I even look over at the General who is always close to his Queen's side and catch his eyes seeing me in the shadows.  I smile slightly, nod my head in recognition of his Duty, Courage, and Loyalty to our Queen.  And in the warm feeling that I get from the comradre of all the Knights here, I think to myself that maybe I should give the General back his eye.  But like most thoughts of any good intent that enters my mind it goes quickly and I chuckle to myself.  It is then that I hear the Queensguard's Horns calling out that a Knight of Areilla is coming towards the gates.  And following quickly the horns blare that it is Royalty.
<br />

<br />
All eyes turn towards the Queen and notice tears streaming down her face.  The General hands her a hankerchief and bellows orders for a chair to be placed by the Queens. The Knights of Areilla stand with thier cups raised and turn towards the doors of the Guild Hall.  The General bellows more orders and his Queensguard Knights form two columns at the doors.  Another order is given and they unsheath thier swords forming a canopy over the red carpet that leads to the Table of Fellowship.  I notice the Queen compose herself and stand. I find myself holding my breath as the double wide doors open to reveal the outline......<br />_________________<br /><img src="http://www.southbronx.net/~fubar/thaansig.gif" border="0"></span><span class="smalltext"></span></p>
