<img src="images/1a.jpg" alt="1a.jpg (9254 bytes)" WIDTH="164" HEIGHT="200"> Followers of
Bristlebane, The King Of Thieves, believe in having<br>
fun, at the expense of nearly all else. Bards, rogues, jesters, gamblers<br>
and gypsies are all typical followers. They are almost always very charming,<br>
clever, and witty, traits which all Bristlebane followers should strive to<br>
have. Mischief in all its forms is encouraged. Practical jokes are performed<br>
as if they are the highest of rituals. Very few of Bristlebane's followers<br>
are outright wicked in their desires but it is best to keep at least one eye<br>
on your purse if they are about. And never let one deal you a hand of King's<br>
Court.<br>

<br>
<img src="images/2a.jpg" alt="2a.jpg (11886 bytes)" WIDTH="186" HEIGHT="200"> Followers of
Cazic-Thule, The Faceless, fear their Lord and believe<br>
that only by causing terror in others will they be spared his vengeful<br>
wrath. They strive to beat down and suppress all hope. Fear rules their<br>
lives and through fear they rule the lives of others. Pain, misery,<br>
violence, torture, living sacrifice; these are the tools of a Cazicite. Many<br>
Lizardman tribes are devout followers of Cazic-Thule, but his number of<br>
humanoid followers grows daily, a cold shadow slowly engulfing the bright<br>
spots of Norrath in a nightmare of horror and pain.<br>

<br>
<img src="images/3a.jpg" alt="3a.jpg (14589 bytes)" WIDTH="135" HEIGHT="200"> Followers of
Innoruuk, The Prince of Hate, include nearly the entire<br>
Dark Elven race who regard him as their &quot;Father.&quot; They believe that Hate is<br>
a creative force, or rather &quot;THE&quot; creative force in the universe. Creativity<br>
born of destruction. Love and kindness are tools for those too ignorant to<br>
know what they want or too cowardly to do what is necessary to obtain it. It<br>
is only through the total disdain of your enemies that you can gain true<br>
power over them. Pity and mercy have no power when confronted with contempt<br>
and viciousness. It is the honest belief of the followers of Innoruuk that<br>
if they were to hate strong enough they could destroy all of Norrath.<br>

<br>
<img src="images/4a.jpg" alt="4a.jpg (7304 bytes)" WIDTH="131" HEIGHT="200"> Followers of
Karana, The Rainkeeper, believe in the absolute power of<br>
storms. They worship the life giving power of the rain and respect the<br>
destructive force of a sandstorm or hurricane. Typical followers of Karana<br>
are rural humanoids, farmers, ranchers, hunters, and the like. They will<br>
often offer shelter from the elements to strangers. Many Karana followers<br>
live a nomadic lifestyle, travelling where the winds take them. They are<br>
humble, generous people who value strength and honesty and brook no<br>
disrespect of Karana and his work for they know it is only through his<br>
wisdom and kindness that all of Norrath is not consumed in an eternal<br>
tempest.<br>

<br>
<img src="images/5a.jpg" alt="5a.jpg (7935 bytes)" WIDTH="123" HEIGHT="200"> Followers of
Erollisi Marr, The Queen Of Love, cling to the belief<br>
that love conquers all. It should be pointed out that while love is a<br>
generally peaceful concept, Erollisi worshippers are not pacifists. They<br>
would like to live in a world where everyone loves everyone else and<br>
violence does not exist but they are not naïve enough to think that Norrath<br>
is that world. They have passionate loves of people, places and ideas and<br>
are more than willing to fight and die to preserve those things. The dream<br>
of every follower of Erollisi is to die in selfless defense of someone or<br>
something they love. Many Paladins hear the true calling of their hearts and<br>
follow Erollisi Marr.<br>

<br>
<img src="images/6a.jpg" alt="6a.jpg (7413 bytes)" WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="200"> Followers of
Rodcet Nife, The Prime Healer, take a solemn oath to<br>
fight disease and death until one or the other finally claims them. They are<br>
very generous and humble, asking little more than the recipients of aid from<br>
them pass their kindness onto another. They are not content to deal with the<br>
effects of disease and death after they occur and vigorously seek to destroy<br>
the sources of these evils. Healers and mystics are typical followers but<br>
many noble rangers and paladins also have also taken the Nife Oath. They<br>
believe that, through faith in The Prime Healer, the wounded heart of the<br>
universe shall one day be mended and death's dark shadow will never be seen<br>
again.<br>

<br>
<img src="images/7a.jpg" alt="7a.jpg (8117 bytes)" WIDTH="152" HEIGHT="200"> Followers of
Prexus, The Oceanlord, believe true power lies in the<br>
vast depths of Norrath's oceans. They believe that eons ago life first<br>
formed in the murky deep and that one day the oceans shall rise again to<br>
consume those who are unworthy and to embrace the faithful. The Oceanlord's<br>
servants tend to live and work near, on, or beneath large bodies of water.<br>
They seek to spread the word of Prexus to all who will hear and defend the<br>
oceans and seas of Norrath against any who would cause them harm. Many<br>
sailors and fishermen are followers of Prexus.<br>

<br>
<img src="images/9a.jpg" alt="9a.jpg (8029 bytes)" WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="200"> Followers of
Quellious, The Tranquil, seek peace. They are not strict<br>
pacifists though and will fight to defend themselves and those they care<br>
about. The peace they seek is an inner one. They wish to know all there is<br>
to know about themselves and the world around them. They thirst for<br>
knowledge of their true selves and strive to help others attain<br>
enlightenment. It is through the sharing of this knowledge that they believe<br>
universal peace can be obtained. If every creature fully understood itself<br>
and its neighbors there would be no need for conflict and war. Followers of<br>
Quellious often follow a nomadic lifestyle, constantly seeking what there is<br>
to know and hoping to find themselves along the way.<br>

<br>
<img src="images/10a.jpg" alt="10a.jpg (18428 bytes)" WIDTH="188" HEIGHT="200"> Followers
of Brell Serilis, The Duke of Below, believe that the<br>
surface world is a waste of space. They find true happiness in the caves,<br>
caverns and tunnels that perforate the belly of Norrath. But this is one of<br>
few points that all followers of Brell can agree upon. There are many<br>
different factions who all worship Brell. The Runny Eye Clan of Goblins<br>
claim he is their father much to the disgust of the Dwarves of Kaladim who<br>
know that the Dwarves are the true children of Serilis. But the vicious<br>
Gnolls of Split Paw disagree entirely. For was it not Brell who sculpted<br>
them out of the sacred Clay of Cosgrove? Followers of Brell Serilis in one<br>
form or another can be found nearly anywhere you enter the Underfoot of<br>
Norrath.<br>

<br>
<img src="images/11a.jpg" alt="11a.jpg (17812 bytes)" WIDTH="152" HEIGHT="200"> The
followers of Rallos Zek, The Warlord, believe in survival of the<br>
strong and death to the weak. Strength, courage, but above all, victory is<br>
what the heart of a true follower of Zek yearns for. In the heat of battle<br>
is the only place where enlightenment can be gained. The universe was formed<br>
by conflict and in conflict it will end. The victors feasting upon the<br>
remains of their fallen enemy. No respect or regard is given to the dead,<br>
for if they were worthy their hearts would still pump blood through their<br>
veins and not upon the soil of Norrath. Followers of Zek are almost<br>
exclusively warriors.<br>

<br>
<img src="images/12a.jpg" alt="12a.jpg (10518 bytes)" WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="200"> Tarew Marr
is one of a triumvirate of beings who rule over the Plane<br>
of Water. The people of Norrath know little of him. His relationship to<br>
Mithaniel and Erollisi Marr is a source of constant debate amongst their<br>
followers.<br>
