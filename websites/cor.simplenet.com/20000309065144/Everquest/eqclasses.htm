<p align="center">The following is a description of Classes found with in Everquest :</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="6" color="#804000" face="Old English Text MT"><strong>Warrior</strong></font><font SIZE="3"></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000A0">Warriors are the masters of armed combat, in all
its many forms. They are at home on the</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000A0">battlefield, and are trained to take punishment as
much as dole it out, so their Hit Points are the</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000A0">highest of any class.</font></p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="6"><font face="Old English Text MT"><font color="#804000"><strong>Cleric</strong></font></font></p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="3"><font color="#0000A0">The Cleric is a holy man
endowed by his patron deity with the power to heal, and, to a lesser</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000A0">extent, call upon the wrath of his deity to smite
his foes. Prayer is how the Cleric gains his ability.</font></p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="6"><font face="Old English Text MT"><font color="#804000"><strong>Paladin</strong></font></font></p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="3"><font color="#0000A0">Paladins are the very
picture of a holy knight, fighting for the cause of good in all aspects of his life. They
share some of the power of a Cleric, and a good deal of the fighting ability of a Warrior,
but have a few powers all their own.</font></p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="6"><font face="Old English Text MT"><strong><font color="#804000">Ranger</font></strong></font></p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="3"><font color="#0000A0">The Ranger is a meld between
a Warrior and a Druid, sharing some of the skills of both. They are at home in the
outdoors.</font></p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="6"><font face="Old English Text MT"><strong><font color="#804000">Shadow Knight</font></strong></font></p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="3"><font color="#0000A0">The evil twin to the Paladin
class, Shadow Knights derive all of their powers from the evil gods</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000A0">whom they serve. They are a meld of Warrior and
Necromancer, and share some of their abilities</font></p>

<p align="center">and spells.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="6"><font face="Old English Text MT"><strong><font color="#804000">Druid</font></strong></font></p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="3"><font color="#0000A0">A Druid is completely at
home in the outdoors, and is a friend to all animals. Because of this, no</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000A0">animal will ever attack him unless first attacked
by the Druid. They are spellcasters whose focus is all things natural, allowing them to
call upon nature for aid. They share some woodland skills with their Ranger brothers.</font></p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="6"><font color="#804000"><font face="Old English Text MT"><strong>Monk</strong></font></font></p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="3"><font color="#0000A0">Monks are dedicated to the
pursuit of shaping their bodies into a pure weapon, and because of this</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000A0">they nearly shun all weapons and most forms of
armor. They are very religious as well, and the</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000A0">gods are known to bless them, not by prayers and
spells, but by magically enhancing their attacks.</font></p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="6"><font color="#804000"><font face="Old English Text MT"><strong>Bard</strong></font></font></p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="3"><font color="#0000A0">The Bard&#146;s
stock-in-trade is his ability to play songs. His songs are actually spells of a sort, and</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000A0">their magical affects last as long as the Bard
continues to sing and play the correct instrument.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000A0">They have some passing knowledge of the Warrior
ways (mainly for self-defense), but their main</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000A0">focus is always their art, and so they will never
be as skillful as Warriors.</font></p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="6"><font color="#804000"><font face="Old English Text MT"><strong>Rogue</strong></font></font></p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="3"><font color="#0000A0">They are the secretive,
mysterious class of the world, who sneak about in the dark. Some say they</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000A0">are assassins, and some that they are nothing but
common thieves, but the truth lies somewhere in</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000A0">the middle, and they are capable of both. They are
quite skilled with many weapons, but they</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000A0">cannot stand toe to toe with a Warrior and prefer
to make the kill by a sudden attack from the rear, at which they are extremely skilled.
They would much prefer to not be discovered at all, or if they are, to not be there for
their opponent&#146;s blow to land. The darker skills of picking locks and stealing are
also their forte.</font></p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="6"><font color="#804000"><font face="Old English Text MT"><strong>Shaman</strong></font></font></p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="3"><font color="#0000A0">They are similar to the
Cleric, but are more of a tribal witch doctor and are typically found amongst the more
primitive races. Their primary focus is largely healing and other Clerical type spells,
but they also have a good deal of offensive spells.</font></p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="6" color="#804000" face="Old English Text MT"><strong>Necromancer</strong></font><font SIZE="3"></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000A0">These are the dark brotherhood of the arcane arts,
dabbling in death. Through evil spiritually based spells, they are able to animate dead
bodies and skeletons to do their bidding, as well as having spells which leach life from
their victims.</font></p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="6"><font color="#804000"><font face="Old English Text MT">Wizard</font></font></p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="3"><font color="#0000A0">Wizards are the master
seekers of knowledge, and their talents and spells are focused on this goal.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000A0">They use powerful spells to not only see things
from afar, but to transport them there as well. This</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000A0">thirst for arcane knowledge has also made them the
true masters of the strongest form of defense:</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000A0">offensive spells of pure destruction. In their
ability to do magical damage, they have no rivals.</font></p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="6"><font color="#804000"><font face="Old English Text MT"><strong>Magician</strong></font></font></p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="3"><font color="#0000A0">Magicians are the summoners
of the arcane arts, and wield the power to call forth everything from a loaf of bread to a
huge Fire Elemental to fight for them. While not as adept at offensive spells as the
Wizards, Magicians still wield considerable power in this area as well.</font></p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="6"><font color="#804000"><font face="Old English Text MT"><strong>Enchanter</strong></font></font></p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="3"><font color="#0000A0">The primary focus of the
Enchanter&#146;s art can be summed up by the name of the arcane order to</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000A0">which he belongs: Enchanter. Their spells are
crafted to enchant people, places, and things. This</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000A0">art allows them to charm beings and make them
fight for their new master, or magically enhance</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000A0">the capabilities of a sword. They also have some
skill in offensive spells, but are never as skilled as a Wizard.</font></font></p>
