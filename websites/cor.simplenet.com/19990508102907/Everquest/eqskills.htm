<p align="center">There are a variety of skills in EverQuest, and learning and developing
those skills is key to a</p>

<p align="center">character's success in the game. How a skill works in-game depends on
the type of skill. Some</p>

<p align="center">skills are triggered automatically, while others are used at the
player's discretion. Also, some skills</p>

<p align="center">are very general and shared by all, while others are specific to certain
races and classes. In</p>

<p align="center">general, the more the character attempts to use a skill, the better he
or she will become at it. The</p>

<p align="center">following is a list of several skills, including a short description.
Keep in mind, however, that this list</p>

<p align="center">is intentionally incomplete -- some skills are more obscure and
difficult to learn, and it will be up to</p>

<p align="center">the player to discover them and their uses as they explore the world
that is Norrath.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Abjuration</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">One of the several skills related to the art of
magic, abjuration deals with defensive magic, for</p>

<p align="center">example a spell that enables the character to take less damage from
extreme cold.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Alteration</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Another of the several skills related to the art
of magic, alteration deals with changing things,</p>

<p align="center">whether it be illusion or an actual physical change. An example would be
a spell that teleports</p>

<p align="center">something, or that enables a character to move faster, or forces him or
her to move more slowly.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Archery</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">In addition to the skills dealing with melee
combat, range weapons are also prevalent in the world.</p>

<p align="center">The skill of archery deals with a characters efficacy in using bows,
crossbows, and other similar</p>

<p align="center">devices.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Backstabbing</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">The Rogue has in his repertoire many unique
skills, including the ability to strike at his opponent</p>

<p align="center">from behind, often dealing a great deal of damage in one blow.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Bash</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Certain races and classes have the ability to
knock an opponent down, thereby both disorienting</p>

<p align="center">him, lowering his defenses, and also interrupting the process of
spellcasting.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Block</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Negating an attack by deflecting the blow with
one's body is a skill unique to the Monk, and</p>

<p align="center">blocking is one of several skills available to that class.</p>

<p align="center">Blunt, Slashing, &amp; Piercing Weapons</p>

<p align="center">Combat is rather integral to the game, and there are a variety of
weapons available to the</p>

<p align="center">combatant. In general, these weapons are broken up into three
categories, blunt, slashing, and</p>

<p align="center">piercing, as well as whether they require one or two hands to wield. The
better one is at these</p>

<p align="center">skills, the more effective they are with that weapon.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Channeling</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">One of the several skills related to the art of
magic, channeling allows the caster to decrease the</p>

<p align="center">amount of time necessary to cast a spell, regardless of its nature.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Conjuration</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Another of the several skills related to the art
of magic, conjuration brings something from</p>

<p align="center">elsewhere into the world, whether they be elemental creatures or
powerful clouds of energy.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Disarm</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">This skill allows the combatant to dislodge a
wielded weapon from his opponents hands, knocking it</p>

<p align="center">to the ground, and forcing him, at least for the moment, to fight
hand-to-hand.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Divination</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Another of the several skills related to the art
of magic, spells of divination allow the caster to both</p>

<p align="center">detect things previously concealed, as well as to conceal things
previously visible.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Dodge</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">One of the better ways to negate damage is to
completely avoid the blow itself, and the skill of</p>

<p align="center">dodging allows the combatant to do just that.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Dual Wield</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Certain classes will be able to wield a weapon
effectively in both hands, thereby increasing the</p>

<p align="center">number of attacks and thus the amount of damage dealt in a given amount
of time.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Evocation</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Another of the several skills related to the art
of magic, evocation deals with things that go boom.</p>

<p align="center">Fireballs, force spells, etc. all fall under the auspices of this
offensive skill.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Foraging</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Being at home in the wilderness has many benefits,
including the ability to forage food. This skill</p>

<p align="center">has been known to save quite a few trips back to town when the supplies
have inadvertently run out</p>

<p align="center">mid-quest.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Hand-to-Hand</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Although this skill can be mastered by only the
Monks, most every other class can at least throw</p>

<p align="center">the occasional punch. Besides, one never knows when one might be
relieved of one's weapon, both</p>

<p align="center">during combat and at other times.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Kick</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Being able to dish out a bit more damage during
combat is attractive to many of the warrior classes</p>

<p align="center">in the game, and kicking one's opponent in unpleasant places in between
sword swings does just</p>

<p align="center">that.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Meditate</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Another of the several skills related to the art
of magic, meditation allows the caster to memorize</p>

<p align="center">spells more quickly.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Pick Lock</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Oftentimes finding that precise key is just too
time consuming or expensive, and the lock picking</p>

<p align="center">abilities of the Rogue class come in very handy.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Safe Fall</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Monks, being typically unencumbered by heavy armor
and weapons, often work on their ability to</p>

<p align="center">fall great distances, yet still land on their feet, incurring minimal if
any damage.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Sense Direction</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Although compasses are known to exist, they are
also typically rare and expensive. Certain races</p>

<p align="center">and classes, however, have the innate ability to determine their heading
and direction. Then again,</p>

<p align="center">they are also often times wrong.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Singing</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Bards (one can at least hope) have great singing
voices. And the better they are at this art, the</p>

<p align="center">more effective their songs, which are themselves often magical in
nature.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Steal</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Another art known only to the more shady of
individuals, this Rogue-specific skill allows the</p>

<p align="center">miscreant to pilfer items from both players and NPCs. Their intended
victim, however, will at times</p>

<p align="center">detect this activity, and will rarely appreciate the attempt.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Stringed Instruments</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Certain Bard songs require certain instruments,
and the better the minstrel is at playing Stringed</p>

<p align="center">Instruments, the more effective he or she will be at playing those
songs.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Swimming</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Many areas in the world of Norrath are covered by
water, and one's ability to maneuver in that</p>

<p align="center">environment is directly related to one's skill level in swimming.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Wind Instruments</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Certain Bard songs require certain instruments,
and the better the minstrel is at playing Wind</p>

<p align="center">Instruments, the more effective he or she will be at playing those
songs.</font></p>
