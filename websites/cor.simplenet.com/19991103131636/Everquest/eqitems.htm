<p align="center">Acquiring various items in EverQuest, whether they be</p>

<p align="center">armor, weapons, jewelry, or other equipment, is an</p>

<p align="center">important part of building your character. With over twenty</p>

<p align="center">different body locations, configuring your character can</p>

<p align="center">involve a bit of customization. In each inventory slot an icon</p>

<p align="center">appears representing any one of hundreds of items that</p>

<p align="center">can be bought, found, or quested for, and changing many</p>

<p align="center">of the slots also alters the appearance of your character in</p>

<p align="center">the world itself. The following is a list of the various</p>

<p align="center">inventory locations, the types of items one might equip</p>

<p align="center">oneself with, as well as a shot of the inventory screen.</p>

<p align="center">Keep in mind that only mundane (non-magical) items are</p>

<p align="center">described, but rumors and legends abound, often</p>

<p align="center">describing rare and potent objects, even unique artifacts of great
power.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Armor Materials</font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p align="center">Most armors are constructed from three basic types of materials:
Leather, Chain and Plate.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Leather Armor</font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p align="center">Leather armor is the easiest to manufacture and is usually taken from
livestock, cut to the desired</p>

<p align="center">pattern and then boiled and shaped to fit the wearer. It provides
moderate protection from thrusting</p>

<p align="center">weapons and can be excellent against the slash attack. Leather is,
however, quite useless against</p>

<p align="center">impact or &quot;bashing&quot; weapons like the mace or axe.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Chain Armor</font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p align="center">Chain mail or ring mail provides much better protection than leather but
is also a magnitude more</p>

<p align="center">difficult to make and far more expensive. Chain consists of thousands of
small links of wire, each</p>

<p align="center">shaped into a ring and riveted together to close the ring. Each ring is
then knitted together in either a</p>

<p align="center">three link, four link or five link configuration and then these are
joined to make a coat. The more links</p>

<p align="center">in a given section the stronger the mail will be. Chain gives good
protection against all types of</p>

<p align="center">attacks, however can be vulnerable to some weapon thrusts.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Plate Armor</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Plate is the best type of armor available. It is
made of sheets of steel shaped to fit the wearers&#146; body</p>

<p align="center">through forging, and tempered to a tough hardness. Plate is extremely
hard to make and much more</p>

<p align="center">expensive than chain. (In today's dollars a full suit of plate would be
the equivalent of purchasing a</p>

<p align="center">Lear Jet.)</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5"><font color="#800000">Armor Types</font></p>

<p align="center">Masks</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Leather mask: More of a tool to hide identity than
protection, the leather mask can still turn a knife</p>

<p align="center">blade or a glancing arrow.</p>

<p align="center">Chain mask: These give good eye protection from slashing attacks.</p>

<p align="center">Plate mask: Usually incorporated into the helmet, but sometimes worn
alone, the plate mask can</p>

<p align="center">protect fighters&#146; charisma by keeping the nose straight and all the
teeth intact.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Helmets</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Leather: The leather helmet, or skull cap, is a
favorite of mercenaries as it provides some small</p>

<p align="center">protection against the slash and also keeps the head warm on those long
cold nights of</p>

<p align="center">campaigning.</p>

<p align="center">Chain: The chain helm or Coif provides great head protection and has the
added bonus of reaching</p>

<p align="center">down below the head to cover portions of the neck.</p>

<p align="center">Plate. The plate helm, or great helm, completely encloses the head
creating a solid wall between the</p>

<p align="center">wearer and those that would do him harm.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Earrings</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Earrings are typically more of a decoration than
armor; however they could stop a slash to the throat</p>

<p align="center">(better safe than sorry).</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Gorget</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Leather: Generally large to cover the shoulders as
well as the neck, the Leather Gorget is a cheap</p>

<p align="center">way to protect your jugular.</p>

<p align="center">Chain: A more primitive form, the Chain Gorget is still in use because
of the trade off it provides</p>

<p align="center">between protection and price.</p>

<p align="center">Plate: The plate Gorget can turn all but the most determined blows; it
is, however, expensive and</p>

<p align="center">very uncomfortable to wear.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Breast</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Leather: A studded leather breast piece is a good
bet for the beginning adventurer. It protects and</p>

<p align="center">warms the wearer and gives good slashing protection.</p>

<p align="center">Chain: The standard in armor protection throughout Antonica. Good
all-around armor against almost</p>

<p align="center">all types of weapons.</p>

<p align="center">Plate: Few items can match the status one enjoys when wearing a
breastplate. Many are lovingly</p>

<p align="center">crafted with designs and fluting, but whether fancy or plain, this is
the armor to stop your enemies</p>

<p align="center">cold in their tracks.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Back</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">A fine cloak of brocade or a boiled leather cape
covers the posterior nicely. Either type is fine for</p>

<p align="center">protecting your back during the frenzy of a melee. For protection
against rogues, however, one</p>

<p align="center">should complete the breastplate with a back plate.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Shoulders</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Leather: The gambeson will protect the shoulders
well with the added bonus of being able to wear it</p>

<p align="center">under other types of epaulette.</p>

<p align="center">Chain: Usually this is one piece that stretches between the shoulders
and hangs relatively low on the</p>

<p align="center">body to provide a layering effect.</p>

<p align="center">Plate: The pauldron protects all the way from the neck to the middle of
the upper arm but does</p>

<p align="center">restrict mobility quite severely.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Arms</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Leather: Leather arm armor is generally just tubes
of soft leather stitched onto whatever coat the</p>

<p align="center">wearer has handy. It is very uncomfortable to wear but worth it when the
blades start swinging.</p>

<p align="center">Arm bands: Generally of steel, though occasionally of iron or brass,
these tight fitting bands can be</p>

<p align="center">the difference between a won battle, and the life of a one armed beggar.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Wrists (Bracers)</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Leather bracers are a favorite of archers as they
protect against bowstring slap as well as opponents'</p>

<p align="center">blades.</p>

<p align="center">Metal bracers offer far greater protection and generally extend to the
length of the forearm. They are</p>

<p align="center">heavy and this must be considered when participating in protracted
conflict.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Hands (Gauntlets)</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Leather: Inexpensive, workman-like protection, the
leather gauntlet will serve you well for many</p>

<p align="center">years.</p>

<p align="center">Chain: The chain glove is more like a mitt -- but still, it will save
your fingers from stray axe blows.</p>

<p align="center">Plate: The plate gauntlet is a marvel of craftsmanship. Each finger is
articulated for the best possible</p>

<p align="center">movement, and the hearty steel will stave off all but the most
determined of attacks.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Belts</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">The leather belt is a stalwart standard for
carrying you personal belongings, and it also offers some</p>

<p align="center">small protection from sword thrusts.</p>

<p align="center">The girdle is the only way for any self-respecting adventurer to go. The
large surface area provides</p>

<p align="center">both protection and support (the latter of which can increase stamina in
a long brawl).</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Fingers</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Rings are another method of armor that provides
both protection and vanity for the wearer. A world of</p>

<p align="center">advice, though: stay away from gold if you're serious about these as the
soft metal does not hold up</p>

<p align="center">well in combat.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Legs</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Leather: Leggings are little more than leather or
cloth wrapped around the legs and held in place with</p>

<p align="center">strips of leather. They will help to keep one warm, though.</p>

<p align="center">Chain: Chain pants are a good compromise between protection and price.
Their loose fit means that</p>

<p align="center">even achieving a hit on the leg is difficult, much less inflicting
actual damage.</p>

<p align="center">Plate: Greaves are plate protection for the legs and, when properly
fitted, are surprisingly</p>

<p align="center">comfortable. They can stop all but the heaviest of attacks.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Feet</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Leather boots, the staple of an adventurer -- one
could perhaps survive Antonica without armor, but if</p>

<p align="center">any travelling is planned a good pair of boots is a must.</p>

<p align="center">Solerets: These are plate mail for your feet. Uncomfortable at best and
clumsy at all times, these</p>

<p align="center">foot coverings are nevertheless nearly indestructible; one doesn't have
to worry about smashed or</p>

<p align="center">missing toes when wearing these.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Primary Weapon</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Your favored weapon should be your primary.
Examples include the Longsword, the Shortsword, the</p>

<p align="center">Broadsword, Two Handed, Bastard, Rapier, Axe, Great Axe, and Spear.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Secondary Weapon / Shield</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">Your second weapon, or more often a shield or
Targe of some type. Sometimes, however, one would</p>

<p align="center">use a Dagger or Main Gauche, a Mace or small Axe, or for the very
proficient, another sword.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Range Weapon</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">These include the Short Bow, Long Bow, Crossbow,
etc., and for the truly desperate, the Spear.</p>

<p align="center"></font><font size="5">Ammo</p>

<p align="center"></font><font SIZE="2">A space for arrows and bolts, the ammo is
automatically used when firing a Range Weapon.</font></p>
