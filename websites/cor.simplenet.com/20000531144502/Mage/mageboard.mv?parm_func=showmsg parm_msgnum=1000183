Also posted on EQVAULT.  i have only played my mage to level 20 thus far and unable to site how the pets are at high levels.  But my judging from what high lvl mages have posted here and elsewhere, I am seriously considering canceling my account as well.  I really feel bad for fellow mages who has hit level 44 and 49.  I guess I still have time to start over with a more viable class.  <br><br>I currently have a lvl 8 druid and never planned to kite (although with he last patch an attempt was made to eliminate this)  The reason for this part of the patch was to stop kiting (the ability to solo yellows and reds) so druids will be forced to group.  This was the reasoning behind the nerfing of the DOT's.  <br><br>But what was the reasoning behind nerfing the pets?  Because some warrior was complaining that the necro pet out damaged him?  What has this got to do with the mage pets?  I found it ridiculous since the necro and mages are two separate and distinct classes and nerfing one should not affected the other.  The original intention was due to a math error on the necro pets.  Again I ask "what has this got to do with mage pets?"  <br><br>I have spent countless hours playing my character just as everyone else has.  Just imagine when nerfing happens to you!  I'm not trying to scare you but trying to see if anyone out there has explanations for Verant's actions.  With Asheron's Call coming up, Verant is showing extremely poor judgement in its actions and pissing a lot of people off (i.e. mage's, necro's, druids, and owners of the (in)famous BOX OF ABU KAR).  <br><br>Why should I get this feeling of been in grade school again where Verant is this big scary teacher who is the center of the universe and that i'm sacred to death that he/she will call on me (my class) and just punish me by nerfing (even if i didn't do anything wrong).<br><br>I guess I'm going to wait for AC to come out and move on.  This has been my first MUD game and enjoyed it very much. I was very impressed and addicted to the game and has made a lot of wonderful friends. This was until Verant got bored and instead of improving and expanding the game as any good wise business should do, started to look at issues and try to play the role of god.  They should try and get the expansion out as soon as possible or risk a lot of people leaving EQ.  There will be no one around to buy the expansion pack when it comes out.  With AC coming out, i'm guessing there will be a lot of player’s migrating over there and this patch will just ensure that!<br><br>Please if anyone can supply me the information (or just) forward this message to Verant. (And let me know their response.)<br><br>And please post any comments regarding my thoughts (even if you disagree) <br><br><br>P.S. Also in my many journeys a lot of players have asked me not to summon pets due to the fact that they "steal" experience.  I only wished Verant would make clear this issue on the experience regarding pets and post it so ALL players are aware.<br><br>I apologize if this is a rant and wish all good luck.        <br><br><br>Diamondsun <br><br>Mage of the 21st Circle<br>Citizen of Rodcet Nife<br>
