Honestly, I put 1 point in the magic types and 1 in meditate, and have not spent one since.  All of the skill rise quickly to level 10 or so, and then slow down to a steady grow-once-in-50 uses.  There is a cap for skill level growth, something like 10 for 1st level, 5 each level thereafter.  So right after leveling you will see your skills improve, then they stop improving.  The only numerical readout you get on skills is when it improves, with the number in parenthesis at the end of the message.<br><br>Right now at level 16 I have 60+ training points, and will probably use them all on a trade skill at some point.  Dont bother putting training into weapons unless you plan on switching weapons--then train a bunch if you are past level 10 or so.  I use a 2HBlunt staff, and enjoy seeing "You crush BigFreakinMonster for 20 Damage!" every 3.8 seconds, versus the dagger 1HSlash message of "You slash him for 8 Damage" every 2.1 seconds.  When you do the math out the daggers are better in the long haul, but I use melee to finish a baddie off - in 1 or 2 rounds of melee.  My spell casting does 95% of the damage.  You melee a LOT less the higher you get.<br><br>As far as hunting grounds go, find a partner and fast!  You can solo as a mage, but no matter what others tell you, experience is much better in small groups!  When soloing you will spend 50% of your time meditating.  When some of the damage dispensing is shared, less meditating.  Plus, with a good partner, they will pull to you while you med and you will leap up and commence battle -- you can get 3 times the # of kills in same amount of time as soloing, and split the experience.  <br><br>Once you find a good partner, FRIEND THEM.  I found a partner around level 6 named Zhareen, Half Elf Druid.  We worked well together so I added her to friend list.  Then, every time I was on, I noticed her character growth closely matched the pace of mine, and we were on a similiar times.  I have had others I liked to work with, but she & and do the best and match up well.  So I started chatting with her when I jumped on, and soon we met several times a week to group and do something.  Now, at level 16, we meet every day and do something.  We have each done huge favors for each other, and will continue to do so.<br><br>The point is, make sure you make friends now while others (and you) need it the most, and they will soon pay off.<br><br>Ragincajun, Magician of the 16 season<br>Veeshan of Norrath<br><br><br><br>: I'm level 6 and have 15 skill points burning a hole in wha<br>: tever you keep those things in.<br>: <br>: So far I've been using my knife exclusively, and no other <br>: weapon.
