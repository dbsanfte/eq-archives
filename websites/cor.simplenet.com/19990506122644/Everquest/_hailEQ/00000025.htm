<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>This carries over from some of the controversy from COR UO, but I think it should also
be addressed here. I don't believe it's ever been decided whether or not there would be
one administrator &lt;GM&gt;overseeing every game that COR participates in, or a separate
GM for each game. In the near past, Gammit was GM of Monarchy, Kal was GM of UO. How much
they worked together I don't know. I think it is something that needs to be decided upon.
If we have separate GM's for each game, we risk the possibility of changing COR so much in
one game that it no longer meshes with COR in other games. One solution would be to form a
GM committee. COR Charter changes would first have to be approved in the GM committee,
then could be voted on by the members in the game involved. </p>

<p>My 2 cents, please respond with ideas or comments.</p>
