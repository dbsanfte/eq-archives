<p>Hey Everquest announced it's release date and a few other things.. here is the message.
&quot;We are finally able to announce some dates! Most of the announcements will go out tomorrow, but I had the chance to post them here tonight, and I know people have been waiting a long time, so here goes:
<p>
EverQuest will be released on March 16, 1999.
<p>
Phase 4 testing will begin early-mid February (I'll hopefully have a more precise date soon, but it should be some time between the 1st and 15th).
<p>
We will be sending out an email to all registered beta testers (yes, the one we had hoped to send out in early December) explaining how and where to sign up for Phase 4 next week. This will include pricing. 
<p>
So there you have it. So far the beta test has been a huge success, and we appreciate both those who have participated, and patience of those who could not, who have been waiting.
<p>
Phase 4 is around the corner, and the release of the game around the next. It's a very exciting time for us, but at the same time there's still a lot of work to be done, and I and the team will deliver the game you all have been waiting for shortly. 
<p>
Thanks for your continued interest and faith in the game and the development team behind it.
<p>

Producer, EverQuest &quot;
