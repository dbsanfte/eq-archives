<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>Kal brings up a really good point on the News and Rumors page. Why are pk's coming to
Eq? I'm going to guess it's because they're as sick of Osi's problems in Uo as everyone
else. But I also tend to remember that not all pk's are stupid, just most of them. They
have a Pk switch in The Realm where I was playing for awhile. Pk's simply found ways to
trick people into fights. One thing they'd do to newbies is act real nice and get the newb
to join their group. The way it worked in The Realm is if one person in a group had Pk
turned on the whole group could be attacked. So this newbs group would get jumped and
everyone would turn on the newb. I'm hoping Eq puts in some sort of warning that tells you
when you're about to render aid to someone with their pk switch on. If not we could run
into a problem such as: While traveling you come across some fake warrior of good. He says
he's does not have his pk switch on so you give him some healing. Next thing you know your
pk switch is on and his buddies are roughing you up. </p>

<p>Guess we'll just have to be careful when Eq starts out till we figure out what tricks
they've come up with. </p>
