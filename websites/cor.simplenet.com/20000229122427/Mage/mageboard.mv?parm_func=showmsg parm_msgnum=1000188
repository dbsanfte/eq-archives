<BLOCKQUOTE>Posted by
Celarye on 12:34:46 9/20/1999 from 195.249.161.203:<p>
It saddeness me to say this but its been long since i enjoyed playing this game and more so playing a Magician. Im currently lvl33 and i dont even look forward to my new spells at 34.. why ? Because i know what they are, i have allready used them to death. I also know my pets gets worse and worse, i also know that i need to go into dungeons for exp and that my pet is useless there. I have no root. I cant get into group because im no use for them, hell even a druid or cleric can burn more than me. When is the last time anyone said "Hey i need you in my group, we really really need your abilities !"... hmm never... last time i was invited was when i was lvl 9 !! Back then it was easy, i could just solo, it was easy and magicians solo real good til 26 ! I think the problem starts at 29... All other classes get something real good at 29, more like a reward for getting the charecter to a good lvl... I got myself a new fireshield, nothing else !! sure i can summon a sword but none wants it, not even newbies ! All pets but earth are to weak to use ! IMO the 24 earth is very very close to 29 air. <br><br>So like i said its easy to solo to about 26, but then you start to need groups and guess what, at that lvl its more or less to late, most people are at that point either in guilds or close groups. Even when im lucky and find good people, they dont call me or tell me to come, for guess what, they dont need me ( or rather the magicians class/abilities).<br><br>I feel so utter useless, im really heartbroken about this. I have lost all hope and all desire. I have even noticed myself snapping at friends, mostly my enchanter friends, because they tell me this and that about where they went and things they killed... Enchanters get clarity at 29, guess what, everyone want clarity, so he gets into high lvl groups for that spell alone. My 29 wiz friend have no problem either, he can gate now ! Now what was it i could... Uhhh yes, summon a sword and make huge pet trains ! Wow i feel really needed now (<br><br>Please dont give me rants about im a cry baby and wants what others can etc and that i could just shout out for groups etc... because i DONT want clarity or gate or sow or things like that, i want my class to be of use and i want to be the promised master of conjuration ! <br><br>There is a reason why there is not many over 40 thats a magician ! They become totally bored after 24.. our spells are just upgrades, and 4 max spells pr circle IS boring...<br><br>So people tell me to just continue soloing, i say.. where ?<br>Sure i cant swallow my pride and forget theres a real life and waste my time killing aviaks for another 2 lvls but after that ? Will i be able to kill the blue giants at 36 ? hehe i think not ! Goto a dungeon, hmm, how ? I cant use my pet there !<br><br>I need someone 50 to tell me im not wasting my tears on this stupid class, i need someone to confort me and tell me im good people and that i should not be in this situation ! I cant and i stress cant bring myself to raise another charecter, first off i dont have the time for it, i work. Second, i know most places to boredom allready, the only places i dont know is where my mage should start going, but cant !<br><br>I would also like one single valid reason why i dont have any form of root ? And if i hear yet another lvl12 say that my pet is root enough im going to strangle the person. Pets are not roots after 29 ! You will be lucky the mob doesnt start running to you after 2nd blast and thats even with max range and fireshields and burnout ! Also dont throw the pet classes dont get root on me, druids have root, necros have root, enchanters have root, shamans have root... why why why why ??? <br><br>I know im more angry and unhappy today because i have had a eq less weekend ! I cant play on the weekends, theres to many people on and since i cant get into group and the places i can solo (aviaks) are way to crowded i choose not to. Im not going to waste my time playing a game where i have to argue with people over who can get a blue kill every 45mins !! Im starting to hate this game, it has wasted my time, used my time, and nurfed me... Lately with yet another pet nurf, why do these stupid people use their time on nurfing a useless class into utter distinction ? Dont they want costumers ? Im really in a mess...<br><br>So again i have to hear a voice of reason, a fresh breath of air, a kind soul, who can tell me that im not a waste of Norrath air and that i can be used etc...<br><br>If nothing happeness this week, my account will be closed.<br><br>Celarye Faeriekin<br>Sad magician on Bertex.
