<!--NEWS BEGINS HERE-->

The Huge Update is still not ready.  Glancing through the emails, it seems I will soon be able to add around THIRTY new items in 
from the recent patch!<p>

As promised, I have now revealed nearly EVERY item's zone!  Only a handful (10 or less I think) of items have their zones still hidden.  Please forgive 
any mistakes you might find.  I did all of these zones from memory, so I suspect that I may have made an error or two.  I will review all the items again and 
double check that I have made no errors.<p>

The 48-Hour Free Zone is temporarily disabled, because there are now really no free zones to give away =)  I'll see if I can think of something else to do with that area...possibly 
a 48-Hour Mob Identity giveaway, but I'm not sure about that yet.<p>

The only change made to the item lists so far (other than revealing the zones), is the change to the Rubicite Armor listings.  These armors are no longer dropped as loot.<p>

Things coming soon: The massive patch update (30 new items, at least 10 updated items!), a new ZONE SEARCH feature will be added to the search engine, and finally I will put up the new 
humor picture winners with the next update (hopefully won't have to wait 4 days for the next update!).

I'm still alive =)  There have not been many new items discovered lately.  Hopefully 
the temple of solusek ro will add many new items for all the classes (and lets hope they put all the right races on the items hehe).<p>

There are a few new items on the test server; I'll wait till they make the jump to the regular servers before I post them up (in case they are changed).<p>

Received several pictures of Wu's fighting gauntlets.  I have not yet posted them because I'm waiting until I can find someone in-game to show them to me.  The only reason I am 
hesitating on this item (which other sites have already posted), is that gauntlets is spelled incorrectly (as 'guantlets').<p>

Several new <a href='Humor.html'>humor pictures</a> have been added for everyone to enjoy.  I awarded prizes to everyone that sent pictures in recently, so if there are some item locations you want to know, send some 
humor pictures in!<p>

I will soon be making more item locations public (probably within the next 2 updates)<p>

<a href='Humor.html'>Humor Winners:</a> Meanie Trolls, NPC Party, Long lines to Drelzna, Crunchy footsteps, EQ Boarding!

Sorry for the lack of updates over the weekend.  I was unable to log on all weekend (Broadband was finally installed).  I am playing catch-up right now, adding all the new items I've got in emails.  Humor pix will follow, hopefully 
tonight or tomorrow.<p>

The butcherblock hammer is apparently a one-per-server item given out this past weekend.  The names of the various hammers might be slightly 
different (Hammer of Brell, Butcherblock War Maul), but they are all the same item.<p>

Some Plane of Fear updates: the way I understand it, Lustrous Russet Armor is no longer dropped by the Amygdalean warriors.  They instead now drop Indicolite Armor, which is what Lustrous Russet was *supposed* 
to originally be (great armor for warriors). Lustrous Russet is no longer available, but the existing items will remain in game, and have reverted back to their original class restrictions (anyone can wear Lustrous Russet except 
Druids, Monks, and the 4 Pure Casters).<p>
