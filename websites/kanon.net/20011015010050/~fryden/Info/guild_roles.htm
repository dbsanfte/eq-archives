              lawless. Their other duties are largely unaffected; they may also
              hold an office. The Justiciars are responsible for enforcing the
              Hunt. Justiciars are self-appointed: by entering the compact with
              the Priests of Discord. In all other regards, they are the same as

              Inquisitors substantiate charges brought against individuals. To
              be named Inquisitor is a singular honor, because it requires an
              unquestionable integrity. Inquisitors must be able to distinguish
              between the true and the false, between the emotional and the
              factual. When an individual is charged with a crime, the
              Inquisitors are charged with confirming it. To fail to confirm a
              crime is to possibly allow a criminal to go free; but to falsely
              confirm a crime is to destroy the record, the integrity, the honor

              distinction between investigating a member of the public and a
              member of the OoL.&nbsp; Inquisitors also recommend a punishment
              for the crime they have investigated. The Captain may suggest an
              alternate punishment. The punishment is confirmed by a vote of all
              Inquisitors and the Captain (each voter may also cast a &quot;Vote
              for Acquittal&quot;; if acquittals achieve the majority, no
              punishment is confirmed). Once confirmed, any member of the OoL

              punishments, and calls for elections. He or she may call for a
