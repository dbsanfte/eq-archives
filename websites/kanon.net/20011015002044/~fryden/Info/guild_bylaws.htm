                <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Secretary will conduct
                  official elections. Generally, this will involve each member
                  recording his or her vote with the Secretary. This may be by
                  voice, by email, or via web page, at the Secretary's
                  discretion. Votes involving more than nine members may not be
                  conducted by voice.</font>
                <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Elections that result in a tie
                  are discounted, and the election must be held again.</font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A quorum is 1/2 (one-half) of
                  the eligible electorate. Thus, for any election to count, 1
                  out of 2 of the members eligible to vote in that election must
                  record a vote. Each member must be given a reasonable amount
                  of time to register a vote. If, after that time, insufficient
                  members have voted, the Secretary may eliminate non-voting
                  members from the official voting role until a quorum is
                  obtained. Membership in the guild is not affected in any way
                  by this process. However, if a member misses three elections
                  in a row, he or she may be permanently removed from the guild
                  by the Secretary on the grounds of de facto retirement. Such
                  members may re-join the guild in the ordinary fashion.</font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial" size="2">To participate in an election, a
                  member must be inducted and have filled out the web page Join
                  form before the election is actually begun. If a member leaves
                  during an election, their vote will not be counted. Alternate
                  characters cannot vote.</font></li>
              </ol>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Judgment</b><br>
              A judgment is a punishment confirmed by the Captain and
              Inquisitors. The Secretary will see that all current judgments are
              displayed on the Judgment page. Two special kinds of judgments,
              War and the Hunt, are discussed below.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>War</b><br>
              A guild war can only be instituted as the result of a judgment.
              Thus, to wage war, an Inquisitor must investigate a complaint and
              return a recommended punishment of War, which must be confirmed by
              vote of the Captain and and Inquisitors. Once declared, a War may
              only be terminated by the Captain. Any rules of engagement (such
              as excluding certain individuals on either side, limiting the war
              to a particular zone or zones, etc.) are the exclusive domain of
              the Captain, and may be changed at any time.<br>
              A war necessarily involves all members of the OoL. Because of
              this, the Captain will naturally exercise extreme discretion in
              declaring War, and will make every reasonable attempt to exempt
              those members that do not wish to participate.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>The Hunt</b><br>
              The Hunt is a punishment of extreme prejudice. It only applies to
              PvP characters, and thus can only be carried out by the
              Justiciars. Hunting a character means systematically tracking down
              and killing that character until experience loss reduces them to
              fifth level. A Hunt can only be initiated as the result of a
              judgment; once initiated, it may only be disbanded as the result
              of a judgment. It is understood that the Captain and Inquisitors
              will consult the Justiciars before deciding any matter concerning
              a Hunt.</font></p>
