                  they are doing. After all, they are paying just as much as you
                  are to play. Respect means exactly what you think it means:
                  the Golden Rule. If you come across&nbsp; role-players, try to
                  role-play your character a little. If you stumble upon a
                  private group chatting about football games, don't yell at
                  them for being out of character - unless they are shouting
                  across the whole zone. Don't kill newbie monsters just because
                  you are bored. Don't just give away the game's secrets. And so
                  on.</font></li>

                  OoL members above the 10th level are required to go out of
                  their way to help a newbie at least once a week. Helping
                  players who are completely new to the game (as opposed to
                  simply low-level characters) is strongly preferred. The
                  reasoning behind this is not only so that new players can
                  begin having fun sooner, but also to make the OoL stronger.</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The single best method of
                  recruitment is to behave in a way that other players want to
                  behave. By going out of your way to make sure some new player
                  is having fun, you will demonstrate what kind of guild we are,
                  and all of the people who are the kind of people that would go
                  out of their way for a stranger will want to join our guild...
                  and those are exactly the kind of people we want.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Help&quot; doesn't mean
                  dumping money and equipment on them (though that doesn't
                  hurt), it also means talking to them to help them learn some
                  of the basics of the game and how to get around. A sympathetic
                  ear, a few tips, directions to a good beginner's hunting
                  ground, and the kind of basic equipment that all the
                  experienced players get for their low-level characters will
                  make an indelible impression.</font>

                  It would be a mistake to assume that the PvP switch will fix
                  everything. There are still many, many ways an anti-social
                  player can wreak havoc upon other players. It would also be
                  wrong to assume that there is nothing we can do about such a
                  player. Specific tactics will be discussed elsewhere, but the
                  basic strategy is a long-term approach. EverQuest is a
                  communal world, and exclusion from the community is always the
                  ultimate punishment. This applies to players who are PvP as
                  well.&nbsp;</font></li>

                  In the world of Norrath, words are more powerful than they are
                  in other worlds. A member of the OoL must be careful with the
                  words they use. Lying, in particular, is a dangerous and
                  dishonorable act that poisons the very air we all breath. A
                  member of the OoL should never commit any act that he or she
                  would not willingly disclose to any other member of the OoL,
                  or even the public at large.</font></li>

            <td width="62%" height="277">The OoL distinguishes between two kinds

              <p>Anti-social players are the sort of vile creature that should
              be exterminated from Norrath, and the OoL will co-operate with any
              social organization (including evil guilds) to that end.&nbsp; The
              other kind of evil character is better viewed as an unfortunate
              accident of nature. Dark Elves, Trolls, Ogres, Shadow-Knights,
              Necromancers, etc., are the result of karmic imbalance operating
              on helpless individuals.</p>
              <p>Sadly, the best known cure for these afflicted individuals is
              to return them to the Well of Souls and hope that their next
              re-incarnation is not flawed. Other individuals (such as Rogues)
              can often be turned from the path of evil even in this lifetime,
              by combining appropriate rewards and punishments. Strangely, it
              seems that showing kindness and honor to even the worst Dark Elven
              monster increases the chances that its next reincarnation will be
              good. Or perhaps not so strange... the path of Good is hard but
              fruitful. To that end, we wage a war of extermination against
              evil, but an honorable war.</td>
