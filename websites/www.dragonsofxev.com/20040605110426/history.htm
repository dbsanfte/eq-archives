      <P> <I>Dragons of Xev was founded in November of 2000, at the start of
          the Xev server in the North Ro tunnel. The members were all low, and
          had dreams of some day making DoX an all powerful guild. Most of those
          starting members moved on. Many have stayed and still desire to make
          DoX what it was intended to be in the start. </I>
      </p>      <I>Since the beginning days DoX has evolved to a close fun loving family.
          We've had members come and go...all along they remembered their start
          and remained our close friends. DoX has been a starting place for many
          high level players on the Xev server. </I>
      <P> <I>DoX's original leader, Snay, left the guild in December of 2001,
          due to his lack of EQ time. &nbsp;He turned the guild over to Bonecarver,
          one of DoX's founding members. Bonecarver remodeled DoX into a guild
          of variety and fun. DoX was no longer a stepping stone for low and
          midlevel players.<BR>
  It became a family that everyone loves, cherishes, and sticks together with,
  till after many deaths do they part, still even then. they usually hang out
  together.</I>
      <P> <I>In July 2003, Bonecarver passed the reins of the Dragons of Xev
          to Vahpurr. She is gathering together the members of DoX and expanding
          the guild through careful &nbsp;recruitment. If you are interested
    in joining our family, please see the application page for more information.</I> </td>
