  Dragons of Xev is more than just one person, or one group. While we are many
  individuals, by working together we create something which is greater than
  the sum of its parts.
  <P>
  We are looking for people who want to have fun, who are commited to helping
  their family members, who are commited to this guild above personal advancement,
  and who share our goals. &nbsp;There are great people all over Norrath, who
  are good players, who do not fit into our family for one reason or another.
  And, that is fine. That is why there are hundreds of guilds available to
  choose from.
  <P>
  We want to be your home. The bonds we form last through trials and triumphs,
  through dings and deaths, victories and defeats. Friendship and family above
  self. Honor above all.
  <P>
  If we sound like a family you would be proud to join, please fill out a short
  application at:
