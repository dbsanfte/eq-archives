And, that is fine. That is why there are hundreds of guilds available to   choose from.   </p>         <p>   We want to be your home. The bonds we form last through trials and triumphs,  through dings and deaths, victories and defeats. Friendship and familyabove   self. Honor above all.   </p>         <p>   If we sound like a family you would be proud to join, please fill out   a short   application at:   <a href="http://pub39.ezboard.com/fdragonsofxevfrm23" target="new">Dragons  of Xev Message Board</a> we&#8217;d like to get to know you. </p>     </h3>      <br>         </body></html>
