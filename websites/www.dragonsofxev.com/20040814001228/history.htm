Most of those           starting members moved on.Many have stayed and still desire to make           DoX what it was intendedto be in the start. </i></font>       </p>      <font color="#cd7f32"><i>Since the beginning days DoX has evolved toa close fun loving family.           We've had members come and go...allalong they remembered their start           and remained our close friends.DoX has been a starting place for many           high level players on theXev server. </i></font>             <p> <font color="#cd7f32"><i>DoX's original leader, Snay, left theguild in December of 2001,           due to his lack of EQ time. &nbsp;Heturned the guild over to Bonecarver,           one of DoX's founding members.Bonecarver remodeled DoX into a guild           of variety and fun. DoX wasno longer a stepping stone for low and           midlevel players.<br>   It became a family that everyone loves, cherishes, and sticks togetherwith,   till after many deaths do they part, still even then. they usuallyhang out   together.</i></font>       </p>      <p> <font color="#cd7f32"><i>In July 2003, Bonecarver passed the reinsof the Dragons of Xev           to Vahpurr. She is gathering together themembers of DoX and expanding           the guild through careful &nbsp;recruitment.If you are interested     in joining our family, please see the applicationpage for more information.</i></font> </p>      </td>   </tr>   </tbody></table> <p> </p><font color="#cd7f32"><br></font></body></html>
