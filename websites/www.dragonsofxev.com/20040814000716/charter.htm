You must be a FUN loving person,as this is first           and foremost in DoX as we are a guild who lovesto tease and dish it           out. </font>       </p>             <p><font size="4" color="#cd7f32">2.) You must have a sense of humor--meaningyou should            be able to take what your fellow family members serve.They do not           really think that you are the things they accuse youof, they are merely           TEASING. Please be advised: we do not claimto be a PG-13 guild. There           are times when the teasing in guildchat takes on an adult tone. </font></p>                     <p><font size="4" color="#cd7f32">3.) Dragons of Xev is open to charactersof all ages.            Level in itself is no gauge of the player, only atemporary measurement            of a characters power. The only requirementwe put on both new low           level members and low level alts is that: </font></p>                     <p><font size="4" color="#cd7f32">a. You do not ask for free items.VERY frequently items           are given to guild members who are lackingbecause they consider you           to have put forth effort and deservethese items. <br>    b. Please do not EXPECT to be power leveled. You may ask if a personis not   currently grouped or gaining experience for themselves, but at notime is a   member required to drop what they desire to do to help lowerlevel characters   advance. We do however ask that higher level charactersattend low level raids   as escorts to aid in teaching and helping lowerlevels advance in the EQ community. </font></p>                     <p><font size="4" color="#cd7f32">4.) The Golden Rule applies evenin DoX! Do unto to others           as you wish them to do unto you. Thisis quite simple, when a guild           member is in need, it is kind tohelp them out. You NEVER know when           you may be in need of theirservices in the future. Please remember           DoX is a family beforea guild, so if you are available to port, help           on a corpse recoverymission, group, etc. with a member of your family           please do so.But once again, if you really are busy, it is okay to           continuewith your previous activity. Just remember if you are never           availableto help your guild mates, they may never be available to           help you.The more involved and helpful you are in game, the more respected          and liked you tend to be. </font></p>                     <p><font size="4" color="#cd7f32">5.) Dragons of Xev is a guild whosereputation is that           not only are we a bunch of practical joke playingalcoholics, but that           we are a guild of honor. We are not now andnever will be known for           having members who are dishonorable ordisrespectful. When it comes           to material items DoX is to be trusted.</font></p>                     <p><font color="#ff0000" size="4">The following are examples of behavior           that will not be tolerated: </font></p>                     <p><font color="#ff0000" size="4">Misrepresenting an item in a trade box.<br>    Failure to deliver on an item you have been paid for and promised.<br>    Any intentional SCAMS or schemes that intentionally result in gain with out   repayment.<br>    Kill Stealing and/or Camp Stealing ESPECIALLY IN LOWER LEVEL ZONES regardless   of reason <br>    Intentionally training<br>    Begging for items or cash<br>    Lying to guildmembers or other players</font></p>                     <p><font color="#ff0000" size="4">Disruptive behaviour which does not techincally           violate the terms of the charter but is continually detrimental to           the guild as a whole is grounds for dismissal.</font></p>                     <p><font color="#ff0000" size="4">Violation of these behavior guidelines           causes ill representation of the guild. Any violators will beremoved            from the guild IMMEDIATELY - NO QUESTIONS ASKED </font></p>                     <p><font size="4" color="#cd7f32">Members are never expected to turntheir backs on the           rules of supply and demand. It is your choiceas to how much you market           your items for and is not the businessof any other members. </font></p>                     <p><font size="4" color="#cd7f32">6.) We insist that you take pridein being a member of           the family you chose to be in. Members arenot permitted to be anonymous.           When you are your Dragons of Xevbanner is not showing and you are           turning your back on your family.This is offensive to many members.           If you desire to not show yourclass and level then you may /roleplay           -- your guild tag stillshows and no one will know those things about           you. </font></p>                     <p><font size="4" color="#cd7f32">7.) Raids: </font></p>                     <p><font size="4" color="#cd7f32">Dragons of Xev is not primarily araiding guild. We are           a family, socially oriented guild, who raidsonce a week. Other events           are planned occasionally, with no particularfrequency. If you are           online during an event, we'd really liketo see you. HOWEVER: Raids           are NEVER required. We are here to haveFUN. If something comes up,           of if you don't have time for a LONNNNNGGevent ... just let your family           know. </font></p>                     <p><font size="4" color="#cd7f32"><br>    A. We understand when RL calls and you are late or can not attend anevent.        If you need to show up late, please have your own way of gettingto the       place we are camping or position we are located. More timesthan not unnecessary       deaths occur when the groups get separated dueto falling behind or turning       around to retrieve lost members. </font></p>                     <p><font size="4" color="#cd7f32">B. Loot is distributed on a NEEDBEFORE GREED basis,            this means all members who NEED an item mayroll for the dropped loot.           This does not mean if you NEEDS to SELLsuch drop you may roll for           it, this is considered greed. Pleaserespect your fellow family members           who could actually put theseitems to use. If no one needs the item           then it may be rolled forby all who desire it and they may do with           it what they desire.Some items may be collected to go in the guild           bank for futureprizes in later events for members who may not have           been presentduring that drop. </font></p>                     <p><font size="4" color="#cd7f32">C. Please have reviewed a map ofthe zones we will be           raiding and be somewhat aware of where weare going as well as what           kind of mobs are in the zone. This willhelp you in knowing your role           in the raid. </font></p>                     <p><font size="4" color="#cd7f32">D. Keep in mind that death happensand even though on           numerous raids we have higher level escortsdoes not mean that they           can keep you from dying in all instances.So, keep your sense of humor           and please remember that this is aGAME. If you die, you pick up and           start over... and remember tohumbly bow and thank the cleric or pally           who granted you new life!</font></p>                     <p><font size="4" color="#cd7f32">E. Be aware of instructions fromraid coordinator and           make sure you are in the chat set up for theparticular event. Your           raid leader for the night is GOD. If youhave suggestions please wait           until the event is finished to offerthem. During the raid is no time           to switch tactics.</font></p>                     <p><font size="4" color="#cd7f32">If you are not on the event pleaserefrain from asking            questions or talking on the set channel. Itwas established for the           purpose of granting clear and businessrelated information on the event           All news on event will be madeavailable after the event or on the           website. </font></p>                     <p><font size="4" color="#cd7f32">F. If possible sign up for the raidsprevious to the           event so that we know if we will have enough inattendance. This is           vital in the success of the events. You canhowever still attend even           if you did not sign up. We understandthat sometimes advance plans           are hard to make. </font></p>                     <p><font size="4" color="#cd7f32">G. Guild officers are requested toattend all official            guild-sponsored raids unless real life issuesinterfere which must            take precedence. If you will be unable toattend a scheduled guild            function, please let your fellow guildofficers and leaders know by           email, post to the officers group,or some other outside of game communication. </font></p>                     <p><font size="4" color="#cd7f32"><br>    8.)

Being an officer of the Dragonsof Xev is not a "social           rank", it is a rank that is earned throughservice to the Dragons           as a Guild and its individual members. <br>    2. Promotion to officer status is earned based on the recommendationof guild   officers and members. <br>    3. The promotion of a member to officer status is accomplished through majority   vote of the actively serving officers. <br>    4. Individual promotions may be vetoed by the Guild Leader. <br>    5. All discussion and vote on member promotions to officer status are confidential   and will not be discussed with the members of the guild. <br>    6. If you as a guild member think someone, through their actions andservice,    deserves to be promoted to officer status, then recommend themto a guild officer   or the guild leader. Recommendations may be through/tell or via email. Public   recommendations violate the confidentialityof officer selection and will not   be accepted. </font></p>                     <p align="center"><font size="4" color="#cd7f32"><br>              <font size="6">Officer Requirements </font></font></p>                     <p><font size="4" color="#cd7f32">As officers we are responsible forsetting the example            for our guild members. Officers are held toa higher standard of conduct           than the average member. Officersare solely responsible for presentation           and appearance of the guildand what it stands for. In many cases,           minor misconduct from membersis overlooked by others . However, misconduct           by an officer defacesthe guild reputation and will not be tolerated.           In addition, asofficers, no matter what someone does whether in guild           or not,we never bad mouth anyone, even if they deserve it. Guild officers          are expected to keep a cool head during disagreements, including being          willing to apologize first to any who feel they've been wrong byan           Officer or member of Dragons.

Officers are requested to share a minimal amountof outside-of-game            time in communication, research, and leadershipduties to better assist           their guildmates. To hold the title ofofficer is to serve the guild,           not for the guild to serve you.      </font></p>                     <p align="center"><font size="4" color="#cd7f32"><br>              <font size="6">Officer Duties </font></font></p>                     <p><font size="4" color="#cd7f32">An officer's duties include the following:      </font></p>                     <p><font size="4"><font color="#cd7f32">* Conflict mediation betweenguild members, or between            Dragons and members of other guilds.      <br>    * Assisting guild members in donating or borrowing items or spells from the   guild bank. <br>    * Taking extra initiative to encourage guild groups <br>    * Additional leadership duties as agreed upon by the leadership team      </font><br>      </font></p>       </td>    </tr>       </tbody> </table>   <h1 align="center"><font size="4">  </font></h1>  <br> </body></html>
