<p><i>Dragons of Xev was founded in November of 2000, at the start of the Xev 
  server in the North Ro tunnel. The members were all low, and had dreams of some 
  day making DoX an all powerful guild. Most of those starting members moved on. 
  Many have stayed and still desire to make DoX what it was intended to be in 
  the start. </i></p>
<p><i>Since the beginning days DoX has evolved to a close fun loving family. We've 
  had members come and go...all along they remembered their start and remained 
  our close friends. DoX has been a starting place for many high level players 
  on the Xev server. </i></p>
<p><i>DoX's original leader, Snay, left the guild in December of 2001, due to 
  his lack of EQ time turning the guild over to Bonecarver, one of DoX's founding 
  members. Bonecarver has since remodeled DoX into a guild of variety and fun. 
  DoX is no longer a stepping stone for low and midlevel players...but a family 
  that everyone loves, cherishes, and sticks together...till after many deaths 
  do they part...and even then...they usually hang out. </i></p>
<p><i><br>
  Dragon's of Xev Membership Requirements:</i></p>
<p><i>1.) You must be a FUN loving person...this is first and foremost in DoX 
  as we are a guild who loves to tease and dish it out.</i></p>
<p><i>2.) You must have a sense of humor...meaning you should be able to take 
  what your fellow family members serve. They do not really think that you are 
  the things they accuse you of...they are merely TEASING.</i></p>
<p><i>3.) Dragons of Xev is open to characters of all ages...the only requirement 
  we put on both new low level members and low level alts is that a.) you do not 
  ask for free items...VERY frequently items are given to guild members who are 
  lacking because they consider you to have put forth effort and deserve these 
  items...and b.) please do not EXPECT to be power leveled...you may ask if person 
  is not currently grouped or gaining experience for themselves but at no time 
  is a member required to drop what they desire to do to help lower level characters 
  advance...we do however ask that higher level characters attend low level raids 
  as escorts to aid in teaching and helping lower levels advance in the EQ community.</i></p>
<p><i>4.) The Golden Rule applies even in DoX do unto to others as you wish them 
  to do unto you...this is quite simple...when a guild member is in need, it is 
  kind to help them out...you NEVER know when you may be in need of their services 
  in the future. And please remember DoX is a family before a guild...so if you 
  are available to port, help on a corpse recovery mission, group, etc. with a 
  member of your family please do so...but once again... if you really are busy...it 
  is okay to continue with your previous activity. Just remember if you are never 
  available to help your guildmates...they may never be available to help you. 
  The more involved and helpful you are in game, the more respected and liked 
  you tend to be.</i></p>
<p><i>5.) Dragons of Xev is a guild that's reputation is not only that we are 
  a bunch of practical joke playing alcoholics...but that we are a guild of honor, 
  we are not now and never will be known for having members who are conartists 
  or scammers. When it comes to material items DoX is to be trusted, if you are 
  misrepresenting an item in a trade box, or you fail to deliver on an item you 
  have been paid for and promised, these are examples of scamming and it will 
  NOT be tolerated...but never are we expected to turn our backs on the rules 
  of supply and demand...it is your choice as to how much you market your items 
  for...and is not the business of any other members.</i></p>
<p><i>6.) We insist that you take pride in being a member of the family you chose 
  to be in...members are not permitted to be anonymous...when you are your Dragons 
  of Xev banner is not showing and you are turning your back on your family...this 
  is offensive to many members. If you desire to not show your class and level...then 
  you may /roleplay and your guild tag still shows and no one will know those 
  things about you.</i></p>
<p><i>7.) <b>Raids</b>:<br>
  </i></p>
<p><i>A.) We understand when RL calls and you are late or can not attend an event...but 
  if intend to show up late...please have your own way of getting to the place 
  we are camping or position we are located. More times than not unnecessary deaths 
  occur when the groups get separated due to falling behind or turning around 
  to retrieve lost members.<br>
  B.) Loot is distributed on a NEED BEFORE GREED basis...this means all members 
  who NEED item may roll on dropped loot...this does not mean if you NEEDS to 
  SELL such drop you may roll for it...this is considered greed...please respect 
  your fellow family members who could actually put these items to use. If no 
  one needs the item then it may be rolled for by all who desire it...and they 
  may do with it what they desire...some items may be collected to go on the guild 
  mule for future prizes in later events for members who may not have been present 
  during that drop.<br>
  C.) Please have reviewed a map of the zones we will be raiding...be somewhat 
  aware of where we are going and what kind of mobs are in the zone...this will 
  help you in knowing your role in the raid.<br>
  D.) Keep in mind that death happens...and even though on numerous raids we have 
  higher level escorts does not mean that they can keep you from dying in all 
  instances. <br>
  E.) Be aware of instructions from raid coordinator...make sure you are in the 
  chat set up for the particular event...if you are not on the event please refrain 
  from asking questions or talking on the set channel...it was established for 
  the purpose of granting clear and business related information on the event...all 
  news on event will be made available after the event or on the website.<br>
  F.) If possible sign up for the raids previous to the event so that we know 
  if we will enough to be in attendance. This is vital in the success of the events. 
  You can however still attend even if you did not sign up...we understand that 
  sometimes advance plans are hard to make.</i></p>
<p><i>8.) See #1...ONCE AGAIN HAVE FUN!!!!!! <br>
