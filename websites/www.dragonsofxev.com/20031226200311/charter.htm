  Membership Requirements:
</H2>
<P>
1.) You must be a FUN loving person, as this is first and foremost in DoX
as we are a guild who loves to tease and dish it out.
<P>
2.) You must have a sense of humor. Meaning you should be able to take what
your fellow family members serve. They do not really think that you are the
things they accuse you of, they are merely TEASING. Please be advised: we
do not claim to be a PG-13 guild. There are times when the teasing in guild
chat takes on an adult tone.
<P>
3.) Dragons of Xev is open to characters of all ages. Level in itself is
no gauge of the player, only a temporary measurement of a characters power.
The only requirement we put on both new low level members and low level alts
is that :
<OL Type="a">
  <LI>
    You do not ask for free items. VERY frequently items are given to guild members
    who are lacking because they consider you to have put forth effort and deserve
    these items.
  <LI>
    Please do not EXPECT to be power leveled. You may ask if a person is not
    currently grouped or gaining experience for themselves, but at no time is
    a member required to drop what they desire to do to help lower level characters
    advance. We do however ask that higher level characters attend low level
    raids as escorts to aid in teaching and helping lower levels advance in the
    EQ community.
</OL>
<P>
4.) The Golden Rule applies even in DoX! Do unto to others as you wish them
to do unto you. This is quite simple, when a guild member is in need, it
is kind to help them out. You NEVER know when you may be in need of their
services in the future. Please remember DoX is a family before a guild, so
if you are available to port, help on a corpse recovery mission, group, etc.
with a member of your family please do so. But once again, if you really
are busy, it is okay to continue with your previous activity. Just remember
if you are never available to help your guild mates, they may never be available
to help you. The more involved and helpful you are in game, the more respected
and liked you tend to be.
<P>
5.) Dragons of Xev is a guild that's reputation is not only that we are a
bunch of practical joke playing alcoholics, but that we are a guild of honor.
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><STRONG>We are not now and never will be known for
having members who are dishonorable or disrespectful</STRONG></FONT>. When
it comes to material items DoX is to be trusted.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>The following are examples of behavior that will
not be tolerated:</B></FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>Misrepresenting an item in a trade box.<BR>
  Failure to deliver on an item you have been paid for and promised.<BR>
  Any intentional SCAMS or schemes that intentionally result in gain with out
  repayment.<BR>
  Kill Stealing and/or Camp Stealing ESPECIALLY IN LOWER LEVEL ZONES regardless
  of reason</B></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Violation of these behavior guidelines causes ill
representation of the guild. Any violators will be removed from the guild
<STRONG>IMMEDIATELY - NO QUESTIONS ASKED</STRONG></FONT>
<P>
Members are never expected to turn &nbsp;their backs on the rules of supply
and demand. It is your choice as to how much you market your items for and
is not the business of any other members.
<P>
6.) We insist that you take pride in being a member of the family you chose
to be in. Members are not permitted to be anonymous. When you are your Dragons
of Xev banner is not showing and you are turning your back on your family.
This is offensive to many members. If you desire to not show your class and
level then you may /roleplay and your guild tag still shows and no one will
know those things about you.
<P>
7.) <B>Raids</B>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <OL Type="A">
    <LI>
      We understand when RL calls and you are late or can not attend an event.
      If you need to show up late, please have your own way of getting to the place
      we are camping or position we are located. More times than not unnecessary
      deaths occur when the groups get separated due to falling behind or turning
      around to retrieve lost members.
    <LI>
      Loot is distributed on a NEED BEFORE GREED basis, this means all members
      who NEED an item may roll for the dropped loot. This does not mean if you
      NEEDS to SELL such drop you may roll for it, this is considered greed. Please
      respect your fellow family members who could actually put these items to
      use. If no one needs the item then it may be rolled for by all who desire
      it and they may do with it what they desire. Some items may be collected
      to go in the guild bank for future prizes in later events for members who
      may not have been present during that drop.
    <LI>
      Please have reviewed a map of the zones we will be raiding and be somewhat
      aware of where we are going as well as what kind of mobs are in the zone.
      This will help you in knowing your role in the raid.
    <LI>
      Keep in mind that death happens and even though on numerous raids we have
      higher level escorts does not mean that they can keep you from dying in all
      instances.
    <LI>
      Be aware of instructions from raid coordinator and make sure you are in the
      chat set up for the particular event. If you are not on the event please
      refrain from asking questions or talking on the set channel. It was established
      for the purpose of granting clear and business related information on the
      event All news on event will be made available after the event or on the
      website.
    <LI>
      If possible sign up for the raids previous to the event so that we know if
      we will enough to be in attendance. This is vital in the success of the events.
      You can however still attend even if you did not sign up. We understand that
      sometimes advance plans are hard to make.
    <LI>
      <FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Guild officers are requested to attend all official
      guild-sponsored raids unless real life issues interfere which must take
      precedence. If you will be unable to attend a scheduled guild function, please
      let your fellow guild officers and leaders know by email, post to the officers
      group, or some other outside of game communication.</FONT>

  Officer Selection
</H2>
<OL>
  <LI>
    Being an officer of the Dragons of Xev is not a "social rank", it is a rank
    that is earned through service to the Dragons as a Guild and its individual
    members.
  <LI>
    Promotion to officer status is earned based on the recommendation of guild
    officers and members.
  <LI>
    The promotion of a member to officer status is accomplished through majority
    vote of the actively serving officers.
  <LI>
    Individual promotions may be vetoed by the Guild Leader.
  <LI>
    All discussion and vote on member promotions to officer status are confidential
    and will not be discussed with the members of the guild.
  <LI>
    If you as a guild member think someone, through their actions and service,
    deserves to be promoted to officer status, then recommend them to a guild
    officer or the guild leader. Recommendations may be through /tell or via
    email. Public recommendations violate the confidentiality of officer selection
    and will not be accepted.

  Officer Requirements
</H2>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">As officers we are responsible for setting the example
for our guild members. Officers are held to a higher standard of conduct
than the average member. Officers are solely responsible for presentation
and appearance of the guild and what it stands for. In many cases,minor
misconduct from members is overlooked by others . However, misconduct by
an officer defaces the guild reputation and will not be tolerated. In addition,
as officers, no matter what someone does whether in guild or not, we never
bad mouth anyone, even if they deserve it. Guild officers are expected to
keep a cool head during disagreements, including being willing to apologize
first to any who feel they've been wrong by an Officer or member of Dragons.
(the APPEARANCE of a slight is everything in this electronic world we live
in.)</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Officers are a select number of individuals committed
to the well-being of the guild above personal character advancement. Officers
are requested to share a minimal amount of outside-of-game time in communication,
research, and leadership duties to better assist their guildmates. To hold
the title of officer is to serve the guild, not for the guild to serve
you.</FONT>
