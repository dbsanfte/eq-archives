<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You acted in accordance with the
laws of the land, and the laws of your conscience. We now find you guilty of the
needless slaughter of many fine Player killers. That you sought no bounty, but
did it for the shear joy of inflicting pain on those just doing what they had a
right to do is reprehensible. You are hereby banished to the tranquil land of
Norrath for time and all eternity. There you will never be allowed to kill
another player in cold blood as you have so freely done here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;All I did was serve justice to those who made a
conscious choice to prey on the weak and the innocent. Yes I would not wait to
catch them in the act. If I new they needed to be killed they were killed fast
and hard where ever they were found, and there belongings distributed among the
poor and the young.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Silence the witch! You will hunt us no more.&quot; With
a great burst of force the killers and cheaters had won. Her name was removed
from the pages of history and her body flung into a dimension she had never seen
before. But their minds held her memory, some in joy and some in fear. Had they
truly won?.....<br>
<br>
.....Months of study in the halls of Felwithe taught the woman much. There were
many new schools of magic to learn. She realized that she must devote herself to
one as she always sought to master that which she did.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You would do well to remember the hunting tricks you
learned so long ago. Though players are not the targets, many of the things we
taught you apply here as well.&quot; She turned to the familiar voice.
&lt;hugs&gt; &quot;Darkeagle you too have come! So good to see you here.&quot;
After a long reunion with an old friend, guild mate and hunting partner, she saw
that he too had held to the high code of honor that drove them to ultimately
leave their homes and friends.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Aye m'lady, I am here. I miss the owning of property
but not the endless killing. There is so much more to do here, so much more to
see. Follow me, let me show you around a bit while we chat.&quot;<br>
<br>
