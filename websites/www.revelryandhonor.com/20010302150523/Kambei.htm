        <p><b>I can remember it clearly...the raindrops that fell were as big as
        lightstones, and the dark was blacker than Dvinn's heart. I was a wandering Ronin, a Paladin who had failed to protect her leader in
        battle. I made my way to South Karana to hunt Aviaks, and perhaps get
        some good plat along the way.</b>

        <p><b>Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a sharp looking Wizard, who
        I later learned was Alcuin Wizziefingers. Despite his best attempts to
        blast me, I wouldn't go away, and I even buffed him. Of course, he was
        stunned by my cool demeanor and High Elf features, and we are like a
        pair of worn Journeyman's boots to this day.</b></p>

        <p><b>I also remember the day I met our co-leader, Troval Nobleknight. I
        was sitting on the tin roof of the SteamFront Caves, slowly healing
        myself, when I heard a voice ask if I needed assistance. I knew
        immediately that he was a fellow Paladin, and when I saw that he was a
        High Elf, it was the beginning of a beautiful friendship. We killed
        dozens of Minotaurs, hundreds of Crocs, and thousands of Orc Chiefs, and
        countless Aviaks. One day, we decided to form a guild, so that we could
        share our great adventures with other denizens of Norrath. Revelry and
        Honor was born soon after.</b></p>
        <p><b>I am a High Elf, and because of that I tend to have a strong sense
        of justice. But I also have an innate desire to help others, and when
        I'm not baking or fletching, I try to lend a hand to those who follow in
        my humble footsteps. Hail me any time you need help, or would like a
        tasty meal. I am a Paladin at heart, and my guild is my pride!</b></p>
        <p><b>Hail Revelry and Honor!</b>
