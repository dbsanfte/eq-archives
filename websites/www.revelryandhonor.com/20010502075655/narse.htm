&nbsp;&nbsp; <b> My wounds burned, as the chains tore deeper into my flesh. My
thirst for vengeance swelled with every passing moment in the decrepit hole.
They taunt me with their pets pacing by my cell, and deprive me the strength of
my art. It took all my resources to call forth food, water, and bandages, to
maintain this humiliating existence. I vowed to claim my Right of Revenge, and
had to survive to see it through.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could hear the guards running around, another lost victim
no doubt. To my amazement, I saw a lone cleric, narrowly avoiding the guards. He
unknowingly added to my humiliation, as I had been reduced to depending on him
for my freedom.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being trusting &amp; generous, a character flaw that forever
makes most clerics weak, he gave me the regent I desperately needed. Hate for
Najena fueled my will, and I called forth the Stone to start my revenge.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though the cleric is beneath the understanding of Teir'Dal
honor, I am honor bound for now, to serve him for releasing me. I will exact my
revenge on Najena, and one day defeat the cleric, to prove that I have overcome,
and reclaim my honor!<br>
