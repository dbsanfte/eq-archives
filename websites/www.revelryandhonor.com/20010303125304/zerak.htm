  <b><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#808080"> I was born walking on both feet, perhaps quite
  a feet for the lesser races, you know, the ones strewn about hugging grass&nbsp;blades
  everywhere you travel.&nbsp; I decided to try these feet out.&nbsp; It took
  some time to realize that looking over balcony walls was forever going to be
  some trouble.&nbsp; But as you all know, we stubborn Dwarves, especially with
  out intelligence attributes, will keep trying.&nbsp; I never did find mom and
  pop...must have been dropped off in the hands of the Paladin class due to my
  extraordinary wisdom and physical abilities.&nbsp; I gather it was pop who
  instructed me with his note to talk with the General, and thus I did.&nbsp;
  Being alive 5 hours I became hungry and lost in Kaladim.&nbsp; Fortunately I
  learned to kill for food, and later for better equipment.&nbsp; Alas, I have
  been given various duties to clear out smaller evils just to have the
  permission to excel at doing bigger and better.&nbsp; Before long I traveled
  far and wide with the advice of various Paladin Masters, learning new skills
  and places along the way.</font></font></b>

  <b><font size="3" color="#808080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time I venture back to Mistmoore
  Castle in search of my level 5 Paladin body, but with regret it never turns
  up.&nbsp; As you know, we Dwarves will keep looking.&nbsp; Soon I realized
  that I had a keen ability to take some serious damage that would cause several
  of the lesser races to collapse to their deaths...look around you.</font></b>

  <b><font size="3" color="#808080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It became my second nature to kill, but did not
  offer much of a social life.&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided that joining various groups
  and factions was much more pleasant, not that a dwarf need the help of course.&nbsp;
  Soon I received an invitation along with a simple quest to join a guild (from
  a ranger of all things, go figure).&nbsp; Saving the life of a near death
  friend was common practice, and thus I was accepted.&nbsp; I found myself a
  member of a larger effort to rid the lands of Norrath of evil, not that the
  Paladin Master didn't already have enough for me to do.</font></b>

  <b><font size="3" color="#808080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I became more aware of the evils present in
  Norrath I was fortunate to have the master make it easier for me to assist
  them.&nbsp; Of course this meant more bodies of the lesser evil races strewn
  all over.&nbsp; I had no problem with it though.&nbsp; I have come across many
  friends doing the same so we go at it together...simply for the conversation
  you know.&nbsp; I continue to seek others willing to follow the same path.&nbsp;
  The more the merrier.&nbsp; Brell Serilis only know what is in store for me
  next.&nbsp; But I have the faith of a paladin that the master will continue to
  ease those burdens with new skills, not that mom and pop would ever.</font></b>
