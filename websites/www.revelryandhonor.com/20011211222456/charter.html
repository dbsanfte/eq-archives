As members of Revelry and Honor, we strive to embody the values that we carry in our guild tag. We will endeavor to succeed in all of the challenges put before us, but what we value most of all is a shared sense of community and a dedication to each other.
<br><br>

<font size="4" color="lightyellow"><b>Revelry</b></font>
<br><br>

Revelry and Honor was first created over a year and a half ago, with the purpose of establishing a guild for those who preferred a casual, friendly atmosphere in Norrath. Our members are as varied as the mobs of Norrath – we are of different ages, from all over the world, and range from the casual gamer to the more advanced player. However, every member shares in the power to shape the direction of the guild.
<br><br>

Members are encouraged to participate in guild decisions through board discussions and guild chat. This can include approval of new guild policies, support of a new candidate, or participating in Bobnob’s weekly poll.
<br><br>

Revelry and Honor members are usually spotted in clumps, rather than alone. Members usually find it easy to seek out others for a group, and if there is an R & H member in a pick up group nearby, don’t be surprised if you get an offer to join fairly quickly.
<br><br>

While Revelry and Honor is active in setting up raids, and clearing Norrath of evil, we also enjoy the lighter side of life in Norrath. This can include:
<ul>
 <li> Server wide festivals</li>
 <li> Guild driven quests</li>
 <li> Mentoring someone in a trade skill</li>
 <li> Language Fairs</li>
 <li> First Aid Stations (Buffs, SOW’s, binds, and ports)</li>
 <li> Guild wars and drinking contests</li>
</ul>


<font size="4" color="lightyellow"><b>Honor</b></font>
<br><br>

Carrying the Revelry and Honor guild tag is no easy task. Members are expected to use good judgement and show a sense of integrity at all times. Bad conduct not only gives the members a bad reputation, but it undermines the very name that each of us carries above our heads.
<br><br>

Members are expected to practice rules of fair hunting, which include no kill stealing and no training on others. Members should make every effort to talk with another hunting party and diffuse any potential conflicts before they escalate. If discussion fails, seek out the aid of an officer. Do not inflame the conflict by acting in a dishonorable and aggressive manner.
<br><br>

Members are prohibited from begging, either from other members of the guild or from the population of Norrath in general. Everyone needs help from time to time, and usually members will not hesitate to lend a hand. But no one should harass or spam the guild or any individual for items, rezzes, ports, etc. There is a delicate balance between asking for assistance and becoming overly reliant on guildmates – spending time offering your abilities to others usually reaps great rewards later.
<br><br>

It is a courtesy to auction useful items within the guild first, and to the general population second. Members are expected to sell items at fair market value, both to members and to the population of Norrath. There is also a guild bank, currently managed by Orko and Marthisdil. Members may make a donation or inquire about purchasing an item. Items for purchase are usually offered at a lower price than the current market rate. Again, Karma has a funny way about rewarding those who contribute to the guild, and your generous offer of a hand me down to a member may be rewarded by another's offer towards you in the future.
<br><br>

Members are discouraged from using the /anon command. If you need to conceal your level because of tells for your services, use /role instead.
<br><br>

Members should always use proper etiquette while attending raids, whether it is a guild raid or one hosted by another guild. These are a few guidelines:

<ul>
 <li> Sign up in advance.</li>
 <li>Most raids have a specified duration (at least our guild raids will). If they don't, ask before signing up. If you cannot stay for the whole event, please               consider not signing up, or at least let the raid leader know in your signup post that you will have to leave.</li>
 <li> Don’t pester the raid leader or the puller with tells.</li>
 <li> Offer to help when you can.</li>
 <li> Follow the raid leaders orders.</li>
 <li> Don’t whine about loot.</li>
 <li> Don’t whine if you die.</li>
 <li> Don’t whine about lack of experience if it’s not a raid for that purpose (i.e. planes, target mobs).</li>
 <li> Thank the raid leader at the end.</li>
</ul>

These are ideas borrowed from a great guide to raid etiquette by Nethos of Phoenix Elite. For the complete guide, please consult the guild library.
<br><br>

Any guild decisions or changes will proceed in an organized fashion. It is essential that everyone be notified of proposals and changes before it is announced to the general population of Norrath. Bearing that in mind, there may be times where a quick decision is needed. The best way to stay involved is to check the boards regularly and post your views.
<br><br>

If a member does not observe the guidelines above, the following options may result, and not necessarily in this order

<ul>
 <li> Warning from an officer or guild leader</li>
 <li> Repayment towards a person or party who lost an item due to bad conduct</li>
 <li> A probationary period</li>
 <li> Removal</li>
</ul>
