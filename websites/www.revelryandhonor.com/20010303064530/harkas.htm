<p align="left">&nbsp; <b> The air was thick with evil, my senses overcome by the
stench of the rotting dungeon. Out of the darkness, through the cold bars, a
dark hand reached for me. As I pulled away, I heard a subtle plea:</b></p>
<p align="left"><b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Malachite please, that's all I need&quot;</b></p>
<p align="left"><b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I approached the cell to find a tortured soul, a single
Teir'Dal collapsed near the cell door. Regardless of one's trespasses, no one
deserves an end such as this. I handed him a pale green stone I had scavenged
off an elemental moments before. He started to work his summoning arts, as I
fumbled with the keys.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking into the cell, still unsure if this was an ambush, I
noticed an opening in the ceiling.&nbsp; Just then, a huge beast lunged forth
&amp; effortlessly ripped apart the bars. The Teir'Dal thanked me heartily as he
ran out, promising on his honor to repay me. I turned to leave the hellacious
place and saw, scrawled on the wall, &quot;Bearron was here&quot;. I laughed as
I ran, remembering when Alcuin &amp; I found the paladin in the very same cell.<br>
