        <h4><font color="#996600">A Day in the Life of Alcuin Wizziefingers</font></h4>
        <p><b><font color="#808080">The young Wizard raised his hands in the air and quietly muttered
        the words of power, &quot;Madavenpad, Lenavenpad, Astelethon!&quot; A
        crackle of energy began to form in his hands, and blue wisps flowed
        angrily up and down his arms. Alcuin grinned to himself and turned
        towards the leering Mummy. He threw his arms forward, sending the storm
        of energy hurtling towards the Mummy. Mid-flight, the blue wisps faded
        and died, leaving nothing in their wake except a quiet, fizzling sound.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font color="#808080">&quot;Another Fizzle!&quot; Alcuin shouted, &quot;DAMMIT!&quot;</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font color="#808080">&quot;I'll take care of it, Alcuin. Just meditate for a bit&quot;
        said Kambei as she slashed the mummy with her long sword. &quot;Try to
        relax&quot;, she added under her breath.</font></b>
        <p><b><font color="#808080">&quot;Yes, we have it, young one&quot;, said the
        grizzled old Paladin, Troval Nobleknight. &quot;Just keep back.&quot;</font></b></td>

      <td colspan="2">
        <p><b><font color="#808080">&quot;The hell with that!&quot; said Alcuin. He threw his spell
        book on the ground, pulled his dagger from his belt and waded into
        battle. The Mummy, sensing a vulnerable opponent, immediately turned its
        attention to the unprotected Wizard. It grasped Alcuin by the throat
        with one hand and slashed him right down the middle with its rusty short
        sword. Alcuin yelped in pain--two inches to the left and the would would
        have been fatal. Alcuin flailed away ineffectually with his small
        dagger.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font color="#808080">Kambei struggled to get in a good swing with her sword, but with
        Alcuin between her and the mummy, she wasn't able to get into position
        to fight. Troval glanced at Kambei and said with his eyes, &quot;Did we
        have to bring him, again?&quot;</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font color="#808080">The Mummy attacked Alcuin again, this time with a deadly
        disease-touch. Alcuin's face went a deathly pale and the strength
        dropped out of his arms. The Mummy dropped him to the ground in a heap,
        and turned its attention back to Kambei.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font color="#808080">&quot;Heal me, please!&quot; moaned Alcuin from the ground.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font color="#808080">Reluctantly, Troval sheathed his sword and pulled out his spell
        book, leaving Kambei to dispatch the Mummy on her own. A few words of
        healing, and Alcuin was cured of the Mummy's disease and his wound was
        remarkably healed.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font color="#808080">Kambei dispatched the Mummy with no further incident. Alcuin got
        up, brushed himself off, and did his best to look stoic. &quot;That went
        well. Good job, guys!&quot; He immediately began rummaging through the
        Mummy's corpse. &quot;Oooh, a jade&quot; he said, dropping the green
        stone in his pocket. &quot;Did either of you need this sword?&quot; he
        asked, indicating the rusty short sword lying next to the Mummy.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font color="#808080">Troval turned to Kambei, &quot;Could you talk to him?&quot;</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font color="#808080">Kambei sighed, &quot;I've tried. Tunare knows I've tried.&quot;</font></b></p>
