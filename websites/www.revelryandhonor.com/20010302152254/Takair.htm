<p><b>The large pillar to my back, I sat, Goneker at my side. I could feel my
energy returning, as the stench of the horrid beasts surrounded me. Though my
mind was rejuvenated, my body still lacked vigor.</b></p>
<p><b>Yet another deepwater Crocodile crawls by, taunting me with memories of his
sharp embrace. Not this time! Just then, down the beach, ran a naked Wood Elf, a
scaly monster not far behind. I summoned the essence out of the vile creature,
filling my limbs with life. Goneker laughed wickedly, as he taunted the vile
creature.</b></p>
<p><b>Oddly enough, upon the croc, I found a torn parchment, alas, all that remains
of his last victim, no doubt. The young Druid made use of the parchment and
thanked me heartily.</b></p>
<p><b>Over the next few days, my path crossed with his many times. He judged me not
by my race, but by my actions. With our new found friendship, he introduced me
to this new allegiance.</b></p>
