<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Franticly reading from the tattered
journal, the young bard realizes that this is the gate her mother wrote about. A
portal to a new land where murder is not a way of life for so many. The guards
are closing on her, she can hear their footsteps in the dried grass. &quot;Damn
this corrupt place. They killed mother but I shall escape and carry her legacy
to more deserving people.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she approaches the ominous black
gate a wizened old man steps from the shadows and begins to cant a familiar
spell. Flames leap from the heavens and the guards are no more a threat.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning to her he says &quot;You must hurry, as I am no match
for the army that is coming to close these escape routes. Know this young one,
you will not be alone. Many have departed Brittania never to return. Hold true
to the virtues that have guided you here, They will serve you where ever you
are. Go now young Bard of Humility, and find the peace that never existed here.&quot;&nbsp;
Two arrows pierce the old mans chest and he falls lifeless at Lavilla's feet.
Without turning to see who or how many she finalizes the commitment she had made
so many months ago. Stepping into the gate she leaves her beloved home forever.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She awakens on a large wooden platform. Muttering to herself,&nbsp;
&quot;This is odd,&quot;&nbsp; she notices how high off the ground she is.
&quot;Ahh there is music coming from that hut. Mayhaps I can learn from them
something of this new place.&quot; She closes the door behind her and blocks out
all further interruptions as if absorbed in the tranquility of a great forest.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Songs of history and great adventure fill the air for hours.
Mesmerized she drifts off once again&nbsp; to sleep, perchance to dream....<br>
<br>
So as one chapter ends a new one begins in the life of a young girl named for
ones nightmares.<br>
