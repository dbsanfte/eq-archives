&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#808080"> <b>I lack the discipline for all the ceremonies and duties of
the church; but my faith is just as strong. I serve Mithaniel Marr, not with the
healing skills of the cleric, nor the bloodlust of the hired guards. One of the
guards once called me a fighter with a cause.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I travel Norrath to defend the dominated &amp; vanquish the
evil rampant in our lands. This is a long, hard road. Many travelers I have met
scavenge Norrath for power. Slaying creatures to build their skills, they kill
without honor to speed their ascension. Many innocent Treants &amp; guards have
fallen to the fast feet of power hungry druids &amp; the defiling art of Death
Magic. I have even seen fast Trolls killing these creatures, if you can imagine
such a sight. The innocents' end may speed such shallow beings into power; but
it also empties their souls.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fight long and hard, many times ending the day having more
to overcome than when I started. But, it is an honorable fight, that I will
stand and face everyday.<br>
