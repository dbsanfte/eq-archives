knowledge. I have journeyed all throughout the lands of Norrath, and I have
learned many tales of adventure from people I have encountered during my

Magi'kot, your journey shall begin in the Commonlands. Search for Jahsohn Ak'sot
and give him this token. He will share some of the knowledge I have bestowed
upon him, and point you further down your path to Mastery. Bring me the Words of
Mastery, Power of the Elements, and the Words of Magi'kot....Then you shall

the Token to Jahsohn Aksot in West Commonlands.&nbsp; His location is (+62.78,
+3639.68)&nbsp; He will wander a little so just get close to this and then use
the sense summoned spell to be directed to his pet.&nbsp; When you cast it make

told me afterwards that I did not have the balance I thought I had. Have you
come for the Words of Magi'kot?&quot;<br>
<br>
You say, 'Yes I have come for the words of Magi'kot.'<br>
<br>
Jahsohn Aksot says 'The Words of Magi'kot can only be shared with those
elementalists whose minds are of balance. The Words were separated into three
pieces by a high council of Magi who feared that the story would bring an end to
elementalists throughout Norrath. If you feel you wish to read from the sacred
Power of the Orb then an elementalis of such power should easily accomplish this

Autropos is a very hard level 50 Wizard.&nbsp; He can be taken out by around 2-3
groups that work well together.&nbsp; He enjoys dispelling people (usually your
enduring breath.)&nbsp; He is also very difficult to kill because he is guarded
by 6 guardians which can be hard to kill as well.&nbsp; (Level Needed)&nbsp; The
Tears of Erolisi are dropped from Captian Rottgrime.&nbsp; He is a level 55
warrior that spawns every 5 minutes at (+2471, +2138), near the outpost.&nbsp;
He is said to be 100% magic resistant but this is not confirmed yet.&nbsp; He
looks like an Iksar Skeleton.&nbsp; Killing the Captain isn't hard, you just
need lots of tanks and clerics. Casters who have pets can help, but I don't
think any other spells will be useful against him.&nbsp; Pulling him from the
outpost in the Overthere is difficult; the two times I was present, a dragoon
was pulled along with him. He is usually standing near the southeast corner of
the Outpost, along with six undead marines, who are level 50. You'll probably
want a monk to feign pull the Captain, and it will be much easier to do at night
when the dragoons are out on patrol (fewer things to aggro). I don't know the
exact method that was used however.&nbsp; You will take a Venril Sathir faction
hit for killing Rottgrime; apparently it's a pretty sizable one, so be careful
if you're used to being able to travel there (evil races and classes, for
example.&nbsp; The Rain of Karana is found off of Trabul Earthstrider located in
East Karana.&nbsp; He is a level 48 named hill giant that spawns very frequently
on Crag Hill.&nbsp; You just need lots of druids in that area with
tracking.&nbsp; Once you have the three items give them to Jinalis Andir and you

and search the world below for an Elemental Binder, and a cloak fashioned from
the feathers of a Pegusus. Return them to me and I shall give you the Element of
Wind.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Crown of Elemental Mastery is
dropped from the Sphinx on the 7th Island in Plane of Air.&nbsp; This is a
common spawn.&nbsp; The Elemental Binder is loot from Elemental Warriors in The
Hole which is connect to Paineel.&nbsp; They spawn near the entrance and are
level 38-42.&nbsp; The Binder is a semi-common drop.&nbsp; Finally, the Pegasus
Feather Cloak is a very rare cloak from the Pegasus, Quillmane in South Karanas.&nbsp;
Its too bad that once you get the cloak you almost immediately have to give it
away because this cloak gives the effect of Levitation when worn.&nbsp; Very
useful.&nbsp; Quillmane is a rare spawn level 30 warrior, but he can spawn
anywhere in the zone. Most commonly he is found in the interior of the zone,
away from the zone walls, but he can be out there, too. He wanders almost
constantly, and is killed almost instantly by any who see him (because the cloak
you need for the quest is All/All and has unlimited charges of Levitate...).
This sucks, but it means it takes some real effort to get the cloak.&nbsp;
Because Quillmane spawns randomly and wanders, the best way to get the cloak is
to go to South Karanas with as many high level rangers and druids as you can
gather. More than 5 would be overkill, since you want to be grouped with them
all. Basically, what you should do is summon your pet of choice, get a SoW, and
then run around the zone killing anything that wanders. Static spawns like the
Aviaks at their tower or the Tesch Mas Gnolls outside splitpaw, need not be
killed (Quillmane doesn't spawn there, and there will always be people camping
the Aviaks and Gnolls anyway). Anything else that wanders -- centaurs, wolves,
lions, elephants, aviaks, gnolls, treants (although there is a faction issue
there) -- is fair game. You want five trackers with you because they can always
home in on a mob and kill it, and they can do this constantly -- the instant
something shows up on tracking, they will go after it and kill it. And the
reason you want to be grouped is, if someone in your group does see Quillmane
and kills him, then you will be able to get to the corpse and loot it before it
opens up and some ninjalooter steals your cloak!&nbsp; Even one high-level
tracker with you can make this an easy enough camp. (To put it another way, one
tracker tracking and killing mobs, and Quillmane when he pops, is better than
wandering about hoping to encounter Quillmane by yourself!) If you have even one
or two ranger or druid friends who can help, then your life will become
immeasurably easier.&nbsp; Nevertheless, even with your entire guild scouring
the zone for Quillmane, expect to spend at least several hours on getting the
cloak.&nbsp; Give the three items to Kihun Solstin in the Plane of Sky.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Once you have given him the three
items you will receive the Element of Wind.&nbsp; Also, the Master of Elements
will spawn (Thought to spawn in the middle of the Quest Room in Plane of Sky but
unsure).&nbsp; Be sure to have all four elements when you hand in the three
items to Kihun.&nbsp; Give the four elements to the Master of Elements and he
will in return, give you the scroll Summon Orb of Mastery.&nbsp; Scribe this
spell and then summon your epic weapon.&nbsp; It is very useful that this is a
summon spell because if you accidentally delete it or something happens to it,
you just summon it again.</font></p>
