Introduction</P>







<P></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">This is not a strategy guide on how to start and play a specific character.&nbsp; I do

not have extensive EverQuest playing experience (yet) to say what each race and class character type should do.&nbsp; This is more of a generic guide to get you ready to start adventuring with groups and be on your way to exploring the continents in Norrath, no matter what character type you play.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've only played in the Human City of Freeport so almost all the experience I have is in that area, but I think some of what I did can be applied anywhere and on most types of character races and classes.</P>







<P><B>Learning &amp; Setting Up your Interface</P>







<P></B>First, run the EverQuest Tutorial to familiarize yourself with the user interface.&nbsp; At the end of the tutorial, DO NOT EXIT immediately, take time to explore the &quot;Tutorial World&quot;.&nbsp; Even though not all buttons work in the tutorial, practice navigating through the terrain and also learn HOW TO SWIM.&nbsp; This is not covered in the tutorial but you can jump in the lake and practice.</P>







<P>All characters have the Sense Heading skill.&nbsp; This skill enables you to determine what direction your character is facing.&nbsp; Without this, YOU WILL GET LOST.&nbsp; Every newbie char is&nbsp; direction-impaired, you can't even tell you are facing east when the sun rises in front of you in the morning&nbsp; *LOL*&nbsp;&nbsp; Raising your Sense Heading skill is easy, just use it over and over while you´re running, fishing, resting, and even while fighting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The easiest way to do this is to put the Sense Heading skill button in one of your hotkey buttons.&nbsp; I used the 1st hotkey so I just press 1 over and over.&nbsp; Do this as soon as you login.&nbsp; </P>







<P>Also, hotkey the other most often used skills like fishing so you don't do multiple clicks just to use it.&nbsp; You may also revise the navigation buttons especially if you are right-handed.&nbsp; I find that using the numpad or arrow keys and the mouse is not all that&nbsp; convenient.&nbsp;&nbsp; I changed the keyboard settings to the following, but this is just my preference:</P>







<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E = forward<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D = backward<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S = left<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F = right<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X = duck<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G = Target Nearest NPC<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T = auto-attack</P>







<P>Note: The G and T keys are convenient, since while running, I can easily target a nearby critter and attack it without moving my hand, just my forefinger.&nbsp; The default settings for these are F8 and A, so it's quite annoying fumbling for the keys, at least for me it is.&nbsp; Bring out your Map Guide from the EQ manual as it will help you immensely.&nbsp; Write down the names and type of the buildings so you'll not waste time retracing steps trying to see which store sells what. </P>







<P><B>What's Next</P>







<P></B>In your inventory you will find a note telling you to locate your guildmaster.&nbsp; Each character class has a guild house in the city you are in.&nbsp; Find it and give that to the NPC mentioned in the note.&nbsp; You also have a Book of Discord.&nbsp;&nbsp; What you do with this determines your PVP status.&nbsp; Since we are SoF,&nbsp; I suggest you destroy this book immediately, otherwise give the book to a Priest of Discord and your PVP will turn on.&nbsp; This is IRREVERSIBLE.</P>







<P>Once you locate your guildmaster, he/she will give you a guild tunic.&nbsp; It's nothing special but it will give you some protection against the low level monsters, not much but its better than nothing.&nbsp; The guildmaster may also give you a quest like fetch him/her an item.&nbsp; You may choose to do this now or for later.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've read somewhere that you can get the first few levels on questing alone, but finding the NPCs that offer them are a complete waste of time.&nbsp;&nbsp; So forget questing and go straight to hunting.</P>







<P><B>Leveling and Equipping your character</P>







<P></B>If you are a magic user, scribe your spells and memorize them before going out to the field.&nbsp; If not, then go to a gate and venture outside.&nbsp; This is the newbie area.&nbsp; As you go farther from your city outskirts, monster levels will increase.&nbsp; Usually the first 4 levels can be obtained in the first or nearest outside-of-city ZONE.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>







<P>One thing to remember about EQ, there is no such thing as power-leveling a la Realm 2.x.&nbsp; If a level 3 groups with a level 7 or 8, they will hardly get experience or nothing at all.&nbsp; Group party members should be at most 3 levels apart, better if it's only 1 or 2, so the low level is not disadvantaged much on the XP split.&nbsp;&nbsp; The premise is that the lower level has no idea what the heck the higher level is doing.&nbsp;&nbsp; In EQ, most monsters under level 6 can be killed alone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fighting alone and gathering all the treasure is the best way for you to get up to level 5 and earn enough money to buy leather armor.&nbsp; Do not even dream of wearing chain or plate armor since these items are way way expensive and you cannot afford it.&nbsp;&nbsp; You have to earn at least 10 platinum to afford 3-4 leather items.&nbsp; Start to buy the ones that gives you the highest AC, e.g. tunic and leggings. </P>







<P>To earn money, loot EVERY monster you kill.&nbsp; You need every copper piece you can get.&nbsp; Money is tight and you will always be broke until you get your Trading skills high enough as an alternate source of income.&nbsp; You have to go back to town frequently to sell your loot as you are only allowed to have 8 slots on your inventory.&nbsp; Food and water already takes up 2 slots. </P>







<P>TIP: Once you have enough money,&nbsp; go and get a backpack.&nbsp; This will give you more inventory room.&nbsp; It's average cost is about +/- 6 gold,&nbsp; some character types will be able to buy it cheaper depending on race and charisma.&nbsp; I suggest buying 2 backpacks so you don't have to go back and forth frequently to town and also you can save some loot to be sold to places where you know the shopkeeper buying price is more, i.e.&nbsp; loot from critters in the desert is sold for less in shops close by the desert since supply for them is plenty. </P>







<P><B>Raising your Skills</P>







<P></B>In EQ, your skill level increases the more you use it.&nbsp; You will get a message saying your skill in such and such has increased.&nbsp; For each character level you gain practice points&nbsp; (like Realm build points).&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice Points (or pp in EQ-lingo)&nbsp; can be used in your guildhouse to raise your skill level in any skill you choose.</P>







<P>TIP:&nbsp; DO NOT USE your practice points on skills you can increase without cost.&nbsp; For example, do not use it for Fishing Skills, or Sense Heading or even Weapon or Magic Skills, since these types of skills, you will use A LOT.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is better to save your practice point on a TRADE SKILL like Smithing or Tailoring, since to increase your skill in this, you have to spend money on materials and it can leave you really broke.&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest you save ALL your practice points until level 7 or 8, at which time you can decide what trade skill to pursue.&nbsp;&nbsp; For those who will get the Research skill, I suggest you save all your points and pour them to that skill when you get it.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>







<P><B>Trade Skills</P>







<P></B>There are several trade skills available.&nbsp; I do not intend to give guides on how to do them.&nbsp; The EQ Vault website has several guides on it.&nbsp; I suggest you read up on them, the URL is&nbsp; </FONT><A HREF="http://www.eqvault.net" target="_blank"><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">http://www.eqvault.net</FONT></A><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica"></P>







<P>The EQ economy is player driven.&nbsp; You WILL NOT earn money from your trade by making items and selling them to shopkeepers.&nbsp; Shopkeepers will pay you only for the base cost and you'll have 0 profit or even a loss because there will always be a failure in making items (loss of materials if that happens) even at high skill levels. </P>







<P><B>Survival Guide &amp; Tips</P>







<P></B>Food and Drink -&nbsp; You must have them all the time lest your stamina will go down and you'll not be able to run or do much.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some characters have the spell to summon food and water, a la Cornucopia spell,&nbsp; but I don't think there is an equivalent of a Ring of Eternal Nourishment (I wish there was though,&nbsp; LOL) so for majority of the characters, you will&nbsp; ALWAYS have to stock up on food and drink.</P>







<P>Bread and Water are expensive to you at low levels.&nbsp; On average, one loaf of bread is like 1 silver and 5 coppers on average and a Flask of water is 1 silver and 1 copper.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rations which supposedly last longer are even more expensive at 1 or 2 gold a piece.&nbsp; Contrary to popular belief, alcoholic items such as ale cannot be substituted for drinks, so don't go around wasting your money on them, unless you role-play a drunk that is. </P>







<P>TIP:&nbsp; If you are low on money and you are out of food and drink,&nbsp; buy muffins and milk which costs only a few copper each.&nbsp; This will allow you to go out and earn more money to buy food and drink that will last longer.&nbsp; I have not determined how long each food item lasts, but I do know that the more expensive the food is, the longer it lasts.&nbsp; Iron Rations which cost about 2 gold and a few silver last a very long&nbsp; time. </P>







<P>Examples of food items are muffins, fish cakes, loaf of bread, grapes, rations, iron rations.&nbsp; Drink items are Milk and Flask of Water only.</P>







<P>Hunting -&nbsp; While your Sense Heading skill is still low, do not venture far away from the city gate.&nbsp; Always try to keep within sight of it.&nbsp; There are Guards patrolling it who will kill creatures that venture too close.&nbsp; This is a good way to get rid of a creature chasing you. </P>







<P>TIP:&nbsp; Critters are relentless, they will not cease attacking you until they are attacked or taunted by someone else.&nbsp; Do not think that you lost a critter just by running away from it.&nbsp; They will find you and attack you so do not attack another one until you know that you've rid of your current attacker.</P>







<P>For some evil aligned creatures or those that are on kill-on-sight (KOS) status, you do not&nbsp; have the luxury of running to the guards for help, if you are on a city foreign to you.&nbsp; They will kill you instead.&nbsp; One way to get rid of critters is by ZONING.&nbsp; Each region in EQ is called a Zone, monsters will not cross a zone, so to be taken off a monster's hit list, go to another zone.&nbsp; This is a very good technique and is essential in surviving when things go awry.&nbsp; Fighting a critter that proved to be too much for you, and without the option of running to a Guard, this may be your only option, so know what direction the nearest zone&nbsp; border is.</P>







<P>Which leads me to my next topic….</P>







<P>Considering – Although creature levels cannot be determined, there is a way to know what&nbsp; your chances are in successfully killing a critter in combat alone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Target the critter and type /con&nbsp; or press the ‘c' key or the Consider button.&nbsp; I also hotkeyed the consider button since I always use it.&nbsp; </P>







<P>You will get color-coded messages when you consider a critter.&nbsp; It also gives you an indication how much XP you will get. </P>

<P><B>Dying &amp; Resurrection</P>







<P></B>You will die MANY TIMES in EQ, that´s just normal, and sometimes even fun, well not exactly.&nbsp; =)&nbsp; You get to &quot;see&quot; yourself as your &quot;soul&quot; rises and your mortal body being pounded and shredded to pieces by the monster who has just slain you&nbsp; *LOL*&nbsp; Don´t worry, it´s not gory at all =)</P>







<P>The good news is you don't lose items to other players, unless you are pvp on. The bad news, yes there are a few =) </P>







<P>1.You lose experience at level 5 and up.&nbsp; The amount you lose depends on your level.&nbsp; You may be setback a level even, but don't worry too much at levels 5-10, lost xp from death is not that much and can be recovered quickly. </P>







<P>2.You have to retrieve your items from your corpse.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you die, you get returned to your starting zone.&nbsp; You have to locate your corpse so try to remember what area or zone you were in when you died.&nbsp; Others suggested to use the /loc command to remember your coordinates, but don't ask me how to use it since I've never really been able to do a /loc just as I was about to die =)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consult the EQ manual on various ways to locate your corpse.&nbsp; The best way is to just keep track of your surroundings and remember landmarks.</P>







<P>3.There is a corpse decay rate.&nbsp; You have to retrieve your corpse immediately or risk having the server&nbsp; delete it.&nbsp; The normal decay rate for those under level 5 is 30 minutes online,&nbsp;&nbsp; 24 hours offline. High level chars can have decay rates of 24 hours and up to 7 days offline.&nbsp; Do not chance it though!!&nbsp; Go find your corpse immediately or risk losing all that you had.</P>







<P>TIP:&nbsp; Do not venture to another city unless you like travelling or you got money to pay a player to cast a &quot;Bind Affinity&quot; spell.&nbsp;&nbsp; Binding changes your &quot;starting point&quot; when you die&nbsp; to the current city you are in.&nbsp; There is nothing more frustrating dying several zones away and you have to spend well over 30 minutes going back retrieving your corpse.&nbsp; It's worse if you have to travel by boat to get back to where you were.</P>







<P>The usual charge for getting &quot;bound&quot; is 1 platinum (cheaper or free nowadays), but other players may charge for less.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully this will be a free service by members of our guild to other guild members.&nbsp; </P>







<P>TIP:&nbsp; Always deposit money and extra gear in your bank.&nbsp; If you die, and your body is too far away, you can buy some food and drink so you can survive travelling back.&nbsp; If you have spare weapons and armor, don't sell it, put it in your bank for these kinds of emergencies.&nbsp; The EQ Banks are &quot;networked&quot; magically.&nbsp; They're like ATM machines.&nbsp; Depositing and Withdrawing assets can be done in any city, at NO CHARGE.&nbsp; Wish some of our ATMs are that way!! *LOL*</P>







<P><B>Group Hunting</P>







<P></B>Once you get about level 5 or so, now is the time to group hunt. Since most critters in the next region you are going to are equal to or above your level, it's risky hunting alone since a higher level creature may attack you from behind while fighting another. The normal strategy in group hunting is that the party stands at a spot with a clear passage to safety, either to a city gate or a town with Guards or close by a zone border.&nbsp; One party member will go out and attack a creature (after considering it) then run like heck to the spot where the others are waiting to &quot;ambush&quot; the pursuing critter.&nbsp; Usually, the one doing the &quot;fetching&quot; will shout &quot;Incoming!!&quot;&nbsp; to warn your group and brace for the approaching monster.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you see the critter, target it and then attack.</P>







<P>TIP: Do not be a hero.&nbsp; If there are several party members with high hit points, back off from the attack if you go down 50% in health.&nbsp; Sit down to the side and let others take some hits.&nbsp; Let your health recover before jumping back in the fray.&nbsp; There are two advantages to this,&nbsp; #1 – Clerics in your group do not have to spend a lot of mana healing &quot;close to dying&quot; members&nbsp; #2 – less time is needed for you to get back to full health and you can start another battle sooner.</P>







<P>TIP: Looting or treasure gathering… the norm is by alphabetical order.&nbsp; Do not expect to earn a lot of money through group hunting.&nbsp; You are in it for the XP.&nbsp; Your primary source&nbsp; of income would be your trade skills and other skills like fishing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other ways to split the loot is have one gather everything and split the loot later, but this doesn't always happen since members of the group doesn't logoff at the same time and party members go in and out.&nbsp; Maybe on dungeon runs, this strategy is useful, split the loot after completing the dungeon.</P>







<P>TIP: A good mix of party members is the best.&nbsp; A Cleric or two, if you intend to fight critters with poison, diseases, etc.,&nbsp; a wizard, 2 or 3 warrior type characters and a bard in the group is preferred, since their magical songs affect the whole group, e.g increase party speed or increase the party's AC. </P>







<P><B>EverQuest Lingo</P>







<P></B>Much like the Realm, EQ has its own lingo.&nbsp; These are some of the stuff I learned:</P>







<P>mob - Monster or Beast, or from an old MUD term for MOBile NPC<BR>con/conned -&nbsp; considered&nbsp; <BR>inc – Incoming&nbsp; (critter on the way… a strategy used by groups, one goes out and&nbsp; lures a&nbsp; critter to the waiting party and is a form of warning to get group members ready)<BR>Train – bunch of critters on the way… best to get out of its way or run for safety<BR>PP – practice point<BR>KOS – kill-on-sight<BR>Tank – a character type with plenty of health...usually for absorbing the most damage in party hunting.<BR>Dised – diseased (when a mummy hits you, sometimes you get diseased)<BR>PL – packet loss&nbsp; (it's like lag, but not quite)<BR>Bubble or bubs/bar = your health, stamina, mana and experience has a gauge or &quot;bubble&quot; meter where each bubble represents 20% of the total.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, 3 of 5 mana bubs,&nbsp; means you only have 60% mana left. <BR>OOM =&nbsp; Out of Mana<BR>LOM = Low on Mana<BR>Town or Zone Abbreviations e.g.&nbsp; nro = North of Desert Ro,&nbsp; ecomm = East Commonlands<BR>Currency Abbreviations e.g.&nbsp; p or plat or pp = platinum piece&nbsp; g or gp = gold piece&nbsp; s=silver&nbsp; c=copper&nbsp;&nbsp; hence&nbsp; 5p 3g&nbsp; is 5 platinum and 3 gold<BR>Red or Yellow &lt;insert creature nickname here&gt; -&nbsp; describes the creature after it has been&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;conned&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example:&nbsp; Red Spidey = A Tarantula that gave a red text message after you considered it. <BR>ZONE!!! = heheheheh..run for the nearest zone border, the party member lured a monster&nbsp;&nbsp; he/she considered too tough for your group to kill…the monster will not cross the border but you'll always be on its &quot;hit list&quot; if you stay within the zone. </P>
