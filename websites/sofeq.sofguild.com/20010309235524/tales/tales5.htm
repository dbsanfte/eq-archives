    The scorching sun and the lava heat permeating from the ground of the

    Lavastorm mountains did nothing to spoil the mood of the stalwart

    adventurers calling themselves the Elite Legione. Fresh from a victorius

    slaying of the foul dragon beast Lord Nagafen, everyone was in high spirits

    as they prepare for a journey to the Northlands to invade the lair of the

    infamous ice dragon Lady Vox.</font>

    <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">I

    was one of the few people invited to join the forthcoming adventure. &nbsp;As

    usual, Ceinwen the druidess was on my side and we were both excited and

    nervous about the events about to unfold.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the history of our

    world (ooc: the Xegony server), Lady Vox has never been defeated and the

    multitude of attempts to slay her have all ended in death and failure.

    &nbsp;That night, everyone hope the result will be different.</font>

    <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">I

    flipped through my songbook back and forth, thinking what songs will be most

    useful. &nbsp;I try to predict what the battle would be like. &nbsp;Gathering

    knowledge from stories brought back by survivors of previous expeditions, I

    have a few ideas of what monsters we are going to face and what to expect

    when fighting the dragon herself. &nbsp;I remembered something about pit

    traps in the dungeon where you can be blown into by icy terrors. &nbsp;I

    also heard something about Dragon Fear, a roar so dreadful, it takes away

    the courage from an &nbsp;adventurers heart causing you to run away and

    possibly into more danger and ultimately death.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the most

    fearsome thing I have heard about Lady Vox is her Ice Breath that can kill

    an adventurer instantly.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was sweating as I strive to memorize

    the songs I've chosen to aid me and my group in the upcoming battles.</font>

    <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">I

    close my song book and try to contain my anxiety. &nbsp;I look at the band

    of adventurers around me and I see them drinking and joking around. <i>&quot;By

    the gods, aren't they nervous at all?&quot;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; I think to

    myself. <i>&quot;Well I suppose they aren't, being experienced dragonslayers

    and all, we should be fine, shouldn't we?&quot;.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; A gruff

    warrior handed me a bottle of Ol'Tujim Fierce Brew, &nbsp;<i>&quot;Here lad,

    this will calm ye down!&quot;</i>, he bellowed.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>&quot;Don't

    ye worry! We shall be feasting by Vox's body by the night is over!!&quot;</i>

    he assured me and everyone else as he went around handing everyone some of

    that brew.</font>

    <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">I

    took the bottle of Fierce Brew to my mouth and drank heavily.&nbsp;&nbsp; I

    felt my throat on fire and felt my muscles tense and bulge. &nbsp;No wonder

    this is such a popular pre-battle drink! &nbsp;My uneasiness was gone and I

    am eager to get going.&nbsp;&nbsp; I stood up and look up in the heavens and

    left my fate to the gods. <i>&quot;By your will oh Holy Mother Tunare!

    &nbsp;I shall live or die this night, but please give me the courage so that

    my songs will not fail my companions in this mightiest battle of my

    life!!&quot;</i> &nbsp;Then the call to start the journey was made.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    The wizards and druids called forth the magics that instantly transported

    the group halfway across the continent.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</font>

    <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">We

    appeared at the Northern Plains of Karanas. &nbsp;I took out my battle drums

    and sang a steady beat to accelerate our journey by foot. &nbsp;I can feel

    the wind in my face as we ran across the plains, swifter than any creature

    in Norrath!&nbsp;&nbsp; Running west we arrived in Qeynos Hills in no time,

    and a quick transit through Blackburrow we reached the edge of the Everfrost

    plains, the frigid lands of the North.&nbsp;&nbsp; We waited for a few

    others to catch up (too bad they don't have a bard and have to rely on

    Spirit of Wolf to increase their speed hehe), before we made our way east

    into the Caverns of Permafrost.&nbsp;&nbsp; When we got there, we saw that

    the others are already amusing themselves beating up on the Ice Giants that

    guards the entrance. &nbsp;We joined in on the fun while we waited some more

    for the rest of the groups to arrive...</font></p>

    <font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">Finally,

    the leader of the Elite Legione shouted <i>&quot;IT IS TIME!&nbsp;&nbsp;

    EVERYONE GO IN!! GO IN!!&quot;</i> &nbsp;Saying another quick prayer, I drew

    out my weapon and entered the dungeon of ice. &nbsp;The ice goblins guarding

    the hallways were no match for the group as they were quickly dispatched.

    &nbsp;I nary saw a goblin alive and just followed a trail of goblin blood

    leading to the room where the Ice Giant Diplomat waits.</font>

    <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">His

    resistance was met with a rain of swords and burst of fire magic that ended

    his life with a quick thud on the icy ground.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next room,

    there were 2 ice giants, &nbsp;but the group was too powerful and again the

    ice giants were quickly slain.&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone shouted <i>&quot;Okay

    folks, that's the easy part, rest and meditate and in a few minutes we will

    be moving on&quot;.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Time elapsed and everyone was ready to

    go. &nbsp;Another call was made to start walking deep into the dungeon.

    &nbsp;We were warned not to stray from the path being taken for danger lurks

    in every corner.</font>

    <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">As

    we walk along the dark hallways, chilled air coming out of our nostrils,

    &nbsp;I was wondering why the place was so quiet. &nbsp;Then I heard some

    commotion up by the front of the line! &nbsp;An Icy Terror has attacked the

    group! &nbsp;I heard a yell &nbsp;<i>&quot;Backs to the wall!!&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Backs to the wall!&quot;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; I faced the Terror and saw a

    cone-shaped like creature with deadly tentacles all over its body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    I felt a massive force hit my chest as I slammed against the wall knocking

    the air out of my lungs.&nbsp;&nbsp; That force would've knocked me hundred

    yards back to the hallways we just passed had I not turned aside in

    time!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Breathing deep and getting back on my feet, I joined the

    fray singing a battle song that make muscles bulge with strength and feet

    agile as a cat.&nbsp;&nbsp; Every now and then I would see someone being

    blown away from the battle as the Icy Terror was putting up a good fight.

    &nbsp;In the end however, the Icy Terror has met a similar fate like the Ice

    Giant Diplomat before him.</font>

    <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">We

    stopped at a corner not far from where Vox's lair is. &nbsp;The order was

    made to rest and meditate. &nbsp;Everyone was also told to use any buffing

    spells available for the next fight will be against 3 giants, one of which

    is the priest Nafegen, and the fight after that will be Vox herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    The plan was to lure the 3 giants that guard the entrance to Vox's lair, and

    kill them in the corner we were in, for to fight Vox with her guards is not

    only foolish, but altogether fatal. &nbsp;If Vox takes notice, then the

    order was to immediately evacuate the area. &nbsp;Sounds like a good

    competent plan. &nbsp;I knew that this group can definitely handle 3 Ice

    Giants.</font>

    <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">However,

    no matter what kind of plan you devise, some things can go wrong and tonight

    was no exception...</font></p>

    <font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">The

    monk Shaolin was given the task to lure the 3 giants to the group waiting to

    ambush. &nbsp;When every was all buffed and ready, he was given the order to

    pull. &nbsp;The ground shook as I saw 3 giants running towards us. &nbsp;The

    priest of Nafegen, an ice giant magi, and an ice giant, but wait!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;

    NO! &nbsp;There's another Icy Terror hot on the monk's trail!! &nbsp;Hmmm…no

    matter this is not a disaster.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone focused on killing the

    priest first for he was deemed to be the most poweful of the lot. &nbsp;Jixl

    and Ganthin, their battle commanders, were amongst the first to draw blood

    and others turned to assist them.&nbsp;&nbsp; I jumped in the battle singing

    Verses of Victory once more and attacked the priest.&nbsp;&nbsp; The air

    smelled of smoke and fire as magics of flame and lighting filled the hall

    striking the giant where he stood. &nbsp;The warriors, paladins and rangers

    hacking and slashing their way to through. &nbsp;The rogues were swift and

    deadly with their backstabs and the healers kept vigil to see that everyone

    stays healthy enough to fight another.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</font>

    <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">I

    felt another massive force hit me as I was thrown back a good distance but

    fortunately not into anything dangerous. &nbsp;I tried to keep away from the

    Icy Terror everyone was ignoring and joined the attack on the priest

    again.&nbsp;&nbsp; The priest was finally slain and a shout told everyone

    that the ice giant magi was next. &nbsp;Gaelad, the enchanter was holding

    the other Ice Giant in check and the fight should've been easy. &nbsp;But

    things started to go wrong…. When the magi was nearing its life's end it

    ran away and no one was able to stop it.&nbsp;&nbsp; No one dared follow the

    magi into the depths of the dungeon and we just waited for it to come back,

    so we started to kill the remaining ice giant and icy terror. &nbsp;But the

    ice giant magi had a trick up its sleeve. &nbsp;He has summoning magic!!!

    &nbsp;He has the power to teleport you from where you stand back to him!!

    &nbsp;All of a sudden, we hear the magi's deep voice shouting <i>&quot;You

    will not evade me&quot;</i> calling us by names and summoned people to him

    one at a time!! &nbsp;It was horrible seeing someone just disappear in front

    of your eyes and then suddenly hearing them scream from a distance!!&nbsp;&nbsp;

    There was nothing you can do except pray that you don't get

    &quot;chosen&quot;.</font>

    <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">Nevertheless,

    the fate of the summoned ones was of less concern for the time being until

    the ice giants and icy terror were dispatched. &nbsp;The group continued

    their attacks until the icy terror and ice giants were slain. &nbsp;Then

    some of the people that were summoned were able to find their way back to

    the group but were not by themselves, but with more ice giants after them!!

    &nbsp;The group geared for another onslaught of giants and I saw a few

    corpses laying around. &nbsp;The previous fight did have a few casualties,

    and still a few missing ones. &nbsp;A loud voice echoed from the halls

    &nbsp;<i>&quot;You will not evade me, Kellen!&quot;</i> as my vision grew

    dark and I felt a tug as I was summoned by the magi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    My eyesight came back and I felt the fist of an ice giant pound on me.

    &nbsp;A shock of ice slammed against me as I tried to evade another blow

    from another ice giant. &nbsp;I was summoned to a place I know not!! &nbsp;I

    didn't know where to go and I'm getting attacked by two ice giants and the

    magi!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I sang a song of healing and intersperse it with a psalm

    of warmth to keep me alive long enough to escape. &nbsp;Then another

    adventurer appeared near me…and then another!! &nbsp;More and more people

    are being summoned and the ice giants started to attack them instead of

    me!&nbsp;&nbsp; They started running towards a hallway and the ice giants

    ran after them.&nbsp;&nbsp; I followed them knowing they are more familiar

    with the caverns and maybe they could lead me back to the group. &nbsp;We

    round a corner and I saw flares of magic and heard the sounds of fighting!!

    &nbsp;There they are!! &nbsp;I went back to my group and sang my battle song

    once more.&nbsp;&nbsp; More corpses are on the floor as the continued

    barrage of ice giants coming from everywhere is taking its toll.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    There were only a few left fighting but they will not be daunted into

    submission. &nbsp;Everyone came to fight a dragon and fight a dragon it will

    be, not lose from a bunch of ice giants. &nbsp;The battle has to be ended

    but the magi has to be stopped first.&nbsp;&nbsp; The magi was lured back to

    the group and this time it was not allowed to ran away which made things

    turn for the worse the last time around.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the magi was

    killed and all the remaining ice giants were slain as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Cheers for both victory and relief rang throughout the air.</font>

    <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">I

    looked around the area, several corpses strewn around. &nbsp;No one came out

    of the battle unscathed and everyone alive are now recuperating and healing

    their wounds. &nbsp;The casters are meditating and the clerics are preparing

    to call forth their gods favor into resurrecting our slain companions.

    &nbsp;I sat down wearily and sang a song of clarity, a peaceful hymn that

    clears the mind of the listener enabling them to gather energy for the next

    fight ahead... against an Ice Dragon.</font></p>

    <font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">This is

    it. &nbsp;The fight against Lady Vox. &nbsp;The band of weary adventurers

    summoned their courage and whatever is left of their strength. &nbsp;There

    was no time to recast all the buffing magic, only the most important ones,

    &nbsp;for to wait longer would mean that the ice giants will come back and

    the group can ill afford another fight of that magnitude. &nbsp;</font>

    <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">The

    plan was announced.&nbsp;&nbsp; Shammy, the guildmaster of the Elite Legione,

    will go inside the lair with Invulnerability and absorb the initial

    onslaught of the dragon's ice breath.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next ones to go in

    would be casters' pet followed by the warrior-types and then everyone

    else.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under no circumstances will Vox be fought outside her

    lair. &nbsp;If she gets out and everyone is not yet inside, the order was to

    evacuate. &nbsp;</font>

    <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">I

    started humming a psalm of mystic shielding and had a levitate spell cast on

    me. &nbsp;The song is supposed to help prevent being affected by Dragon Fear

    and if I do get feared, I do not accidentally fall down a pit trap if I lose

    control of myself and started running.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I heard a shout that

    Shammy is going in!&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone held onto their weapons tightly and

    I heard the whispering of arcane words as the magic users prepare to send in

    their pets.</font>

    <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">All

    of a sudden chill of fear filled the air!! &nbsp;I felt my hair rise and

    bile well up in my throat. &nbsp;It was the Dragon Fear!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; The

    roar was faint and it grew louder and louder!! &nbsp;Something is wrong!!

    Deadly wrong!!&nbsp;&nbsp; People were running around and screaming madly!!

    &nbsp;DRAGON FEAR! &nbsp;I resisted it with the help of my song. There were

    those not fortunate enough and they fell into the bear pit traps. Those that

    can gate, gated out when they got control of themselves again. &nbsp;Those

    that can't, had to fight their way up. &nbsp;I looked up and saw her. &nbsp;OH

    MY GOD! &nbsp;IT'S LADY VOX!! &nbsp;AND SHE'S OUT OF HER LAIR!! I didn't

    have time to start singing Psalm of Warmth when I felt the freezing winds of

    her breath.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two people directly under her died instantly. &nbsp;Others

    died when her claws rend them to bits and pieces. &nbsp;A white dragon of

    ancient beauty, mercilessly slaughtering anyone who dares invade her lair.

    &nbsp;It was a horrible (and yet awesome) sight to see! &nbsp;</font>

    <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">Remember

    the original order was to evacuate if she gets out, but only a few heeded

    it, for the deaths of the fallen will not go unavenged.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those

    who recovered from the dragon fear shouted to everyone <i>&quot;GO INSIDE!!

    &nbsp;GET HER INSIDE!!&quot;</i> &nbsp;More bodies lay dead as the ranks

    were quickly decimated. &nbsp;It was a sign of things to come. &nbsp;Everyone

    ran inside her lair trying to lure the dragon back and quickly reformed to

    start the attack.</font>

    <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">I

    saw the dragon go back to her lair and after receiving a few healing spells

    I quickly rushed inside her huge cavern room.&nbsp;&nbsp; I ran towards the

    fray and attacked the dragon and tried to damage her as much as I could with

    my weapons.&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside her lair, getting feared is not as dangerous

    as outside so I sang my psalm of warmth and cycled it with my battle

    song.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;More and more people fell from her terrible claws (ooc:

    205 damage each) and her ice breath was wreaking havoc.&nbsp;&nbsp; NO!!! I

    screamed as I saw my friend, Calek collapse and die as her barraged of

    attacks concentrated on him.&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt her sharp claws slashed

    through my armor and I writhe in pain as I saw her eyes gazed threateningly

    at me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thankfully a warrior caught her attention as he delivered

    a very powerful blow!&nbsp;&nbsp; A bright flash of lighting and a huge ball

    of fire came streaking through the air and hit the dragon square in the

    chest. &nbsp;She screamed in agony!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Warriors, Paladin and

    Rangers were hitting her with their mighty weapons trying to slice through

    her frozen scale skin.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was bleeding from more than a dozen

    wounds all over her body. &nbsp;She was taking a lot of damage and we knew

    we had a chance of winning (ooc: She was down to about 40% health). &nbsp;BUT

    THEN SHE HEALED HERSELF!!!</font>

    <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">I

    briefly saw the faces of those people near me surprised and then turn into

    resignation as with our current state with just a handful remaining

    standing, defeat was certain.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A renewed Lady Vox roared

    once more driving fear into the hearts of the bravest of men. &nbsp;</font>

    <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">I

    was close to death. &nbsp;I stepped back from the dragon and ran towards my

    wife who was ready to cast her healing magic when another wave of icy winds

    slammed into our backs. &nbsp;Thankfully I was far enough not to bear the

    brunt of the damage as I saw more people die, if not from her breath, from

    her sharp talons.&nbsp;&nbsp; We crawled out of her lair back to hallways

    where some people are meditating to gather enough energy to evacuate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Then &nbsp;I heard Lady Vox once more, roar with all her mighty splendor. <i>&quot;Begone!

    puny mortals!&quot;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; I could almost hear her mock us.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Shouts of <i>&quot;GATE! GATE!&quot;</i> were heard when the beast came out

    of her lair once again. &nbsp;I told Ceinwen, <i>&quot;Succor now!!&quot;</i>

    but she says <i>&quot;I have not enough mana!&quot;</i> &nbsp;I softly sang

    to her a song of clarity to ease her mind and ignore the chaos surrounding

    us. &nbsp;I felt my life ebbing away as another frozen wind slammed us

    against the wall. &nbsp;This is it…our life is at its end… I saw Vox

    rear her head around the corner fixing her icy glare upon me. &nbsp;I close

    my eyes and submitted myself to my fate. &nbsp;Then my vision grew dark and

    I lost consciousnes...</font></p>

    <font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">The

    warm sun and the chirping of birds woke me. &nbsp;I slowly opened my eyes to

    see visages of gigantic treants stumbling around the druid stone structures

    in the Karanas. &nbsp;I am alive! &nbsp;I can't believe it! &nbsp;Mumbling a

    quick prayer of thanks to the Mother of All, I stood up and saw Ceinwen

    severely injured, drained of magic but alive as well!!. &nbsp;I took out my

    lute and sang a hymn of restoration and the bardic magic of song slowly

    closed our wounds and restored our health.</font>

    <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">As I

    sang and strum my lute, I remembered our ill-fated journey, the mighty

    battles we fought, the joys of our victory and the agony of our final

    defeat. &nbsp;I vowed that the bravery and audacity of the people who dared

    to challenge Lady Vox will not be left untold.</font>

    <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">Some

    day, Lady Vox will fall, and on that day I hope to be in the midst of the

    final battle once more...</font>

    <p><i><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">OOC:

    &nbsp;This is a recount of a failed Lady Vox slaying attempt at the Xegony

    Server the night of October 8th as seen through the eyes of yours truly,

    Kellen. &nbsp;Obviously I embellished it a bit and also did not include the

    fact that people died multiple times (especially those that bound themselves

    inside the dungeon to get back into action immediately) just because it
