<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:.5in"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">In
the dim twilight, Leithreas admired her.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">She
walked gracefully down the sandy path, the long shadows playing through her
hair, the last light of the day flickering through the trees and clinging to her
as if reluctant to leave, as if somehow the daylight should shine just a little
longer whenever she passed beneath it.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Leithreas
sat cross-legged against a tree stump along the trail, absentmindedly twisting
an arrowhead between his fingers, interrupted briefly from his task of repairing
arrows.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He paused his crafting for
just a moment to watch the lovely lady walk down the path.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She smiled at him as she passed; he smiled up, and tipped his head
politely.&nbsp;<o:p>
 </o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">&quot;Good
day, m'lady.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">&quot;And
good day to you.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She smiled
down upon him as she passed.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Leithreas
sat back against the tree and continued to admire her as she walked past,
watching the flow of her cloak as it swept behind her, watching her long blonde
hair cascading down her back, watching her slender hand holding an ornately
carved staff before her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Leithreas
watched her pass out of sight, listening to the slow cadence of the base of her
staff on the sandy trail, and reflected on her warm smile.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">&quot;Lovely,&quot;
he remarked to himself, as he turned back to the arrowhead in his hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He pulled an arrow shaft out of his backpack, and turned it over under
his eyes, inspecting it closely.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">A
sudden scream jolted him out of his concentration, and he flew to his feet,
leaves and pebbles kicked into the air in his haste.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He pulled his rapier from its scabbard and stood ready. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>A
leaf floated back down to rest on his boot as he listened intently in the eerie
silence.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">The
silence was broken by the sounds of a struggle, of rustling armor and muffled
screams.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Guided by the sounds,
Leithreas crept silently but swiftly through the trees, his rapier held ready,
his heart racing.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Crouched
behind a tree, he peered into a clearing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His
trained eye and keen senses spotted clues quickly; trampled grass, broken twigs,
drag marks in the soil; signs of a struggle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>His heart skipped a beat as he caught the final clue.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">A
richly carved staff laid silently where it had fallen in the grass.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Indecision
lasted only a moment as the lady's radiant smile flashed through Leithreas's
mind.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Shouldering
his backpack higher onto his back, Leithreas followed the footsteps through the
clearing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As the sun's rays
vanished from the sky, Leithreas silently disappeared into the dark forest.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Leithreas
stared up at the sky, catching his bearings, not to mention his breath.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Well
into the night, Leithreas had pursued the trail left by his mysterious
adversaries.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He had expected to have intercepted them by now; instead, the
trail only seemed to get older, as if his prey was fast outpacing him.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">And
the forest was only getting darker and more forbidding, the further he traveled.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">His
blood chilled as he heard the distant sound of running water, churning and
tumbling over rocks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He knew where
he was; whatever he was following, it was heading north, into the thick and
humid forest of Nektulos, ancient home of the cold and evil Dark Elves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Whoever, whatever Leithreas was pursuing, whether it was aware or not, it
was taking Leithreas into these evil woods with it.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Leithreas
did not care to waste time imagining his fate if he became the hunted, tracked
down by the Dark Elves that inhabit these woods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moving more cautiously, he continued to follow his quarry.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">In
the damp, cold darkness, Lisette sat brooding.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Her
eyes wandered over the dim gray stone and smooth, dull iron bars that had become
her new home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her slender hands had
explored these cold surfaces a dozen times and found no way of egress; resigned
for the moment, she sat against the damp stone wall, huddling her knees against
her chest for warmth.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">In
the darkness she heard labored breathing, grunts and snarls that could scarcely
be imagined.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps her situation
could be worse, she thought dryly to herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Meaning, of course, that any moment it could be expected to become so.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Feeling
a chill, she looked up to catch a pair of dark eyes staring impassively at her
for a moment before disappearing, leaving her once again alone in the darkness.</font></p>

* -</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">The
sound of a twig snapping made Leithreas freeze in his tracks.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">He
crouched slowly and silently, tensed like a cat ready to spring, taking in every
sound.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A single shadow moved before
him in the mist, and was gone.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">It
was alone; Leithreas padded silently in pursuit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The shadow paused for a moment, and Leithreas sprang.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In a split second Leithreas was upon the figure, his smooth hunting knife
held firmly against its dark blue throat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Leithreas
swallowed hard on recognizing the Dark Elven features.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">&quot;Be
silent,&quot; he whispered, &quot;or you will surely die.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">The
eyes, almost black in the darkness, looked up at him silently, unimpressed, and
almost somewhat amused.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;You've
given me no reason to believe,&quot; the Dark Elf hissed, &quot;that I won't
anyway.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Leithreas
considered the situation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He did
not relish the idea of killing this man in cold blood; nor did he want the risk
of leaving him alive.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">&quot;They
know you're coming,&quot; the Dark Elf hissed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Leithreas ignored him.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">&quot;I
know where she is,&quot; the Dark Elf whispered again, taunting gleefully.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Knife
pressed to his throat again, Leithreas whispered, &quot;Talk.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">The
Dark Elf grinned, pleased with himself, enjoying his strange advantage
immensely.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Perhaps you are the one who will die,&quot; he
whispered playfully, &quot;if *you* do not do as *I* ask.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">&quot;I'm
listening.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">&quot;I
am called Leachreas,&quot; the Dark Elf began.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;I have been waiting for you… brother.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">It
was hours until Leithreas could finally believe the entire story.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Leith
and Leach crouched in the shadow of a boulder, peering at the guards standing
vigilantly at the entrance to the Dark Elven city.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">“Are
you sure this will work?” Leithreas asked.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">“Trust
me,” Leach replied mischievously as he emerged from his hiding place.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Nonchalantly, he walked up to the guard station and nodded
politely to the officer as he passed; they looked him over and allowed him to
pass by, ignoring him once he was beyond the gate.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Once
inside, he turned, gave Leithreas a wink, and quietly began to whisper.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The guards did not hear the arcane syllables that Leach
uttered, nor were they aware of the warm glow that spread from his outstretched
hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then suddenly they were
aware of nothing at all, as a cascade of mystical forces fell over their eyes
and ears and minds, easing them into a deep trance.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Moments
later, Leith padded quietly into the tunnel and stood uneasily at Leach’s
side.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">“We’re
in,” Leach whispered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“Follow
me.”</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">As
they snuck past the first gate and down a winding cavern, Leith’s mind
wandered.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>To discover a lost brother was strange enough – to discover
that brother as a Dark Elf was beyond imagining.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And yet here he was, following this strange man into a stronghold of evil
powerful enough to snuff out his life like a candle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If this was a trap, Leith pondered, it was a mighty strange one.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Yet
Leach’s story seemed possible enough…</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Leith’s
mother, Torrey Peregrine, was – according to Leach – not killed by Orcs as
Leith and his younger sister Letrea had always believed – the same Orc tribe
that had killed their father earlier that year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She was captured, yes – but kept as a slave, where she was discovered
by a particularly cunning Dark Elf man named D’Sloc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He had a weakness for Wood Elves, a charming personality, and a general
disrespect for established conventions; she had a bleak future and no other
chance for survival.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They ran away
together – Torrey cooperating because at first she had little choice, but
later because she fell in love.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
had a child together; a most unholy mix by the standards of either race.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Shortly
after that child was born, their secret filtered back to Neriak, where the Dark
Elves were most displeased.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
kidnapped the entire family – D’Sloc was swiftly executed, while Torrey and
her “abomination” were imprisoned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With
herself and her child doomed to execution – or worse – Torrey was without
hope until she was secretly approached by D’Sloc’s sister Enmity, who
offered only to rescue the child – nothing more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Having no choice, Torrey agreed.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Torrey
was never seen again; the child, however, was raised as a Dark Elf in Neriak
society, its heritage a secret.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">The
child’s name was Leachreas.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Leith
was woken from his reverie by a cautioning gesture from Leach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>“Shh,” Leach whispered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“We’re
here.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Creeping silently along
the side of an ancient stone building, they ducked down to a tiny window into
the dungeon below them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They slowly
and carefully peered through the bars, into the damp prison cell beyond.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">It
was empty.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Lisette
struggled against her bonds, the chains around her wrists digging uncomfortably
into her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That would not be the
worst discomfort by far she would feel today, she told herself, the pit of her
stomach growing cold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rough voices
shouted around her, and she felt a tug at her chains, pulling her ever onward.
They traveled the winding streets, amid jeers from Dark Elves who glared at her
out windows and doors and from the street, threats and obscenities shouted in a
language she did not understand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
knew their meaning clear enough; she was a light Elf; she was the enemy; she was
to be sacrificed to please their evil god Innoruuk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The words themselves were not important.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Not
all of the onlookers were Dark Elves; there were a handful of Trolls and Ogres
enjoying the spectacle, grunting and shouting coarse and suggestive remarks.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>One Troll in particular approached close enough to gaze at
her with a look that gave her chills – a look that somehow struck her as oddly
familiar – before vanishing back into the crowd quickly.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">The
Troll was in fact quick – ducking back into the crowd purposefully, stooping
into a building, sneaking out another door, and into a dark alley.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He glanced around to make sure he was not followed, then closed his eyes
for a moment.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">His
image shimmered, as if he was a walking mirage, and suddenly he refocused into
the image of a Dark Elf.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">“Did
you find her?” Leith asked.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">“Yes,”
Leach replied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“Amazing how much
you can see when you’re that tall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
found her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On her way to her
execution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When they pass into the
temple there will be no crowd – we make our move there. Follow me.”</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">As
he started to leave, Leith stopped him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“Why
are you doing this for me?”</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">“I
honor our mother,” Leach replied softly, with an uncharacteristically gentle
tone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“I could not change her
fate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But for your lady, I can.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Without waiting for a response, Leach hurried down the alley.</font></p>

looked around furtively, searching for some final means of escape and reaching
the bitter realization that there was none.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

over her and speaking words of evil, calling upon the vile powers of Innoruuk to
bind her onto the altar where she stood with magical force.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>From the corner of her eye she saw a dark robed figure, raising a
wicked-looking axe, drawing nearer.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">As
the executioner approached Lisette, a seedy looking human – as were most
humans with enough poverty of spirit to be found associating here – a human,
clad in dusty robes, drew away from the crowd and approached the altar,
muttering quietly to himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
crowd, wrapped up in the excitement and the thought of blood, paid the pathetic
form no heed.</font></p>

</span>As he lifted his axe, Lisette closed her eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She heard the axe whistling through the air – and she opened her eyes
in surprise as she heard the priest collapse at her feet, cleaved in two with a
mighty blow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A hush fell over the
crowd, and then cries of anger as the crowd fell upon the dazed executioner.</font></p>

the executioner fell under the might and rage of the furious crowd, the strange
human cast off his dirty robe and pointed defiantly at Lisette, intoning strange
words.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her confusion gave way to
dim understanding as she felt the bonds of force around her falling away in
response to his command.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
stumbled off the altar, staggering down the steps, where she fell – and
collapsed into Leithreas’s waiting arms.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">The
crowd, frenzied from murdering the executioner, took a moment to spot the Wood
Elf in their midst – and then the air was full of shrill, murderous cries of
hate.<span style="mso-spacerun:

– rearing back, he flung a wave of mystical forces into the heart of the
crowd, and the shouting was replaced by panicked sounds of confusion.</font></p>

hold them off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I can buy you time,
and it’s me they’re looking for.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
get her to safety.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Protect her at
all costs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I’ll…”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Leith paused.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“I’ll do
what I can to slow them.”</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">“There’s
still another way, Leith.”</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Leithreas
paced the room, agitated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“We’re
cornered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They know we’re in
here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A Wood Elf is kind of hard to
hide around here, and we’ve got half the city outside that door looking for
us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just what did you have in
mind?”</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Leach
smiled, a sad fraction-of-a-second smile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“Don’t
worry about me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just run when I
give the word.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Run out of here and
don’t look back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Do you
understand?”</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Leith
scowled, but was silent.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Leach
walked slowly to the door, and smiled at Leith one last time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>“I will find you again, brother,” he whispered, and gave a mirthful
little wink.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With those words, he
closed his eyes, and his image shimmered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Leith
found himself staring, for a wordless moment, at a mirror image of himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was as if they stared at each other for a lifetime – and then Leach
was out the door, Leith crying “No!” – but a moment too late.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">He
heard only the sound of Leach running, and the screaming of a furious crowd in
pursuit.</font></p>

moment later the street was empty.</font></p>

but I refuse to give up hope that somehow, through your resourcefulness, you
made it out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There’s so much I
still want to ask you, so much to tell you, so much we want to thank you for.</font></p>

need this delivered,” Leithreas instructed, “care of the Enchanter’s Guild
of Neriak, to Leachreas Afterglow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Can
you send this?”</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">“Of
course,” the young bard replied, shifting the weight of his lute on his
shoulder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“Trust me… he will
get this letter.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As the bard
walked away, he winked slyly at Leithreas, and departed swiftly around the
corner.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Leithreas
pondered the strangely familiar wink for a moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>“Wait a minute,” he said to himself as he turned to examine the young
human more closely, but the man had already disappeared.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>All Leithreas could see was the man’s shadow around the corner, a shape
that was drawn long in the evening light.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:135.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">A
shape that shimmered and changed for a moment before it disappeared into the
distance.</font></p>
