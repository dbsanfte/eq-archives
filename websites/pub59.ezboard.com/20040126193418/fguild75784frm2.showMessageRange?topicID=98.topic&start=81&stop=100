&quot;Flood GM's with petitions&quot;<br>
<br>
Maybe I should have said dont petition GMS for accuracy but the point is flooding the GMs doesnto help.  This is not their decision.  They cant make that change.  You are making it impossible for them to do there jobs, like retrieving bugged corpses and such.  All I am trying to say here is that the GMs are not at fault, nor are they the ones who can change things for you.  <br>
<br>
Something else for everyone to think about.  If you do email/petition Verant be ready for them to nerf or do away with cleric epics.  That is one of their standard responses. (rubicite) <p><FONT COLOR="green" FACE="forte" size="6point" >Myles Bonaduce</FONT> <P>

At least then, people with urgent petitions for lost corpses and such won't be made to suffer (more than they already are, that is.)<br>
<br>
As for Arirang, I'm sure there are some decent kind people in that guild, but sadly, they will have to deal with the consequences of what the bad apples have done.  The RN community, while not fully endorsing the list, DOES recognize camping, and simple courtesy/consideration for fellow players' time.  <br>
<br>
There may have been only 2 people in PA still alive, but that log was slanted to exclude what other non-PA people were in the zone helping them, so we cannot judge if a wipe was a foregone conclusion.  How many times has an epic-questor died but the epic mob dies, and then the questor gets rezzed in to loot?  MANY times, it's not uncommon. <br>

I'm glad Erkild got Rage the next time around. Grats Erk!<br>

Ragefire KSed.</span><hr size=1> One of my officer's put it best offer services to Arirang members only if they will go anon, thus removing thier Guild Tag while you give such services.  At least until Arirang proves the the Rodcet Nife community they are serious about changing peoples opinions about their guild.  If they continue to believe the actions taken on RF were tactics and and camps are to be only partially honored instead of assisting or leaving a camp, then we should continue to press this issue with their membership by making them temporarily remove thier colors (ie Guild Tag).<br>
<br>
I will still need to discuss this with my officers before I make this guild policy.  <br>
<br>
Personally though I dont think I will change my opinion on this subject until I see some postitive gestures on Arirang's part.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> This &quot;List&quot; that people keep referring to is moronic. A few people got together and made a list. Yeah,I know who's idea it was and I know who wrote the rules also.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The list is not moronic, but you are entitled to your opinion, as we all are.  Yes it was originated by a small group of clerics, but it was needed at the time.  It is a damn sight better to try and get along and help one another, than it is to hurt your fellow players with disrespect and untrust!  So I am now donned the Commie ragefire cleric, now ask me if I truely care?  We had a vision to work with one another, and to forge new friendships, and we DID just that....the list has seen 20+ clerics get their epics now and we are damn proud to know that we have taken a horrid camp and made it better for the clerics, as far as future relations are concerned. <br>
<br>
You do know whos idea it was, and who wrote the rules?  BTW, hiya kiddo, but ummm, yer wrong if you think your following statement is correct...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Remember that your &quot;Rules&quot; were written by a Necromancer.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually they were not, they were written by a cleric, and have been since revised by me once alone, and once with another cleric, who btw has a necro as well...<br>
<br>
I myself have personally written to VI everyday for over 2 months now, complaining that they effect a change to this freakin camp...I know a lot of ppl that have been doing the same thing.  VI is stuck on themselves and apparently will not place a change in effect that will be a postive change for our clerics. <br>
<br>
Helen did what she had to I am sure to keep her job.  It does not make ushappy, but we will abide by the decision made.  Btw, Helen is approving of the list even tho she can not uphold it, she speaks very highly of it.  Again I invite all the clerics of RN to come to this addy.... <br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub68.ezboard.com/bclericsofrodcetnife">pub68.ezboard.com/bclericsofrodcetnife</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
and help us effect a change to the rules/list.  We would like 1-2 clerics from each guild to enter into a discussion with the clerics of RN, for the clerics of RN, to try to make an amicable solution to this unbareable camp. <br>
<br>
Rather then put it down, and whine and complain about it, plz feel free to send your clerics to this board and lets discuss some changes.  No the list is not the best thing going, but it is an attempt to gather our wits about us and make a bad situation better.  Bring your balls and female parts <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->        and lets talk about it so that it may become something that &quot;we, the clerics of RN&quot; can be proud of.<br>
<br>
As far as that other guild, who I do not call by their proper name usually, but will here out of respect, tho they do not deserve it, I will never rez, buff, sow or port them anywhere.  Any guild that does not stop members from hurting others condons their behaiver.  I may be but just one person, but Arirang will get no kind of support from myself or my friends.  Does Arirang care?  Probably not, but then again, neither do I.  What happened in SF was a disgrace, unhonorable, and totally uncalled for.  That cleric whom you deceided didn't have the force to take down Rage had been camping him for a long time, you really should have backed off.  That is just my opinion tho.  Even if yo do not beleive it, I am positive that PA had enough ppl to take that spawn, as all of the clerics on the list have the support of at least 100 ppl at all times.  Shame on you, the members of Arirang that showed no honor whatsoever!!!   Aye what goes around does come around.  One thing tho, you will never find a member of TA training, curseing, or throwing racial slurs around, and tho you did wrong, whoever did that crap to your lower members should have their fingers tied together.<br>
<br>
Lastly, we are all good ppl on the list, we are not COMMIES, nor are we idiots with a small vision.  I have alrdy admitted that the list was nearsighted, I have thrown out an invitation for the clerics of every guild on RN to come to the addy I posted.  Come and help us all help all the clerics of RN.  Let our server be a leader and not a follower who blindly goes on the word of the way VI says it has to be.<br>

<br>
There is something to be said for a guild being able to accompliush epic battles. Sure its great and all that theres this cooperative warm fuzzy share-the-wealth thing going on but quite simply there are people that have no damn business having a weapon so powerful.<br>
<br>
Yes, you can do the turn in's at level 50. This does not ENTITLE you to an epic weapon at level 50. There are clerics out there that are or were part of guilds that couldn't do ragefire so they've waited patiently and strived for a goal to defeat this shit of a spawn. THESE are the people that should have their epics not some lvl 50-52 who had it handed to them because of some &quot;this is the way it is&quot; list.<br>
<br>
Nice people on the list ? Maybe at one time they were nice people but I've seen some shit said that just makes them as despicable as the people they would whine about last year.<br>
So this might not be a communist thing, maybe just an angry mob mentality.<br>
<br>
This list WASN'T made available to everyone now it is a MONOPOLIZED spawn. Patient, hard working people who tried to advance themselves and/or their guilds now are being told that they don't have a shot for whatever duration it takes to get a spot. Bullshit. Adira got her Epic at what ? 59 ? 60 ?<br>
You want to make a useful list ? Make one that recognizes time spent on Clerics, all those pre-no hell level clerics. All those clerics that spent years getting through level after level bettering themselves.<br>
<br>
Cleric list at 50 ? Hell no. People still quit at 51-53 because its too damn tough. Start your list at 58-59. Seniority should stand for something.<br>
<br>
As for my references. YOU are the one that told me it was a Necro that wrote that pile, I didn't make that up.<br>
So what if he has a cleric, at that rate...I have 3.<br>

Actually had you listened to me, I said that a cleric made the original list, I revised it once alone, I then revised it with Thom/Mez, who is a cleric/nec, and he put it into his own words....guess I do not speak or spell eloquently(sp) enough.  I am too tired to argue anymore, if you like to fashion me a commie, so be it!  I will still fashion you a friend untill the time comes that you tell me to my face we are not friends any longer.  <br>

Btw grouch, you are the only one that could actually get away with calling me that, and still be able to discuss shit with me, anyone else would go on ignore for the stupidity of the name in the first place. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center>

<br>
I had my 14 bard parked in Oasis to check on Cazel from time to time, because we had a chanter in guild that needed him for his epic.  I took a break from Zorach to log on Leneras my bard, and lo, Cazel is up and at docks, so I Selo it to zone and bring back Zorach online and tell the guild he's up.  The guild responds and folks from other guilds in the AK alliance start arriving and with an alarming lack of organization, my guild leader at that time, Kolena begins using /ooc to call the troops together for some sort of focus, and to begin assigning groups since we had far too many people to kill him.  No sooner than we had established groups and began buffing, we receive word that Valde Amicitia had engaged Cazel, and by the time i made it to gypsies from docks, Cazel lay dead, 9 VA sitting down, filing their nails, playing poker, whatever.  Now, while there was nothing illegal about what VA did at that time, it still made us angry and upset that they KNEW we were planning Cazel and didn't let us have the chance.  Tough shit, they got him first and the best we could do was piss and moan about it, and to remember what happened, so we remembered.<br>
<br>
<br>
The next scenario involving the Aurora Knights alliance and VA happened in EJ versus Severilous, for the scale.  Again we had a throng of people (more than 50, if memory serves me) getting groups together and beginning buffs, when we get the word VA is getting ports to EJ and some are offering 200pp, so even a simple minded person could deduce they are aware Severilous is up and to get there pronto.  Next zone check tells me 11 VA in zone, 2 minutes later 17, and a shout goes out, &quot;who is the brewmasters raid leader plz?&quot; to which Abrahms replies and he and the representative from VA begin to discuss the matter, arriving at the following agreement:<br>
VA wanted Severilous for a guildmates epic, but since the alliance was there first, VA agreed to give us a fair shot at the dragon before they engaged.  Woulda been nice if they abided by that decision, and as it turns out, VA did strictly adhere to the agreement without question...it went down a little something like this...Abrahms led the charge above the staircase in the direction of the dragon and we engaged.  10 of us died in the opening 30 seconds of the fight, the remainder of us, except maybe 5 couldn't shake dragon roar and were feared off or stunned and fed to the mobs that aggro from the proximity of it.  Myself, i clicked melee attack and never landed a single hit on Sev..at no time during the entire event did my faction lower from &quot;Severilous looks upon you warmly -- what would you like your tombstone to say&quot; because when i got near, i ate dragon roar and ran off like a wuss.  Nonetheless, after the entire raid except me died, it was unanimously agreed that the dragon would be handed over to VA and Abrahms (from what he said in the chat channel) then sent tell to the VA representative giving them the green light, that Sev was all theirs...a moment of zonewide silence and 11 seconds later, Doraf shouts, GRATZ VA, signalling the defeat of the dragon.  Now thinking back to the Cazel incident, I never expected VA to wait, i figured they would steamroll and take over whenever the hell they wanted to, but they did not.  When they were handed the mob, they dispatched him with the greatest of ease but in no way even came close to AoE range until given the green light to do so.  There was one member of VA, Zipity who came up to us before we engaged, and i suspect he was there checking to see what we were going to do, when we charged, he withdrew into the shadows, and i know, because i lived thru the entire thing and after we wiped, i was killing mobs near the corpses so Doraf could rez us (which he had no real reason to do so, but out of kindness he rezzed them all, and told VA in /shouts to clear the yard trash that our team could loot our corpses without incurring second and third deaths.)<br>
<br>
THAT is how you take over a mob when someone wipes, there was nothing further we could do without wiping again and the entire time, VA waited till it was officially handed to them by our raid leader, AND they stayed off a remarkable distance to be doubly sure there was no appearance of impropriety.  You don't stand 20 feet away from their mob and say, &quot;we gunna rush the mob if they die&quot; cuz you damn well knew they would.  <br>
<br>
I noticed Airirang didn't do this the week before when Amttee was on the hill...and i think its' for the insanely obvious reason that eastern keep would not wipe against ragefire.  what came thru out of all this to me, is the amount of disrespect that those people from Arirang had regarding Phoenix Arise that they would stalk ragefire in this manner.  Another interesting sidenote...while this whole thing was happening, any guild who was capable, could have came thru and taken Talendor down while you all knew nothing of it...what i mean by that is, the focus of nearly EVERYONE in the zone Skyfire was on Ragefire and him alone.  So there shouldn't be this theory &quot;Arirang didn't set this up in advance&quot; because i don't believe that for a second.  What about the part of the log beginning with the words, &quot;you have entered Skyfire Mountains&quot;  ? <p><p align="center">[56 Knight] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=105849" target="_blank">Zorach</a>

<br>
Hell, most of you are in bed before they even log on. Even if your awake, let me tell you a secret. They don't care. Nothing you can do to them...<br>
<br>
What are you going to do when Ascent, Alliance or DA/EIE decides that one of their clerics is ready for there epic? Rush them? Beat them? Blacklist them? I doubt they have even heard of half the guilds on the list. <br>
<br>
Arirang is at the same level as those 3. Maybe if one or more of that group decided to blacklist them they might feel some pain, but other then that they'll never even notice it. Worse to worse they might get mad and try the same thing on your guild. <br>
<br>
Its like a little mom &amp; pop shop trying to beat Starbucks or Walmart or something. Threats will just get laughed at. You might think about a compromise though. Re-work the list so its not so sour and maybe it can survive. Otherwise its on life support waiting for the plug to be yanked out.<br>
<br>
A few ideas that might make it more tolerable.<br>
<br>
Limit it to 56-57+<br>
No unguilded.<br>
Have to be at the last step.<br>
No twink bots<br>
Limit it to like 10 or so people with new ones having a random chance to get on.<br>
<br>
Otherwise the list is dead. I doubt even some of the smaller guilds will be to happy to see some 51 unguilded clr waiting hours trying to mass people when they have a 58+ cleric who raids daily and would use it for their benefit daily.<br>
<br>
No other mob has a 12 month + waiting list. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=96131><B>Tilien Venator</a><BR>

1. List is bullshit.<br>

2. Tunare has twice the people RN has, and they get by just fine with the RF camp.<br>
<br>
On a related note, the only real experience I've had with Airrang is: was grouped with an Airrang Monk once in Velks, US to be exact. Frenzied spawned, SCHW dropped, we all rolled, Monk one. I was the ML, so I try handing them to her. What happens? I get the Lore message. I tell her &quot;Err. You've already got SCHWs&quot;, she replies with &quot;nono i don't&quot;, so I try it once again, same message. Then I get the bright idea to inspect her, and she's actually wearing the damn things.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Err. You've got Silver Chiten Hand Wraps on, dear.&quot;, she replies with &quot;nono i have fungi on&quot;. <br>
<br>
&quot;No, look at your hand slot. You have Silver Chiten Hand Wraps on&quot;. &quot;NONO you are steel my loot&quot;<br>
<br>
Not only that, but she starts trying to  complain to the group that I am &quot;steeling her loot&quot;. Of course the group was just laughing at her, but it was the point of how idiotic could a person actually get?<br>
<br>
That right there was enough for me to draw a conclusion for an entire guild. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/umatiltrynstum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Matil Trynstum</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cons Threateningly </span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#333333>(6/5/02 11:53 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.cox.net/matil/matil.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A sad day for Rodcet nife. Ragefire KSed.</span><hr size=1> Similiar to Plato's &quot;Republic&quot; or Marx's &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot;, &quot;The Cleric List&quot; is a great idea in theory.  The downfall is that it depends on people to maintain it.  Human beings, being what they are, fall short of the theories laid out.  When the epic weapons were introduced, it was stated that not everyone would be able to complete their epics.  Well over a year later people seem to believe they have a right to have it.  Essentially there is one difficult part to the cleric epic, and it is getting the mob itself that is really the hard part.  I look at the walk throughs for Warrior, Wizard, Mage, Necro epic and find it hard to feel sorry for a cleric having to do Rage.  Now, if the dragon is KS'd the cleric does not have to start completly over.  You no longer have to sit in a remote part of a dungeon depending on your guild/friends to clear giants out 2 or 3 times a day.  The weapon is entering the game at the same rate as before.  If, and it is an if from what I have seen, the dragon was KS'd (defined as engaging the mob after a party had the mob aggro'd and engaged) then there is an issue.  If the dragon was not engaged then there is no issue.  Period. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=76592"> Matil Trynstum

<br>
But with such a long spawn time, so many people waiting on it, the conditions in which it was started, and the incredible value of the item - it can't work.<br>
<br>
You can't expect a level 60 cleric who didn't hear about the list for a few weeks to meekly sit in place in 47th place behind a few twinks or semi inactive people. He might do it, but he is in no way a bad individual if he doesn't. <br>
<br>
We all know the flaws. It the current conditions, Ragefire is a FFA spawn, still subject to the rules of engagement - like everything else in the game. <br>
<br>
I don't understand why people are doing this camp. It's everything that's bad around the game crammed together: Greed, sitting around doing nothing and bored, obsessive, LONG and just generally unfun. <br>
<br>
No item in the game is worth going through all this shit.<br>

#2.  The list.  Where to begin.  Let's start with a reality check.  If the cleric epic had just been introduced last patch, this list would be REALLY moot.  Why?  Because all the top end guilds would be farming them until they had a suitable number of epics.  All the way down the line.   Another reality check...these guilds are based around fast mobilization, thats basically what EQ boils down to if you're trying to increase the capability of your guild.  Where exactly would your list be racing multiple guilds that can all mobilize faster than you?<br>
