There's too much &quot;raid&quot; content (ie. massive numbers of players needed and only 6 of them will get any kind of experience out of it, usually, but not always, the group of mages/wizards because they can deal more damage in a short period of time).  Last night, a group of mine (Warrior, Druid, Cleric, Chanter, Bard, Monk) looked through as many 50+ grind zones as we could get to and think of... Chardok, raid and overcamped, Velks, overcamped (as usual, even now), Karnor's, experience sucks at 55+, Hole, camped and raid, Naggy's Lair, have to go too far in and none of us knew the way, the Warrior and Monk didn't have Luclin, Cazic, raid zone now, Planes, didn't have the kind of mindset to break them and hold it (or anybody that had been to them to the point to know them around like the back of their hand), Siren's, mobs too high HP in there, wasn't worth our time, can't get past sirens, nobody knew the way and no succor/evac, Seb, overcamped and the druid said &quot;You go without me then&quot; and we decided against it... even I don't like it, too many trains to zone in and only I had an HS key *sigh*<br>
<br>
Eventually ended up in Ill Omen playing with fishes for the corrupted barracuda for the druid epic which never spawned.  Pretty sad when you spend 4 hours running around finding a place to get some experience and it's all either taken or not worth it.<br>
<br>
Pre-Luclin, any other &quot;grind zones&quot; I'm missing here?  Even with Luclin, you get pretty limited on who's got &quot;goods under the hood&quot; (ie. good hardware), but your options are almost limited to solely 2 at 55... Fungus Grove and Maiden's Eye (unless you like faction hits - Sanctus Seru guards are OK, but we were thinking in general) - The Grey is too long to run to when you have to EB half the group when you get there, so I'm kind of running out of options here.<br>
<br>
Reason I don't like raiding... standing there for hours on end with nothing to do and probably get nothing out of it besides lost experience due to dying so much... I'm better off trying to find a group.  As a bard, 90% of the time, your stuck standing there with mana going or maybe throwing a resist song (can't be 2, they don't stack) or Occlusion in the mix too and you can't normally go up and melee the mob as you go out of range for the songs to take effect on the casters and such (which a lot of bards don't take into effect).  That... and even after turning Luclin models off, spell effects off, names off, etc, you can still get some pretty nasty lag... client side no less.<br>
<br>
I don't think I'm really &quot;burnt out&quot;... just bored with nothing left to do.  Neither my bard, shaman, druid or wizard can get a group, let alone a raid to break up the monotony of grinding all the time... at all unless it's a friend of mine or something asking, which is a different story, but that's it.<br>
<br>
Granted, I've gotten quite a few tells about guilds from my previous post, but since almost all of them are raid-centric anymore, I'll take my interests elsewhere. <p>[56 Troubadour] <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=33907 target=_blank>Singhawk Stormbringer</a><br>

That... and the group I was with at the time which was a really good group had we found somewhere... 2 of the 6 didn't have Luclin... and that was the warrior and monk, so we had no choice unless we tried shouting for one wherever we went and since we had them already, didn't want to bother. <p>[21 Shaman] <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=80537 target=_blank>Karaab Spiritcaller</a><br>

You have tons of places to find exp at any level in this game, SoL (pos if you ask me really) only made it more likey to get level 60.  Everywhere you look, everything is camped?  Be more adventurous then.  None of you knew the way through SG?  Well, hey theres something to do.  Go learn how to get through.  Oh and now since you did that with out evacing across, you can now get to ANOTHER zone (DN) that you can grind in for exp.  Thats just one example.  And this is just one example.<br>
<br>
If you bring your own group, you can find EXP in more places than you think.<br>
<br>
And if you dont want to do little things like, finding you way through a zone to get to another, thats great, less people i have to worry about in the zones i fight in sometimes.....FOR EXP. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ueqfoulwind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQFoulwind</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00bie</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#333333>(4/16/02 8:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=69.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://millennium.fortunecity.com/celesteville/649/oscar.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Everquest Overcamped ?</span><hr size=1> If you can't find a zone to grind in, you just aren't looking.<br>

There's been more than enough content added with Luclin and it's not raid material. Fungus Grove and Maiden's Eye are pitifully underused. The Deepshade and The Grey are the same way. Even Dawnshroud has Rockhoppers that are Light blue to 57. Acrylia Caverns is another viable option.<br>
Umbral Plains is a nice spot, plenty there to kill and Disturbed Elysians don't summon, they just have 15k hp.<br>
<br>
Kunark ? <br>
Go to Traks Teeth or Emerald Jungle, plenty to kill there. Hunter / Forager spawn still blue at 57, there's xp and good drops too. Karnors Castle, Sebilis, Howling Stones and Veeshan's Peak. Skyfire for Spells, Burning woods for spells and gems, Chardok as well. Bloodgills in Ill Omen will get you to 55 easy also.<br>
<br>
Velious ?<br>
Truthfully Velks IS overcamped. However there are Sentient Suits in Wakening Lands, zone in dwarves in Icewell Keep, plenty of blue mobs in Western Wastes. Sirens Grotto is never too busy. Otters in Cobalt Scar are still blue at 57 and decent xp as well. Skyshrine is a horribly underused zone, bring a group to Wyvern Gate and kill all day and all night for great xp and loot. RyGorr Elites in East Wastes are still blue as well, loot sucks but they're there.<br>
<br>
Old World ?<br>
Well, theres SolB, Giants in Perma, Lower Guk, The Hole, and Kedge Keep. For the brave at heart, there's Cazic Thule.<br>
Feeling really brave ? Get a group together and go grind in Hate.<br>
<br>
All you need is a group and themotivatoin to get there. There's plenty to do. Sometiems getting to the camp is half the fun.<br>

Course I guess at that level maybe.. I just have flashbacks to doing hate when the max level was 50. Grinding in hate was inconcievable, and with one group a joke. =) My how times have changed.<br>
<br>
Of your oringinal list, I would have to agree that the only place old world that you missed would be Permafrost. (which another poster mentioned) There are some nice giants inside, and not much of a maze to find. (esp compared to SolB) In addition, there are the polar bears in the pits, which I would imagine still give you exp at 55.. They are some nasty bears.<br>
<br>
If this is a regular group you get together with, I would suggest going to eqmaps.com and investing some printer paper and some time in getting some maps, so you can find your way around. Also there is something to be said for the &quot;experience&quot; of going somewhere new. Sure... there may be little EXP in learning where not to sit, or pull to, but there is experience gained.<br>
<br>
EQ is in a sad state of affairs, when people dont want to do adventuring anymore. (i am not referring to the original poster here... dont take this as a flame) The blasted LOIO/OT/DL/KC/SEB phenomenon of progression has created a distinctly different gamer. You can tell the ones who came in post Kunark. They are the ones in your group or guild who whine when they die, and wont take less than a clicky res. They are the ones who insist on being in the KS group on a raid. The first question out of their mouths when it is suggested that they explore a new zone is &quot;Will I get XP? What drops for me?&quot; The LOIO/OT/DL/KC/SEB gamer is too used to easy exp, easy loot with little threat. Kudos to those hearty adventurers who do something because THEY have not done it. (they are not nessecarily the first, just their first) I myself am one of those adventurous types. I think I have died in every zone I have been to.. Just trying new stuff...<br>
<br>
Keep on adventuring!<br>

Which is part of the problem overall with EQ... everything after 51 takes too much time, casual players get &quot;weeded out&quot;.  That night 4 of us had all of maybe 2-3 hours, not really enough time to &quot;go adventuring&quot;, had we had the time, probably would have. <p>[21 Shaman] <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=80537 target=_blank>Karaab Spiritcaller</a> (Vah Shir)<br>

I know that ya dont like them and are worried about dieing heck i am too  but i see it this way nothing ventured nothing gained. I have made 4 lvls since last we grouped together and that was not all that long ago. Heck this game is not called everquest for nothing. start doing some, take the bla za out of it and have a bit more fun. go grind at the akeava zone (sp) in or the zone to U.P. both are great grind spots and some pretty fat loot. <br>
