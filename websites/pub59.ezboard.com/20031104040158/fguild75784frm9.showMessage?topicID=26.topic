I just didn't feel like writing a post for every board <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  /hug copy+past)<br>
<br>
I started playing in ~September, 1999. I had just upgraded my computer (P2 -- ~300mhz ... yes yes /drool I know) and I figured I would go out and buy a game to celebrate. This was way before I went off to college so in between drinking (illegally at the time), highschool (big joke), and parties I would play video games. A way to relax.<br>
<br>
I originally wanted to buy an Ultima game. I heared they were cool, but now knowing anything about Ultima (Lord British sounded like a fairie to me), I saw Everquest sitting on the shelf. Looked good. Bought it, thinking it was a 1 player RPG. Boy was I wrong.<br>
<br>
Installed -- Realized it was only online. Ok great, this will be awsome! My first impression was a wonderfull 5 hour patch. But, I kept telling myself &quot;Live in a virtual world as an elf! woot!&quot;, so I stuck with the initial patch.<br>
<br>
Logged in, made a Warrior who started in Qeynos. Ran around, got lost, tried making RL conversations with NPC's... <br>
<br>
Then I made a bard. Kilyan. Got him to lvl 8 (this made me feel uber btw). His leather armor and songs were great! Ran him to HHK, got lost, died. <br>
<br>
I forgot corpses decay, lost his gear (all 10pp worth), and made a Paladin. Finamin.<br>
<br>
Well, he didn't get too far (@#%$ paladins)<br>
<br>
Then, along comes Auvdar. I found the port spells alluring.<br>
<br>
I found my home server too. Well, ok, this was the server that I actually wrote the name down on a piece of paper so I would remember. Rodcent Nife.<br>
<br>
I got Auvdar to level 10, and found my first guild! House of Honor. I thought they were insane! They invited me to a Unrest raid, and I was like &quot;That would be sweet, but I think im too young to do that&quot;. So, I stayed behind.<br>
<br>
I took some time in HoH, got to know some members, but unfortunatly I left. I couldn't keep up with them, and I didn't feel it right for me to stay (Although I thought they were great). HoH became Council of Honor (Or something like that), and after that I dont know. They beame quasi-uber, falled, &lt;shrug&gt;<br>
<br>
I, however, had a good run in with a Human druid named Fractus. I helped him with a trade, he thought I was trustworthy ( or so he said) , and invited me into his guild Drunken Fishermen.<br>
<br>
This is where things go good , and bad. First, DF has to be one of the best guilds I have ever, ever, ever been in. They are laid back, fun, and bring out everything I ever wanted in EQ. <br>
<br>
I was still pretty immature back then, and I always jumped the gun on the littlest things. After making some good friends, I decided to RP Auvdar a little bit. What the hell right? I married a Human Enchater named Laena, and that was fun. She left EQ. Then, I met Darisa. She was around my age in RL, was extremely nice to me, and was always there to give me encouragement when I needed it. But, more on her later...<br>
<br>
I became a officer of DF, got kicked out of DF (missunderstanding, rash tempers, take your pick. I'm still sorry about everything I did Fractus!) Then my alt necro, Valdamir, got invited back into  DF as an officer by Darisa (who got leadership by either Fractus or Zaltag, I forget who. That whole thing is a different story that no one needs to know about).<br>
<br>
I become a raid officer. Tried to get DF into shape. Got tired of my necro and was more or less getting bored with EQ.<br>
<br>
Auvdar, still being guildless, got a invite to EoD (yes, the horrid Emissaries of Dread now on Antonius Bayle). It was fun. It was my first real *uber* experience if you consider raiding SkyShrine uber.<br>
<br>
@#%$ happened in a Hate raid, Majouth's ego was hurt, he goes off in a rampage, and I told him to &quot;@#%$ off you German nazi&quot; and /guildremoved (Litterally, those were my exact words)<br>
<br>
Then, along comes the move to Anotnius Bayle! I figure, Im a casual player, peak times for me would be late night for them which means more camps! yay yay. It turned out for the best in my eyes. I could solo, and could group with a few people I met.<br>
<br>
I then join a newly formed guild called &quot;Valorous Stormguard&quot; led by, who else, AB's jackass Paladin Diemetri <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  &lt;3<br>
<br>
I again got tired of EQ, left V-Storm as we called it (After leading a successfull Efreety raid, OMG that was so uber! tee~), and began to go solo again.<br>
<br>
Joined Avatars of Fire, didn't fit in, Taurus was a dumbshit, got kicked/ was about to remove myself. Lets forget about the whole AoF thing.<br>
<br>
That pretty much brings me up to now. I VERY slowly leveled, but managed to do ok. Got 1 charector to level 60, but unfortunatly Auvdar stayed at 54/55 (Yes, almost 4 years of play, ~200 days clocked, and only 55).<br>
<br>
So now, it's time to say my good-byes. To everyone. Everyone who has ment something to me over the years. I'll split this by server.<br>
<br>
********<br>
Rodcet Nife<br>
********<br>
<br>
Sinaj -- The druid of my first guild, HoH. I looked up to you. Ever since I saw you in Wolf Form camping the guard for the Testiment of Vanear quest, I always wanted to be like you. I doubt you play anymore, but still, I wish you the best.<br>
<br>
Corona -- Thank you for the port. You really helped me out of a jam <br>
<br>
Fractus -- We had our good times, our bad times. You were always like a big brother to me, and I betrayed you in a lot of ways. To that I'm sorry. I really hope things are going good for you in RL.<br>
<br>
Zaltag -- Bringer of the &quot;MONKEY&quot;. I'll never forget you. Ever<br>
<br>
Cilren -- You little @#%$ gnome warrior. I loved your antics, even though you were a deceitfull bastard. I will miss you.<br>
<br>
Madmmiller -- You were just all-around fun. <br>
<br>
Laena -- Well, I didn't know you well and you were a RP bride. It was fun, and you were great. I hope things are well with in you in RL!<br>
<br>
Darisa -- Now, I hate putting you down at the bottom of the list but I'm doing it for sake of order. There is just so much about you that I cared about, I can't sum it up in 1 little paragraph. Ill put a little section just for you at the end of my post <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
All the Drunken Fishermen -- I love you all, believe it or not!<br>
<br>
******<br>
Antonius Bayle<br>
******<br>
<br>
Majouth -- I think the best way to sum you up is Furor without any skill. You demand everything from your guild, your an @#%$ to others, but your too dumb to realize your a @#%$. Your very indifferent to me. I like you, but I hate you. I really hope everything is going ok for you though, and ignore all the critisizm everyone gives. Its a game afterall<br>
<br>
Diemetri -- You are the BIGGEST BONER I have met on Antonius Bayle. I like you though, and don't forget that. And yes, 98.32% of the server hates you, but still, I think your l33t! &lt;3 <br>
<br>
Sean -- Love you~! Buy me some beer when before you come home kay? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And a multitude of others (Too much for me to remember each and every one of you. That or you just werent important to me :P kidding! )<br>
<br>
<br>
But, all you people are the most important to my EQ life. You are the ones that stick out in my head. And I will never forget any of the memories you gave me.<br>
<br>
And now, for the hard stuff. Auvdar is deleted. He is no more. The account is cancelled, and he will NOT be coming back. He retired at level 55, and that is where he will stay.... and for that, I will stamp (finally)<br>
<br>
Auvdar Oakenmist (re-@#%$-tired!)<br>
55'th preserver of Tunare<br>
Guild-hopper<br>
Jackass<br>
Crazy<br>
Wood-Elf<br>
<br>
*Darisa* <br>
<br>
I told you I would give you your own section. Kinda dumb seeing as how you will probably never see it. Where do I start with you?<br>
<br>
You have always, always, been there when I needed you. My bestfriend died, and you were RIGHT there by my side giving your fullest support. Although I never met you (although I saw your picture, and talked to you once), you always felt like my best friend. I could tell you anything.<br>
<br>
Back when my life was a @#%$-hole (When all I wanted was to be a lawyer *yarg* ) you were the only person outside my family who really brought a smile to my face.<br>
<br>
I remember me and you were in the Freeport Arena. We were dicking around, and I got you to negative health. So I would 10pt heal you, and smack you with my club or burn you with my lowest nuke to knock you out again. For some odd reason, that made me bust out laughing.<br>
<br>
When me and you RPed a marriage (Yes, I was a in-game whore), it made me feel outstanding. It sounds dumb, but that fact someone like you would even fake something like that to me made me feel like I was Jesus. It ment so much to me that you were always there, that the day you left EQ and I stopped talking to you regularly I litterally cried a tear or two (No joke, sounds gay doesnt it).<br>
<br>
I tried to keep in touch with you over IM. It worked, we had our laughs and our conversations. But, recently, you havent been around. I missed you, but I did move on (Im not a loser IRL, really im not).<br>
<br>
Every word you said touched me, and for that, and that alone, I thank you. I don't want us to drift apart in our friendship, but if that happens  its ok. <br>
<br>
But, you really did seem like my best friend for a long time. You were the only person who I actually wanted to meet in RL. I wanted to meet there girl behind Darisa (yes I know your name, but I wont make it public), I wanted to shake your hand, no, I wanted to give you a big hug as a thank you for all the help you've given me.<br>
<br>
But, I'm rambling. It's late, and I need to get to bed.<br>
<br>
Thank you again, Darisa. Thank you not from Auvdar, but from Loren. If you ever feel like getting in touch, I will give you my cell# so you can call me. My email changed from hotmail to earthlink (Mavrik3050@earthlink.net) so you can always write me there.<br>
