Recently Chami (head of the list) was hurt.  Melissa (the person accused of KSing Ragefire) has been hurt as well.<br>
<br>
Perhaps we need to ask a completely different question:<br>
<br>
1)  Does Verant INTEND that only SOME clerics will have their epic?<br>
<br>
I think the answer is yes.<br>
<br>
Now the question is:  WHO gets their epic and WHO does not.  This depends entirely on us.  All things being equal, those guilds with enough force to take Rage will end up being the guilds that have epic clerics.  That said, some clerics on Rodcet have created a list.  Contrary to some beliefs, this favors the smaller guilds.  They can be at the top of the list someday, and CLIAM rights, theoretically precluding the mighty from simply taking it.<br>
<br>
I don't agree with the list as it stands.  It is a scheme wherein all the clerics that will ever get their epic are on the front of the list - and noone else would ever get it.  The current waiting list is over a year.<br>
<br>
I also don't think Verant HAS to fix anything.  If they only want some clerics to be epic, so be it.<br>
<br>
So... what to do?  I think rage needs to be set back to what every other mob is... you get there first, you camp, you agro.  If someone adds too much structure to the &quot;who is next up on the hill&quot; then FFA will, and HAS TO happen.  A list can only work if supply will equal demand in a timely fashion.  That is not the case.  Plain and simple, only some clerics can have their EPIC as it is programmed today.  Let that be governed like any other MOB.<br>
<br>
This is a change in my personal opinion, but I have listened to both sides and I have concluded that the list is disfunctional, and can never win support server wide. <p><b><i><font face="Garamond"><font color="#993366"><font size=+2>

Hmm, never know...<br>
<br>
First off, I just want to say that I do not support the list, I never have. But, I have always respected it and I intend to do so. I have helped a few people kill Ragefire and I will continue to do so if needed/asked.<br>
Also, these views are my own, not the official stance of my guild (Cascade Point). The stance of my guild is it's own and should not included in any way in this post.<br>
<br>
The biggest flaw I see with the list is that the people who benefited from it most were the people who created it. Those are the people who have their epic now. People who chased others away from SF because they were 'not on the list' although they didn't even know about it. So the list was something that a small part of Rodcet forced others to tag along on. If the list was to have been made fairly then every single cleric on Rodcet should have been asked if they agreed on it. And, if the answer was yes, then everyone should have been in a lotto to see who got the first shot at Rage. This is the first fatal flaw in the list.<br>
Second, the list cannot work with the number of people that are on it. EQ wont be around long enough for all these people to get their epic. There just isn't time. And anyone making a cleric today would not have a prayer to get their epic ever, if everyone should follow the list. Of course, VI (Verant Interactive) takes a major share of blame in this since they wont allow everyone who wants to, to get an epic. This is true about all the epics, the cleric one is just the one who most people want to get and it cannot be done.<br>
Take the rogue epic for instance. It 'could' be possible for 500 people to complete it in a row. All you need to do is to spawn the general often enough. You can't do that with Ragefire.<br>
Ragefire just doesn't support any kind of list system as it will always be unfair to someone. But then again, FFA (free for all) doesn't work either since that will also be unfair to a lot of people. FFA will work best for the cleric who has 5 manaburn wizards and thus gets killshot. <br>
The only way to make the cleric epic any fair is to change it so that more people have access to it, a thing which VI has said they will not do.<br>
As I see it there is no 'right' way to deal with Ragefire and the cleric epic at the moment. It just can't be done. What ever people try to do someone will be against it. We are just too different to be able to agree on a matter like this. Of course, this difference is the same that makes so many of us enjoy this world of Norrath, it is what drives us to find new friends and new adventures and why we keep coming back. <br>
<br>
But in the end I hope that we can all at least agree on one thing... Ragefire sucks in a quite majorly way indeed.<br>

HOWEVER, I do not understand how it can possibly survive.  If I was a cleric that had just reached the 50s, and I was expected to wait for 111 other people to get their epics before I got mine.....  Hah!  There is no way I would agree to wait a year.  I'm sorry, but I think that is a lot to ask someone to sign their name to the bottom of the list.  I guess the list is the best thing that can be done under the circumstances....<br>
<br>
I think Verant really needs to think about another way of limiting the cleric epic.  Creating a bottleneck that creates a list that long is ridiculous.  To me, the answer seems obvious:  find a way to make the quest a LOT harder.  That's all.  <br>
<br>
Just wanted to say something about this issue that everyone and their mother has already said something about.  <br>

I'd love to have the rez, but if that is what they want to limit, make it a 2 part quest.<br>
<br>
Part one: do everything else for the current quest. Turn in the items. Get an intermediate weapon, with the stats and saves (or maybe 1 or two less of each), but with a clickable no-component symbol spell, or even a no mana heroic bond.<br>
<br>
Part two, kill rage, turn in the heart and the weapon, get the rez stick.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think it sucks that there are so few decent cleric weapons, prior to the epic. A lot of people go straight from dark embers, or paw of opalla, to the epic. <br>
<br>
Then clerics could do the first part of the epic, and have a decent weapon. If they then choose to, they can bother with ragefire, for the rez stick.<br>
<br>
Even druids have better pre-epic weapons, than most available to clerics. I have seen a 12/24 +10 wis (and other stats) druid scimitar, that isn't all that expensive. I think if Verant had any sense, they would put some stuff like that in the game for clerics.<br>

While I agree that there should be some sort of lesser weapon on the way to the Cleric epic. (Damn near every class get's some sort of &quot;Im doing my epic&quot; item. Monks with the robes, Druids get a scimmy, etc etc) I think giving it a clickable effect as well would be a bit much.<br>
<br>
This is completly a &quot;what if&quot; situation though. <br>

That is the way it is. For some classes they are even useful. However the desperate *NEED* for cleric epic weapons is not propogated by them but by YOU. I have several cleric friends whom I am very close to. I have gotten tells from all of them at one point or another &quot;I just got kicked out of such and such group for a 51 cleric with their epic&quot;. So you take a lesser cleric in a better guild for a better (or faster) rez that you are sure to need taking a 51 cleric with little experience to your camp over a 55-58 cleric who was busy learning to be a cleric instead of a dwagon camper. So the lesson we teach our clerics is you are useless to me without a 56 rez. Said cleric get's 56 and now they cannot rez fast enough. Skill is clericing is apparently worthless, it's how fast can you rez me after that lack of skill becomes apparent. So Nuggruk and you other fools can scream and cry all you want about Rage being KS'd. It would not be an issue if jackasses like you actually gave a @#%$ about the clerics themselves, and not their rezzing toy. There would be no talk of ruined marriages and all that BS if you considered the cleric type people for who they are and not what they have. <br>

Yeah, thing is, its a drop off a lvl 60 mob, in a really tough zone, and it's no drop. Plus it's not off Radir, its off the Spirit of Radir, which means you have to kill 2 lvl 60 mobs, and HOPE they have it.<br>

The druid weapon I mentioned is droppable, and sells for a few K in EC. Not quite the same thing. Look, a melee can buy a droppable weapon, with awesome melee stats (their biggest concern), and either AC or saves. Int casters can get very nice held items for both hands, relatively cheaply.

it's still easier than getting epic.<br>

radir is easy, so is his spirit, i've killed them before with 1 group... and the group only had 2 60 members. it takes a little time, and a little while to learn where he is, how to pull, etc, but ya can't say there's nothing available. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/uzorach.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zorach</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#333333>(7/23/02 9:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=150.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rage aftermath</span><hr size=1> Well this has taken a slight drift into the stupid.

I think FFA would screw over a lot of people too though.   The most interesting support I've heard for making it FFA is that it will make the camp SO hostile and contentious between players that it will draw Verant's attention to the situation and maybe they'll finally do something about it.  Imagine what happens when Ragefire is like Lodizal and keep in mind that there would far more demand for Ragefire.  My like Lodi, it could be kited around until a sufficient force is brought in, but like Lodi people probably aren't going to respect one druid sitting there kiting it if they've got a force ready to kill it.  So they'll take it from the kiter.  The kiter's guild is also arriving and sees &quot;their&quot; mob getting taken, so they attack too.  It basically just becomes a KS fest.  That's a pretty painful way to draw verant's attention to it.  I still think it should in some way be like Ragefire in solb was for quite awhile before it was moved to skyfire.  The cleric who'd been there camping it the whole time got first crack at it.  The question is how you limit the number of people waiting behind them.<br>

What I was saying is that I would be happier if there were more other choices. YES, I would love to have a rez stick. Howeve,r it probably isn't going to happen. Therefore, I wish there were a few more alternatives. And, yes, one of the reasons I would like the epic is the Very nice stats and resists. I really don't give a rats hind end about melee stats, since anything I'd be meleeing would be running away, near dead. If I could have a weapon with nearly as much wis and saves as the Water sprinkler, I would be pretty happy. <br>
<br>
Oh, and BTW, the weapon from Luclin only has +2 to saves, so its really not even close. <p>Xaanru <br>

<br>
Answer: Yes, of course this is their intent. Earlier this year, their change to the RF part of the Cleric epic quest, VI has in fact greatly reduced the frequency of sprinklers entering the world. VI justified this change as &quot;reducing the bottleneck&quot; of the SolB RF camp. In reality they have created a monstrosity, which we know as &quot;the list&quot; today.<br>
<br>
<br>
Consider this; prior to the change there was no list per say. How can this be? What right does the cleric sitting in Naggy's Lair, clearing FG's every 7 hrs have to &quot;claim&quot; the RF camp?<br>
<br>
Simply put, it was understood that the cleric/guild putting the time in, keeping a force on standby to clear FG's had &quot;rights&quot; to the RF camp. They WORKED for it, they EARNED the right to &quot;camp&quot; RF!<br>
<br>
During my RF camp I had many discussions with GM's about &quot;who can claim the camp&quot; after me, &quot;I'm here now clearing FG's with my guild, I lead a Naggy raid to secure the camp, no one else is doing the work except for me and my guild etc&quot;. Their official view (as it is today) is &quot;there is NO list&quot;!  Does VI acknowledge the current RF &quot;list&quot;?. Perhaps, but they have turned a blind eye to the current dilemma.  <br>
<br>
I will guarantee you given the situation, (just as with Lodizal or any other mob) first person/guild to gain agro will win rights to the prize, regardless if poorcleric_111 was camping him for the past 5 days. Remember guys, there is really no &quot;list&quot; per say. At least not in VI's official view.<br>
<br>
VI's official take is this for RF and any other mob: &quot;First person/group/guild to have forces in place to attack the mob, and gain agro has rights to the kill&quot;<br>
<br>
My personal opinion, I do not recognize the list. It is a cop out. Why should the current RF spawn in Sky Fire be treated differently then any other mob in EQ?<br>
<br>
Lose the list, petition your GM (I have) to have VI change the cleric epic RF portion back to the old way, or something better this stupid SF spawn.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just my 2cp. GL to those on the &quot;list&quot;, you guys really do have it easy. So quit your belly aching. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
