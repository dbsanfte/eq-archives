Well I dont speak to Melissa being a good or bad person at all because frankly I dont know her.  (I am assuming Melissa is female in real life)  I cant say that I have ever grouped with her or had a conversation with her.  Without rereading my other posts I can only think of mentioning Melissa in the sense that I wasnt trying to tell her what to do.  I speak of Chami because I do know her.  (as much as you can know some one through an internet game anyway)  The reason behind me posting here was because from reading all of these thread I was getting the picture of Chami being the one to say the stupid things in the rage channel.  That people were at least lumping her in with htose remarks.  Getting back to the other side of the coin Melissa, because I dont know her it is not my place to speak for her.  I would say it is the place of Melissa or her own friends to do so if they saw the need for it.<br>
<br>
A more general answer is no it would not be fair to condemn Melissa as a horrible person for one action.  So if I ever have a chance to get to know her in game or through these boards, that is when I would really make my decision about her.  Granted neither of those 2 mediums are the best way to really know someone but it is all we have here.<br>

I was polite, and made it clear I was not busting on her at all, was just curious how it all turned out with her.  She totally ignored me.  I guess you can say that she did not immediately attack me, and you can also say that she may have been tired of the whole issue, but a simple response would have been better than none at all.  It makes you wonder what kind of person she is.<br>
<br>
I said in the past that her reputation would be adversely affected if she did the turn in.  This has proven to be true. I did not say it was fair, and to be honest, I can see both sides on this issue, especially in these circumstances.  Grats on your click stick, I hope it is all you need/want it to be.  I really do hope it doesn't ruin your rep, but this kind of thing can really spiral, and not always fairly.  I just wish it had not been Chami who got hosed.<br>

I clearly identified I was not askin for buffs, I had my RL wife's druid on and was buffing myself, and I clearly stated I was curious how it all came out, and that I was not trying to bust her chops.  I did not see it in her hand, so was curious.  She was talking to other folks in OOC, and moving around, so she was not AFK.  I am not saying this makes her a jerk, and though I did say it made me wonder, it was not conclusive proof.  I really thought I had made that post clear enough, sorry... <p>Kharne Bloodyhand <BR>

<br>
No it doesn't make me wonder what kind of person she is,, or anyone is for that matter just because they don't respond to a tell.  Especially from someone they obviously don't know.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, when very busy with tells, in guildchat, groupchat, or trying to run somewhere, or even get something done - I miss tells.<br>
<br>
Or I don't miss them, but tell myself  'ok, I'll answer that in just a second here'   then I forget.<br>
<br>
So someone didn't answer a tell - it happens.  I'm sure even you've done it.  And on top of it, with all the crap thats been going on lately, it just very well may be that she's tired of the whole thing<br>

But felt compelled to add my 2 cents. (In case anyone is counting who agrees with whom)<br>
<br>
Just from what I read in this post...<br>
<br>
Melissa screwed over Chami and the other clerics on the list above her. <br>
She knew it was wrong.<br>
She let herself &quot;justify&quot; it by looking at the list the same way a lawyer or politician does.<br>
I agree that Melissa would not be in the wrong if she was not on the list. By putting herself on the list she agreed to abide by the rules. <br>
<br>
I feel very badly for Chami. I get pissed when someone steals a camp I sat at for ten minutes, much less 2 weeks.<br>
<br>
Melissa above says she feels sorry for Chami and respects her. <br>
How does that make sense when she didn't even give her the respect to wait the 30 minutes to come back from LD as stated in the rules of &quot;the list&quot;? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/udalimur62.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dalimur62</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00bie</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(7/22/02 10:43:55 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: DA EiE take Ragefire 19th July 2002</span><hr size=1> [Fri Jul 19 02:42:35 2002] Ryee tells ragefire:3, 'and a shitty cleric to boot....I remember that when we were allied we had to answer the stupidest questions for her'<br>

                         server.&quot;<br>
<br>
How long have you been playing? That is one of the most false<br>
                         statements I've seen in a while.&quot;<br>
<br>
perhaps back in it's early days... I know that for quite some time before the spawn was changed though, the cleric who camped the FG's in solb and kept them cleared until ragefire popped got the camp.  MOST people were respectful enough not to mess with this setup.  <br>
<br>
Bottom line is that certain top tier guilds (EiE/DA at the least) want it to be a FFA spawn because they know that means they'll pretty much get it when they want it.  The fact that EiE hasn't gotten cleric epics since The List started has nothing to do with who will get epics if it's FFA.  It's going to be almost entirely the top handful of guilds and that's what they want.  Could they try to work out modifications to the list?  Yes.  Could they camp it alongside the list cleric for the 1 week plus that it takes so at least they have some leg to stand on when they go for the spawn?  Yes.  They instead declare FFA because they don't give a damn about respecting someone else's effort and enormous time commitment.  They'll take what they want and tell you to STFU if you say anything against it.  It's the reason people have a negative stereotype about uber guilders and they're just reinforcing it for us.  I'm not going to yell about blacklists and boycotts, but I personally will add EiE/DA alongside Arirang and not associate with them.  I'm sure they don't care and that's fine.<br>

Before Rage was moved to Skyfire, he was NOT FFA, there was always a cleric shouting in OOC “I’m camping Rage next after cleric_99 of Guild so-and-so!”  And even in the semi-support of the list, if another non-List cleric had sat alongside Chami all that time and gotten the kill, then I would not be outraged, it would be a perfectly respectable thing to do, because that person would have shown the same commitment to getting their epic that the List clerics did.  None of this “Swoop in at the last minute and screw the cleric who’s been camping for days” crap.<br>
<br>
Do I think that being required to camp a mob for days on end is SANE?  NO.  Let’s all /feedback and /petition Verant until they get sick of it, because I know we sure all are.<br>
<br>
Do I think that being required to camp a mob for days on end is necessary? Unfortunately, as the situation stands currently, yes.   Face it, there is camping in EQ<br>
<br>
Some naïve person suggested that clerics should just go on about their usual business and “check occasionally to see if RF was up” …umm, sure, you do that, but since there ARE people willing to put in the time to camp RF, you aren’t going to have much luck, because this current incident was a fluke/bad timing.  LD happened just after another cleric went for a short AFK (cleric #3 was not required to be there by the ‘rules’ so I don’t count that person) <br>
<br>
To those saying “Melissa is right because she TECHNICALLY followed the rules”   ???<br>

Umm, how about NO.  She put herself on the list and agreed to follow the rules, and then she didn’t follow the rules in full.  She was #8 and in all her happy cut and paste quotefest she CLAIMS she tried to contact clerics #1-3..but at no time has she claimed to have tried to contact clerics #4-7.<br>
<br>
It’s all too late now, apparently she has the epic.  May every click remind her of the pain she caused to a kind and decent person. <br>
<br>
ps:  EIE/DA/Ascent  no one seems to have said it yet, so even though I wasn’t there and didn’t participate in the chat channel, I apologize for the vulgarity and threats you were subjected to, that was all so unnecessary.  I don’t agree with your position in this matter, I think a list (or rotation might be a better word?) is possible if implemented correctly, but we can all be civil about this, and not resort to vulgarity, personal attacks, and such.<br>
<br>
For those who say a list/rotation won’t work…there are servers where it does work.  They reserve and rotate the planes, NtOv, Vox and Naggy (perhaps RF, I don’t know). Here is an example:<br>
<br>
Karana server: <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://http://kgc.igz.net/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro">Karana Guild Central</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://http://pub6.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds">Karana Council of Guilds</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Eldryc, someone I have never heard of before, is not going to associate with me over something that happened while I was asleep.  I am gonna go cry now.  While I am at it I will hoist another beer to toast Melissa's epic.  Not one of you has came up with any kind of explanation as to how this dragon is any different than any other dragon.  They are all FFA.  Trak, Serv, Gore etc..  And any other raid level encounter, for that matter.  Ssra, Akheva, NTOV first come gets the raid.  Ever see guildchat on a friday night?  &quot;What are we raiding&quot;  &quot;Nothing, everything is taken&quot; .  Ok.  I am gonna go post how Ascent/AOD/WOW/Arirang/Forsaken ALL are no good bastards for not letting us raid something, and I am also gonna blacklist them.  Please.  Why on earth should Melissa of MQ'd a damn thing?  If Chami had been not LD or not AFK or not whatever it was that she was, and said &quot;Hey, that's mah dwagon&quot; things would of been different.  Cleric # 1 says nothing.  Cleric #2 says nothing.  We kill Ragefire, Melissa gets her epic.  Gratz her.  I am sorry for Chami's wasted time and effort, but I am not sorry for loot she did or did not get.  The list has failed.  It's rules are not enough to take care of situations like this.  Did Melissa take advantage of a situation?  Maybe.  A lot of you are blaming her like she did.  Would ANY of you have done any different? I doubt it.  All your high talk of morality sounds great when you are talking about others.  I imagine you all fail when it is you put to the test.  It won't change how I feel about you.  You are human.  Apparently none of the parties involved here are.  Chami is angelic and Melissa demonic.  Whatever, your a tard Eldryc.<br>

<br>
As being someone who sat on that damn hill for 13 days of my life with my cleric, putting my family and friends on hold, arranging schedules for others so that I had help on the hill and destroying my sleep pattern that I think I'm just now recovering from <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .....I'd be pretty damn pissed if I were Chami.<br>
<br>
Melissa was ON the list.  She agreed to the terms when she got on it.  I believe Chami was not guilded when I saw her on, but Melissa should have contacted cleric #2's guild to tell them the spawn was up.  Not sure if she did this, but it's my guess she didn't.<br>
<br>
Sure Melissa agreed to hold and MQ the item.. yea she waited a couple days to turn it in.  But it wasn't her ass on that hill camping it 24/7 for all those days.  She didn't sit beside Chami list or not.   I don't know the circumstances of why she was there to begin with, but personally as someone who's been on the list, I would have done everything I could have to preserve it and my spot on it.  My opinion is that Melissa didn't make attempts to contact the right people or abide by the rules that she herself agreed to.  <br>
<br>
She took advantage of the circumstances.  End of story.  Just remember the world is round and everything comes back around 10 fold.... <p><center><A HREF="http://www.auroraknights.com"><img src="http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/auroraknights/images/kol2.jpg"></a><br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=163661>Check out this Rangerette's gear</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/umatiltrynstum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Matil Trynstum</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cons Threateningly </span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#333333>(7/22/02 1:02:41 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.cox.net/matil/matil.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: DA EiE take Ragefire 19th July 2002</span><hr size=1> Does it matter why she was in Skyfire?

<br>
Too friggin bad.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to cut and paste every retarded thing said here.<br>
<br>
Melissa, keep your epic. List sucks. Congrats<br>
<br>
Chami, sorry to hear you spent so much time and went LD at the critical moment. I'm not sure if its irony but its certainly bad luck.<br>
<br>
For whomever was saying that people want Ragefire DECLARED FFA. You have no clue what you're talking about nor do you know who you're talking about. You're probably the same kind of person who doesn't want a minority family living next door. You're uninformed and moronic, but thats OK. The world needs ditchdiggers too.<br>
<br>
For people who arent going to associate with EiE/DA over this.<br>
GOOD ! Few less retards asking me about my epic, what spell does what and wether or not I have money/items/buffs to spare. Oh my, however shall I find another pickup group in Crushbone, I must be screwed.<br>
<br>
Lets say a guild or guilds doesn't wish to acknowledge that list. Lets say these people can mobilize, buff, and kill in 20 minutes or less. If these people were truly evil, would anyone besides them have cleric epics ? No. They would be selling MQ rights for big profits and enjoying more Kunark dragon loots...or worse, just letting it rot out of spite.<br>
<br>
All of you whiners should cut the crap and just drop it before you draw too much of the wrong kind of attention to yourself and your precious camp. You are doing the cleric camping the hill an enormous disservice. <p>Foulwind Grouch <br>

How is this a bad thing?<br>
<br>
If you're wanting to get an awesome job, you don't call the people that were suppost to be at the interview ahead of you to make sure they are on time.<br>
<br>
If you want this really cool shirt, and 5 other people want that shirt. When you get to the department store you don't go on the intercom and say &quot;I know there are 5 other people wanting this shirt. Come get the last 5 they have in stock and I'll just wait for the truck to get here next week.&quot;<br>
<br>
If you're waiting in line for some concert tickets, and the 7 people ahead of you walk off to go eat accross the street at Dennys, it's not your responsibility to walk over there when they open the ticket office to get them.<br>
<br>
I just think saying someone taking advantage of a situation as an insult is kinda naive. <p><center>[58 Preserver] Baroness Elawnah Zhir`Venhiruum (Wood Elf) < Bitter Monkeys > Server: Rodcet Nife<br><a href="http://www.gaijindesign.com/lawriemalen/jedi" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gaijindesign.com/lawriemalen/jedi/yoda.jpg" width="285" height="123" border="0"><br>:: how jedi are you? ::</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/umatiltrynstum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Matil Trynstum</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cons Threateningly </span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#333333>(7/22/02 1:57:40 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.cox.net/matil/matil.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: DA EiE take Ragefire 19th July 2002</span><hr size=1> Elawnah.

<br>
It IS a FFA spawn.  It's the list supporters who are trying to change the rules.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's going to be almost entirely the top handful of guilds...&quot;<br>
<br>
In any game, the more capable will do better than the less capable.  Using the list is in essence changing the rules of the game (which you have no right to do) in order to allow the less capable to win over the more capable.<br>
<br>
&quot;Could they try to work out modifications to the list? Yes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Have several of us offered suggestions on how to make the current, horribly flawed list better?  Yes.  Has anyone offered to try them?  No.<br>
<br>
&quot;They instead declare FFA...&quot;<br>
<br>
Once again, it IS FFA.  If you choose to spend a week camping an FFA mob, quite frankly you're retarded.  If you respect someone else's week-long camping of an FFA mob, you're either too nice for your own good, retarded, or both.  If you camp an FFA mob for a week and someone mobilizes faster than you, engages first, and gets the kill, and you cry foul, you're doubly retarded.<br>
<br>
One of the worst things is that the list people essentially tried to bully every Cleric on the server into being on the list.  And they believed that is somehow okay, while someone else doing what's to HER advantage (putting herself on the list but still getting RF before her turn) is not.<br>
