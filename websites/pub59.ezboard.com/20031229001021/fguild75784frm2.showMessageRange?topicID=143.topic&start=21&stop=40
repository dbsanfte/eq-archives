<br>
If you are stupid enough to do that for a few pixels, it's your choice. It does not entitle anyone else to do the same thing in game. It does suck for Chami for sure. But it's not a case of Chami vs Melissa, it's a case of Chami vs his own choice of sitting for weeks on and the game mechanics.<br>
<br>
That said even if I respect her choice, and I don't think she did anything wrong even if she was on the list, I would not do the same thing. Basically you have to either spend literally hundreds of RL hours in skyfire, or do it the normal way and have many people angry at you. What I would really do, is just not do the ragefire camp - NOTHING in the game could ever be worth so much trouble.<br>
<br>
The real problem here is the limited amount of content available to high level players. The ragefire thing is just one aspect of it. I did some tracking this morning and I think I can safely say that 95% of all significant mobs will be down by this evening. That's 36 hours after a patch, and only one evening for the north american players.<br>

So respect for someone elses much greater effort is not a reason?  Pathetic.<br>
<br>
I'd panic too since I'd realize the person might try to take the spawn, but I'm not about to think it's perfectly fine for them to do so since they're not on the list.  <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Xaanru's post suggesting that if someone wasn't on the list, swooped in at the last minute, and aggro'ed the spawn first, then it's just fine as long as they didn't break any Verant rules really bugs me. That makes as much sense as saying that in RL all behavior is perfectly acceptable and it's fine to treat people however you want as long as you don't break the law. Sad. Screw the verant rules. It's about having respect for the effort of other players, not about whether or not some stupid verant rule was broken. <br>

<br>
You have to remember, that my perspective on this is that of a person who had never heard of this list, until I happened to chance across this site, and found it to be over 80 people long. I don't like the list, never agreed to the list, and the list has effectively locked me out from EVER getting my epic. <br>
<br>
Saying that my statement equates to &quot;all behavior is perfectly acceptable and its fine to treat people however you want, as long as you don't break the law&quot; is a ridiculous jump in logic. Why should I respect the effort of others to monopolize a spawn, so that I can never get it?  The list is unfair, was not widely known at first, and is loaded down with people who happened to be the first to hear of it. <br>
<br>
As far as having respect for others, any person who has dealt with me in game knows that I am always respectful, and have never engaged in nasty, or unseemly behaviors. The point is, just because you SAY that you &quot;own&quot; a spawn, and have it reserved for the next two years, doesn't mean that you actually do. And doesn't it show disrespect for others efforts to tell a cleric who has everything but the heart that they must wait two years for the spawn, since they found out about the list late? There was a post on one of these boards from a lvl 60 cleric in just that situation.<br>
<br>
Personally, I plan to deal with the whole thing by not getting my epic, but I don't fault other people, who happened not to be insiders to the existence of this list, for wanting to get theirs. <p>Xaanru <br>

That has to be very frustrating.<br>
<br>
Melissa, you did absolutely nothing wrong. Keep it and congrats to you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now... <br>
The list is in essence,  the minority trying to control the majority under the guise of morals.  <br>
If you don’t adhere to and support the list, you have no morals, you’re an ass, you’re a creep, you’re a moron, and then some.  You’re threatened with being “blacklisted” (haha), you’re called names, and you and the people associated with you are harrassed with tells, shouts, etc.<br>
<br>
Remember when RF spawned in Solb, clerics would actually have to put in some time and effort prior to even getting the CAMP for RF.<br>
<br>
A cleric that was interested in the SolB RF would have to find out who was currently camping RF and find out if someone was already next in line.   If not, the cleric would try to  work it out so that they could be next in line.  They would either hang out with the cleric currently camping RF and help kill FG’s, or asked to be notified (personally, thru their guild or thru friends).  <br>
<br>
If that person could not be found for whatever reason, the RF camp was then open to whoever got there first.  No one went overboard trying to “maintain”  a list of whoever was next in line.  The only person who ultimately had that responsibility was the person who actually wanted to camp RF next.<br>
<br>
If there were more than a couple people waiting to “be next”, you had one or two options.  Wait a week or two and check back – or continue to check back often.  I mean, you never knew, maybe someone didn’t show up after the last RF killing and the camp was open.<br>
<br>
People interested in RF, had no choice but to put forth some effort, and what good is that you ask?  Well, it definitely weeded out those that didn’t want to put out any effort.  It weeded out those that were too lazy, too preoccupied, or just didn’t care.<br>
<br>
Only those that were willing to put in the effort, got the RF camp &amp; hence their epic.<br>
<br>
It's a little different with the list.  The list encourages and supports those that otherwise wouldn’t stand a chance of getting RF, whether that be due to laziness, lack of support, or lack of interest.<br>
<br>
All you need to do is get your name on the list.<br>
<br>
You can get your name on the list and not even be RF ready.<br>
<br>
You can get your name on the list, and not have even started your epic yet.<br>
<br>
You can put your name on the list, and happily go about your way for months, maybe even years, knowing that when your time comes for RF, come hell or high water, someone will find you.   And if you can’t be found, someone with “higher morals” will defend your right to the camp anyway.  <br>
<br>
You can put your name on the list, go on vacation, out of town, log out of EQ for 6 months, and still rest easy knowing you haven’t lost your place in line – on ‘the list’<br>
<br>
Get rid of it<br>

<br>
First, let me point out that I have not resorted to flaming any of your opinions by calling them pathetic, even though I disagree with them. I would ask the same courtesy from you.<br>
<br>
Second, if by much greater effort, you mean camping the zone, this really isn't that hard to do. I camped the skeleton camp in SK for almost a week straight just to get my aegis of life. <br>
<br>
If other clerics had the option of sitting side-by -side in the zone, camping the spawn, I'm sure they would. The list has created a situation where the ONLY WAY a person who is not on the list can get ragefire is by trying to get aggro first. So what you are saying is, if the non-list cleric is in the zone camping the spawn for the same length of time, or longer, then you would support their efforts? Or basically, you support the list, and will call anyone who disagrees pathetic? <p>Xaanru <br>

2) When you saw Rage up did you give the Hill Clerics a tell ?<br>
<br>

The whole basis behind the list is this quote.  If you join the list you might get a shot at ragefire in 2 years.  If you don't join the list and try to get ragefire on your own you are threatened with vulgarity and blacklisting in game.  No other mob in the game is monopolized by a group of people 24/7.<br>
<br>
You do not respect a cleric's right who is not on the list to get their epic.  Why should that cleric respect your right to get an epic?  Because 100 people were threatened with blacklisting and joined the list?  I don't think so.<br>
<br>
Melissa did nothing wrong and should keep her epic. <p><BR>

I think Verent is off their rocker on the making of this spawn, but that is a different issue altogether.  Being a mage, I have come to understand that most epics suck.  But, I think it all goes back to real life in the world we live in.  People are inherently lazy.  I think the list is a good answer to a problem that clerics had.  As in our world, I think Norrath lacks honor amung men and women.  All of the chivalry is gone in society and that makes me sad.

<br>
I was going to post again, tossing more fuel on the fire, but as I thought through my arguments, I more and more see both sides of this.  There ARE a huge number of clerics that will do anything to get rage, KS, ignore the list, whatever... those people are not going away no matter what.  <br>
<br>
But in all fairness, there are just as many anti-list people that just feel the list is truly unfair because of how it evolved and how some people knew about it before others.  <br>
<br>
I do see both sides of this.<br>
<br>
That said, I still can't see jumping in on someone that has waited 5 days when I have not.<br>
<br>
So?  What to do.....<br>
<br>
If most of the server really want this to be fair and organized (do we?), maybe we should restart... Kill the list.... Get everyone on board with a brand new system.<br>
<br>
1) Create a database of clerics (over some level) that want the camp.<br>
<br>
2) New people get added whenever they want.<br>
<br>
3) Pick a cleric at random and that cleric gets first spawn.<br>
<br>
4) Pick a backup cleric at random, who gets next spawn.<br>
<br>
5) Every time rage is had, pick a new backup cleric at random.<br>
<br>
This could address the &quot;unfair&quot; arguments against the list. It would obviously suck for those atop the current list, but being those people are &quot;community minded&quot;, I'd wager they would agree if it would restore order. <br>
<br>
However, if many on the server want a FFA, then no list of any sort will ever work.  And it needs to be a community decision, not a minority based solution (which some claim the current list to be).<br>
<br>
Personally, I'd prefer either a completely role playing based situation, which would result in the same thing we have today, but at least would have some color and character (as opposed to RL name calling), or a completely OOC: list that everyone can agree to to solve this problem. <p><b><i><font face="Garamond"><font color="#993366"><font size=+2>

It's easy to say you would be willing to MQ the item, but no one can say for sure until you walk a mile in someone else's shoes.  Melissa complied with all of Verant's rules on this matter, Ragefire was not KS'd and if anyone were to petition a GM, they would probably congratulate Melissa on her epic.<br>
<br>
I've helped a few clerics camp Ragefire and the same basic things happened.  One time in SolB with a cleric that was having problems with his ISP and a few times went linkdead only to come back 20 mins later and have the camp taken by another cleric.  Another time in SF a cleric spent 9 days in the &quot;number 1&quot; spot on that pathetic list only to have the spawn taken from him 3 times due to an afk/sleep situation.  I know it is frustrating and I know tempers flare, but in either of the above two situations no one offered to MQ the item nor did anyone even apologize.<br>
<br>
The list has outlived its usefulness.  Melissa has done nothing wrong and to say that it would ruin her reputation is a fallacy.  Her reputation is and shall remain outstanding amoungst those that know her.  I believe she has acted in an honorable manner and need not be dope-fiended, manipulated or insulted for doing what anyone else would have done in same or similar circumstances.  <br>
<br>
Congratulations Melissa on your epic, it is well deserved and a job well done.<br>

  I'm sorry, but I don't think killing Ragefire is something that takes two seconds.  If she had all this time for these events to occurr, then the clerics who were camping...er sleeping him lose out, too bad.   You can't put your cleric in a spot, go afk for 3 days and come back and bitch.  As for the LD person, I'm also sorry for you, but blame your isp.   Rage aggroed Melissa, she has the right to defend herself.     Congratulations to Melissa on her epic, she deserves it.

<br>
2) you may say a FFA isnt fair because all the uber guilds will get it everytime, there is another side to consider.  Many times the spawns for my epic have just been sitting up waiting to be killed (easy druid mobs such as ulump), so why do I not have my epic already?  Because we have bigger better things we were going after at the time.  Had Rage spawned a few hours earlier while we were in the middle of our AL attempts, we wouldnt have pulled out of that to go get rage.  Many of the uber guilds are often busy trying to kill the next mob on their list, and usually cant just stop what they are doing for one person's epic.  So in that respect the smaller guilds have an advantage sometimes too.   <p>Treeber<BR>

Melissa(sp?) didn't do anything wrong in my opinion... this list is retarded. She is even saving the pieces just in case she has to MQ, you have to be an @#%$ to even say anything after she holds the items for you.<br>

<br>
It is true that generally speaking, if you are camping a spawn and go LD then come back 20 minutes later to find the camp taken, you have probably lost the camp.  But we all know Ragefire is a special sort of camp, due to the extreme length of time between spawns.  Thus if someone has been camping Rage for 5 days straight and goes LD for 20 mins, courtesy and respect for that person’s time, common decency! DEMAND that you allow sufficient time for them to log back in (reboot if necessary, it happens..ah technology...) <br>
<br>
I have heard the arguments about “no one in their right mind should be camping RF for days (weeks)”, but it’s a fact that it WILL happen, the cleric epic is a highly valued and useful item to all guilds, and if camping in the zone will give them the edge over someone else, they will do it.<br>
<br>
Given that this is so, the List was an attempt to bring some order where there was chaos, and try to cooperate in order to reduce the stress &amp; frustration factors (oh boy is THAT not working.)   It was poorly implemented, and is in need of a huge overhaul, but I won’t hijack this thread into another debate about what should be done to fix it.<br>
<br>
I don’t know Melissa, and I don’t think she is an ‘evil’ person for doing what she did, Ragefire brings out the worst in people.  Personally I would never trust her after this.  And many others won't, also.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  She put her name on the list.<br>
<br>
She agreed to abide by the list’s rules.<br>
<br>
She was #12 according to reports.<br>
<br>
Clerics 1, 2, &amp; 3 were incommunicado so did she contact their guilds? <br>
<br>
For all you people arguing that the other clerics were given plenty of time to 'wake up' and object:<br>
<br>
Did she attempt to contact clerics (and THEIR guilds) #s 4 to 11 ?  As per the rules she agreed to?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>NO she did not.</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> She saw an opportunity to get her epic sooner than she had thought, and gave little more than a moment’s thought to the fact she was breaking her agreement.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Edit: apparently the idea about non-list clerics camping alongside Listed clerics was Happyslapp's idea and only quoted by Melissa, so to this extent, she was not being hypocritical.  The rest still stands, though</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
ps: This is my opinion, I am not speaking for my guild, although we do think the List is FUBARed (****ed Up Beyond All Recognition)<br>
<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
It is BEYOND time that Verant fix this situation and make Ragefire trigger-able only (like Feydadar.)  Then, by their own rules, the triggered spawn 'belongs' to he/she who triggered it and they WOULD consider it KSing if someone other than the triggering cleric looted the heart.<br>

Ragefire is incredibly mindless to camp now. I fault Verant for this. No idea why they changed it from before. If anything, the cleric epic should be made harder, so there are less clerics and guilds contesting for one stupid spawn.<br>
