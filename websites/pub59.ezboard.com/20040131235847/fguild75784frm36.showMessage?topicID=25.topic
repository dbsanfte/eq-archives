<br>
Is it just me, or is the average EQ player's ability to communicate going down?  There seems to be a growing number of people that:<br>
<br>
1) Cannot or will not type a complete sentence or all the letters in a word.  Take a chill pill and RELAX!  If you get 2 less kills tonight because you communicated like a civilized adult and actually finished words and sentences, is that really that bad?  If you ask me for a buff, but are so rushed that the request comes out like garbled shorthand, how can you expect me to spend time regaining mana when you can't take time to type?<br>
<br>
2) Abbreviations are bad enough, now we have a mass influx of people that swear and blaspheme in abbreviations.  Worse, they think they are not swearing.  My least favorite: OMFG.  Get serious.  Everything that happens to you does not constitute swearing.  I am not religeous in real life, nor do I have an absence of the 'f' word in my vocabulary.  But when someone asks me a naive question, or I get trained I don't need to yell OMFG and you fu**ing neeb, or you moron repeatedly.  Do I?  No, so why must you?  Ever hear of being polite?  Being civilized?  If this stuff was in character, it'd be great.  But its all RL people being mad or abusive because noone and nothing matters except themselves.  This kind of behavior ruins the mood of the game.  If you think the game is @#%$, don't play.  Don't log on and spread your diseased attitude like peanut butter on the rest of us.<br>
<br>
3) ADD.  Attention Deficit Disorder.  Can you say we are swamped with this?  The next MOB isn't already pulled?  Who cares that the cleric is OOM and the group is near dead.  We can't sit still for 3 seconds, heavens no.  Pull.  And if we die, yell many abbreviated swear words, and say that Verant sucks repeatedly.  That will demonstrate your character.  Sometimes I'd like to tie these people to a chair and make them remain still for 2 seconds just to prove they don't belong in an institution.  Got banned for an exploit?  Blame Verant for having rules.  Damn these rules that prevent me from being God.  But whatever you do, don't let a second tick by that you're not in motion.  Run around and around in a circle if nothing else, or spam the area so people notice you.  ARGH!<br>
<br>
EQ is a community game, and for the most part, I love people.  But we're growing an alarmingly large crop of ADD, rude, obnoxious people that its starting to be less fun.<br>
<br>
Recently, someone from a guild that is advertised to be &quot;guardians of the weak&quot;, yada yada was belly aching in a zone about not being able to find the exit.  When noone would come and lead him there by the nose (we did give directions and locs) he cursed the zone, calling those that helped names, and used my favorite OMFG to show how stupid we all were for not solving his problem while we were busy (yet trying).  He then said that OMFG is not swearing....  Perhaps we need IQ tests before allowing fertilization of eggs.....<br>
<br>
/rant off<br>
<br>
Have a nice day.<br>
<br>
PS:  These are personal views, letting off a bit of steam.  This is not written as my character and should not reflect well, or poorly on my friends, mates and guild associations.  If you disagree, vent it at me in RL. <p><b><i><font face="Garamond"><font color="#993366"><font size=+2>

But on the other hand I have ADHD and yes it sucks I am 33 years old. oh well sue me for haveing it or better yet sue my parents for passing it along! and i like to use abreviations and this is due to my training in the military. can you say SNAFU, can you say FUSDAP. you probably have no clue what the second one even means. and personaly if ya dont like the way that people are in this game then dont play it, as you pointed out that the other people should do. you basicly sound like one of the mothers that blame the way that your kids act due to what is brodcast on TV or on the radio. well all i can say is there is a button on the radio there is a button on the TV and there is a button on Eq if ya dont like it turn it off! I say to each their own and if ya dont like it OMFG ignore it!<br>
<br>
and as forest gump says OMFG that is all that i have to say about that<br>

<br>
1) I apologize to anyone with an ACTUAL medical condition.  I mean no disrepect or lack of concern for these people, and I admire their drive and perseverance.<br>
<br>
2) I believe that the vast majority of childen today being prescribed ADD medication have a different problem.  Bad parenting.  Lack of discipline.  Sure, there are honest cases of mental or nervous system problems.  I also believe that a world on depresion medication is insane.  The world is pill happy.  Far too many people, healthy but lazy people, pop pills to solve all their problems.  The &quot;ADD&quot; people I am referring to are undiciplined brats,  aged 10-60.  I have a hunch Baror69 that you are NOT among them.<br>
<br>
3) I do disagree strongly with your statement:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> if ya dont like the way that people are in this game then dont play it<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
for a few reasons.  You say this is very much like what I said about people not playing the game if they don't like it.  That's very different than me quitting because of rude people.  As an anology, should I &quot;not play&quot; the game of life if everyone decides tomorrow to be as rude in real life as they are in EQ?  I think a certain level of civility needs to be maintained in real life, in online games, on bulletin boards and web pages.  Our society lately is so hung on &quot;me centric&quot; behaviour that concern over how our behaviour affects others has become passe'.  Your saying that if people swearing everywhere I go bothers me I should stay home?  I disagree.  So does Verant.  So do most board moderators.  It is only the &quot;I am God&quot; syndrome people that insist that they are ENTITLED to do whatever to whomever anytime.  These are the people that need to be &quot;corrected&quot; so the rest of us can enjoy a game free from harassment.  <br>
<br>
When did being rude become the default accepted behavior?  When did attitudes like &quot;How's My Driving?  Call 1-800-EAT-@#%$&quot; become cool?  That's exacltly the same as saying if I don't like people swearing, being disruptive, spamming the zone for attention, I should quit playing.<br>
<br>

I think you need to first divide the list off &quot;ADD&quot; people into two types. <br>
1)  Dumb guys who enjoy just running around killing people, don't care about anyone but themselves, and would give up your group for another even if your in the middle of a fight cause the other group has better exp and loot.  And then wont help with CR that they were the reason behind.<br>
2)  The second type are the go get'm people who are willing to do anything for the fun and excitment, but don't want to get people hurt and are loyal to those they are grouped with.  They enjoy running through tov solo trying to make it to PoM as long as there is not a raid force there or someone to wipe.  Actually, I heard its quite a  rush lol.<br>
<br>
I have to say, good post, there is a great lack of carring in our society.  Again, good post.  Cursing isnt needed 24/7.  I also want to point out, if someone screwed up and did something wrong you don't need to just cuss them out repeatedly, just tell them what they did wrong and good chance is they know it and are sorry.  <br>
<br>
thats my 2cp. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/udrool.showPublicProfile?language=EN>drool</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#333333>(10/7/02 1:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.rochester.rr.com/drool/NoudVamp.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ language.....</span><hr size=1> Hiya Edaar!

Sorry if I wasn't too chatty.  I was in tell hell and about to turn ...... OMG..... 60.....  I am still in shock that I made it!<br>
<br>
I tend to be somewhat quiet in EQ except for 2 situations.  1) I get into role playing with my group or raid, or 2) Someone is a real jerk.  I dislike the latter because sometimes I react inappropriately.  I'm working on it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Direct conversation tells don't happen alot with me, as I can't multitask too well when I'm pulling (which I do alot when I am with RL friends ingame) or sorting through my mess of poison components!  Don't take my quietness as anything more than forgetfullness on  my part! <p><b><i><font face="Garamond"><font color="#993366"><font size=+2>

Guess I have been wondering about this for a while now, well ever since I started playing actually... So, here goes.<br>
<br>
Since EQ contains a language filter, that is, I might add, at default set to ON. Why is it, that those who do not like to hear swearing/cussing, are the ones that decide to turn it OFF?<br>
<br>
As for abbreviations, theres not much that can be done there, OMFG in itself is not recognized by the /filter same with a lot of other abbreviations. <br>
<br>
Guess I am just sincerely preplexed as to why the actual swearing/cussing should be so bothersome if it is possible to control your intake of it by simply typing a word.<br>
<br>
/agree on the abbreviated junk though, especially if someone is asking for your time and mana, at least have the tact to say what you want politely.

I guess I am disappointed that people can't seem to communicate well.  Often people ask why I don't use filter and ignore.  To me, these are like hiding under a rock and ignoring a problem.  And to me at least, people that are rude in a social setting are a problem.<br>
