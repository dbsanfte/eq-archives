I've spent much time in CS and have had countless wizards and druid kite over me. (me being kos and on giant faction) Not once did any of their kites stop to hit me or my pet.  They must have been magical kiters back in the day that knew what they were doing.  Also, there is 3 seconds between the time you agro'd and the time adriona casts a spell, that not exactly alot time and I would call that an attempt at a KS.  Like liltonto said, your log is crap.  It shows me you casted some spell on a wyvern then adriona casted a spell on that wyvern.  How do I not know she didn't have initial agro and that you weren't trying to steal her wyvern?<br>
<br>
As far as people being rude,  maybe they were having a bad day and you just happen to strike a never.  You coming over here throwing a big fit about 1 instance with 2 members.  If I got all pissed about every little thing that went wrong in EQ and went and complained about it all the time.  I guarantee you no one would want to group with me and no guilds would want me either.  Learn to take a little shit, cuase in the real world outside of EQ there is alot more shit.<br>
<br>
Grow up sir, realise that not all time are people gonna be friendly, and also realise that sometimes shit just happens and learn to take it in stride.  Granted don't let people walk on ya, but christ, I don't see anything here remotely threatening.  If someone was continually bothering you or training you or whatever then I could see grounds for a complaint but come on, this is pretty trivial.<br>
<br>
At any rate, I'm done huffing and puffing.  Have a nice day.<br>
<br>
Naz<br>

Talk to me then.  <br>
<br>
I'm not going to point out each specific quote from your orignal posts but I would hope you are not surprised by the responses it provoked.  Basically what your post seemed to boil down to was something to the effect of: &quot;I've had a bad experience with two of your members in CS and therefore this must be the trend in your guild.&quot;  Whether you meant to or not, in your first post you have apparently labelled the guild negatively as a whole based on your two incidents and therefore the responses followed.  I'm sure you would be willing to agree that any guild on the whole will defend its members against attacks/statements/remarks made by someone outside the guild.  Your second post doesnt really inspire much good will either in that based on two other members' posts you have, directly this time, decided to sum up your viewpoint of the whole guild with the phrase &quot;most of your guild acts that way,&quot;.  Initially, I would hope you realize that there are more than 6-7 people in the guild Blight, but I will conceede it is your perrogative to stereotype people/guilds/events however you wish.<br>
<br>
Setting aside the issue of proof and verification via logs and screenshots, I'm going to address both incidents from my viewpoint.<br>
<br>
As for your first instance, as I have not done any quad'ing in CS myself I dont know the specific ettiquette or methods in CS.  I would assume though that there's a way to pull and quad without pulling them over either the pet or Bringer.  (Unless Bringer and pet were in the middle of the ridge so you have no place to go other than over either one?  Based on my passages from CS to SS I would assume there is generally ample space.)  As you said in a later post, you, like everyone else needed to learn the right and wrong way to quad in CS.  I would assume/hope there's a path or way to lead the wyvern which does not involve kiting over a player otherwise every person in zone would have a problem with Bringer (unless for some reason that's the only time Bringer has ever sat in that particular spot?  I do know Bringer is in CS a lot.).  Perhaps between Bringer and her pet if they were on either side of the ridge?  If I'm wrong and every player does have the problem of having to pull quads over Bringer, please correct me.  Perhaps it's just a matter of asking or observing a different way to quad.  I would hope you agree though that, generally, dragging your quad over another player is considered bad form even if you know for a fact that they are not KoS.  <br>
<br>
In regards to your second incident, I see a log of one instance where you apparently cast your flux staff possibly at the same time as Adriona began to cast her spell.  If you're going to point out that you cast 2 seconds faster in your log, I would hope you will acknowledge that due to latency issues inherent in multiplayer games, on Adriona's screen she may have cast first.  This would especially be true if either or both of you are on a dial up connection.  Personally I have instances of up to 6 second delays even though I'm on a broadband connection.  If this was a repeated occurrance, I would think your case would be stronger but to voice your displeasure in public channels after one incident of two people going after the same mob would not give your argument strong support.  I would also suggest perhaps using /tell instead of /ooc as your first means of contact.  My instinctive reaction to abrasiveness is to return the same.  I might suggest something along the lines of: &quot;/tell adriona Excuse me, I had aggro on that wyvern first.&quot; working as a better opening line than: &quot;/ooc KSer&quot;  Especially after a single occurance with a single wyvern.<br>
<br>
I thank you for pointing out what you percieve as problems within this guild but perhaps you will agree that both sides could have handled the situation with more diplomacy.  If you feel you are completely in the right, I'm sorry you feel that way and know that this is the opinion/decision of an officer and probably the bottom line response you will be recieving. <p><Table Style='Filter: Alpha(Opacity=100, FinishOpacity=50, Style=2, StartX=85, FinishX=20, StartY=0, FinishY=0)'><B><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6495" target="magelo"><Font Color=#FFCC33 Size=3 Face=Times New Roman, Helvetica>Rula -
