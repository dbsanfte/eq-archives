You made a personal choice Happyslapp and I place no judgement of its merit one way or the other so please do not place judgement on us that wanted our epics , agreed with the merit of the list and were willing to wait for our name to come up.  This is completely a matter of what is right and wrong and in this case the people from Arirang were very wrong.  If those of us that feel the same way let our opinion be known then I am sure that there will be an effect on Helen and in not at this particular situation the maybe Sony will look into a more amiable alternative to the situation.<br>
<br>
As leader of Drunken Fishermen I have asked each member to shun, boycott or otherwise not interact with the members of Arirang until such time as they are properly called to task for this heinous and deplorable act. I am asking you all to join us in condemnation of the members of Arirang that perpetrated this act and demand that justice prevails.<br>

IS THAT RIGHT??? in my book no I do not agree with this list specially when you are taking a ragefire piece away from a cleric that is rage ready and giving to a cleric that is not ready for it. <br>
<br>
You have a monopoly and are playing god with a spawn and that is not right. You all whine when a so called uber guild monopolizes a spawn then when you monopolize one you want everyone to abide by it. In my book that stinks. but the biggest thing that pisses me off is that clerics not ready for rage are getting his piece thus taking his piece away from clerics that have gone through the trouble to be ready up to the rage part so when they do that crappy camp they will have thier epic.<br>

But oh wait you all can do no wrong you are god and made this holyer then though list and no way what you are doing can be wrong!<br>

I have a 55 cleric on rodcet, and before i had heard of the list it was longer than i think was fair.....if you realistically expect people to wait 6 months or whatever for a spawn becasus others started a list you are dreaming, it was only a matter of time before somebody decided to KS a spawn.<br>
<br>
Additionally, i believe that you should have to have THE REST of the epic done before you are allowed on the rage list- otherwise the problem that we have currently will get worse, ppl will get on it without having done the other parts, leaving those of us requiring ONLY ragefire with a frustrating wait.<br>
<br>
Having said that, i think Arirang KSing a mob that is already engaged/camped is Wrong....and i dont condone it at all (/blacklist arirang). I just feel that the list needs work, people at the top of the list really need to justify their top spots by having finished all the other bits.<br>

Even without the &quot;list&quot; IE first to engage there is nothing stopping a cleric who is &quot;not&quot; ready from looting the heart.  So to say the list supports this some how is ludicrous, you would have that problem no matter what you do.<br>
<br>
2nd.  Since all the pieces are no drop how could u tell a cleric has completed all the steps?  List or no list there is no way to tell.<br>
<br>
Yes the proposal to make up a list maybe should have been better publicized BUT I dont know how many guild raids I have been on where the raid was posted on the boards and on the Gmotd only to have several people always ask &quot;Is there a raid today?&quot;.  So no matter how much the list was splattered everywhere you would still get people who are clueless and would be angry because they didnt know about it.<br>

Are there cleric forums...<br>
<br>
I know that I have a wizard website and forum that is outstanding for information and as a resource for finding things out.  Pretty much if your a wizard your using Graffe's website.  My thing is this...  was the list proposed on a cleric website, with things that should go into determining who can get on the list.   Was it even brought up in detail on this website prior to the list being made or any website for that matter Prior to the list being made?  I really am asking this question, I do not know.<br>
<br>
I think a list can be a good idea, I just do not think the way it was started was done in a way that the entire server would have known about it..If I am following all the details correctly.  <br>
<br>
By the terms described by those that made the list (if i am getting this correctly)  Once i find a mob that is hotly contested ,(now this would be hard right) all I need to do is grab about 6 or 7 others that would like to take the time to camp it..  Have a discussion, start the camp, and publish the list.<br>
<br>
This is by no means meant to be disrespectfull of those that put this all into motion, it just seems a little bit on the odd side of things when something is done that still has that FFA effect to it, but puts those in the know of the list on the First come First served order.  FFA changing from power to knowledge with only a few knowing of the change in tactic for the camp if I am following this correctly?<br>
<br>
If it was discussed on a cleric website how come more people were not aware of the list from the start, and something like a roll done for those that were ready from that point to establish an order versus what was done?  <br>
<br>
I am really just thinking out loud on this, as I have been following this with some curiousity.  I do not play a cleric but have helped with the cleric numerous times, and realize how much of a pain it is. <br>

But it would also include adding some semi-rare drops in the other planes too.  It astounds me that the cleric epic never has to go to a plane of any kind and all the major drops are for sure drops.. You see mob, kill mob, get drop.  Very few other epic mobs are like that.  Most have a chance of dropping.  And many of them have 3+ day spawn timers in Planar zones that many guilds have grown out of.  <br>
<br>
By putting cleric epics in the planes and the end (or hardest piece) on the 8th isle of air you gaurantee almost every other class in the game a shot at their epics while the guilds go after about the only epic they care to get.<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
if you have to have a list it should be guild based.  No guild can have 2 clerics on the list at a time.  The guild decides which cleric goes onto the list and then supports that cleric in getting epic.  As it is friends of whomever created that list and people who knew about it early have a huge advantage over anyone else.<br>
<br>
but..<br>
<br>
All that being suggested.  RAgeFire went from bad to worse.  VI needs to fix it.  <br>

Anyways, my 2 cents says that it should be first come first serve, then i MIGHT start my epic.. /sigh, already 55.<br>

The list is poorly managed. I have no respect for it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ueqfoulwind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQFoulwind</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cons Threateningly </span><br>  Posts: 98<br> <font color=#333333>(8/20/02 8:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=15>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://millennium.fortunecity.com/celesteville/649/oscar.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: End to Ragefire List?</span><hr size=1> /agree Kinare<br>

Everyone should hit that message board and let em know what you think. In cases like this, silence=compliance.<br>
<br>
Even the clerics on this list aren't active on thier 'official' board.<br>
<br>
Plus, I think an influx of people that don't agree with the list letting others know would be funny.<br>
