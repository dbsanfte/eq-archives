You lack the experience and perspective to understand his argument.&quot;<br>
<br>
I've been playing the game since long before Ascent was a guild.  They were simply used as an example of a guild that can mobilize quickly.  To say that once the really fast mobilizing guilds are gone, the others are irrelevant is just not true.  They easily COULD have raced each other to RF in solB.  Sure they wouldn't outrace AoD or DA or whoever if those guilds had been there, but they'd have a shot at outracing each other.  They chose not to.  I understand Jeet's argument and I find it flawed.  That's my opinion.  But don't tell someone who's been playing the game well over 2 years that they lack the perspective/experience just because you might have been there since Beta or whatever.  Who cares.<br>
<br>
&quot;There is alot of grey. How much, in this case, seems to be based on whether you are either pro-list or anti-list, for the &quot;rules&quot; or think they need changing etc.&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually I think the list has gotten silly, but I also think the way EiE has chosen to deal with it is wrong.<br>
<br>
&quot;Anything that is not FFA is never going to be anything more than a gentleman's agreement to begin with.&quot;<br>
<br>
Correct.<br>
<br>
&quot;According to the &quot;rules&quot; that are in place Melissa did not break any of them. THEN you wanna<br>
talk about the spirit versus the letter of the law, and doing what is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;fair&quot;.  So just following the rules is not enough. Then why do you have them? Hell, follow the rules and you get flamed on a board like this. Apparently doing what was right was not good enough for someone because they felt the need to start this &quot;list&quot; and make these &quot;rules&quot;.&quot;<br>
<br>
I've said from the beginning that no Verant rules were broken.  But yes, I'm arguing for what's &quot;right&quot; or &quot;fair&quot; if you want to put it that way.  Rules/laws seldom cover everything and people still have a lot of choice about whether to treat each other with respect or to not do so without violating any rules/laws.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Now it has to be both ways. Looks more to me like someone's friend got their feelings hurt and so they came here to do some name calling to make themselves feel better over it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually I don't know the cleric who was camping it at all.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then a lot of people jump on the &quot;anti-uber&quot; band wagon based on heresay and we are left with what we have here. Leave your spite and jealousy behind and look at the facts. You will see a lot different picture than the one you are painting.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm on the &quot;anti-uber&quot; bandwagon because of how I see so many of them treat other players.  It's not ALL people in the so called uber guilds, not by any means.  Jealous?  No, I could have aimed at joining a top tier guild.  I chose not to.  What I see are people who play the game far more competitively than most of the player populace does.  There are some, again not all, in these guilds who could care less about someone else's time and effort.  If they can take what they want through superior force, they will do it regardless of who might be pushed aside in the process.  <br>
<br>
---------------<br>
<br>
&quot;And why the adverb &quot;simply&quot;? Rules are rules; attempting to trivialize them does not change that. No player in the game is above the rules, and has the right to expect more than what the rules entitle them to receive.&quot;<br>
<br>
It's nice to think that people will be kind to one another without rules/laws forcing them to do so.  Sorry if that's naive.<br>
<br>
I think the main difference we're getting at is that for something in a game like camping that silly ragefire spawn, you see giving the person who's been camping it all week first shot as doing them a favor.  You're giving them a handout... a random act of kindness.  It's not something they should expect.  I see it as no huge favor at all, but simple respect for their time and effort that should be given to everyone and is something we should expect from one another.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, because we aren't as charitable to non-ubers as you would like us to be?&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't see choosing NOT to trample their time and effort with superior power as an act of charity but of simple respect.  The fact that you see it as some big favor you're doing for the little guy says something about the uber guild mentality, once again of some top tier guild players, not all, and why the anti bandwagon exists.  <br>

I told him my friends were just zoning in now and I'd be starting in 7-10 minutes.  He said he could go now.  And he did.  <br>
<br>
Well I was so depressed at not being able to finish my 8th ring I figured I'd just switch from dorf to Giant faction.  So I pulled Garadain.  After I killed him I changed my mind though, I don't want to go through all that work again.  He got kinda mad.  Probably something about having to start all over because Garadain died before he could do his turn in.  Oh well.

<br>
You have been playing over 2 years but I have never heard of you.  And you used a very recent example of a guild in your argument.  Implies lack of experience, when Jeet's argument used guilds and was speaking of a time well beyond Ascent.  It is like comparing apples to oranges.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Actually I think the list has gotten silly, but I also think the way EiE has chosen to deal with it is wrong.&quot;<br>
<br>
They did not do anything wrong, except reply to a request for help from an ally that I can see.  Since when is that wrong?<br>
<br>
&quot;I've said from the beginning that no Verant rules were broken. But yes, I'm arguing for what's &quot;right&quot; or &quot;fair&quot; if you want to put it that way. Rules/laws seldom cover everything and people still have a lot of choice about whether to treat each other with respect or to not do so without violating any rules/laws. &quot;<br>
<br>
From everything I have read, Melissa tried to make contact with the clerics on the hill.  When that failed she moved on the spawn.  She made an effort.  I guess she did not work hard enough for some though.  I can think of a lot of people who would not of waited as long as she did.  On the Cleric board it states she was in zone for close to an hour, that is a long time for the AFK's to respond.  An hour seems like a healthy amount of respect to me.<br>
<br>
&quot;  Actually I don't know the cleric who was camping it at all&quot;<br>
<br>
Then why are you so involved?  I know the cleric being flamed and I also in her guild.  <br>
<br>
The whole anti-uber thing is silly.  That is not the term I would use.  I prefer raid guild vs casual guild.  That is more accurate.  There are people with attitude problems in guilds at all levels.  There are good people in guilds at all levels.  To make lump statements about all guilds at a certain level or even lump statements about a whole guild is akin to the same sort of thinking that promotes prejudice RL in matters of race, religion, sex, ethnicity etc...  not that &quot;guildism&quot; or &quot;uberism&quot; is anything like RL bigotry, but in the manner of making a judgement about a person or persons without knowledge of them based on an appearence, in this case a guild tag.  Personally what anyone thinks of me, based on my words, actions or my guild tag are not going to affect whether or not I have fun in EQ.  But for everyone so concerned about the &quot;people at the other end of the screen&quot; your blanket descisions and snap judgements based on guild tags may cause some hurt feelings on the other side.  But who cares.  We're uber.  We don't have feelings, right?<br>

I do firmly believe that.  However, you failed to recognize that Callon said there are SOME and not ALL people in &quot;uber&quot; guilds that can act that way.  I believe the reason these uber guilds are the target is simply because of their power.  With great power comes great responsibility, ne?  <br>
No one is going to respect or look up to the power of someone who takes all they can get and runs....especially if the little guy is hurt in the process.  Well ok... maybe SOME people will look up to it, but imo, those people are often just as twisted in their thinking, and no better than the first person.  <br>
Personally I have a number of friends in top tier guilds that I believe to be VERY honorable and decent...  they have my respect, and I believe have earned their power.  But there are always those in powerful positions who abuse it.  These are the people who do their guild tag a disservice and give it a bad name.  <br>
As for Melissa, she did not give DA a bad name in my eyes, but I do still believe she acted in an underhanded, sneaky manner.  No, I do NOT think she did the right thing... and she did not make enough effort to contact people.  It really seems to me that she put out the absolute minimal effort she thought she could get away with, and then hid behind the &quot;rules&quot; as her defense.  Sure....maybe that protects her from the rules and those who follow them strictly, but not those of us who consider ourselves to be honorable and put ourselves in her shoes.  I know I would never have done what she did, therefore I can not respect it.  <br>

I could be jealous of their gear and their smooth working teams but face it.. they play a LOT more than the most of us. They work hard for it. Just as in RL a part time employee wont have the experience or get the pay of a full time employee.<br>
<br>
The way I see it there were 2 basic positions on the list you either supported it or you didnt. I had no problem with the people who were up front and said they did not support the list and when they were ready they were going to camp Ragefire and take him (notice I'm not saying ks). But don't put your name on the list, thus agreeing to its rules, and then take out of turn.<br>
<br>
Regardless, what's done is done and she has to live with it. I found it interesting that the first I heard of it was a post on this board ... posted by Melissa ... asking if she had ks'd. I've since seen that post on several different forums. Including forums for other servers. Feeling a little guilty? or just checking to see what public opinion would be before a decision was made as to if she would mq or not? <p><p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=101234"><img border="0" src="http://www.liquid2k.com/ildanoch/swolfsig.jpg" width="282" height="218"></a></p>

There was a lot of talk on our private message board about it also.  In the end the words of people like Nuggruk and the others basically flaming her made her descision for her.  <br>
<br>
I see where he said not all ubers are whatever...  but he then says &quot;I am on the anti-uber bandwagon&quot;.  I take that to mean he is willing to accept the few he has a problem with to be the norm for raid guilds.  <br>
<br>
As for playing more...  I work 50+ hours a week most weeks.  Saturday evenings I play D&amp;D and Sunday evenings I play volleyball.  I probably have less time to play than most of you.  But we do work hard for what we do.  I see a lot of misc. posts in places saying things like &quot;you can join an uber guild and get your stuff handed to you, or you can work for it&quot;.  That is utter BS.  Anyone who thinks that can come watch us learn how to kill a mob and get a strat down and wipe over and over and over.  Die enough you see serious XP loss with 56 rezzes.  If that is not earning it I don't know what is. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=76592"> Matil Trynstum

We disagree on it and obviously that's not going to change.  To clarify, when I said that I'm on the &quot;anti-uber bandwagon&quot; I was referring to an attitude that some people in the top guilds have.  There is what I see as an arrogance and lack of respect for those not as &quot;L33T&quot; as them, a willingness to take what they can get regardless of who gets run over in the process.  It's not all people in the top guilds, it's just some that in my opinion fit the negative stereotype.  Some of the responses to the ragefire incident, again in my view, showed the very lack of respect that I'm talking about.  I had a much bigger problem with what some of her defenders said than with what Melissa herself said.  For example, it's seen as a act of charity to NOT take a camp spawn someone has been at for ages when I see not doing so as no act of charity at all, but simple respect.  <br>
<br>
At the end of it, I am still under the impression that little effort was made to let the person who was camping it all week have first shot at the spawn.  Then afterwards the concensus opinion of those in EiE/DA, based on those who posted here, was that there was no need to respect that camp anyway, so how much effort was made to contact the original camper was irrelevant.  I strongly disagree with that as i've made very obvious.  I don't like to stereotype entire guilds, but on the other hand guilds do have a collective policy on certain issues even if not every single member agrees (e.g. the post saying that EiE now regards RF as FFA).  Now what opinion of a guild as a whole do you expect to see a person form if they strongly disagree with the views and attitudes posted by several members of said guild and don't see any members of that guild saying anything different?  <br>
<br>
lol... and you never having heard of me is relevant how?  okay, you've probably heard of many of the long time players who are in top tier guilds.  That's nice.  The original point Jeet had made was about racing to ragefire and he dismissed guilds after the top tier ones because they weren't considered rapid mobilizing.  The implication was that since they weren't as fast as the top guilds at mobilizing, there was no real competition among them for the spawn.  I posted why I disagree and how guilds in the next tier down could easily have raced each other too if they'd wanted to and had chosen not to respect the cleric who kept FG's cleared.  Understanding my response or Jeet's original point has nothing to do with whether one has been in a top guild or not.    If you take all the Ferraris off the racetrack and are left with Honda Civics, the Civics can have a pretty close race with each other if they want because they're competing against others at their own level.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It's all a minor point anyway, so oh well.  btw, i used Ascent as an example just because it was the first high level guild that popped into my head.  That's it.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ueldryc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eldryc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cons Threateningly </span><br>  Posts: 77<br> <font color=#333333>(7/25/02 2:25:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=92.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some clarification to the now locked RF thread</span><hr size=1> p.s. I'm trying to refer to the most powerful guilds as &quot;top tier guilds&quot; now to avoid confusion with my comments about being anti-uber.  It's just semantics, but it is confusing.  And whether or not I like, dislike, or am indifferent to a particular guild tag is going to be based on whatever interactions I've had with that guild personally and then to a lesser extent what I've heard about them doing from sources that I consider credible.  That's pretty normal, I think.  Like it or not and particularly if things I don't like have been stated as the guild's collective policy (e.g. We will treat RF as FFA.), the guild tag can carry weight in the initial impression.  <br>

Sorry if that's naive.<br>
<br>
&quot;I see it as no huge favor at all, but simple respect for their time and effort that should be given to everyone and is something we should expect from one another.&quot;<br>
<br>
And expecting to be able to have such FFA camps uncontested is probably one of the reasons why you get trampled.  If you'd accept that you'll have to fight for the camp, and prepare for it, you might actually get the kill more often.<br>
<br>
And I will reiterate that it is the attitude of &quot;I was here first so leave&quot; that causes someone like me (not &quot;like me&quot; as in &quot;uber&quot;, but as in &quot;with similar morals&quot;) to want to run over someone like you.  So, to make a long story less long...yes, you probably are naive.  If you choose to remain so, there's nothing I can do but play the game however the hell I want.<br>
<br>
&quot;The fact that you see it as some big favor you're doing for the little guy says something about the uber guild mentality, once again of some top tier guild players, not all, and why the anti bandwagon exists.&quot;<br>
<br>
By favor/charity, I mean that what I am doing is not required of me.  And that's where the difference lies.  You actually think anyone has to be that nice?  It would be great if the world worked that way, I agree, but it doesn't.  I do not expect anyone to do me any favors;  I find that having such an attitude keeps me from being disappointed as much.  Perhaps if people weren't so naive as to believe everyone has to play nice, the &quot;anti-uber&quot; bandwagon wouldn't exist.<br>
