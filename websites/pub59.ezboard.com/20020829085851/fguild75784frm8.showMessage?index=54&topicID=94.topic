Monks are *suppost* to do more damage than a Warrior. Just like Rangers, they lack ac and hp to make up for that. That's also why they get the skills like Block and whatnot (In the case of Rangers, Jolt). They can't take the aggro.<br>

Your job as a Warrior is to take and maintain aggro because NO OTHER CLASS CAN HANG LIKE THAT.<br>

actually that's not true in a grind group anymore, Elawnah.  Because of the AC softcap and several other reasons, other classes will tank just as well as a warrior.  Basically several classes are close enough to equal now in tanking ability that in a grind group it doesn't matter.  Go with the one that does the most damage (monk most likely) or one that supplies other utility that you need.  But that's a different discussion.  <br>
<br>
Here's the simplest scenario since it is in essence what my grind groups can get the majority of fights down to.  Yes, it's oversimplified, but it represents well what we go for on exp grinds and we can set up this type of 1 on 1 in most situations --<br>
<br>
Take a 60 warrior with decent gear, not uber guild stuff, just solid gear.  Hell, give him 200k for it.  I have 200k+ in gear and that's not counting much value for several pieces, including the bp and legs, which are no drop.  don't worry about how much the mage has in gear.  It doesn't matter.  They need an epic so assume much of their plat went toward buying MQ's or something.  The rest of it can be mediocre gear.  Figure, i don't know, 100k total for some mediocre gear and a bunch of MQ's to help get the epic.  anyway, that's too much detail for a simple test, so moving on...<br>
<br>
Now make an epic mage pet.  Use the water one.  It does great dmg.  Any of them will probably work though.  Throw on the buffs.  Assume you've got nice buffs (DS, haste, aego, etc. etc.).  Have a cleric ready to heal.  Bring in the average blue con grind group mob.  Bring one mob for the pet and one for the warrior.  If a mob dies, assume that it's very quickly replaced by another mob.  Now pay attention while they fight for a few minutes.  I guarantee you that the mage pet will kill it's mobs faster.  It's not close.  Okay, fine, I can deal with that if the old thought that pets are good dmg dealers but not good dmg takers applies.  It doesn't.  That warrior will require far more healing than the pet does.  I don't know entirely why that is.  The pet does have 30hp per tick extra regen, but that's only 300 per minute.  The warrior is going to be at the AC softcap for grind mobs.  But for whatever reason, but pet will not need near the healing that the warrior does.  That's the bottom line... better dmg but also better tanking.  Now how that's even a little balanced,  I have no idea.  If it does better damage, it should NOT take damage as well.  Period.<br>
<br>
-- Callon<br>
<br>
p.s. upgrade the mob quality a bit with some of our recent fights... the epic pet tanked Deep (part of the monk epic fight in LOIO) and did so easily.  A player tank would almost certainly have needed more heals than the epic pet did.  I'm not sure what else our friendly neighborhood mage has tanked with the pet that's a bit stronger than the average grind mob.<br>

<br>
this comment was to revnick, but anyway... what we've seen by grinding together and by the two of them going without me is eye opening.  Also keep in mind that if he's benefitting from cleric buffs, then so am I when i'm there.  But then we've virtually always had clerics in our grind groups and often chanters.  The mage's dmg drops off a bit without c3 up, but it's not a huge amount by any means.  We've spent quite a bit of time grinding after c3 dropped or was dispelled.  And if there's no chanter to c3 the mage and cleric, then there's also no chanter to haste me.  That's actually worse.  The mage destroys us meleers by even more if we don't have chanter haste, even if it means he lacks c3.  So... point is you can't dismiss the issue by claiming this case is an exception.  The gear for everyone is pretty solid, but not totally uber.  It also doesn't make a big difference in a mage'd damage output.<br>

<br>
I haven't argued warriors are underpowered these days.  I even said myself in my own grind groups I prefer a ranger and a rogue over a warrior.  What I don't get is why you're still so focused on a mage.  Rangers, monks, rogues.  All can consistanly outdamage a warrior as well.  Hell, at the risk of being offensive (and I don't intend to be) a lot of classes can outdamage a warrior.  Instead of focusing on one whom you apparently feel is stronger then the rest (whether people agree or not is irrelevent) why not focus your opinion on your classes weaknesses on VI.  <br>
<br>
You've obviously put a lot of testing and comparison.  Get some hard numbers to go with it, you'ld be surprised what they listen to. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ucuedyen2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cuedyen2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#333333>(8/19/02 5:33:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=94.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: verant's pet class (rant)</span><hr size=1> Not being sarcastic - this is one of the better discussions I have read where people are stating vastly different opinions and it has not degraded into a mud slinging contest.<br>
<br>
We will all have different opinions - depending mostly on which classes we play the most or are more familiar with.  <br>
<br>
My first character and the one I enjoy the most is my Paladin.  That being said - I do enjoy the fact that I can get in groups in place of warriors now.  Do you have any idea how frustrating it is to not get in a grind group because you are not a &quot;tank&quot;.  Up until February I was still hearing this a lot.  Thats when I stopped trying and turned to smithing for my gaming enjoyment.<br>
<br>
I personally think verant is doing a fantastic job of balancing (again its all from your perspective).  From the hybrid upgrades to the removal of the 10% healing penalty for non-clerics.  That being said - they are not finished.  There will be more tweaks to casters (which does affect hybrids) and bards are being left for last.  <br>
<br>
It would not bother me would be to see the epic pet downgraded slightly (non-mage here) - then again the epic pet as is does not bother me either.  I will ask again - what percentage of 55+ mages have epics?  I really don't know.  <br>
<br>
Ignoring epic-pets.<br>
<br>
Monks and rougues should outdamage warriors - but neither should come close to taking the damage of a warrior.  IMHO, paladins and sk should come close (but not exceed) to taking a beating like a warrior but do no-where near the damage.  This allows &quot;grind&quot; groups to be viable with various classes.  I guess I am still sensitive to the fact that hybrids are or were unwanted classes in grind groups.  I was shocked a couple of weeks ago when a cleric I know (through a server chat channel) said they would never take a paladin or SK as a MT in a grind group because they were mana sponges.  I thought people had gotten over that. <br>

But lately people have wanted to play mages again, mostly because of the upgrades. And this also affects the number of mage epics which enter the game.<br>
<br>
Anyway, there will always be a place for warriors. The feeling that you need a warrior to tank for you in most places is so in-grown that it is hard to change. Just as the feeling that mages/wizards/necros and others don't add much to a grind group. Of course there will be some who see things differently, but there will always be a lot of people who don't. <p><html>

<br>
I think I can answer this for him.  I think what set Callon off was the fact that the mage pet could already kick the shiit out of him against mobs and varant decided to upgrade them even more by adding 1000 hp and increasing their damage.  Another small change is that the DS now casts almost as soon as the pet is cast, it used to take a random amount of time.  Granted, this was a bug, but it still somewhat effected the pet's effectiveness.  To be fair, I have heard him complain on numerous times about monks being able to tank better then wars, I think he just used mages b/c of the recent upgrades as I stated and the fact they were supposed to help &quot;balance&quot;.  I do think you made a good point with the numbers though man, would not be a bad idea at all. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><p align="center"><b><font size="2">Revnick Lifeweaver</font></b><font size="2">

A couple of months ago, after I got my epic, people would stop me as I ran around to ask what weapon I was holding and would be amazed when I told them what it was. I dont know how to explain it other then saying sometimes I felt like a rare spawn LOL.  I was amazed how many people still asked me for Clarity or a port after I got it LOL.<br>
Since the changes, I have noticed a great many mages have started poping up again which is great. It was kind of sad to see that people felt so down about a class they just quit playing them. What it comes down to is everyone wants to feel wanted, we all put large amounts of time into leveling these characters. It is a terrible feeling shouting for groups and not being able to get one, especially when you are a class that cant solo.  Even classes who can solo often like to group because Everquest is by nature a social game and being alone all the time can get old.  <br>
<br>

I'm for the most part going to be playing a necro alt in the next few months.  Why?  Because<br>
<br>
1. Have a hard time finding a group<br>
<br>
2. Only have a spand of time of about 2 hours a day, in which case by the time I get a group, I have to log.<br>
<br>
3. I can't solo so why should I get on just to frustrate myself?<br>
<br>
I would rather have a ranger in my group if I were anything other than a warrior.  He has buffs, sow (I know a lot of people have run 3 now though).  I agree that a lot of classes should outdamage a warrior.  A monk, all he does is damage.  A rogue all he does is a lot of sneaky damage.  <br>
<br>
I feel the balance is way screwed up from my standpoint, even though it might be skewed.  I also look at what the game has become.  I've heard that each mob in Vex Thal takes about 45 minutes to kill.  Even if it's half that, it's not a game I want to be a part of.  They've balanced the game so that only hardcare gamers have a shot at going certain places.  Only hardcore warriors have a shot at being good MT's.  Warriors, a class that can't solo and is being slowly replaced in groups?  Who wants to play that class?  Me?  I'm going to be playing a necro and selling trading gear for my warrior in hopes that we get an upgrade soon.<br>
<br>
Why did Callon go after mages specifically?  Because they are good at soloing and wanted in groups now, and are still getting upgrades.  The part of balancing that VI screwed up isn't the coding for the classes.  It's the gear, and the AC cap.  At 50 I grouped with an SK who has 5 less hitpoints than me and 20 higher AC.   His str was 235 (although it was buffed) and I couldn't keep aggro from him so I told him that he was the new MT for the group.  Think back to the kunark days when warriors had their own armor, with AC that couldn't be compared to on any other class.  That's all out the window now.<br>
<br>
  Warriors are being outdamaged so badly now that they need incredibly high aggro weapons to keep taunt.  Should they upgrade our damage?  No, not really, we want what everyone wants, for the d4mn taunt button to be fixed.  No one knows what it does now &quot;exactly&quot; anyway.  <br>
<br>
I know that I've been a little of topic, but the people in this board have taken time to read all of this and comment without flaming anyone.  I invite your comments, what should warriors do?  I've thought about this at length, some ideas, like &quot;Have warriors boycott EQ for a week.&quot; and such wouldn't hold, the &quot;uber&quot; warriors most likely wouldn't go along with it.  I feel complaining to VI makes up sound like whinners, and I don't think they listen anyway.<br>

Come on give me a break.  Are you saying that a warrior is only good for tanking extremely high end mobs?  What about us warriors who will never ever even see TOV?  I'm not forgetting about that part of the game but I think some people are definetely forgetting about some of the lower aspects of the game.  How are you going to get to 60 witout grinding?  It's an important part of the game.  WIth all the twinks running around nowadays I would not be happy to be a newbie warrior trying to make his way up.  The warriors in the &quot;uber&quot; guilds might not complain, because they have 7k HP's, primal weapons and 1500+ ac.  Are they better at tanking than a monk? Sure they are.  But I think those few warriors are the exception rather than the rule.  Maybe PoP will changes some of these things, but watch me hold my breath. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=294603 Profile </a>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The warrior is the definition of the tank class in Everquest.  They have high hitpoints, a high armour class, and deliver impressive damage with their weapons.  They can dual wield, single wield, bash, slam, kick, and taunt.  They can parry, riposte, double attack, disarm and dodge.  They are the only class which has almost every combat skill open to them for training, and receive them at lower levels than all classes but monks.<br>
<br>
However, despite this strength the warrior is not a solo class.  At lower levels they can solo very effectively, but as they enter the mid-levels from Level 20 onwards they are forced to seek out groups.  Since they have no magical abilities of their own, and large health, recovering after battle without the aid of a healer is a slow process.  By Level 25 they will not survive most fights without a backup healer.  Because of this the warrior is a grouping class, and a very necessary one.<br>
<br>
Warriors functions in groups are not only to deal damage.  They are generally also the pullers of the group.  Absorbing the damage from mobs as they lead them to the party.  Warriors must also be adept at watching who the mob is attacking and attracting the mobs attention so that the lighter armoured party members do not take excessive damage.<br>
<br>
Whilst most of the combat functions of the warrior are automated, this does not mean the warrior is a boring class to play.  The art of tagging and pulling mobs is in itself a challenging role, and a very important one at higher levels.<br>
<br>
Warriors are a very straightforward class who rely heavily on their party in order to perform well.  You will want to become good friends with a Cleric early in the game and develop a trusting relationship with them, as it will be they who keep you alive in the levels to come.  This class is a fun one to play to beat things up and laugh in the enemy's face as it tries to wound you.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The Monk class is one with both great strengths and weaknesses.  A specialist form of melee, the Monk focuses completely on its offensive abilities, primarily using only ones hands and feet to wound the enemy.  Monks can dish out more direct melee damage than any other class - period.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> There are some drawbacks to being a Rogue.  They have much lower hitpoints than the warrior, and since they cannot wear platemail, also have a much lower armour class.  This greatly reduces their ability to tank, and without a healer around or someone to take the blows, a Rogue can die very swiftly.  Because of this they are generally poor soloers, and forced to group.  Unlike Monks, Rogues get no skills to help them recover health faster, and their downtime is almost as long as a warriors if travelling alone.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Everyone always needs a Tank, so as a warrior you really don't have to worry about finding work. They are the strongest melee class and, with a furry of offensive skills like, dual wield, slam, kick, bash, double attack, and, riposte they make some the best fighters. Warriors are adept at using all types of weapons and with the capability to duel wield are often seen bashing there enemies with both hands. As if this wasn't good enough Warriors can look forward to some pretty sweet disciplines at high levels. <br>
<br>
However with all of these positives come some negatives. Warriors become basically a group only character after level 25 because of their reliance on healers. This minor drawback makes Warriors supreme Group characters but, below average Solo characters. <br>
<br>
In order to be a become a powerful warrior, learning the art of grouping is a must. Warriors are the work horses of any groups. They are often times supposed to pull the enemy and, also absorb most of the damage due to their high hit points. Obviously, Warriors must also deal massive amounts of damage. Basically a warriors job to kill the enemy while making sure non of his fellow group members, ie the casters, get to badly hurt. It's a serious job and they were born to fill it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
I personally see nothing wrong with a Sk/Paladin having near the same ac/hp as a warrior - as long as they cannot do near as much damage.<br>
<br>
Same way i see nothing wrong with ranger/monk/rogue outdamaging a warrior if they have nowhere near the ac/hp.<br>
<br>
To me this is balanced.  Overall BEST TANK is still the warrior - can dish it out and take it.  If warriors were upgraded to the point that their ac/hp were far superior to sk/paladin this would return us to where a warrior is wanted for every grind group (and as far as my recent experience still is).  Having a certain class or core group of classes exclusively wanted in grind groups is not balanced. <br>
<br>
Hard to write without starting flames - hmmm.  Grind groups are limited to 6 people.  There are 14 (I believe) classes.  It appears a majority of the people grind in certain zones (ugh) - so with balance all classes entering a zone will have a harder time finding a group.<br>
<br>
I think warriors are sensitive to this because the ones I know used to go into a zone LFG and would get groups immediately - while I sat there for 2-3 hours and was unwanted.  Now groups have a wider range of viable classes and don't &quot;hold&quot; a spot for a certain class to come along (well clerics may be an exception).  Do I feel sorry that warriors are lumped in with everyone else - nope.  I enjoy playing my paladin as much as others enjoy their warriors.  I want to get in groups just as much and the only place paladins have a chance at fiting in is as a tank.  You sure dont want a paladin for damage output.<br>
<br>
Saying all that, I hope VI upgrades all epics.  To me the epic should be the pinnacle of a classes achievement.<br>

Not to deal out the most of it. That's what the rest of the group is for. So perhaps a warrior should get a minor hp upgrade, but this upgrade is only really needed for the uber guilds who already have MA's with around 8000 or 9000 hp. A warrior in a &quot;normal&quot; guild will most likely only have around 5000 hp. <br>
I do understand why warriors are so upset, don't get me wrong. I also understand why clerics are so upset. Those two classes have lost their monopoly on being the primary invites to a group along with enchanters. At the moment almost any other melee can tank as well as a warrior in a grind group. Good for everyone but warriors. In some cases shamans heal even better than clerics now (combine slow, regen, buffs and heals) so clerics &quot;only&quot; have Complete Healing that is wanted. Just think about how upset clerics are that some druids/shamans want CH now as well. And when was the last time you really needed a CH in a grind group outside of Luclin ? <br>
Am I all that sad that mostly warriors and clerics have lost so much of their power ? Yes and no. Part of me feels kind of good that they have entered the world of the mortals again. But part of me is also sad that they now get to see what so many others have had to go through for years. I long since gave up on sitting in a zone looking for a group for hours. If a group isn't gotten within 10 to 15 minutes a twink is pulled out. I was really amazed at how easy it was to get groups with my cleric, warrior and enchanter after I had played my mage for so long. But my mage will be my main as long as I play EQ. Just as he has always been. That mages are more popular now (well, at least at times) is only good. Right now I don't think there is any class in EQ that is &quot;broken&quot; like rogues and rangers were once. Look at those classes now, they are really holding their own. <br>
In a perfect world all the chars would be equal in power, but sadly it isn't like that. All people can do is try to make the best of what they have while also trying to get improvements made. Karana knows I have whined a lot about mages in the past. Now I think mages are just about right, as are several other classes. Some tweaks are needed here and there, but in general I think the balance is better than it has been in a long time. <p><html>
