<br>
my ranger is one of my latest creations (decided to make one after i saw a ranger get 2  1599 damage bow crits in 1 fight)<br>
<br>
i have powerleveled up and have gotten to 48 in 5 playdays, will be 49 tomorrow.  just wondering if the bow damage increases greatly once i hit 51.  i read that we get a stationary double damage bonus at that level.  i am currently sporting a blessed faydark thunderbolt (OMFG, talk about some range!!) and using tolans bracer summoned arrows and am hitting average in the 40's, high has been 55 and highest crit has been 88.<br>
<br>
i know that 55 will be a big level for trueshot, but will max bow damage increase every level like a rogues backstab skill??<br>
<br>
any info would be appreciated, thank ya<br>

As your lvls/skills increase then the potential DMG will increase aswell <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
51 and 55 are the lvls I noticed Bow DMG increase the most...<br>
Think my highest crit to date has been 575<br>
This was without using TS dis and with a summoned arrow with Bow of the Underfoot<br>
Think I was 56 at the time<br>
Now I generally am hitting for on average of 150/200ish<br>
With Dis on can vary between 200/500<br>
Think my fave arrow hit at the moment has to be either 200Crit on Tantor (killshot) or when a DE Wiz tried to pk me in Gfay... I slapped on TS and chased him round Faydark.... I was critting on him for 400+ (crits also stun) he went down in aonly a few arrows <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The areas where you'll see the biggest affect are 1) the bonus at 51+, which results in double damage versus stationary, non-rooted MOBs, and 2) Trueshot discipline at level 55. Also, DEX is the overwhelmingly biggest factor in calculating bow damage of any kind, including TS disc.<br>
<br>
As good as it is, TS doesn't become a substitute for normal melee damage until your character reaches level 60 and achieves the Archery Mastery class AA skill, preferably with Combat Fury already attained as an archetype AA skill. That's when the really huge numbers start rolling in. At level 58, even with maxed STR/DEX, a BFT and 10 damage arrows, I've never had a TS session that resulted in more DPS than I could have inflicted using melee weapons instead.<br>
<br>
There's a great discussion of AA skills, as well as strategies for advancing them in a way that makes the most sense for your individual play style, on The Ranger's Glade at the following URL:<br>

<br>
Personally, I can't wait for 60 so I can start getting my AA build knocked out. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><font size=2, face=legends, arial>

Dex effects bow dmg very greatly.  The 4 steps are at 51 you get the double dmg modifier for stationary targets.  Trust me, nothing makes you more upset than burning a trueshot disc and a caster decides to root the mob.  At 55 you get that trueshot disc which is alot of fun.  You will get some fun crits no matter what equipment you use.  My current high is a 598 crit, but I got it in HoT and scored a 578 on the next shot, and then a 486 two shots later.  I will say this, so far that is the only time I have ever outdamaged my melee with my bow, but there are occasions where it's a more appropriate means of dmg.  The next 2 steps are the AA skill Endless Quiver, which allows you to use the better arrows in the game instead of summoned or expensive crafted arrows.  And then the AA skill of Archery Mastery.  I saw a Ranger on our server score a 1200 crit with a Ntov Bow, bow of the silver fang, and Archery Mastery 2.  That will be fun, but I'm still about 20 aa away from either of that.  I currently use a Blessed Faydark Thunderbolt, hopefully to be replaced by a Bow of Doom soon.  In the end, a Ranger with am 3, EQ, and a very high end bow is hard to outdamage if the situation allows for bow usage.  <br>

First you need an awesome bow best dropable is BFTB but there are few better no drop ones ratio is 30/38 with mods. Also most of the 1-2k criting rangers are probably lvl 60 because of the aa abilities involved (EQ and AM3). If you use BFTB + EQ with dmg 12 arrows &amp; AM3 wich doubles all hits buy there normal damage have maxed dex/str and very high atk with Eagle eye and use trueshot disc to a non rooted mob in the back (preferably a lrage target like a giant i seem to get my best crits off large targets) and hit a double dmg bow shot you can easily get 1-2k crits MAYBE even in the 3k area if you pray to tunare a lot <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
The Windstriker (POA bow) is 45/60, and procs an unresistable 100 damage 6 second stun.  Obviously the best for PVP as it nearly has the same effect as One Hundred Blows (tranquil staff).  Unfortunately no one on Rallos-Zek has The Windstriker as the frickin' shimmering pearl is **** SO **** rare off the Eye of Veeshan in Plane of Air <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Most the other bows will be about the same, 30/40, 30/38, 33/35.. etc.  Will notice, but not all that much especially after haste cloak from sky, fleeting quiver, etc... all of them will shoot rediculously fast <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Ranger damage isn't really all that noticeable via archery until level 59 with AM3... then it's destructive, and easily out damage almost every class in the game (including wizards).  The only one that comes close are monks, and it's not by much.  The constant onslaught of 500+ arrow shots with 1 - 3 second intervals between shots is hard to beat.<br>
<br>
Arrows have super low aggro too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
