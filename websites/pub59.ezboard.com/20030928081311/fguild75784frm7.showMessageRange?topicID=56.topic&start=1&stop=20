<br>
Abridged version: Lildian wanted a MQ Thurg BP and Cheye said s/he had one. Cheye wanted the 20k up front and Lildian wanted to give the PP to an intermediary to hold it. We asked Cheye to post a link to the item in chat so we could prove that he had it and he pleaded ignorance. At this point, I asked Lildian and Cheye to join a chat channel so we could discuss this. After all, Lildian wanted the tunic, and I wanted to help him get it as safely as possible. He had already been scammed in the past and evaded scammage another time before. Lildian asked Cheye to send a link to the item to him so he could have proof that Cheye had it to be MQ'd. Cheye told him that s/he could not link items that were NO DROP(according to Lildian, whom I believe).<br>
<br>
I do think Vermeretrix handled the situation very well, so hats off to Verm =) Keep up the good work. Cheye, I do not understand what you thought you could gain by scamming other people.<br>
<br>
Now I also think it's possible that Cheye is a good person and has a severe lack of understanding of the English language and thereby did not understand what we were saying too well. If this is the case, then I apologize. Feel free to post in Cheye's defense.<br>
<br>
Below are logs. I believe they speak for themselves. I did not have a chance to log the first part of the chat, because I do not log all of my conversations, so here is the beginning (notice I link two items that are NO DROP):<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://h00045a586549.ne.client2.attbi.com/pub/kinare/cheyechat.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Tells and such are in a different window, so I apologize if this looks a bit strange. After this I tried to edit out the random zone/channel chat. Enjoy!<br>

Thanks for the warning, Kinare.  He does sound like he's not a native english speaker, so its possible that he misunderstood, but that aside, whole thing looks pretty fishy.  He is certainly stubborn, thats for sure.... I can't understand why anyone wouldn't post a link to save their name, no matter how bothered he may have felt by your pressing him.  <br>
<br>
Yet another good lesson in taking precautions.<br>

I have a few questions:<br>
<br>
1) Who is Saton?<br>
