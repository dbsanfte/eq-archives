I ran towards Oasis with him hot on my tail when a wayward Beastlord cast a light heal on me.  Dorn then attacked him and he was getting pummeled.  I figured Hey, he cast a heal on me so he must want me to live, so I didnt bother to stop and help and then thought how noble he was to die and be bound in Shar Vahl.  (only thought he was noble for a short time as he sent me tells thinking I was someone else, saying &quot;thanks for the train @#%$.&quot;)  I finally made it to zone (clue, your screen freezes and then when you can move again you see a message like this; &quot;You have entered the Oasis of Marr&quot;) <br>
<br>
After a lil shouting in zone, &quot;level 60 rogue looking for Lockjaw group&quot;  I got some nasty /ooc messages like &quot;hahahahaha yea right&quot;  and &quot;hey you must be lost, dork.&quot;  Things like this make me think the people in Oasis arent friendly !  So I headed to the dock and I saw a Young Ronin and I think &quot;HEY, I saw that movie with Bob DeNiro ! (I like to call him Bob instead of Robert, kinda makes me feel like I know him)  So I figure this must be some bad @#%$ quest about to happen so I hailed him, nothing happens except he attacks me.  I was scared becuase I didnt have 8-10 cleric heal rotation yet, and then all these people stood there waitng for me to wipe (Is a one person death considered a wipe ?) I got off a lucky chaotic back stab because he died.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, Lockjaw is next, but I need tatctics and strategy knowledge.<br>
<br>
1) have to avoid wandering SG's  (SG = Sand Giants, not Sirens Grotto as Sirens Grotto cant wander a zone)<br>
<br>
2) have to avoid &quot;SPECS TO DOCK&quot;<br>
<br>
3) have to avoid n00bs &quot;have any gear I can have, Im a n00b?&quot;<br>
<br>
4) have to avoid inspections and link requests to my gear becuase I hate taking time to model while Im killing.<br>
<br>
5) Does Lockjaw Rampage ?<br>
<br>
6) Does he summon ?<br>
<br>
7) Will I need weaponshield ranger?<br>
<br>
Any info someone can add would be greatly appreciated.<br>

Considering the time we spent sitting in Kael + Wakening Lands, for a prepared and ready raid, that equated to a lot of time spent doing nothing.<br>

Im most certain the huge time gap thats on log between pulls is the time they were waiting for more members to show up.<br>

<br>
On the Contrary, just because you don't feel 50 is good enough for attempting Idol/AoW doesn't mean that I do.  50 is fine for me.  You can believe whatever you wish to believe, we were not waiting for more to show up to pull Idol.  We had atleast 10 clerics on our CH rotation, and a couple twinks there for extra heals.  I certainly am not one to wait around for more people when I think I have the necessary forces, as well as when I have a guild that can kill AoW easily waiting on me.  <br>
<br>
Whatever time between Statue and Idol we took, had nothing to do with gathering more forces.  One thing I don't do is lie, you can say or think whatever you want.  But I will stick to the fact, that we were not waiting waiting for more people to show up.  Admittantly, some of my attention during that time might have been focused on getting the late comers in camp.  I mean who am I to deny people from coming to a raid, but the main part was making sure the pullers, clerics, tanks, melee all knew what they were doing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>A courtesy which you did not have the consideration to show us when there were 192 people in Ssra while we were attempting to kill Emp.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Two things here.  First, we had originally showed up in Ssra to do the Cursed Cycle, which Ascent showed up as well.  We thought they were going to do Emperor after you and we were waiting on Cursed Trigger to spawn.  Contrary to belief, when you all were behind us at AL and I had asked you all to back up so we could make our final attempt.  I was told that you all had learned to deal with lag and that I should get used to it.  But generally, I bet if we were up there attempting emperor and cursed trigger was about to spawn with another guild also watching cursed trigger, I bet you would of been waiting on cursed as well.<br>
<br>
But, just the same, if one of the EiE/DA leaders had sent me a tell asking if we could zone out to help reduce lag, I probably would of done it out of the same respect.  Just as Jeet had asked us to leave the zone if we wiped on Idol for your attempt/kill.  And we did.   <p><HR Width="25%" Align="Left">

Sure we could turn it off, but it was mid-raid as your members knew.  Things may be said on either guild(s) behalf, but please reign your people in if you wish decent consideration by other guilds in return.  Who dealt &quot;first blow&quot; be disregarded (i honestly dunno how this all started)... but actions from here out will mean the most.<br>
<br>
The time we moved toward AL after your 3rd wipe... If you remember, raid channels were down at the time you tried AL.  If there were things said in /say or /ooc, it was *extremely* minimal.  There's necessary spam of course when spells go off as we were killing mobs...  But we were DAMNED quiet for raid channels being down with two guilds, and the handful of /say were dealt with harshly.  I know you only pointed it out to show we were very near you guys... So my point in this?  That while waiting for you to finish off AL... we had the decency to remain silent out of courtesy... <br>
Call it as you wish for us moving up toward AL during your final attempt of the near all day campaign, but at least were not dis-courteous of your raid while doing so.  I do not feel us moving up was discourteous though... someone please post how long you had been in the attempts.  There is nothing you guys did wrong/discourteous to us that I remember from that night, nor do I recall us being rude/discourteous to you.  But if you disagree with us moving up to attempt the kill after your x attempt, that's an opinion many guilds on server are split on... do you take over after so many hours?  In other respects though we were not rude during this time.  I cannot answer for personal dialogues you may have had.<br>
<br>
As for the Kael incident with your Idol attempt... sure we were there, I mean we wanted AoW too.  Getting tells from your members like &quot;wtf are you guys here for?&quot; &quot;get the hell out&quot; before you even started your Idol attempt was uncalled for.<br>
<br>
Guess my point overall is this...<br>
there's an obvious friction here from somewhere between Anthology and DA/EIE and other guilds.  Like all threads, for the posts you make, flames and defenses occur.  You did not start your topic as something intended to incense DA/EIE.  It was instead a way of lessening the implications that your own guild did not kill the mob.  (i.e. you might have just said you did not kill him yet, but ... &quot;you're close... you can feel it&quot; etc.  no reason for the added part except to make excuse).<br>
<br>
For what I posted above, I'm sure you'd have responses for.  We could all be more courteous, and when conflicts arise let the officers hash out what will happen.  On Msg boards when you use a hidden/unobtrusive means of putting others down for your own means, people see a pattern.  Just realize that people read your comments on this board as well as others. <br>
Our alliance is guilty of some posts that incite others, as are almost all guilds.  Just realize it is all, as a guildleader.  Unveiled potshots are bound to get a response after a while. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/bguild75784.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eelyen>Eelyen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#333333>(10/24/02 3:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=81.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re</span><hr size=1> I wasn't actually going to reply to this thread again because I realized I was arguing a battle that nobody was going to win, but Vanden you posted a very respectable post.<br>

<br>
Yes, I pointed it out due to the fact you were so close to us.  Honestly, the /say's don't bother me at all.  We were using channels at the time I believe, atleast they were working for us.  The /say's didn't bother me, it was your proximity to our raid that was bothersome at the time.  That close basically put the numbers in the range of 100-120 in a very contained area, and that is alot of packet information for everyone to be recieving.  <br>
<br>
Hence, on some of the folks that I have who don't have DSL/Cable, it was causing a severe lag issue for them.<br>
<br>
I honestly don't mind you moving up on AL on us, Dalla had gave me a tell a few hours before saying you all would leave us alone for a while and let us do our thing.  And you did, we wiped twice in that time and we wanted to make a good 3rd attempt.  But the lag was just sort of horrendous for some, that we only did a practice on MTing and didn't actually engage him.<br>
<br>

I don't blame ya, there was never any disagreement between Jeet and myself as to why you were there.  It's days later when I'm in tells with one of your members that says to me, &quot;I don't even know why we do Aow anymore, people just get bored&quot; that does throw a wrench into my view sometimes.  But none the less, I'm not going to blame another guild for wanting a mob after another guild tries it and fails.<br>

This I have warned my guildmembers about not doing.  And I will give you my complete assurance, that if you screenshot one of them sending a tell like that and email it to me daniel.young@afit.edu.  I will probably remove them very shortly afterwards.  I ask for a screen shot, because I do have to protect my members from old grudges that may use my open statement as a way to get back at someone.<br>

Well said and is exactly the reason I apologized.  Which I've see very few apologies by anyone publicly, in my near 4 years of EQ.  I'm not a person that tries to invoke harsh feelings.  Sometimes I may feel stepped on and feel provoked, but those feelings for me don't last beyond but a short while.  I don't hold grudges...can't more like it.<br>
<br>
In my final workds, after 2 wipes to unslowed Idol last night, the 3rd attempt went down flawless.  Although AoW warped on us during pull unexpectantly so we lost some momentum in that battle, although we faired well.  It's only a matter of time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I don't think he gave a @#%$ who the top 5 guilds were, he just wanted to see a good fight.  <br>
<br>
Why does he want to see a good fight between some guilds that are relativily close to eachother? <br>
<br>
He's milking your disdane for each other, while he and his guild get you all to fight it up, while they sneak up and gank your mobs while your bringing this stuff up in the zone. <br>
<br>
It wouldn't suprise me either if he started this knowing some people are outspoken, hoping they would be asked to leave thier guilds for their actions, and he picks them up in his guild and pass the guilds that were bickering.<br>
<br>
Not sure if Slink is a characer on RN, but i'm assuming he's not.<br>
<br>
I hate to say it, but it's a great stratagy and I would have to commend him if this is what his intentions are.  <br>
<br>
This is just my thoughts on his actions, I don't mind ur all bickering over what you and others can do.<br>

And Eelyen, I wont count Anthology above EK before you are able to kill something like AoW or harder that we can not. Rising fast is good I suppose, but you can fade away just as fast if you dont live up to your members expectations.  <p>&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=131568&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Belcarl&lt;/A&gt;<br>
