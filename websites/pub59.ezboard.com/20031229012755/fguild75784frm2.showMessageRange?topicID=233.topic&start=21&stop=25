In attemping to improve their product's appeal they are doing the same thing they are accusing Sony/Verant whomever of doing. Making a product that appeals to the masses. <br>
<br>
I could have picked a better example for the drinking husband. To restate the point I was attemping to make is that if one spouse was doing something the other felt was in  excess and the two of them couldn't work that issue with the behavoir out with some sort of compromise, then they are to blame not the activity.<br>
<br>
To respond to your last paragraph, I agree 48 hours isn't the place to go for news. But I do still feel that in general a trend towards that type of journalism instead of focusing on facts prevails. The media directly caused a change in pattern of the targets to be picked in the sniper incident for instance. The media influences wars, who you pick for politcal officer etc. <br>
<br>
I feel that the news media as such has a responsibility to report facts first, and to make clear when they venture into the area of opinion. Instead they are reporting and stating criminals who are not yet tried as guilty by their labeling. The woman who was on video tape hitting her child was tried in the media long before it was handled by the authorities. <br>
<br>
I guess using alleged or suspected is too much to ask these days though... it appears to be far easier just to sue for damages later on. <br>
<br>
edit - got this from the 48 hours site - a description of what their program is supposed to be. I figured it might spark some discussion in relation to this thread. <br>
&quot;<br>
(CBS) When 48 Hours premiered in 1988, Time magazine said it could be the most innovative prime-time news series since 60 Minutes debuted in 1968. In its unique approach, 48 Hours delves into a single subject, examining it from multiple angles with its saturation coverage and action-driven style. 48 Hours Investigates is now in its 16th season. The broadcast has received critical acclaim reflected in almost 20 Emmy awards, a George Foster Peabody Award, and an Ohio State Award. <br>
<br>
48 Hours Investigates airs Fridays at 8 p.m. ET/PT. Check local listings. &quot;<br>

I know there are a lot of people out there that dont know what everquest is.  I have mentioned the game numerous times and people havnt even heard of it before.  That said, I think back to the Metallica incident with Napster and the big stink they made which drew all kinds of attention to Napster and eventually caused all the changes, etc.  All it basically did was made more people aware of it.  Sony must have loved the special 48 hours had b/c thats free advertisement to a group of people that probably wouldnt get any.  Now I know the 48 hours special didnt get as much hype as the whole Napster incident, but its the idea of it.  The mother makes a big stink about the product which peaks people interest b/c as sick as this is I know people probably thought &quot;if someone killed themselves over a game, it must be damn good&quot; and just the fact that some people may just try it out.  I saw a special on married with children once and they said the show didnt take off until a mother watched it with her children and made a big deal and then everyone wanted to watch it.  Everquest has already reached a lot of people, but its kinda scary to think how it would be if more people learn about it and all the different type games that are coming out b/c there will be more people addicted (not everyone mind you).  I know this is a totally random thought and may not happen, but thought I would share. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <p>&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Revnick Lifeweaver&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt; <br>

Blame music industry<br>
A kid kills himself over a tv show... Blame tv industry<br>
A kid/adult kills himself over a game..  Blame EQ? I think not...<br>
<br>
Blame mom...  She knew he had a problem.  EQ was not a problem when he was playing only towards the end.  He was sick...  Now how in the world did a person with his medical problem end up with a gun?  He was screaming for attention from his mother, she did not give to him so he turned to eq.  So all of the blame falls back on the mom.  I feel bad that he had to commit suicide, but everyone knew he had a illness.  He grew up with this illness and when he died they kept comming back on his illness, the only one not to was his mother.  She did not live with him so she does not know.  Had she paid a little bit more attention to what her son was doing she might know.  <br>
<br>
/sigh  Pretty bad when you have to blame something on everyone but yourself when you know where the real problem lays.<br>
