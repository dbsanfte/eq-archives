I only know the name from seeing his corpses in Hate while I've been there and his name appearing on a /who list when I'm there.<br>
<br>
I can name two times we've been up there to do mini bosses while Apothes was also up there and not once did he interfere either time.  <br>
<br>
To hate and brand someone an evil farmer because he grinds in a zone where a rare piece for an epic drops is just asinine.  From what it sounds like, and what I've experinced, he doesn't go up there for just the named mobs, but if they're in his way, he's going to kill them.  By that nature should I be pissed at the people that grind Fear for the armor drops and take out the Broken Golem when it spawns because they happen to be there?  Or the people that kill VS for the class legs that held me up for months in getting my own epic?  No, and it makes no difference if it's group or solo.  He could let them rot, in fact it sounds like he plans to from now on.  And I don't blame him a bit.  The mages that berated him shot themselves in the foot.  He's not going to stop his grinding or killing the spawn.  And he's under no obligation to, all you've succeeded in doing is cutting off another possibility if you can't get up to Hate every day and check on the spawns.  Congratulations.<br>
<br>
As for the person calling him a liar about someone offering 250k for the staff.  Well here's the link to the thread where it's posted clear as day.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=37676898&replies=11">vnboards.ign.com/message....replies=11</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

Just because you don't see it doesn't mean it isn't happening, and to assume so only makes you look foolish.  <br>
<br>
He put up a buyout option that he really didn't believe anyone would go for, but they did.  It happens.  And it's done all the time, when I don't really want to part with something I'll put an outragious price on it.  If someone wants it that badly, then more power to them.  To be honost, I'ld find putting a King raid together a thousand times easier then getting 250k together.  And comparing the difficulty is apples and oranges.  Yea, maybe it requires more people or more skill to get down and kill the king.  But he's gonna respawn two hours later, and he's going to drop the piece you want every single time.  The Magi doesn't even come close to that. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=26254>Master Brokenfang Silverhart</a> <BR>

In fact, one of the problem is that you can't sell your phat lewt in the bazaar since it requires a  MQ and you get flamed when you try to.<br>
<br>
The chardok king is more than  a fair trade. Both 1 group encounters, tougher for the king but timing is important for the magi. The cleric epic piece is more desired though and that's what balances it out.<br>

I was offerin the staff for King as a way of letting some mage get one of the Pain in the butt parts of her/his epic instead of letting it ROT like high end guilds do with no drop stuff they dont need.

I can put togather a king raid that is not a priblem I wasent lookin for money though so this was a way of both parties getting something in return the buyouts were for fun like I said before I never expected anyone to do them but I guess insane amouts of money to me are not insane to other people.<br>

Dont try and fool people. Your an epic farmer  point blank. Thats why you have 2 staves . Clearly shows your lust for plat. As far as hate being your &quot;grind zone &quot; cool more power too ya ,  great accomplishments there. No critique on you there,  but to kill epic mobs to sell for plat  is worse than a band or roaving MB wizards that  blast Kunark dragons to sell epic peices.  <br>
Hrmm now lets see. As i mentioned in my last post i  have been up with 2 raids just to help other mages get the Magi while you killed him  during the raid. Magi isnt hard to kill, I have the staff. Problem is Greedy farmers like you, that  jump on the chance to make profit on another class. And send the average mage back 3 days  just becuase some lame had to kill a mob he wants to make a quick buck on .So you want to talk to the 2 mages the you basically screwed out of their raid to get their epic staff???<br>
Look how you  jumped all over me, defending yourself all to the end of the world.  If you  werent all about the plat then you wouldnt have gone around posting on every RN board i can find. Geez  grow up and be honest.   <br>
<br>
Remember  saying &quot; If i wanted king badly enough i could get my friends to kill&quot;   <br>
Ya buddy  sure looks like thats an option your excersizing there.. I never knew you and had no problem  till you try and blackmail the class i chose to play. <br>
Hey here's a thought for ya !  Why dont you get out of hate and go make some &quot;friends&quot;, and go kill the king yourself! <br>
Sounds to me like you've spent way too long locked away in Hate and forgot how to be social and understand  the value of a player behind the character . Not  the cold hard plat that you where so greedily after. As far as your spasms on this board after a confrontaion and dramatizing it all so personally, well good luck to ya  in what ever you do.  I only speak for myself but lost any and all respect for  you  in your ignorant epic farming ventures. I rarely come  to this board  but this attempt to  blackmail mages 3 and 4x's what the staff is worth , I had to call out and voice myself. I can do that, and I did. End of story.<br>
<br>
The very fact the Apothes can even single pull this mini boss clearly shows that he can work around him and he does not need to be killed &quot; because its in my way&quot;. So lets recap this coversation:<br>
<br>
Leave the Magi alone dude. People actually do plan entire raids on this guy, and to have to ask you to leave him up is purely ludicrious. /tell Apothes  &quot; um hey there,  think you can leave magi up,   guild x and some friends are gonna try and get him  in the next 5 hours..&quot; Get real dude,  just leave him be. You would have alot less nice people  bad mouthing ya on RN. Try thinking outside of your little bubble of Hate and think about other people  that have been working on thier epics 1year +, but only to have to contend with a lame of your nature.<br>
 <br>
Good luck in  whatever you chose to do from here, oh, and try not to make any more people ill at ya. Kinda hard to get help when ya screw people over . Mmk? thx<br>

If he was out to get a quick buck, why the hell would he put it up at 250k? That is so obiviously a joke amount for one piece of the epic and if he was just looking for money he would have sold it for a hell of a lot less.  Also, your callling him an epic farmer when he has gotten a total of three, I believe, staves from hate over a year plus period? Also throw in the fact that that was ONE piece of ONE epic, an &quot;epic farmer&quot; would have multiple pieces of different epics.  I understand your frustration b/c I know its hard to get people to go up to hate just for you, but the man has every right to grind up there and as he has said, that is his normal route and I know its true b/c I have been up there with him and seen him pull that route a couple times.  Lets be honest, he basically clears that route with 4 characters.  4 characters can take out a lot of stuff, but I am sure there are places in hate that he can not do or is not used to doing.  <br>
<br>
As far as killing the king and him having friends, he has asked me already to help him and I know of a lot of plp that will be willing to go with him b/c of how nice and friendly he is.  Personally, I think he doesnt want to have to burden his friends with that task when he feels he has an item that he can barter for what he needs, but thats just me guessing.  Also, while you have the right to call out the price he put up, he also has every right to sell the MQ for whatever he chooses to.  The part that I will always find funny is that he doesnt farm that spawn like everyone seems to be saying b/c if he did, he would have gotten a hell of a lot more staves by now.   <p><p align="center"><b><font size="2">Revnick Lifeweaver</font></b><font size="2">

There's just no difference to me.  He's selling a rare drop/item that is going to benefit someone else, just like the person that is selling any of the above items.  Do we call the above people evil names?  I mean, they did win something that they obviously couldn't use/need but are selling it at insane prices to benefit themselves.  More power to you and I hope you continue to barter/trade future Mage staffs instead of letting them rot.   <p>Rythar Spirittracker<BR>

<br>
1. Ok so it was my bad asking for the king in excange for the saff you live and learn.<br>
<br>
2. I can do king just havent becuase cleric epic not on my priority list atm but will when I get a few more things acomplished.<br>
<br>
3. was my bad I suppose for killin the magi/rest of minis in hopes for ranger stone for my friends. and various rangers that ask me about one off and on<br>
<br>
4. Really was my bad killing the magi 20 min before server was reset when no one was up there for him guess mages don't want the extra staff that otherwise would not have dropped.<br>
<br>
5. my bad for putting the first staff up for auction after my friend said he has not started epic and I might as well sell so another mage can get it.<br>
<br>
6. and really my bad for all the times i have killed magi when h has not had the staff I guess mages would rather let him sit up till they can get thier @#%$ up there to reset his timer.<br>
<br>
7. for why I killed him when he had last staff refer to number 3.<br>
<br>
8. reset him again this week with no staff after bring up 8+ hours damn I should be shot.<br>
<br>
9. and the last my bad is for namin a insane buyout price and being a man of honor having to honor it when someone actually tells me they will pay it<br>
<br>
So I guess in retrospect I am a baddd baddd person. To remedy this I will leave the magi up. and will kill the other minis for ranger stones for the people I know that need them, and the mages can get thier butts up there and clear the magi when he does not have staff I used to let mages know when he was up and if he had staff or not now I will just keep my mouth shut it's not my concern anymore. I am such a @#%$ for trying to help =(<br>
<br>
Good luck on your epic mages and save your money to pay the guilds that farm PoA crowns if your not in a decent guild.<br>
<br>
and to all of you that sell epic pieces you should be ashamed of yourself and learn from what happend to me so you do not go down dark path with no hope of redemption. (specially the mages that farmed the hell out of jade reavers for the druid epic yes I know you were doin it as I have said I have a few friends that are mages you should be ashamed of yourselves. killing mobs for the simple fact of keeping druids from getting them and selling them a piece to thier epic)<br>
<br>
But I digress. if I missed any points they will jsut have to wait. <p>Apothes 60th pally

I have been in a guild with him and he got our cleric to go to hate and loot almost all her cleric hate gear.<br>
<br>
You all that say he is farming this are idiots...<br>
<br>
/tell player001 Please dont kill the mobs in Hate so I can get my guild/friends/family/gm's to help me kill them for my epic.<br>
<br>
and if you kill them , Since I told you a week in advance, your an @#%$.<br>
<br>
<br>
LMAO.... who do you think you are..<br>
<br>
Who do you think you are in thinking you can tell someone who and who not to kill...<br>
<br>
He grinds up there... he has for the year plus I have known he was alive.<br>
<br>
People who grind in any other group have the first come first serve ability.<br>
<br>
If you want the piece you rather get the camp and kill it your self, ask if you can help and loot it, or just buy it like everyone else.<br>
<br>
MAGES are one of the biggest farming class in the game.<br>
When I sent a tell to the :mage channel on RN, I asked...<br>
<br>
/tell mage channel Can anyone help me get a jade reaver for my epic. I have donate some plat for the help.<br>
<br>
/farmingmage01 tells you. I have one 20k if you want. I get them all the time.<br>
<br>
/farmingmage02 tells you. I have one for 15k I get one last night with my group. 3 dropped hehe...<br>
<br>
/farmingmage03 tells you. I have one for 18k no trades..<br>
<br>
<br>
This is no joke. Ask any ranger/druid out there.. and anyone that has bought there reaver knows that a mage is 75% of the time the looter behind it.<br>
<br>
Mages dont even need anything from CoM TMK and yet they sit there and farm them day and night. Sell them for 20k and dont cry about it..<br>
<br>
SO SCREW YOU MR.WHINNY MAGE.<br>
<br>
You sound like one of those little kids that hits other kids and laughs then when they hit you back ..... you cry to the teacher.<br>
<br>
/finger /rude /STFU<br>
<br>
I am tired of whinny classes and people who whine when there are the ones that have to pay for something.<br>
<br>
Try being a non soloable class for once and try and get the help to do you epic or to try and raise the money to by pieces.<br>
<br>
It makes you look at things alot different.<br>

Get your facts straight.<br>
Mages end up with jade reavers because they need a drop off Neh'ashir for their epic quest. In order to spawn Neh'ashir, you need to kill the ph reavers.<br>

Not that this whole topic matters anyway as mages will probably quit EQ in droves if the nerf goes through and there's nothing to make up for it in PoP.<br>

Neh`Ashiir needs to be killed  for the mage epic in CoM Sometimes 2-3 times as the drop isnt that common. And you have to kill  a Black Reaver  to spawn her. And on the way up to the Neh` Reaver you have to kill another Reaver. Neh` Ahsiir is on a 2 hour timer. Most people grind on other stuff in wait.  Jade reavers drop, more commonly then people think. Do mages lay in wait and prey apon reavers so sell as you suggested? No. Did mages farm the Neh` Ashiir reaver for 1 straight week to get everybody a torch from her? Yes.  Do any of the dozen+ mages that where there like CoM and just can't wait to go back ? No. I helped a guildy with one I got and I had another saved for my own alt's epic.  Didnt the mages go farm Nezzekenezer and Phurzicon  for the Burning Embers in the same way in BW? Yes.<br>
And Slixen Klix in BW also for the Dirt of the Underfoot? Yes. Did'nt they also make sure to get the Tear of Errolsi from Captain Rottgrime in OT? Yes.<br>
<br>
The point to actively sit in a zone and whack a spawn to sell for MQ every time it pops is what I pointed out. There is no other way to &quot;mask&quot; this. Even through, &quot;he is in my way&quot;, is just a mask all together. I personally am not crying about this, I'm jumping on someone's head! To be forced to /tell Apothes &quot;Hey we gonna come up and kill magi now. We been keeping his kill dates/times logged....  Could you leave him up?  As he ludicriously asked us to do, is out of line.<br>
To be forced to buy an MQ because someone keeps the spawn down is also unacceptable. <br>
To voice my concerns of this player highjacking  my class' epic drop is what I have done and will continue to do. To make known that  this is not acceptable. To hold ransom the mage class by keeping the Magi down and selling the MQ's and then when some one voices their concern ,  starts destroying  the drop. Real mature, really.<br>
I am not an avid fan of MQ. That no secret. But it happens, life goes on. That is'nt the concern or the problem here. The &quot;problem&quot; is Apothes. This will continue to be a problem, I guess, until some form of comprimise is made. I had already suggested leaving the Magi alone , but appearently, this is simply too much to ask.. <p>Master Roinin Pyrefists
