<br>
and after reading a few posts, and doing a bit of cogitating...i just got really mad. it's there in one of the posts, but the basics are.<br>
<br>
1) paladins and SK's give up nothing now to be able to cast spells and melee<br>
<br>
2) paladins and SK's can tank just as well (if not better), and hold taunt better now then a warrior because they get spells.<br>
<br>
3)paladins and SK's due to the new weaps do just as much DPS over all as warriors.<br>
<br>
sorry, but i gave up spells to be the &quot;master of combat&quot;, and now i'm not.<br>

It'll just piss me off.  I think they've been screwing warriors good for over a year now and it's getting pretty pathetic.  It's point out that an AC softcap defeats the purpose of higher end armor.  Well even if you don't consider the cap, look at the armor that's been released since after Velious.  In Velious, warriors got the highest AC armor sets.  Other plate wearers had lower AC on their pieces. Then with Luclin and beyond with the new smithed plate, suddenly class has nothing to do with the armor.  All the plate classes can wear it and get the same AC on each piece.  What happened to giving warriors an advantage there?  Who knows... it's gone.  How about dual wielding?  SK's and paladins can't.  Oh but wait, they can now get 1 handed weapons that have a dmg ratio of nearly 1 to 1 and add a shield to it or get 2 handers with a considerably better ratio and still taunt well because of their spells.  Okay, so their AC can easily be the same or with a shield it can be higher.  They taunt just as well or better.  What about hit points?  Well, we still have more but hit points have never been a lot higher than paladins and SK's.  the hit point bonuses on the armor are the same because like I said we all get the same armor now.  The hit points added from buffs are obviously the same.  What you end up with is a very small percentage difference in hit points.  Enter AA points.  Oh wait, most of our AA skills suck.  The only class skill I've heard warriors even talk about is AoE taunt and obviously that's useful only in a very limited number of cases.  Most warriors just max out 3 of the archetype skills (durability, stability, agility).    <br>
<br>
The bottom line is that we get a few more hit points and we get defensive discipline.  That's all we have left over the hybrids.  Dual wield no longer means anything.  Armor classes are the same.  Lower offensive skills on the paladins and sk's are mostly offset by weapons that have much better dmg/delay ratios.  We may still have a small advantage there, but when they give the hybrids such uber dmg ratio weapons, it really shrinks it down.  <br>
<br>
Defensive is our class defining skill and we get that at L55.  In exchange for those, paladins and SK's get all their spells, some nice class skills, and easier access to good equipment.  They've always had easier access since the Kunark days when up and coming warriors were running around in crafted into their 50's and paladins could go buy DW for 1k.  The same holds true today.  In the case of no drop gear, there are nicer paladin/sk items out there and in the case of droppable gear, it's still much cheaper if it doesn't say &quot;warrior&quot; on it.  That last isn't exactly verant's fault so much as it's a factor of there being so many warriors that they create high demand for warrior items.  It doesn't help that our epic quest is a joke.  By easy comparison (not to pick on rangers), the ranger epic is just as good if not better and the quest is far, far easier.  <br>
<br>
I think Verant's still going by their incredibly stupid &quot;balance classes according to how many people play each one&quot; logic.  They seem to decide when a class needs upgrades based on how popular the class is to play.  Since everyone who starts EQ knows what a warrior is and it's going to be a popular choice in any fantasy setting, there's always going to be a lot of warriors unless they get nerfed completely out of the picture.  There will never be a high number of SK's unless they are way overpowered because they suffer from the &quot;WTF is a shadowknight?&quot; reaction as people start playing.  anyway, that's my take on how they decide class balance.  Just look at the percentage playing each class and go.<br>
<br>
&lt;/rant&gt;<br>

<br>
I won't say you're wrong here because I don't know, but I've not seen this claim mentioned anywhere else yet.  The warrior thread linked above is suggesting among other things that warriors be moved to a higher damage mitigation table much like monks are on a higher damage table.  You're suggest that, all other things being equal, warriors already mitigate damage better.<br>
<br>
&quot;There is lots of good warrior-only stuff, smithed rallos/tribunal armours, hate proccing weapons, aow helm/bow, ct bracers etc.&quot;<br>
<br>
Some of us don't worship Rallos or Tribunal.  The smithed armor for our deities has the same AC but not as good of stats for warriors, however paladins and SK's can also wear the same stuff if they follow the right deity.  Most of us will never see AoW drops or even the hate proc'ing weapons.  In the game we're playing, the paladins and SK's already can get the same AC armor we do just as easily thanks to Luclin and the new smithed armor.  With the Velious armors, warrior armor had a higher AC.  AFTER the melee balancing, they suddenly added all this armor that was the same for all 3 classes.  Why?  It effectively increased the power of the other classes after they were supposedly already rebalanced.  <br>
<br>
&quot;&gt; In the case of no drop gear, there are nicer paladin/sk items out there<br>
What gear are you thinking of?&quot;<br>
<br>
For stuff a lot of people are capable of getting, how about the ac35 paladin cloak that drops in ME?  On the more uber end of things, the highest damage ratio weapons in the game are pretty much all paladin/sk (50/39 for instance).  <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm quite happy at least being a 'master of getting beat up', with defensive, evasive, ae taunt, hate proccing weapons and having by far most hps.  If you want to be a 'master of combat', consider monk.&quot;<br>
<br>
The vast majority of players don't have and won't get hate proc'ing weapons.  Defensive/evasive are great, but shouldn't be the end all/be all of our advantage.  Equal or better AC gear for other classes and particularly the AC soft cap have wiped out any advantage in AC but then I guess you didn't claim that as an advantage anyway.  It use to be.  Verant then gave it to everyone else.   The hit point advantage isn't much for most of us and in grind groups at least, is hardly enough to matter.  As far as the high end raids go, the people posting on the above thread are reporting considerable success having monks tank.  I guess that's the biggest balance problem right now for the uber guilds.  Monks are fine on the lower tiers.  They have huge offense and lower AC.  That's how they were always designed until suddenly with north ToV and beyond, Verant started chucking in a bunch of high AC/high hp monk gear that put them well over the soft cap and made 4500 unbuffed hps on a monk possible.  The Statue was recently tanked with no deaths by a monk, i mean, wtf?  That's messed up.  <br>
<br>
anyway, this crap has all been said on the now 10 page thread that's linked so I'll stop now.  I do agree with the person who summarized the main issues with &quot;Better taunt is needed and a slightly higher damage mitigation table than other tanks&quot; (paraphrased).<br>

Sure for encounters that are trivial for the guild a monk can tank np, but so can a ranger or enchanter.

They do have a few less hit points.  The difference in stability/agility isn't clear but does seem implied.  <br>
<br>
Now beyond that, I see it's the bad math post Absor made that the Steel Warriors thread mentioned.  Sheesh... you'd think a bunch of software developers could design things with decent math skills.<br>
<br>
&quot;So the warrior with one level of the skill is 105% and the hybrid is 78.75%.  So rather than the hybrid being 25% less than the warrior, he’s 26.25% less…&quot;<br>
<br>
105 compared to 78.75 makes the hybrid 26.25 percent less?  Umm.... no.  78.75 divided by 105 is 0.75 or 75 percent.  For another example... if player A has a value of 50 and player B has a value of 100, then obviously A is 50 percent of B.  If you increase both by 100 percent then player A is 100 and player B is 200.  A is still 50 percent of B.  Absor dodges the lousy math by saying &quot;i don't want to debate the math, my head hurts...&quot;  GAH!  The logic for giving hybrids physical enhancement and not warriors is clearly completely bogus but anyway, I'm off the topic a bit.<br>

<br>
balance is about keeping things in proportion.<br>
here is an excerpt from my own post about that stupid 2% PEbonus they get. i hope it makes sense.<br>
<br>
then came luclin, with it's AA points. all melee classes got Natural Durability, Combat Stability, Combat Agility. everyone was fine with that. Hybrids also get another AA advancement called Physical Enhancement. This skill add's an additional 2% to each of those 3 prior skills. This is where the problem starts. now, it was explained that if warriors are considered to be at 100% of &quot;yardstick&quot; and pallies/sk's are considered to be at 75%, then a 10% boost to both yields 110% and 82.5%. this still leaves that 25% lead that warriors are supposed to get, but then with physical enhancement they get an additional 2%. this makes them at 84%. this makes them now 76.3% (84/110=76.3%)as effective again tanks this is a relative 1.3% gain. according to the smart people out there that like to fiddle with it, a warrior with 255 stam has 3335 base hp before items. a pally has 2891 with 255 stam. this means that pally/sk have 86% as many hp, before item adds. now with the 10% bonus that warr's get, that's 3668 hp from ND 3, and pally/sk get 3237 with thier 12%, now they are at 88% of a warrior. <br>
<br>
now, the real kicker is, since pallies and SK's wear the same armor that means they get the same HP bonuses that were reserved for warriors. now, say that both the warrior and the pally have +500hp in items, and it's been shown that the AA skills also affect these bonus's so now we have 4218 (1.10*(3335+500)), and 3797 (1.12*(2891+500)), now the pally is at 90% as many hp, because a straigh addition is a larger percent addition if the base it is being added to is smaller (100 added to 100 is a 50% increse, 100 added to 200 is a 33% increase, law of diminishing returns). While HP buffs (aegolism, talismans, etc) do not get the multiplier by adding straigh HP to a character. The relative benefit's are greater on the one with the smaller starting pool.<br>
<br>
the explanation for this extra 2% gain was posted on boards.station.sony.com/u...0583.html. The major flaw in this posting is that while a warrior goes from 100 to 110, and a hybrid goes from 75 to 82.5 the hybrid is still 75% of a warrior, even though the warrior gains 10 points, and the hybrid gains 7.5. they are still proportionally the same. but now, with that extra 2 percent they are now 77% of a warrior. they get an extra boost. this extra boost is enlarged with +hp items. and if you go by straight HP, they are not 75%, they are 86% by base hp. and that gap is shortened with any +hp item. and while HP buffs (aegolism, talismans, etc) do not get the multiplier by adding straigh HP to a character, but the relative benefit's are greater on the one with the smaller starting pool.<br>
<br>
So, when you have a Warrior and a Pally/SK standing next to each other. with the same gear on, with ND3, CA3, CS3, and PE for the hybrid, Aegolism (1100 hp), Focus of Spirit (405 hp)and +1000 hp from items, you get the warrior having 6273 hp, and the pally/SK having 5862 hp, now the pally/sk is at 93% of HP, where they were at 86% standing nekked.<br>

As for the lower end, well, Warriors are still screwy.<br>
my room mate started a ranger to play with me, and we have kept the same levels so far. She Set us up whith the same accessorys, weapons, and so forth. How ever, she got Chain armor while I got Fineplate. For fun we like to duel. now here's the Screwy part.<br>
Her ranger Kicks my arse every time. I thought it was my inability to play, and almost quit untill we traded computers and I Beat my warrior playing her ranger. When I got duel weild at 13 I thought I would start winning. I was dead wrong. The loss of 25 ac was enough to get me killed.<br>
Will the Mid game be better? <p><center><a href="http://www.geocities.com/saliatus"><IMG src="http://www.geocities.com/kewiannlime/images/delicia.txt" border="0" alt="Spankable?"></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ueldryc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eldryc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cons Threateningly </span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#333333>(7/16/02 3:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: GRRRR....i hate verant</span><hr size=1> are you just standing toe to toe hacking away at each other?  I would think a low level warrior would win that one easily due to higher hit points and higher AC.  Now if the ranger starts hitting and running on you it could be kind of a pain.  If they can stick a snare on you it's going to get really annoying.  If you're just going toe to toe, compare hit points and AC to make sure your gear really is similar.  Unless his ranger has considerably costlier gear than your warrior, your AC and hit points should be quite a bit higher.<br>

The one who solos a lot, will almost always beat the one who groups a lot. WHY? Because when you group, your offense and especially your defense skills lag. also, depending on the twinkage level of your group, you may kill the mobs so fast that your weapon skills lag also. As you get into the mid levels, the skills start to catch up, as mobs take longer to kill, and give less exp.  This of course, assumes you are a melee class. Its even worse for casters, since they stop meleeing after a certain point, and that sucky defense skill haunts them for a LONG time.<br>
<br>
For this reason, I rarely EVER group with a character below lvl 12. I have a lvl 16 monk, who has only grouped 2 or 3 times, and then only with one other character, a rogue.<br>
<br>
Basically, what i'm saying is that the only way a ranger can out melee a warrior of the same level, in the same equipment, without using spells, is if the warrior has crappy weapon/offense/defense skills, or you have not put a point into dodge, parry etc, when they became available. <p>Xaanru <br>
