Testament of Vanear<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Saddare sits down and looks at her companion across a chipped wooden bench.<br>
The thick smoke of the dark interior of theie meeting place has already permeated he clothing. She wishes to be on the open roads again, the wind gusting through her long Blonde hair. She stubbornly stayed an extra day in this human city for this meeting and she was determined to pass on the knowledge she held. <br>
The bar keep brougth her a glass of red wine. <br>
&quot;My friend the quest is a simple one but long. From hear you must travel across the continent of Antonica to Qeynos.<br>
Once in its walls seek out an establishment named Crows casino, it is also a pub. It is in here or just outside its door that you shall find an Erudite named Moodoro Finharm. I found him meditating as he stared into a pool outside his drinking haunt. He is an uncouth human and will probably have a wicked response to any attempt at disturbing his meditations. Continue with your purpose here nevertheless.<br>
Give him 2 gp to purchase from him a book with the pages ripped out. Keep this safely.&quot;<br>
Saddare sips the warm wine, the humans always brewed good wine. She liked this bar for drinking but usually she only stopped to buy some wine for her travels. Across the table her companion urges her to continue.<br>
&quot;The same man will also present you with a playing card for the cost of 4gp each. Buy one and examine it. The cards vary and you should give them back to him and purchase another. This seemed a simple amusement for him until I was dealt a JESTER. It seems the jester was important and in order to get it back he was prepared to give me a page that was ripped from the book. The Page was number 34. This is the easy portion of the quest.&quot;<br>
She sizes up her companion wondering would the wait for the next part be too long. This was the tough part as the person who gave the other page was sought after frequently and very tough to find.<br>
&quot;I must warn you you have yet much to do. I advise you to purchase you rations now for a long trip and maybe some brewing accesories as there is a brew barrel where you will end your travels. That destination is in the High Pass. In a secret place called the smugglers cove. You will have to research its whereabout before you find it. The spot where Dyllan Starshine appears in under a canopy beside a oven and the previously mentioned brew barrel.&quot;<br>
Saddare sips some more wine.<br>
&quot;The place may have other people waiting to get the page from Dyllan so you must be patient. Always camp here and wait. When you are first in the queue the wait begins. (max 7 hours). Notice that a very tough smuggler walk past Dyllan and rests nearby at intervals. From the moment he heads downhill and is out of the range for him to hear dyllans cry for help you have 2 minutes (maybe a little more) in order to get the page from Dyllan. Dont let him run. You should be able to do this at about 22nd level of training.&quot;<br>
She looks around the inn to see if they had drawn any attention.<br>
&quot;The page that you loots should be inserted into the book with the other and then combine the whole to produce the TESTAMENT OF VANEAR. This item will make you much wiser, so if you can use it, it will makes spellcasting more possible.<br>
I hope you are now interested in proceeding with the quest.&quot;<br>
Her companion nods and pulls out a small bag that tinkle when it is placed on the table.<br>
Saddare grabs the companions hand as it is withdrawn turns it over and places the purse back in the hand that gave it.<br>
She smiles, makes a quick gesture and her form disappears.<br>
&quot;I am not ungrateful for your offer friend but we are family!&quot; She pauses.<br>
The wine glass raises and the end of the wine is finished.<br>
&quot;And after all knowledge is free.&quot;<br>
Then a tall, slender void can be seen moving thru the smokey inn and slips out the door in the shadow of slightly wobbly customer. <br>
