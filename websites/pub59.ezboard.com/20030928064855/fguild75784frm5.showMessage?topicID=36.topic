<br>
Has anyone else noticed how much harder it is to get a skill up in Fletching now?<br>
<br>
I'm at 210, and have gone through some stacks of stuff since the Trade Skill Balances, and haven't gotten one yet. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I have been harvesting Luclin stuff for the Arrows, is this a good route, or would Bow Attempts be better? <br>
<br>
I use alot of dex gear, and usually get a KEI for the Wisdom boost before I try anything. I also use a geerlok. <br>
<br>
I have a fairly good success rate with the Arcylia arrows, but can't get a skill up, and want to make the Blessed Faydark Thunderbolt. <br>
<br>
Any help that can be offered would be greatly appreciated. <p>Kinladar Truwarp<br>

As for arrows or bows, I'm not that far yet.

It took my dex to waaay up high (215?). I had just read somewhere that high dex or high wis are good for fletching, so I ran off and started fletching.<br>
Lo and behold, I went from 139 to 198 in about 2 hours. Then it wore off and I wasn't able to get it to 202 until I had a KEI the next day.<br>
So, I guess try for a high dex or high wis before you fletch. <p>Avelyna ~ 48 Ranger<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Tiadari ~ 14  Druid<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Rodcet Nife</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/bguild75784.showUserPublicProfile?gid=baror69>Baror69</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://webpages.charter.net/embell2/images/cooldude.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cons Threateningly </span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#333333>(11/5/02 12:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=36.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fletching Skill Nerf</span><hr size=1> aye i constantly stat buff my self when i do any trade skill at all. i constantly hear about all of woe's with tailoring and fletching and personaly i never seen a problem. <br>

<br>
I tried both Maxed Wisdom, and Maxed Dexterity, Maxed wis let me get a few, so that helped. But you would think that for 200 combines, one would get more than just 4 skill ups.<br>

God this is taking alot of farming. ;P <p>Kinladar Truwarp<br>

If you got 4 skillups out of 200 combines, just be glad it wasn't a REAL hell skill level. There is a guy on EQtraders, who has had 1100 combines smithing since the june 6 patch, with zero skillups.<br>
<br>
Personally, my worst hell point was 199, which took 347 combines to get through.<br>
<br>
Sounds like fletching isn't broken, its just in line with the other trades now. I've never fletched, but I tried pottery, which I hear was similar, and was laughing the whole time, because I could not beleive I was getting one skillup per combine, and got to 148 skill on about 200 combines.<br>

<br>
[Rant On]<br>
<br>
I think we should look at Fletching not as being more inline with other trades, but why the hell make any of them so time consuming, difficult and in most cases, expensive in the first place?<br>
<br>
Instead of making fletching harder and Smithing and Tailoring a bit easier, why not just make Tailoring and Smithing as easy as Fletching used to be?<br>
<br>
And to be honest, I got Smithing to 155 so easy the other night, it was pathetic, smithing to that level was easier now, than getting Fletching to 155 was, only took me a couple hours, took me weeks to get Fletching to that level.<br>
<br>
I think you should also consider one other aspect, a GM Tailor or Smith can far and away make much more Plat than a GM Fletcher. Reason being, Tailored and Smithed items appeal to a much wider audience than Fletched items. <br>
<br>
Tailors can make some great stat armors with studded and reinforced acrylia armors, weight reducing bags, etc...<br>
<br>
Smiths can really rake it in with all types of chain and plate armors, weapons, custom order dyed armors, etc... <br>
<br>
Fletchers can make some bows, arrows, and darts. Gonna get rich of off that fast, not.<br>
<br>
I think that was the reason fletching was also so &quot;easy&quot; (sarcasm injected for benefit of Sony here) in the past, and why I still think it should be now. The rewards for Smithing and Tailoring once GMed far outweigh the rewards for GM fletching. At least by what I've been able to see.<br>
<br>
Also add in the fact that the challenges aren't just in getting the skill ups, also need to consider farming the appropriate materials at times, and the challenges that sometimes requires for any tradeskill past 200. <br>
<br>
I think that's the one area that Tailors have the most legitimate complaint, they have to farm everything to get any skill ups, where as all other trade skills can at least get started and most mastered via store bought items.<br>
<br>
[Rant off]<br>
<br>
Sorry for the rant, it's just something that irks me to no end on trade skills in general. <br>

Have you considered that the &quot;nerf&quot; of fletching has something to do with new PoP recipes that will make fletching and pottery more lucrative?<br>
<br>
I kind of like the fact that I am one of only about 20 or so smiths with over 200 skill on this server (at least among those who post on EQTraders). If it were as easy as pottery/fletching used to be, then the value of the finished goods would be low (like fletching). Look at how the overabundance of 250 skill jewelers killed the prices on most jewelcraft items. That tradeskill was too easy to GM. Everything was storebought, and you could GM the skill in a day, with only 1-2kpp loss.<br>
<br>
Now, imagine smithing has beome super easy to GM. The blue diamond cultural floods the market. Prices drop to barely above cost. Dropped items with similar stats plunge in value. Older items (barbed ringmail, treeweave, etc) drop so fast that they become a vendor trash item. People start looking at those as something of too low quality for their twinks.<br>
<br>
Don't think it can happen? Look at fine plate armor. Used to be good stuff. Now vendor junk. Just another step in skilling up. Old cultural armor, now relegated to twink wear, for the not very rich. Acrylia plate, already dropping in value, dragging barbed ringmail down with it. Making tradeskills easy would only accelerate this trend, and you would have lvl 1 characters uberly equipped, never suffering a single hit for five levels, as they level up on red cons.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I sympathize with you, in that tradeskills can be frustrating, but if they were easy, they would be no fun, no challenge. <p>Xaanru <br>

<br>
<br>
I agree there needs to be a challenge for trade skills, but would rather see them attached to the challenge of getting the materials, versus continual repitition of click click click. <br>
<br>
On the other hand, there are dropped items that by far out strip crafted stuff. I personally think that if that much effort is required, then the crafted items should be the best, and most drops drops a little behind them. Obvious exceptions would be planar items, something crafted by the gods better be ubber )<br>
<br>
These are just my thoughts however. <p>Kinladar Truwarp<br>
