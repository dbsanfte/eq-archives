I know plenty of mages that went out of their way getting rune items and such to take advantage of T-Rods. Hope they didn't spend too much or cash in too many favors.<br>
<br>
I love how people go on and on about this whole concept of infinite mana that was possible using T-Rods. Please remember that REQUIRES a full time cleric or a couple of secondary healers to keep churning out truely infnite mana. It wasn't easy, and it wasn't fun. In that sense I'm glad I no longer have to do that. I understand the need to limit Rod is some fashion but I still think they were a bit too heavy handed. To make them have a timer AND no drop is a bit silly if you think about it. We'll see if they change that anytime soon.<br>
<br>
In reply Broken'...<br>
<br>
No I don't think Manaburn was too powerfull. I'm a BIG fan of High Fantasy where the strongest and most powerfull wizzies actually stand a chance against a dragon. But instead we're stuck in VI's &quot;vision&quot; of Group &gt; all else. If they believe an incounter needs to be a big group and instead a small group pulls it off... OMG OMG we have to nerf something because people can't do stuff liek that!!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I think the best solution instead of nerfing all these nifty high end powers they like to give out they really need to make sure each class has their own nifty OMG kind of thing so everyone can quit crying about things other classes can do. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Power down Mages? ROFL that's a good one, especially given the class the comment came from. But hey, that's a line of thought more in line with the Red Forum.<br>

(tm)</span><hr size=1> Just to change the subject one more time.  In response to druids sucking.  It's just completly false.  Whether sucks or is overpowered can, and when it comes down to it often does, revolve around the players ability to put his abilities to the most use.  <br>
<br>
If all you feel you brought to a group was digital boobs for young boys to ogle, then you weren't using everything you had to offer.  I don't know you, so I can't say you're just a lousy player, but I can pretty safely say the druid class wasnt for you.  Assuming you still play, you must have found a class that is.  <br>
<br>
But that doesn't mean seeing mages that can seriously kick some @#%$ mean that they're overpowered.  I know some mages that seriously suck too.  In terms of casters, as opposed to melee types, it comes down a lot more to what you do with what you have, and not just what you're wearing. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.carpenocturnus.com/Brokenfang.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
1: My comment of mages being overpowered isn't heavily funded on personal experience. I don't hate mages at all. What I meant by saying they needed to be powered down, was how some can do certain things, things that just...don't seem like it should be there.<br>
<br>
2: You were right there when you said the Druid class &quot;just wasn't right for&quot; me.  Talking about it still makes me pissed off though, namely because I love where the Druid class is based on.. (the good AND evil of nature in it's rawest state). Thing is, that's not how Verant sees what a Druid is. To Verant, a Druid is &quot;the dumping class for all the spells everyone else has, just put at useless states&quot;. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Nothing sticks when a druid casts something (A Scrawny Gnoll resisted my Firestrike...). That's so...like.. NOT GOOD.<br>
<br>
It's sort of hard to bring your best to a group and feel good about it when the other members laugh when you cast Skin like Nature on them. Sitting there looking pretty until the group needs Evac'ing because the sub-normal IQ tank &quot;thot that thretining ment not koss heehee&quot; isn't my place.<br>
<br>
(Neither is being a tank myself. *shudder*)<br>
<br>
I have found a class I like more, thankfully.  And pretty much feel like EQ is a whole new game (when you get used to one class, going to another is like stepping into another world.). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/bguild75784.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ommundan>Ommundan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.datecc.de/bilder/woag/bilder/misc/misc59d.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#333333>(11/8/02 10:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.cfl.rr.com/exarch/files/PAINT1.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Here comes the NERF STCK !!!! (tm)</span><hr size=1> I do like the whole ordered list format so here goes:<br>
<br>
1. Your use of a kinder gentler insult (sweetums) is mildy amusing but still pretty weak. Or are you actually sweet on me? WOO HOO I have a sweety on the RN boards after being here only three days!!!<br>
<br>
2. Post bland statements about powering down a class all you want, until you can give me specifics I have to guess you only wanted to show some sort of opinion about every topic here without any real basis for them.<br>
<br>
3. No pissing contest brewing. Your opinion is mages are over powered. Having played a mage and a druid both since '99 I can say for sure I level much faster with my druid, but I can take down harder mobs faster with my mage. Group wise there is no comparison possible at all since Druids bring SO much more to groups. So I brought up druids since they have the best of both worlds (fast leveling AND groupability). In a raid situation it's even better for the druid because it's just like the group setting but add in the pluses of also having nice buffs and being able to land nukes on more mobs thanks to having Ice based spells also.<br>
<br>
4. Druids suck? That's probably the most humerous thing I've every heard. I suppose Druids are ALWAYS in the top 3 MOST PLAYED classes because everyone else playing this game is just dumb and can't figure out how much they suck? They're 2nd best at like everything making them BY FAR the most versatile class in the game. Maybe someone with the personality where they always have to be the best at something would have issues with playing a druid? /shrug<br>
<br>
5. Let me ask you to clarify a bit and maybe it will help me understand your point... What other classes do you feel need powering down? Also, why exactly do you think mages need toning down?<br>
<br>
6. From my standpoint as a long term main character mage this nerf takes the one OUTSTANDING group ability we've EVER had and taken it back to the utility level of the older rods (less actually since we can no longer pre make the old ones). So now the ONLY good thing about mages is we dont NEED a group at all. This seems fine to me since now it's back to any decent rogue being able to offer pretty much just as much as me while being less of a liability.<br>
<br>
7. I will DEFINITELY agree with you that Verant has screwed up about every roleplaying concept that they possibly ever could in this game. <br>
<br>
7a. My first character was a Rogue. I almost always play a rogue type character in any new roleplaying game or any game where I want to actually roleplay. In most pen and paper role playing games a rogue is the best class for always having something to do be in a fight or out of a fight.<br>
<br>
7b. EQ rogues? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  they were a joke for 2 friggin years. Worthless skills, low HP decent damage, and next to no utility. How did they fix roges? Made them one of the best long term damage dealers in the game. How the #@^%#$^ (not filtered, just insert random curse word) is that ANYTHING like the roleplaying games VI used to claim was their initial inspiration?<br>
<br>
8. Mom threw away your best porno mags??? Beastie Boys fan, or just random choice of words?<br>
<br>
9. Was your mage named Dnise? I ask because I knew some character named Dnise a LONG time ago. I think she was in Drunken Fishermen for a while but not totally sure. Can't remember if she was a wizzy or a mage but I know it was one of those two. I liked chatting with her and I never noticed any bitterness or unhappiness. /ponder<br>
<br>
10. Why in the world are you hugging Broken'? He disagreed with everything you said except that he was right about how the druid class wasnt for you.<br>
<br>
11. I know ALOT of mages that completely suck. Many of them used to drive me crazy with the fact the somehow got their epics before me. I say used to because I realize now all they had to do was join about any average guild and just fill a spot and bide their time til the raids they needed came around. That or they bought them with lots of plat (no real opinion on that one though).<br>
<br>
12. I KNOW that I am a damned good mage. There's not too much that any mage has done that I can't do. Some of the really cool things like dragon soloing and crap I can't do yet due to a lack of levels, spells and AAs needed but I WILL get there. From what I have seen though only about 20-25% of the mages out there are actually capable of doing this stuff. I got this good because anytime I hear of something new and cool some mage did somewhere I have to go and try it. Not only that I have to keep trying it til I succeed. That and tradeskills is why I've taken so long to level Ommundan <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
In closing, no I don't think all mages need to be nerfed because a few of us can pull off some crazy stuff.<br>
<br>
Blah blah blah, that's enough of a book for now. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I'm not trying to get in an arguement here either, but I'm curious.  What buffs do you think a shaman has that are better than a druids?<br>
<br>
Your HP AC buff is better than our HP AND AC buffs, however they do stack well if that helps.  <br>
<br>
Stat buffs are crap.  Stat buffs are BEYOND crap.

(tm)</span><hr size=1> Not sure when you quit playing a druid and when you quit playing you mage, but I haven't noticed any more resists with my druid through 35th level. /shrug maybe it gets worse at higher levels? I know I have found some mods that ensnare just does not like to stick on so I avoid those.<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm not as disenchanted with my druid because I solo her just like I do Ommundan. This means I fight on MY terms. No Warriors, Necros or whoever to give me a hard time with their stupidity.<br>
<br>
Some things you left out from my experiences grouping with druids here and there...<br>
<br>
Regen - heal the meat shields WHILE they fight<br>
<br>
Damage Shields - there is NO resisting this damage.<br>
<br>
Sow - puller's love it and it's everyones best friend for escaping<br>
<br>
Harmony - another thing pullers love you for<br>
<br>
Succor and Teleports - Emergencies and getting to where you want to fight in the first place.<br>
<br>
Now about some of the things you didn't like...<br>
<br>
Heals - The new druid heals are sure as heck noticed by the tanks.<br>
<br>
DoTs - The way they stack now is awesome! My wussy 35th druid can stack 4 nice DoTs on stuff. She can take a heck of alot more stuff down than my mage ever could (even taking into acount focus items and KEI) before needing to med.<br>
<br>
All this stuff combined with some of the fastest solo exp methods around... Yeah there's so much to not like =/<br>
<br>
I am truely sorry that you became disenchanted with the two classes I've managed to have the most fun with. It was fun dropping a line to you from time to time (I believe I still have your mage on my friends list) because you were always friendly and always seemed in a good mood.<br>
<br>
I am glad that you eventually found something more fun (I guess you're having fun or why would you still be playing) though.<br>

<br>
At first all I wanted to know from you was what exactly makes us overpowered since it's the second time I've heard this lately. Having played a mage for so long I propose that maybe what people are seeing is that &quot;hey, mages don't suck now&quot; as opposed to the way mages used to be. I'm proposing that people consider for a moment that what mages used to be was sub par and only just now are we back in the running for consideration as a damned good offensive class instead of just another good solo class.<br>
<br>
Then later comments from you made me wonder how you disliked a druid since so few intelligent people I've met actually believe that druids suck.<br>
<br>
Which also led to me feeling sad that someone that seemed friendly, sociable and intelligent would be so disenchanted as to sound so negative. Granted it was a long time ago and I don't remember EVERYTHING we talked about but I remember your name in a good light and in a since that you would be someone I would trust and value their opinion. This made me want to hear what you had to say even more out a &quot;wanna console a down in the dumps old friend&quot; kind of sense.<br>
<br>
Sorry if my rambling just drove things deeper into the ground.<br>

<br>
What I mean when I say Druids Suck... is... I should probably rephrase. MY druid sucked. MY druid wasn't worth a bag of Orc Poopies. I'm sure lots of people that play druids find good ways to play them, thing is, I don't have the patience. Dnise Ivyblaze had a bad start, for one. For seconds, I went through 5 different guilds with that ONE character, all of which had negative things to say about druids and made me feel pretty crummy and useless.. considering this was all coming from level 50+ clerics,rogues, ect, when I was still level 20.<br>
<br>
Hell, in one guild I was in (recently,at that), 4 people I knew, as close friends, called being CALLED a druid in the first place an Insult to personal strength,intelligence,values, (what else can you think of?)<br>
<br>
On the mage thing, like I said before, that wasn't heavily based on personal experience. I guess I've just seen a few use some of their...powers.. ;p.. for some rather negative things, and they shouldn't be able to use it for..that.<br>
:shrug<br>
<br>
Of course... something I forgot to mention with the mage thing is... if you look at it that way, all classes need to be powered down. In EVERY class there's some 11 year old who does nothing but play EQ and eat burritos, and suddenly wants to use his Soandso to KS dragons..<br>
<br>
Anyway, again, thanks for the compliment, it's neat to see someone actually say I was a friendly,smart, happy person.. (since usually at boards like these I get called the opposite most of the time... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   )<br>

(8p ) </span><hr size=1> Mages and druids are both among the most powerful classes in the game if used right. I can be of huge asset to a group just as a druid can. And any guild that does not see the value of a druid isn't really worthy of that druid in my book. I'm lucky though, I'm guilded with some of the best druids I have met since I started playing in 1999. Oh, and not uncommon to see one of them do 4k+ damage with their nukes. That's one nuke.<br>
<br>
I don't think mages need to be toned down. Mages do not solo very well past 61, most mobs just kill our pets too fast. And a mage without a pet.. isn't much of anything. But in a group the mage can add a huge amount of damage, that is the field mages shine in. Many people seem to misunderstand what a mage is about. It's pure offence and no defence. We give up a lot to be so good at offence.<br>

(8p ) </span><hr size=1> I've got to agree with Mordread, I just started my Mag, and even at lvl24, in a group is a very powerfull addition. The pet can help melee some damage, tank a bit if someone's getting low on health, and of course I nuke.<br>
<br>
Solo is ok, but I get alot of meditation practice also, since each kill takes some nukes to acomplish, and of course those draw the mana down fast. Steady exp in a group where there are more chances to med and nukes needed to assist the melee seem to let me keep the mana pool more consistant, and helps the group pull more mobs over a longer period of time without the healers yellin for a med break so often.<br>
<br>
I've played my Ranger to lvl52, and still play him alot, but after playing a Mag in a few groups, and comparing how much they bring to a group, I'll never understand why we didn't seek them out as part of my grind groups as an up and coming Ranger. (Also the other reason the Ranger has stalled, farming acrylia for $#%@ arrows to max fletching puts a crimp in leveling ;P )<br>
<br>
I can solo a Ranger or Mag pretty well, and while the Ranger is starting to run a bit dry on soloable things at 52, I can still make casual gains. The mag solos  faster at 24, but so did my Ranger at that level. <br>
<br>
I still prefer a group with either class though. Now to simply get people to understand that Rangers and Mags aren't evil things and that both add alot to a group.  <p>Kinladar Truwarp<br>
