These are the only special skills a Ranger gets, that set's him/her apart from all other classes, and they appear to be getting ready to swing the nerf bat at us.<br>
<br>
I wasn't thrilled with the Monk nerf, and now they are taking the one class that does NOT need a nerf, and may do just that.<br>
<br>
Absor has already posted some comments, so they are reading this board, and I would highly suggest all Rangers who find this news alarming, post thier opinions as well.  <p>Kinladar Truwarp<br>

<br>
but in all honesty, endless quiver is kinda crazy. so is archery mastery. While i agree it's great to see rangers do so much, they're flat out outdamaging other folks and getting basically no taunt from it.<br>
<br>
Now don't get me wrong i love rangahs, but to continue onto this, every single class never thinks they need to be nerfed  while every other class tends to think differently. IMHO this &quot;nerf&quot; if there will be one, isn't as out of line as you think... and it doesn't have a damn thing to do with the previous monk nerf just to clear it up. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=96653" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~outcastadventurers/images/diefenrox.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://home.attbi.com/~outcastadventurers/" target="top">Outcast's Page</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/bguild75784.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kinladartruwarp>Kinladar TruWarp</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#333333>(11/17/02 12:52:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Potential Ranger Nerf Report from Fan Faire</span><hr size=1> I can understand part of your beef Deif, but also look at this current status of archery.<br>
<br>
1) Gotta have clear line of sight, no tanks in the way, not pushed into a wall. <br>
<br>
2) Mob cannot be rooted. Otherwise double damage ability does not come into play.<br>
<br>
3) EQ3 and AM3 take a huge amount of time in AA point grinding to get. The high damage potential that a Rogue (only using them as an example) can do requires zero. With thier innate abilties, they don't get much aggro either.<br>
<br>
4) Not just any arrow can do that kind of damage. To really see outrageous crits, takes a custom made arrow, typically one that takes a fletching skill of 200+ to make, and if you buy them are very expensive. What other classes nukes, attack abilities have a wasted component that can cost 5-20p each if purchased and you go through 40-60 stacks for a raid? Also requires a high damage low delay bow.<br>
<br>
5) Those ultra high damage crits only have for 2 minutes with downtime of 72 minutes afterwards for Trueshot Discipline. Otherwise DPS is lower than other classes.<br>
<br>
It's a very situational ability Deif, just as the Paladin one is. And to even think of nerfing it with that in mind is just plain wrong.<br>
<br>
And along with that, tell me the one other thing a Ranger can do for your group/raid that others can do much better if they &quot;balance this?&quot; We are not tanks, healers, evacers, mezzers, nukers etc...<br>
<br>
Only thing we'd bring is another sword, do average damage, maybe peel a mob of the casters, and offer some small amount of crowd control with root parks. <br>
<br>
Each class wants to be known for something special. Each class has something that sets them apart. We might still out damage other bow equiping classes if they nerf it, but if it's only marginally better than swords, why bother?<br>
<br>
One last thing before I end this, Rangers have been the butts of so many jokes, scorn at times, and with Luclin and alot of work to get to lvl59 and get the AA points, (remember, Rangers have one hell of a lot more work for each level as a hybrid) they finally got something special. Just leave it alone. <p>Kinladar Truwarp<br>

I've grouped with the same one for 60 levels now and he's a damn good rogue, and i'm a damn good tank and he generates aggro more than you can possibly imagine. You don't notice much because he can evade it off eventually and rogues have decent HP/AC, unlike a chanter who can take less hits and it looks like more.<br>
<br>
Same can be said with Monks, wizzies, mages... etc etc all generate massive aggro with their damage. Archery... the ONLY time i've seen rangers get aggro from archery is when they use at the same time i do when i tag a mob from a FD puller (which gets me irrate) I hit it for 10 (if i dont miss and i always do) and they hit it for 100. That's the only time i've EVER EVER EVER seen a ranger get aggro from archery. Thru crits and regular massive damage it can just be me and the ranger, i could hardly taunt and they will not generate aggro believe me i've tried this.<br>
<br>
That's my biggest beef, they have to get the aggro of the damage their doing and they're not because they're very far outta aggro range. I know too many rangers who do massive damage outside of those crits. Their very very common and they don't even have AM3.<br>
<br>
And i play a ranger and read the posts, I know all about LoS the cost of fletching (i'm a fletching addict) and all about ranger problems. I don't think there is a warrior around who loves rangers as much as myself to be honest.<br>
<br>
but as i said, IMO rangers do need a lil kinda nerfage, I really don't think they're going to nerf the AA but i think it's a good idea if they found the way aggro is handled to be adjusted.<br>
<br>
As far as what else a ranger can do... your a hybrid. Tell me what a pally and sk can do. And IMO a ranger is a massive damage dealer if anyone picks an extra warrior over a ranger in a group their insane. <br>
<br>
The main thing is that i think your really really predicting the worst. Who said anything about archery going to be = or slightly better than swords? Who said AA would be nerfed to high heaven? Pretty much all that was said was that Rangers were more powerful than they intended. Bam that's it end of story.<br>
<br>
And i'm sorry but i get more respect on my ranger than i do my warrior - you'll get no sympathy from me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/bguild75784.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kinladartruwarp>Kinladar TruWarp</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#333333>(11/18/02 9:51:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Potential Ranger Nerf Report from Fan Faire</span><hr size=1> I won;t argue the aspect on aggro, and I would agree, for the damage inflicted, the aggro should match, similar to a nuke from a similar type of caster.<br>
<br>
You did tend to hit the one point on rogues tho, they have a better ability to loose aggre than the Jolt line of spells a Ranger has. Fizzles, Resists and then if meleein all make that spell usefull, but don't always assume it's gonna save ya. Heh, in fact if resisted, it get's even worse :-P<br>
<br>
I'm glad that you have a good view of Rangers Dief, many don't. Can't count how many times I'm LFG and very difficult to pick up a grind group at times. This is only when my usual grinding buds are not on. Typically, pickup groups do take that extra warrior over me, so there are alot of insane people out there yet ;-) <br>
<br>
You and I both know a Ranger can do basic crowd control, with roots and such, and I've saved alot of groups at times with it. Ghetto mez works well when applied correctly.<br>
<br>
Just a little nervous considering how willing the current development team seems to be to just hack and slash any class there is. I don't mind an aggro increase to archery, but the nerf the other stuff for the amount of work it takes to get there would really suck. <br>
<br>
Almost like grinding to level 50+ again after getting 59. Then still would want to grind some more to put some AA into other skills as well. <br>

&quot;if anyone picks an extra warrior over a ranger in a group their insane&quot;<br>
<br>
an EXTRA warrior? this implies that you'd for certain choose a first warrior over a ranger, including the all powerful archery skills.<br>
<br>
from this I take it that you don't really think that the archery skills should be tampered with, as you'd already pick a warrior over a ranger. personally I applaud what came with luclin - groups without the magical trio of cleric, warrior and chanter.<br>
<br>
regarding the main issue, I hope that the new spell on test &quot;Unfold Fletching Kit&quot; doesn't have anything to do with the talk about changing the EQ ability.<br>
<br>
besides, with PoP skills rangers are back to being blademasters more than archers. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Jantunen Kairala &lt;Fervir&gt;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

I want to share my opion if nobody minds, first of all, the basics reitterated:<br>
<br>
1. Double Dmg does not hit when mob is rooted and or in a wall.<br>
<br>
2. 2000+ bow crits happen at the most twice per disc. usage.<br>
<br>
3. Regualar, non-disc crits 1000+ happen one in about 4 mobs, depending on mobs AC and HP, and what arrows the ranger is using. <br>
<br>
Okay, now my opinion:<br>
<br>
I agree aggro should be generated accordingly.  That would be fair.  Have it compare to a wizzie over-nuking. However, I don't believe Archery AA abilities should be nerfed.  Adding aggro would be great, and fixing the bug that makes it impossible to hit a mob in a corner or up against a wall would be good too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Now, I am a non-EQ/AM3 ranger, and I can say what I bring to a group: average 65dps, atk buffs, some ghetto crowd control, ghetto slow if  in a non-conformist group (which I prefer!) and the ability to track mobs better than any other class.  Also, I am one of those rangers that heals the casters when they get aggro. 300pts-428pts (greater heal or chloroblast) can make a difference when healing a poor chanter <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

My experience lately has been very positive regarding being a ranger and LFG..seems like some folks are finally realizing the dmg output of a well-equipped ranger. /cheer! <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=80974" target="top"> <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~cliffy74/Misc_images/Shyran_Sig.jpg " style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/bguild75784.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zaphe>Zaphe</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.josh-leclair.com/uploads/docs/fairy_bounce08.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00bie</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(2/13/03 1:59:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.josh-leclair.com/uploads/docs/fairy_bounce16.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Potential Ranger Nerf Report from Fan Faire</span><hr size=1> /hugs Shyran !! <p><p><center><table border="0" width="111"><br>

Archery &amp; Line of Sight <br>
<br>
“That’s one I definitely wanted a solid answer for before the next fan faire”, claimed Scott Hartsman. <br>
<br>
“Here’s the deal with Archery. Ranged combat is currently very overpowered. Be it from a caster or an archer you could in some circumstances deliver enormous amounts of damage with almost no hate being added to you. This is being fixed very soon. <br>
<br>
We do have a fix for the line of sight bug ready for the Test Server and the other little things archers want like auto-attack, but the game is going to change a little once the hate-list system is corrected and Rangers will need to be a lot more like Rogues in watching their damage output to control aggro. Auto attack will probably be situational at best once implemented if a Ranger wants to stay alive.” <br>
<br>
That said the team is aware of the long term problems with archery and hopes to implement its ‘Archery Patch’ sometime in the next few months.<br>
