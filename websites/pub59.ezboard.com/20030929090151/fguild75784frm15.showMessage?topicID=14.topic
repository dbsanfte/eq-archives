<br>
I don't know if its just me, but I've had some extremely discouraging experiences in Karnors Castle being a rogue lately. <br>
<br>
First of all tank-types can't seem to understand, that a rogue (without chaotic stab) can only backstab if behind the creature. If a creature is backed up against a wall in a corner the tanks especially if there are two of them will never &quot;back up&quot; on request, maybe one will back up for a second, but when he notices that the other tank doesn't, he rushes to the fight again, and the creature is locked against the wall. *sighs* When tanks have engaged, they just mindlessly swing at the creature till its dead or they are. They can taunt and kick, but the groups positional configuration as a whole is beyond the scope of a tank. <br>
<br>
Another thing tanks can't comprehend is that they push the creature backwards, maybe you as a caster or tank do not notice this, but I can assure you a rogue will notice. Tanks keep attacking pushing creatures in the water, over edges, into walls or whereever, sometimes very unfortunate. And this is even tho the rogue several times tell the tanks to &quot;back up please, I can't Backstab, and you're pushing the mob into the water&quot;. they stop when the creature falls into water, and the whacking sounds stop... *sighs* <br>
<br>
Another thing. When there is no enchanter or bard in a group, its ok for the other classes to use whatever means the have to control several creatures. I can't believe the ranger that on a double pull, when asked to root (park) one, responds: &quot; root not loaded sorry&quot; - and starts to whack at  two drolvargs ....  *sighs*  <br>
<br>
And then there is the cleric, that can only heal. The cleric that absolutely can't stun that spectral curate which is casting complete heal on itself. And when told to cast stun, the stun always lands on the curate a second to late stunning a fully healed curate.... *sighs*<br>
<br>
The optimal Karnors Castle group is one enchanter, one cleric and 4 mindless tanks ... those can use the simple holy trinity tactics. Lets not worry about how fast we can kill a creature, we have a recipe here that can kill any finite number, and we don't have to think .. lets do it! *sighs*<br>
<br>
No wonder no other classes are appreciated, because a druid is considered a bad cleric, a rogue, ranger sk, and paladin are considered 2nd rate tanks. No one is using their potential, every class is reduced to either a tank a cleric or a enchanter. <br>
<br>
Why worry about positioning, when you can just whack?<br>
<br>
I know this is really not fair to many tanks and clerics out there in Karnors castle. Of course I've been in those groups, where the cleric saves the group, and the tank does an exellent job - its just not too often anymore I think... <br>
<br>
Maybe Its just me... probably ... <br>
<br>
Kionae - the frustrated rogue.<br>

I totally feel your frustration, I've been there maaaannnnyy times.  Fortunately I haven't had to deal with such problems on my main for quite some time (when I jump on a lower level character though, those things still drive me bonkers.)<br>
<br>
My advice to you is to get outta KC asap.  Velks or Seb are great experience, though they are often crowded and hard to get a group in too :/   but at least, for the most part, rogues seem to be much more respected and understood.  Mobs in those zones are harder, and the extra damage from a rogues' backstabs is a GREAT help, so most tanks there will gladly reposition a bit to ensure your backstabs.  But if they don't when I ask once or twice, I generally drop it thinking &quot;oh well..they are screwing themselves over by not listening..&quot;  Worse case scenario, your group of dummyheads may totally screw up and then have to rely on you to do the CR for them.  Thats a pain too, but at least (hopefully) it can teach a bit of a lesson, and maybe earn you some needed respect for your ability to drag their stupid dead arses outta there :P<br>
<br>
Sadly, there are idiots everywhere and screwups all the time (even the brilliant players screw up now and then..er..... except me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  har har), but I've always found the best groups are the ones that understand EVERYONE's role in the group, not just their own class.   <p><img src="http://rumandmonkey.com/widgets/tests/dumb/teehee.gif" title="Like, I'm so cool!"><br /><a href="http://rumandmonkey.com/widgets/tests/dumb/">How dumb are <i>you</i>?</a>

The best piece of advice I can offer you is to get out of KC ASAP!  The worst thing about it is that it is usually chock-full of morons.  Other points against it would be that the exp is so-so at best, the loot is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> godawful</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, and the trains are plentiful, mostly due to above mentioned morons.

Depending on your level, you might consider going to SolB for awhile, then hitting Velk's or Seb when you're a bit higher level.  I started going to Velk's at 51 or 52, which I think was just a tad low, but if you're 53+ it shouldn't be too bad.<br>
<br>
KC is a lot more fun now, at level 60 with good gear (and jboots hehe).  I can MT if I have to.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I might have to start going there again when I have nothing else to do.<br>

<br>
Here's what you do. Everytime a mob is stuck in a corner or next to a wall and you had it, this is like the 500th consecutive time it's happened and the tanks are not backin off one bit... Sit your @#%$ down. When people go &quot;So-and-so afk?&quot; say &quot;Nope&quot; &quot;D00d wtf you sitting?&quot; Tell them how you can't do a damn thing without they're back. Do whatever so they get the idea that your not playing. So that'll hopefully get them to back off... or you may get booted (small chance but if it DOES happen, you're WAY better off). But don't do this when it only happens once in a while, because it will happen. I live with a someone who plays a rogue, and i'm a tank - we have always grouped together and sometimes, it's kinda inevitable and i know waaaay better.<br>
<br>
&quot;Another thing tanks can't comprehend is that they push the creature backwards, maybe you as a caster or tank do not notice this&quot;<br>
<br>
Aye and actually what i notice happening a lot on raids is bunch of tanks pushing mobs into a wall or near an edge. So they back off. By some miracle everyone backs off. You know what i have now? A caster standing there getting the hell beat out of em and the melees FREAKIN out running up back there and trying to grab taunt. *sigh* i know casters perfer frontline because it makes them think their spells land more or something but if they're gonna be frontline and i say &quot;EVERYONE BACK OFF&quot; and they're still standing there, I'm the type of person to sit back until they either back off or die. Because 9/10 what happens is that mob gets pushed over the edge, and summons me. Garuntee it every time.<br>
<br>
&quot;Another thing. When there is no enchanter or bard in a group, its ok for the other classes to use whatever means the have to control several creatures....&quot; <br>
<br>
Heh yeah that's pretty stupid. a druid/ranger not having root loaded to me is idiotic. I play a wizzie and hell even i have snare and root loaded constantly and i hardly use it. When i do, lifesaver. I met enchanters that got caught with their pants down they don't have mezz loaded - MEZZ!!!<br>
<br>
&quot;And then there is the cleric, that can only heal. The cleric that absolutely can't stun that spectral curate which is casting complete heal on itself.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah that's pretty crazy. the cast time on a ch is so long in comparison to the one of the stun. You really need to get on any warriors/pallys/sks and 55+ tanks for that too. Slam and Bash stun. If it's a caster mob, specially healer, they need to save that button for when they see &quot;Mob begins to cast a spell&quot; I hate CHing mobs. Also enchanters have a stun with low low cast time and low low mana. Many times i've seen chanters chain stun whole fights and mana check afterwards? &quot;85&quot; (that's the lowest i've seen) by the time the next mob gets pulled their up to &quot;95&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The optimal Karnors Castle group is one enchanter, one cleric and 4 mindless tanks ...&quot;<br>
<br>
*shudder* you don't sign a contract when you join groups, excersize your right of freedom to save your own @#%$ before it's ruined. It's easier said than done i know, I myself tend to give people &quot;The benefit of the doubt&quot; but by the end of the incredibly long CR and rezz process (it wasn't that hard but morons will be morons) i hate everyone. You won't be an @#%$ if you see this being only a bad group. Save your energy for a good group, not a CR.<br>
<br>
&quot;No wonder no other classes are appreciated, because a druid is considered a bad cleric...&quot;<br>
<br>
Well i have to disagree but i'm biased towards rogues, i love em. When i'm not grouped with one, I dread every single fight until i get one. Things never die when you don't have one, it's a painstaking task. If anyone thinks a Rogue is a second rank tank... don't even bother with them... they have more screws loose in their head to be helped.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why worry about positioning, when you can just whack?&quot;<br>
<br>
That's what most melee think... I yell, a lot, when stuff like that happens. (they shoulda never put me as MT MUAHHAHAHAHAHA)<br>
<br>
&quot;I know this is really not fair to many tanks and clerics out there in Karnors castle. Of course I've been in those groups, where the cleric saves the group, and the tank does an exellent job - its just not too often anymore I think... &quot;<br>
<br>
KC = sucks @#%$. Only time i ever go there is to help someone with their epic. Camping VSR or tucked away in the hand room. That's it. But unfortunately, that's just not the only places they're breeding. I personally think seb is an absolute joke. It's full of people who you wonder ever got to be such high level on such low IQ. I only go to seb doing Juggs or King... tucked away again. /ooc off /shout off  and sit back and relax .... &quot;Ahhhhh&quot;<br>
