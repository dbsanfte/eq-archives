<br>
Most of them are players who work 15-20 hours a month(last I read). In return for this they get their fee waved (10bucks or so depending on how you pay) and free expansions (40 bucks bonus a year). <br>
<br>
So that is considerably less than one dollar an hour. Which is what four or so dollars less than minimum wage in the US these days ? <br>
<br>
And yes I understand that legally they are considered &quot;volunteers&quot; and the things I am listing are &quot;perks&quot; of volunteering. <br>
<br>
However I like to understand the exact commitment to a company of someone that I am dealing with them. It makes it much easier to understand what to expect. No way to say this without sounding negative but bluntly when talking to a guide I am polite but really don't expect anything at all. They are being compensated far less than a fast food worker for their time. <br>
<br>
This isn't to say I am knocking all guides either, guides can be as great as someone working in a soup kitchen - really care and doing the best that they can. Or it can be a teenager paying for his EQ fix, or someone worse. <br>
<br>
In any case it's not really what most companies would consider service. And I can't really connect it to a traditional volunteer who generally works for a non profit organization helping out what they feel is a worthy cause for their time. There isn't any indication that I can see of a reasonable likelyhood of their heart being in their job, like there is with say a Red Cross Volunteer or some such. <br>
<br>
Now expand that out a bit, if your front line support(guides) isn't likely to resolve any significant amount of problems beyond the easily fixed, what is that going to do to your second line of support the paid support people( GMs) ? <br>
<br>
Simple answer - Stress and overwork. <br>
<br>
That's the in game support system that Verant has in place from my consumer point of view. A team of volunteers who are players as guides, and a relative handful of other support who are GM's and the phone support people etc. <br>
<br>
I am polite to all of them because yelling at a support rep helps nothing really, and it is a person on the other end. But if you have a basic understanding of the system you have it's pretty obvious not to expect a whole heck of a lot.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/usinghawkstormbringer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Singhawk Stormbringer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cons Threateningly </span><br>  Posts: 77<br> <font color=#333333>(8/14/02 4:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=71.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Adding to that</span><hr size=1> Remember, your expansion purchase and monthly fees go toward servers, internet connection, paying the devs, GMs, techs, etc.  So, by rights, when you can't get in for a day or whatever or can't do anything for a day... break it down as to how much you'd get back in a refund if they were an option.<br>

I fell this is very misleading,  Yes it is true that EQ isnt the major cash cow for sony, and yes they probably have lots of other ways to make money.  The way that was stated makes it seem like Sony is doing us a service.  EQ still makes alot of money, if it didnt Sony/Verant wouldnt keep it going it would have gone away a long time ago. <p><FONT COLOR="green" FACE="forte" size="6point" >Myles Bonaduce</FONT> <P>

If the game were not making them significant money, they'd drop it like a hot rock.  To use the whole point of this argument, they don't care about the customer, so the only thing left for them to care about is $$$$.  So my guess is, while EQ is very likely not a super cash crop, it makes them enough money to justify keeping it a live.<br>

After playing EQ for over two years now I feel <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>exactly</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> this way Labbie.  Expecting Verant to listen to my every complaint and respond quickly to all my petitions is the fast track to disappointment and frustration.  And that's not a slur on Verant, it's just a statement of reality.  So if I'm going to stay here and enjoy myself then I need to assume some of the responsibility for identifying the things that are not worth hassling with (often done through experience) and making it my business to avoid them.  There are many quests etc. in the game that I'm not going to tackle because the reward doesn't justify the effort.  But for others with different values from mine they can be a major attraction.  Anyhoo there's plenty of fun stuff to do here and fun peeps to meet, all possible without any assistance from customer support personnel.  And when it all gets to be too much, I take a break and come back another time.<br>

If this were cable service, or phone service, home alarm service, etc.., we would be up in arms, but since this is 'only' a game, then we should all be quiet and deal?  Not THIS hairy arsed barbarian.  Do what you want, I am not going to flame anyone over it, but I spend a lot of money with Verant, 3 accounts, and I don't like it. <p>Kharne Bloodyhand <BR>

My personal peeve with the GMs is that they won't come down hard enough on the players whose antisocial behavior is a nuisance to those who do make the effort to behave courteously.  (That's not a rant, my point is only that I've got Verant issues like everyone else.)  The way I choose to deal with the bad stuff I can't change is to insulate from it as much as possible.<br>
<br>
The fact many people overlook is that bitching about things in a public forum without working to achieve constructive solutions to those problems doesn't make anything better.  Indeed it makes things worse for some of us.  So rather than bitch and bring other folks down, I do indeed remain quiet and deal.  YMMV.<br>

That does not even count the time, which is worth quite a LOT to me, as you can never get that back.  My time is precious, I want it to go well.

The fact is plain and simple the service is paid for not free and when EQ was first put out they had GMs/guides that were actualy on even it was for only 8 hrs a day most times you could count on your petition being answerd within a day. Now I have noticed that GM's/Guides have gotten allot less ingame and or are not answering petitions even close to what they were, so if there going to offer a service at the beginning that same service should be always offerd/upgraded or removed. Misleading customers has always been bad for buisness and changes in customer service policys should always be stated openly to clients and allow simple customer resilutions to complaints <p>Minladar Stoutwood
