Let me explain something to those of you who give tells for unsolicited ports:  DONT EXPECT ANYONE TO DROP WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO HELP YOU.  To think otherwise is simply asanine, not to mention you're setting yourself up for a big disappointment.  Remember, people don't play Everquest so they can help you.  They're playing to enjoy their own gaming experience, and if someone does drop what they are doing to help you, that's a God-send.  Don't expect it everytime.<br>
<br>
Let me give a little background info here.  I had joined up with a mage in Sebilis.  It was early in the AM and there wasn't many people in there at the time, so we decided to duo.  While we are clearing the rock area, I get a tell asking for a port.  I'm busy fighting so I don't respond.  A minute or so later, my trade screen pops up while I'm medding.  I'm being offered 62pp.  I say, &quot;What is this?&quot;  Player X says, &quot;Donation for a port.&quot;  Player Y says, &quot;Actually for 4 ports.&quot;  Another fight starts so I cancel the trade.  The area is uncleared and me and the mage are pretty busy trying to clear.  I get another tell in which I am called an @#%$ and something else for not helping.  This pisses me off and that's when I turn my log on.<br>
<br>
I have to explain before you read on, I don't usually have my log on when I play.  I turned it on shortly after I took the cursing, thinking I was going to record some more of it.  <br>

<br>
I'd like to apologize to Kumaddar for coming off more hostile than I intended.  You may have simply been caught in the middle.  But if you want to tell me about who has a good or bad attitude, why don't you take a close look at the company you keep first, and then make a judgement.  And by the way, I wasn't real happy for someone to be so quick on the draw on reporting.  Thanks bro.<br>

He was wrong there.  <br>
<br>
 But I am sorry, I have to say that I do agree with the point he made about you simply saying, &quot;sorry, I'm busy right now&quot;.  I think it was the lack of any response that really got him.  I'm normally a very calm and collected person, but when someone flat out ignores me, when it would only take a second to say &quot;no&quot;, it really gets me.  I'm sure you were already annoyed at his assumption and attitude, but seems to me that just giving him a response MIGHT have helped in avoiding further conflict.  <br>
<br>
And I'm sure you were just frustrated at that point, and I see you've apologized for snapping at the other guy, but I guess it just shows how fast we can be to snap at each other on EQ.  It doesn't just go for you, or for that other guy, but I think a huge chunk of EQ players could stand to be a bit more courteous in game.... I doubt many of those people act the same IRL. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/bguild75784.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ktadema>ktadema</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#333333>(11/23/02 8:20:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: @#%# you if you think I'm here to port you whenever you </span><hr size=1> Jazziefruit,<br>
<br>
I'll respectfully disagree with you.  You say that when someone flat out ignores you that it gets to you.  According to your logic, that would force every porting class and rezzing class and clarity class to answer every unsolicited tell with a &quot;No (insert explanation here).&quot;  Sometimes I'll do that, but oftentimes I'll get another tell back for various reasons.  &quot;I'll give you 75pp&quot;  &quot;When you have mana will you port me?&quot;  &quot;Tell me where you are, I'll come to you, I promise I won't train&quot;<br>
<br>
And the fact is, plain ole Vanilla flavored No doesn't work.  I'll bet that 75% of time that I gave a tell back that said simply &quot;No&quot;, I would immediately get another tell back asking &quot;Why not?&quot;  Everyone wants an explanation, and in their minds, when they hear the explanation, there's a way around it.  <br>
<br>
Frankly this whole discussion about how to respond when someone asks for a service is inconsequential.  In this case, Player X opened a trade window with me.  I canceled the trade.  What would that tell you?<br>
<br>
But if you really want to talk about about manners in EQ, let me ask you this:  Is it good manners to give a stranger an unsolicited tell to ask for a favor, and then expect an answer?   <p>Givins, 55th level Erudite Wizard, Rodcet Nife  </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/bguild75784.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jazzifruit>Jazzifruit</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cons Threateningly </span><br>  Posts: 86<br> <font color=#333333>(11/24/02 8:32:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: @#%# you if you think I'm here to port you whenever you </span><hr size=1> Well, I'm not sure what all was said before the log you posted, but I was just making the point that time after time after time I have sent very polite tells to porters asking if they could port me, and often they are nice enough and have to time to do it, but sometimes they don't...and that is fine.  What gets me is when they don't respond at ALL.  Because then I end up sitting there, wondering if I should be making a long @#%$ run, or wondering if maybe they missed the tell (happens all the time).  This sort of confusion is very frustrating and could so easily be avoided if porters simply replied. Yes OR no.  ....But that is me....if they tell me no, I won't pester them.<br>
<br>
Now, I understand completely your complaint that 99% of the time when you say &quot;no&quot;, its immediately followed by more begging or asking why.  BTW, I play a porter as well... so I've been in those shoes often.  If they continue to pester you, in my opinion you are completely in the right to ignore them.  Its just that initial decision to flat out ignore someone who asked you a question that gets me.  So...to answer your question, I don't think asking a question and expecting an answer has so much to do with manners...but yes, I think sending a tell (&quot;unsolicited&quot; if you wish to call it that), is perfectly ok.  Are you going to tell me its not acceptable to ask a random person on the street if they could give you directions somewhere?  Asking a fellow human being for a little help occasionally is normal and GOOD.  I think the question of manners lies first in how the person responds to the question, and secondly the reaction to that response.  <br>
<br>
I understand that you closing the trade window was your way of saying no (though I admit, I believe a tell to accompany that may have helped the situation), and the guy should have gotten the picture and left you alone, but its not the nicest way of letting someone know you can't port them, and I'm willing to bet that guy got bent out of shape thinking YOU were the one with bad manners.  I don't mean to come off sounding like I'm just criticizing you, and I've told you I whole-heartedly understand your complaints... but I understand what its like on the other side as well... and it just seems to me that courtesy on both parts is the answer to avoiding these situations.  <br>
<br>
Also, may want to think about going /role or /anon when you know you are absolutely not free to be porting.  Even if someone walks up and sees your familiar, or watches you casting ice comet or something, that tag tends to give a nice &quot;I'm not open for business&quot; look. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/bguild75784.showUserPublicProfile?gid=drool>drool</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#333333>(11/25/02 9:30:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.rochester.rr.com/drool/NoudVamp.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: @#%# you if you think I'm here to port you whenever you </span><hr size=1> I agree Jazz.  Say no once.  If they are persistant and beg, then ignore.  Some people don't seem to get that its YOUR time and sometimes you don't have time or don't want to port.  But no response at all, results in confusion as you said.  If I play a non-porter and send a tell, I'd like to at least know the porter saw the message.  Otherwise I may send again.<br>
<br>
Of course, all this can be solved by our feet.  And with PoP, there really is little excuse anymore to EVER bother a porter again.  It sickens me how so many newer players don't know basic zone and continent layouts because they've never run anywhere.<br>

<br>
People are not entitled to ports, it doesn't matter where, when or why. <br>
<br>
If you can answer them, try to do so. However, in my experience, playing my druid, people usually expect answers just as the one or more of the mobs I was kiting managed to break snare, and I am trying to resnare them, without dying. Well, sorry, but answering comes pretty low on my list at that time. If someone is in the bazaar, or nexus, or PoK, and doesn't answer you, or is clearly sitting, and not fighting, they're probably being rude, or just having a bad day. (That, or you're on their ignore list, from a previous situation. I've been playing EQ nearly 2 years, and there are names on my ignore list, that I cannot remember why they are there. However, to get there, they would have had to REALLY get me mad, so they stay.)<br>
<br>
If they are in Sebilis, fighting, and do not reply, they probably are too busy paying attention to the battle.<br>
<br>
In either case, There is no reason to be rude, even if the person is ignoring you. <br>
<br>
On the other hand, being rude back just takes the thing to their level. I've only once let someone in EQ taunt me to the point of anger, and when I realized what I was typing into my chat window, I deleted it and went to do RL stuff for a while. If i'm not having fun, I'm out of there.<br>

<br>
When someone asks for a port say No if you can't. If you really want to ignore them still say No and if they ask that stupid &quot;why not&quot; then you ignore.<br>
<br>
But at least acknowledge the fact that someone asked. I personally feel horrible asking anyoneone for anything, including groupmates for buffs. I feel bad enough asking once and I always take no for an answer.<br>
<br>
I play a porter myself as well so I understand. But personally I always, ALWAYS respond when someone asks. IMO it's just common courtesy. If someone wants to be dumb about it I say &quot;Look, I just can't&quot; and from that point on i give no response. Does fine for me.<br>
<br>
No disrespect but you did come on extremely strong to Kuma and I see no reason why. You group with different people all the time and I hope I don't have to give a psyche test to everyone I group with from now on. Granted that guy who asked for the port may have been rude to *you* but I didn't see from what you showed how Kuma would've known it.<br>
<br>
But I do agree with the general jist that people do not have to drop what they're doing for you. And strongly agree with the fact that I, for instance, just like you - do not play EQ solely to serve someone else, and they play the game for our own enjoyment. I also agree no one has to be as rude as they were to you so soon it seems, but not to sound too incredibly harsh I can't neccessarily say your information you have given was all that supporting to your argument. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=96653" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~outcastadventurers/images/diefenrox.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://home.attbi.com/~outcastadventurers/" target="top">Outcast's Page</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/bguild75784.showUserPublicProfile?gid=retrievil>Retrievil</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#333333>(12/17/02 10:32:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://whitepapers.homestead.com/files/reticon.jpg h=185 w=120></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: @#%# you if you think I'm here to port you whenever you </span><hr size=1> Guy was a in the wrong for peaking out when he didnt get a response fast enough.

Let's try a different scenario:<br>
<br>
Suppose I get killed in a zone.  I look in the zone and see that there is a cleric there that could rezz me and give me back that oh-so-precious XP that would take several hours to make back.  I give a tell to the cleric, asking for a rezz and offering a donation, as is customary.  I get no response.  <br>
<br>
Now I had always assumed that the cleric is busy or doesn't want to help, so I had always moved on.  According to some of you, this cleric is being rude and could be justifiably chastised for not responding.  <br>

<br>
But honestly, how busy can you be that you can't respond &quot;No&quot; in at least 10min time. I personally will wait til the END of someone's battle to ask and all i ask for is someone to type 5 keys<br>
&quot;t (space) n o (return)&quot;<br>
testing it out i do it in approximately 2 seconds typing slow.<br>
<br>
The only grievance i have is one someone purposely ignores me just because they don't feel like it when, like i said, it only takes 5 keystrokes. And if anyone, like i said again, wants to complain you said nothing more, they have no argument because you already typed a response. Once you said your &quot;No&quot; you don't need a single reason to say anything more, it doesn't matter if someone asked <br>
&quot;why?&quot; or &quot;please?&quot;  you already said your answer. You do NOT have to say anythng else and if he calls you an @#%$, he's the much bigger one.<br>
<br>
While i don't neccessarily agree with &quot;player a's&quot; behavior of just popping money on your screen w/out your consent- you had NEVER disagreed to you porting him, look at it from his perspective, he's confused and just knows he's got to point A to point B and the porter he asked is NOT answering him so do you keep bugging him or sit for a half hour plus because he didn't even feel like saying a simple No to you. Sure he should not have called you an @#%$ for cancelling because of battle but all he could see is someone who would simply not respond to anything he did, he asked, he offered money, but still no answer. You never told him no, you didn't even give him that benefit, that can come off as pretty snooty that you don't even bother responding after all that.<br>
<br>
Like i said i play a wizzie so i really understand but just like real life the power of &quot;No&quot; is astounding. It's worked for me that's for sure. I understand you were busy but look at it from another angle sometime. Look at it from the angle of someone who can't travel and has no one else to turn to but a porter that will not answer him. No offense but you're a freakin wizard nonetheless, and honestly IT IS NOT **THAT** HARD TO TL SOMEONE, you had PLENTY of downtime in that log you showed, enough to check if he was still in the zone and belittle him to your mage friend on several several occassions.<br>
<br>
So while i don't say that Player A was the innocent here, don't act like it's a complete right for any porter to flat out ignore someone in need. If he was an @#%$ from the start that's a different story but i didn't see it til you just flat out ignored him<br>
<br>
And from your example, IMO the cleric is not rude until lets say I had contacted him in obvious downtime twice and still no response at all. I would NOT chastise or blacklist him as you would like to presume. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/bguild75784.showUserPublicProfile?gid=odannrn>OdannRN</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#333333>(12/20/02 10:16:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.shaw.ca/corymcgregor/lazy%20cat2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: @#%# you if you think I'm here to port you whenever you </span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Dief has a pocket porter <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I don't play a porting class, but I get more tells than I could ever want from people asking me to buff them. I don't have to respond to any of them. If they have a problem with that, they need to grow up. I might be in tells with other people, talking to my guild, be in a hurry, fighting in a group, raid, etc. If you don't get a response, assume NO!<br>

People are not entitled to ports, buffs, rezzes, etc. I personally don't like getting tells from complete strangers asking for things. If you need a port, try /ooc looking for port. If you don't get a response, then get ready to run. If a person is able to port, then he/she would have answered your /ooc. I am not going to stop what I am doing to buff a stranger, why should a wizard/druid stop what they are doing to port someone else.<br>
