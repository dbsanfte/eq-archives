<br>
I swear to god everyone tries to find out what i'm wearing, and then talk about what they have that's so much better. I DON'T CARE!!!! They go on about how much more HP, AC, and the fact that they have all this better armor. If they're in a different class they talk about they're fuckin **level 40** warrior twink decked out in this and that. Why? Do you really get off that much more knowing your better than a 60 warrior? Noone cares! It's not a @#%$ competition! If I *REALLY* only wanted to play for gear i'd be in an uber @#%$ guild and have everything by now. It's not that @#%$ hard. But I don't. I don't even play for the @#%$ gear. You know why? Because the game is so @#%$ trivial when you have everything. All the people who have the uberest gear get bored and quit or wait til the next expansion and get the best gear then.<br>
<br>
I have no problem on grats-ing anyone on new stuff, don't get me wrong. If you have something your really happy about, I'm honestly just as happy for you. But telling me 30 @#%$ times a day that you have this or that only because it's better than what I have is SO @#%$ CHILDISH AND ANNOYING!!!<br>
<br>
Oh and while I'm at it. I don't care what an uber mob your fighting, or what he dropped. If I'm not raiding or killing it, don't even BOTHER sending me tells on what stuff he dropped (unless you win it, then the &quot;Grats!&quot; comes into play again) but I DON'T GIVE A FLYING @#%$ ON WHAT MOB DROPS WHAT! Oh look it's an uber mob. If I want to hear about his drops, I'll just @#%$ LOOK IT UP on Allakhazams. It's not that @#%$ hard. But some people have to REMIND ME that they're that @#%$ uber to kill him. It doesn't matter, none of it matters, and NO ONE @#%$ CARES!<br>
<br>
And one more thing. And I hate this. I absolutely hate this. It's happened like 3 times in the past week alone. If I mention to someone &quot;Hey I'm camping so-and-so mob this week for such-and-such item&quot;<br>
<br>
Common Response &quot;Yeah you mean that thing I/we have rotting/dusting in mine/our guild bank&quot;<br>
<br>
Now are you just TRYING to make me feel stupid? Because it sure as hell sounds like it. You can tell me that you have one, say &quot;Oh yeah I/we got one of those a while back&quot; that's not bad, but especially when you say &quot;rotting/dusting&quot; or say you have &quot;so many&quot; it just adds that &quot;I'm/We're so good that we don't even need it&quot; to it. Which is just @#%$ stuck up.<br>
<br>
Trying to prove to me that you're uber just makes me think you're the one of the lamest pieces of @#%$ this side of the server. And I have had it. Ever since I turned 60 and took on a pretty exclusive roll as constant MT, people have just gone OUT OF THEIR WAY to downgrade and belittle me. And I don't have time for it. I really don't, I'm too busy trying to help people, not showing off my new weapons or armor or whatever else @#%$ I got.<br>
<br>
/sigh<br>
I feel much better now. <p><center><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=96653" target="_blank"><IMG SRC="http://home.attbi.com/~outcastadventurers/images/diefenrox.jpg" border=0></a><br><A HREF="http://home.attbi.com/~outcastadventurers/"  target="_blank">Outcast's Page</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ujazzifruit.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jazzifruit</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cons Threateningly </span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#333333>(10/8/02 8:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=106.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I don't @#%$ care what you're wearing!!!!!!!!!!</span><hr size=1> *applause* <br>

hahahahaha.... I hear that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I don't often get so worked up about it, but sometimes crap like that DOES make me want to explode or something.  <br>
<br>
Basically, different types of people play this game- some laid back, some serious and competitive.  Personally I think I'm laid back.  I have no problem with those who choose to be all serious.  I may personally not get it and think its kinda silly, but whatever... do what you want, just don't act like you're better than me.  Pride is one thing, feeling and acting superior is another. And it can be a fine line. <p><SPAN STYLE="position:relative; width:200; height:15; filter:glow(color=#c11b17,strength=2)">

I've let it go in the past no problem. But i'm having a bad day/week/month/year (like most people) and it suddenly seems to be optimal time for people try to make me feel like @#%$ when I'm just trying to enjoy a game.<br>
<br>
Also /agree Ghrog<br>
<br>
Also no disrespect to uber guilds here too... I know what you mean. Most people I meet who have something to their guild name and bank, won't mention it because they know there's just no reason. The ones who actually catch a clue in the game, my good ingame friends, know that I know exactly what they can do, so they don't have to remind me about how good they are. Then there are the people who think it's the biggest deal in the world - and try to make everyone else think the same.<br>
<br>
And I also agree about the RL value. I like the game, don't get me wrong. But bragging soooo much about something that's honestly just a bunch of pixels and coding... kinda worries/scares me (coming from the aspiring graphic artist/video editor, I have to laugh at myself for saying that).<br>
<br>
It's good to know that I'm not the only one seeing this, and I'm not going self-absorbedly mental.<br>

I totally agree with alot of stuff said here.  I hate it when i'm told I suck cuz I don't have this or that or cuz I or MV cannot take this mob yet.  I have worked hard for what I have and that is what gives me satisfaction.  The work personally invested to get to a mob that drops the &quot;Winged Sword of Destruction&quot; is much more gratifying than actually looting it.  <br>
<br>
Along those lines, I so despise those that run threw zones linking their rare ubar items in /ooc and @#%$.  I mean c'mon, you want me to bow down and kiss your @#%$ feet?  <br>
<br>
I find people go out of their way to belittle others daily, it drives me nuts to see people that do these things. <br>
<br>
I'm not taking away from those that go out and gank huge @#%$ and get killer items, i'm here talking @#%$ to those that rub it in the face of others that they can do these things.  (running threw zones linking there set of rare items)  I do love to hear the accomplishments of guild X, but I don't wanna hear their members going into detail on how @#%$ good they are.  Here's a quote I heard the other day, and reminds me of these kinds of people.... &quot;I&quot;m so @#%$ good and i'll tell you why you suck&quot;<br>
<br>
oh oh, how about when a mass of 60's run into a zone that is for 10-15th lvl to gank an epic mob, and act like they run the damn zone.  Not everyone is guilty of this, but I see they don't get enough respect in RL or ingame so they feel the 10-15's owe them respect and should be on their knees kissing their @#%$.  I've been guilty of this myself, and I'd like to say I learned something.  I see this from time to time and shoot a tell to those that are guilty to sit back and read what they just wrote and explain how dumb it sounded.<br>
<br>
All in all I find that those that are satisfied with what they have and can do, do not go around going into detail how good they are and what they are wearing...<br>
<br>
If I won the 1billion in Lotto in RL, yeah i'd tell my friends about it, we'd get drunk and have a good time, but I sure as hell wouldn't go door to door telling everyone I won this fat cash and they should recognize my riches and pay me fealty(sp).<br>

You know though, someone will post here that the only reason you say you don't care is because you are jealous.  <br>
<br>
Argue against twinking?  It must be because you are jealous!  <br>
<br>
In favor of a game balancing change?  It must be because you are jealous.<br>
<br>
Don't like me bragging about my gear?  It must be because you are jealous....<br>
<br>
Message to you all:  Consider this.  Perhaps we actually have opinions on how we like to play the game.  We're not jealous nor are we impressed.  Go call someone that is equally shallow and live it up! <p><b><i><font face="Garamond"><font color="#993366"><font size=+2>
