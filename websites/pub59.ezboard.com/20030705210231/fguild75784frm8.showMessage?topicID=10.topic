<br>
That sucks. So does the fact that we put a GM's name in the &quot;Hero&quot; section... <br>
<br>
IMHO the guides and GMs should either totally enforce the policy or not at all, otherwise it gives the &quot;false&quot; indication of favoritism. I have had friends names changed too and every time I see characters named... oh, for example... &quot;Freeballin&quot; or &quot;Ibehealin&quot; or &quot;Klaumbaz Swampdorf&quot; it annoys me greatly...<br>
<br>
It makes me think, &quot;I guess 'Freeballin' is buds with Helen - or else she would have changed his name too...&quot;<br>
<br>
Half the names on this board count as &quot;phrases&quot; and should be changed as well according to the policy...<br>

<br>
Gonna leap to my guildmate's defense here: what's wrong with 'Swampdorf' as a last name? (other than his taste in names?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )  Doesn't violate the naming policy, as far as I can tell.<br>
<br>
I agree that the name-enforcement policy is not consistent.  Although it has more to do with the fact that until they <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> see</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the violation, the name won't get nerfed/removed.<br>
<br>
Case in point, another guildmate, a 40+ bard, has had his name for months:  Loding Pleezwaite.  It's always given me a chuckle, but apparently the GMs have no sense of humour...yes, it violates the naming policy, but it's not offensive to anyone...well, needless to say, he had his surname removed.<br>

<br>
I personnaly turn a blind eye to most names that I think are retarded, but maybe I should not.<br>
<br>
Maybe if more of use petitioned improper names, then the GM's would be more aware of them and could better enforce it.<br>
<br>
We all know that the GM system in EQ is lacking, so these petitions may only help to make the more important ones take longer.<br>
<br>
Any name change can be appealed, and with a good cause can be over-turned.  I have had this happent o me, and I know that Sneed has as well.  We had our names changed and then restored. (my surname, his 1st).<br>
<br>
Also, if you want to have the naming policy more consistent another thing you can do is become a guide yourself.  If there were more guides then maybe we could effectivly use the petition system to enforce naming. <p><html>

  I, being one who has had his surname and first name changed several times, just wanna agree with you all=)<br>
<br>
   Like my lowbie monk, Adman (lvl 30).   His name was<br>
 &quot;Adman Dabadman&quot;, and I thought it was neato.... but the GMs did not... Taken.<br>
<br>
  My troll shaman's name was initially Butkrak... and I know... kinda childish, but all the good names were taken!!!  Renamed to &quot;Guggrak.&quot;<br>
<br>
  Now... My rogue has gotten away so far with the name &quot;Widdel Weener&quot; ... but for how long? hehe... only time will tell! (he's a halfling.. lol)<br>
<br>
    IMO, I think a name is a representation of a person, and their individual creativity. Even if the name is a phrase, let it be (unless offensive or obscene in nature). Wouldn't you agree? <p>      Always Tenacious,<BR>
 Adman Dabadman (lvl 30 monk)
Guggrak Butterbean (lvl 37 shaman)
Chammy Chamsta (lvl 60 warrior)
Chamsta Hamsta (lvl 48 monk)
Widdel Weener(lvl 30 rogue)
Eviladman (lvl 16 nec-romance-r)
Fataman (lvl 13 enchanter)
Aerow (lvl 7 ranger)

<br>
Make a monk by the name of Baiter- PL to 55 - Max aa points so you earn the nice new title of Master<br>
<br>
Could be something to see eh? =) Nothing wrong with the name if you leave it just Baiter, then when you get the title of Master, They should have no issues because.. well.. hey, they gave you the title didnt they?<br>
<br>
I agree tho, the name enforcement should be equal and consistant. I met Helen at the Dallas Fan Faire and the naming policy was brought up in discussion (some guild mates recently lost a surname prior to the event) Anyway.. she mentioned if you see a name thats not within the rules then petition it. If a name has been removed or changed its because 9 times out of ten someone petitioned it and therefor had an issue in regards to that name..be it offensive or what not. <p><b>Baron Kelmvar Arunsun</b><br>

We where told we could not have that last name due to the fact it was a phrase. To Drayl and myself it was not a phrase it was a fact lol. Anyhow we didn't get the last name so I refuse to have a last name at all.

Someone above made the great analogy of it being the same as a speeding ticket. <br>

That to me is a perfect example of how Verant enforces the naming policy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ulorddaeth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>lorddaeth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00bie</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#333333>(3/2/02 5:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Random Enforcement of Naming Policy???</span><hr size=1> me know you averx?<br>

i·con·o·clast   Pronunciation Key  (-kn-klst)<br>
n. <br>
One who attacks and seeks to overthrow traditional or popular ideas or institutions. <br>
One who destroys sacred religious images. <br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
[French iconoclaste, from Medieval Greek eikonoklasts, smasher of religious images  : eikono-, icono- + Greek -klasts, breaker (from Greek kln, klas-, to break).]<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
i·cono·clastic adj. <br>
i·cono·clasti·cal·ly adv. <br>
Word History: An iconoclast can be unpleasant company, but at least the modern iconoclast only attacks such things as ideas and institutions. The original iconoclasts destroyed countless works of art. Eikonoklasts, the ancestor of our word, was first formed in Medieval Greek from the elements eikn, “image, likeness,” and -klasts, “breaker,” from kln, “to break.” The images referred to by the word are religious images, which were the subject of controversy among Christians of the Byzantine Empire in the 8th and 9th centuries, when iconoclasm was at its height. In addition to destroying many sculptures and paintings, those opposed to images attempted to have them barred from display and veneration. During the Protestant Reformation images in churches were again felt to be idolatrous and were once more banned and destroyed. It is around this time that iconoclast, the descendant of the Greek word, is first recorded in English (1641), with reference to the Byzantine iconoclasts. In the 19th century iconoclast took on the secular sense that it has today, as in “Kant was the great iconoclast” (James Martineau).<br>
