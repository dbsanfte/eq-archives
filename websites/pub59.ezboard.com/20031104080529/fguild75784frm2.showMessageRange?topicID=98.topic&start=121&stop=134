<br>
This thread is now seven pages long.  The Rage KS is long dead.  The cleric got his epic.  <br>
<br>
Most people have LONG ago formed their opinion on what they think about the infamous &quot;List&quot;.  Attacking each other one way or another, changes nothing. <p><p align="center">

Ragefire KSed.</span><hr size=1> Woah woah woah there. Okay, first of all, I never said I was speaking about you directly... don't be so quick to jump to defending your silly little boycott. Did I ever say you were a liar? No. Read whatever you wish between the lines, but I have no problem saying flat-out when I think someone is lying. Since you don't take offense easily I'm safe? From what? You're going to boycott me too or something?<br>
<br>
Hrrm... &quot;Don't make assumptions based on your experiences alone&quot;. Seems you need to take a look at your own advice.<br>
<br>
Im just here defending people that are good people. Do I exactly agree with what was done from what I intrepreted from the log? That's an oponion Im leaving to myself. However, bashing an entire guild based on the actions of 6 people and &quot;boycotting&quot; them is beyond silly.<br>
<br>
And since you seem to be the authority on what looks bad and what dosent, maybe ya should take a step back and look at what you're saying. There are some viscious people on this server that do awful things to eachother, but you can bet it's not Arirang that's doing it.<br>

Ragefire KSed.</span><hr size=1> Right Elawnah, you are a voice of reason and moderation in all things.  I should have remembered that from your days in the Alliance, how silly of me. <br>
<br>
I mis-worded that sentence, I would not threaten anyone, and my experiences with Arirang go way beyond what you posted here.  What I meant by &quot;safe&quot; was that I wasn't angry over it, I know how you can be.<br>
<br>
I keep saying I am done with this silly argument, but I am like a bulldog, I can't back down from a challenge.  Any who know me in RL know I am the same way there as well. &lt;sigh&gt; I need to just step back and watch this flamewar continue, but I LOVE a good argument, especially when I can come off looking reasonable in the face of repeated attacks...<br>
<br>
Here are some interesting questions...<br>
<br>
1. If we want to boycott Arirang, who are any of you to tell us not to, and why the &amp;%!*#($ do you care?<br>
<br>
2. Why is it, when someone tries to do something good in this game, the LIST for example, others always try and tear it down?<br>
<br>
3. Why, when someone voices an opinion, as I have, do others feel the need to PROVE they are wrong(how is an opinion wrong anyway?)and go out of their way to belittle the person for their opinion?<br>
<br>
<br>
Elawnah, you and I were never on bad terms back when you were in GC, or so I thought.  I disagreed with your actions, but I also publically supported your character on the Alliance board.  I see here that I may have been mistaken.  The words YOU WROTE can be taken to mean exactly as I took them, that is why it is so important to be careful in what and how we write here.  Even your statement, &quot;your silly little boycott&quot;, is insulting.  You automatically assume you are the one who knows best with a statement like that.  <br>
<br>
I have never presented anything here as fact without having experienced it myself, if what I am stating is opinion, I say so.  I have met one or two good folks from Arirang, but by continuing to associate with such a guild, their reputation becomes tarnished as well.  We ALL know how important reputation is in this game, it can be the difference in getting a group, getting in a guild, many things.  Arirang has tarnished their rep beyond repair, in my opinion and experience.  We were discussing that here.  You disagree, which is fine, but the way you disagreed was insulting, and read like an attack on ALL who felt the way I do.<br>
<br>
Here is exactly what you said, to prove my point...<br>
<br>
==============================================<br>
I personally find it hilarious when people based in the main US playtimes say they've had &quot;many bad dealings&quot; with Arirang when the fact of the matter is, when you're playing they're at work / sleeping and vice versa. So again tell me how you can have &quot;many bad dealings&quot; with people you hardly ever see?<br>
==============================================<br>
<br>
As you can see, you refuted what we were saying, and the way you said it implied we were lying, there is no other way to look at it, plus your tone was insulting and degrading.  <br>
<br>
You stated that the fact of the matter was that we were sleeping while they were playing, and implying vice versa of course.  That is patently BS, as I have had many dealings with Arirang, most of them bad, and when I do a check to see how many are on, I  OFTEN get request cut short, too many players, so not only are you wrong, you are being inciteful in your speech.  Unless you can PROVE I am lying, which you can't, making a statement like that does nothing but inspire an answer like this.<br>
<br>
Your claim that it is folks in the main US complaining is arrogant as well.  How do you know all the posters here in this thread, and the ones on other boards discussing this, are US, Canadian, Mexican, European, British, Chinese, Australian, or any other nationality? The answer, you don't.<br>
<br>
So, my statement not to base your statements on things you have not experienced is actually right on the money, you are just POed that anyone dared refute you.<br>
<br>
Finally, like RNfreak, and others, you came in here, and instead of discussing the issue, you attacked folks who were presenting their opinions.  Your tenor, how you typed those words and how they are read, present a very arrogant and biased opinion, and contempt for those whose opinions differ.  We cannot see your face, or interpret your body languge, so the ONLY inference we have is from how you write what you want to say.  This is an elementary fact, yet many on these various boards just don't seem to realize it.  I also wonder how many folks on these boards have learned anything about debate technique.  Attacking your opponent in any debate/discussion lessens your position, debating issues and facts is effective communication, and strengthens your position.<br>
<br>
As far as being &quot;Mr. Spam the GM's&quot; I put out an idea, and I still think it is a valid one, but again, instead of just disagreeing with my idea, I was belittled, and mostly by folks who had no ideas, just criticism.  If Verant hears about this enough, from enough people, and from enough different quarters, maybe they will listen, as it has been proven that Verant rarely, if ever, listens to anything about EQ unless it happens to fit with their ideas, they have even publically stated, in an interview with Gamspot, or one of the other web publications, that their customers had no idea what they wanted, so their was no reason to listen to them.<br>
<br>
To be honest, I don't sweat most of you folks anyway, I know who my friends are, and I will keep doing things with my characters the way I see fit, includding boycotting Arirang.  My friends know what type of character I have, and that is all that really matters.  I am not perfect, nor do I claim to be.  Your opinions on how I should run my game are nice, but in the end, irrelevant.  If you want to consort with Arirang, be my guest, I NEVER said you had to join my &quot;silly&quot; boycott.  I will not have any more dealings with Arirang.  I ask others to do the same, I do not demand it.<br>

I was the first to respond to your post about &quot;flooding the GMs with petitions&quot;  I did not belittle your post I merely pointed out that it would be counter productive and that it would accomplish nothing,  I did in fact try to give an alternate suggestion.  You seem to have missed that part so I will say it again.  Instead of bothering the overworked GM's with petitions, GO DIRECTLY TO THE SOURCE!  find out who in verant you can email and do so.  GM's are not game designers they just help players out of jams, and enforce some rules, that is there function.  There is an in game method of accomplishing what you want , it is called the feedback option.  This was ALSO brought up in this thread.  <br>
<br>
Let me say the important part again I DID NOT BELITTLE ANYTHING, I offered what I beleive would prove to be a more effective course of action.  I also left a warning about what may happen if Verant changes Ragefire or the cleric epic.<br>
<br>
Now I am going to lay something else out on the line here, maybe this will explain why you arent getting the reaction you might have hoped for to the whole blacklist.  <br>
<br>
IMPORTANT I AM LAYING OUT SOME FACTS HERE NOT EXPRESS MY OPINION OF THIS MATTER if you want my veiws of what happened email me or tell me in game, I posted my addy earlier in this thread or the log thread<br>
<br>
ALot of people were told to blackball Arirang because they KSed Ragefire, because they did it intentionally, because they planned to do it the night before, brought in mana burn wizards, because there were logs proving this.  When asked for the log it was said that it could not be posted.  Now here is the problem we have a lot of accusations but little in the way of proof.  (by the way in your posistion I might not have posted the log either, friendship does mean more than Rage so i can respect your decision but please understand in my eyes if you felt you couldnt post the log then maybe you shouldnt have brought it up at all)  On the other hand Arirang had a well respected member (Well respected outside of Arirang, by a lot of people) come here and post a log, in some ways this log is incriminating in other ways it refutes some of the accusations.  Now I might have missed a response from PA, but I never saw anyone really refute the log other than to say that PA's allies were not accounted for.  When posted here, the response was basically well it could be lies so I am ignoring it.  The simple fact is an honest person posted it and stands by it.  So the problem alot of people are facing is that, the list was broken (temporarily it appears)  someone got Rage out of turn.  Alot of accusations were made, but the only proof alot of us saw was a log that many of the boycott supporters immedeatly passed of as a lie.  Am I really supposed to blackball an entire guild on that?<br>
<br>
Now let me say this again, I am not saying my opinion of what happened here because there really isnt a point.  Nothing will be solved here, maybe if there was a discussion in the leader officer forum which is password protected we could eliminate the flames and hard feelings, and have discussion on what happened, how best to deal with it, and maybe even toss some ideas about what needs fixing with THE LIST (tm) and how to go about doing it. <p><FONT COLOR="green" FACE="forte" size="6point" >Myles Bonaduce</FONT> <P>

My whole point in this entire thing is to say that they are good people and boycotting them is silly. You getting all up-in-arms about it isn't my problem. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Unless you can PROVE I am lying, which you can't, making a statement like that does nothing but inspire an answer like this.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Ok. I'll prove it to you next time I log on.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Your claim that it is folks in the main US complaining is arrogant as well.

<br>
Now, you're right here about a couple things. I don't know. And I am arrogant. However, I *do* know that a number of the guilds boycotting them are based in the US time zones. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  So, my statement not to base your statements on things you have not experienced is actually right on the money, you are just POed that anyone dared refute you.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
No dear, that's where you're sadly mistaken. I'm not POed at anyone, actually. And I'm hardly arrogant enough to get POed over someone disagreeing.<br>

You don't want us making stupid comments on a pub board?  Don't post your stupid crap on a pub board then.  <br>
<br>
And as for EQvault, I've been around a while in there and on RN, and I've been at the focal point of a few issues there back in the day.  I was trying to be nice, but feel free to start a thread on EQvault and I'll gladly smack you down like I want to.   Good thing you're the knowledge base of the server tho!<br>
<br>
Who's tearing down your list?  No ones tearing down your list.  Personally I'm just sick of the whole &quot;I'm gona git you sucka!&quot; aura you're giving when it's doing jack.<br>
Like I said, if it makes you feel better doing dumb stuff like that tho, more power to you.<br>

I would hate to see this become another Flamevault because posts were allowed to continue in such a manner as this one has taken on.  <br>

People are going to make the decisions on their own as to what did or did not happen... what should or should not be done.  Fact is it happened... let's deal with it and move on.<br>

Don't get me wrong, like I said if you feel the need to boycott Arirang go right ahead.  But when you go posting it on a pub board for everybody to see, trying to gain support for your cause, don't be surprised when people like me come here and call it what it is....dumb.<br>
