                      the spawn&quot;<br>
<br>
They do have that option if they really want to, xaanru.  That very thing has been suggested by people who don't like the list.  I've seen more than one person say that what they would do is camp it too and then try to assemble the force first.  At least in that case both people would have put in equal time camping it.  What you were saying was that as long as someone doesn't put their name on the list, it's perfectly fine for them to come in at the last minute and grab ragefire away from someone who's spent weeks camping it.  As long as no Verant rules are broken, it's perfectly fine.  And yes, I consider such an opinion to be pathetic, or maybe more sad than anything.  It's not you personally, just that particular opinion of yours.  Now throw out arguments about The List from what I was saying.  I wasn't commenting on the fairness or unfairness of that list at all.  Generalizing to apply to all behavior that doesn't break the rules/laws was simply following the logical progression of the view posted by yourself and others who also used the &quot;No Verant rules were broken!&quot; mantra like that justified anything.. <br>
<br>
Again, I wasn't commenting on the fairness of the list at all so maybe that was a misunderstanding.  I was commenting on one person having a mob camped for an incredibly long time only to have someone else come in at the last minute and take it.  To knowingly do so would be a total lack of respect for the original person's effort and in my opinion an all around lousy thing to do.   As for your claim that keeping a character logged in and camping the same spot for over a week requires little effort and apparently from that argument, isn't enough effort to bother respecting.  For most people devoting that much time to it is an insane amount of effort, so much so that they will never do their cleric epic.  It's far far from trivial, at least for most of us who play the game.<br>

<br>
Melissa knows about the list, and is on the short end of the list.<br>
<br>
Cleric goes LD on the hill, and the number 2 cleric is AFK. Rage pop... Notice The Sick Humor of Verant at work  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Melissa gets agro of Rage??  First off how do you &quot;just get&quot; agro??  What would be correctly stated is Melissa took agro for whatever reason.  I mean why rush it??  Was there another guild in zone that was gonna grab him???   Why pull him to BW zone, &quot;Cause folks dont know the way&quot;???  &quot;Cause clerics on the hill would die&quot; *cough*  BS  *cough*.   Even the newest of players can follow the instructions &quot;Put the wall to your right and follow.&quot;  So somehow Rage was agroed and for some reason he was pulled to BW zone to be killed. Whatever reason is not important, just thought I would point out some flaws in what I see posted.<br>
<br>
SO Main cleric is LD,  Rage is standing there.  A cleric on the short end of the list takes him and kills him.<br>
<br>
No verant rule was broken.  But someones Integrity is greatly at stake here.Melissa by posting she hasnt turned in the piece yet is obviously feeling that there might be some wrong doing here.  Straight up rules wise, there is no issue.  But morally , yes.<br>
<br>
BUt I have to admire her for not questing the piece already and entertaining the idea of MQ it with Chami.<br>
<br>
So Melissa I lay it out to you like this.  You keep the piece and you will ALWAYS pretty much know you slighted someone over it and lots of folks will not like you that have never met you. And you will probably never enjoy your epic. I base this on the fact that you havent turned it in yet, so something in your soul is tuggin at you.  It will always have a taint to it.<br>
<br>
BUT, on the other hand if you did MQ this with Chami.  OMG!!!<br>
<br>
You would be one of the most Well Known, Well Respected people in all of Rodcet Nife. I dont know you, but I know I would go out of my way to help you if you ever needed it because of the character you would have shown.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fate has placed you in a peculiar position.  You for some reason decide to visit cleric hill or run past it on the way to somewhere else.  Ragefire has spawned, 3 clerics are camping on the hill, one LD, 2 Afk for whatever reason.<br>
<br>
So you got a tough decision to make. But I can tell ya, MQing it with Chami is a complete win win, cause you are so low on the list.<br>
<br>
I personally wont be mad at you are the guilds involved, cause you didnt KS it.  But I would be disappointed as I know alot of other folks would be.  You were on the list, and folks were honoring your position on the list.  One would hope you would do the same.<br>
<br>
Goodluck on whatever decision you make <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
On to other areas....   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
This list being broken is a unjustified statement.   The camp it self is what sucks.  The lists is the means to an end.<br>
<br>
What, about 30-40 Clerics have gotten thier epics so far on it, with only two times that there were a problem.  Only one KS by the bottomfeeders ( Arirang).  I say thats not bad.<br>
<br>
No matter what you do reroll, draw random or whatever people will whine about it one way or the other.  This thing has been in place for months and has proven to work for ALL guilds.  <br>
<br>
A camp where only 2 clerics have to spend 14 days is way better then the 8-10 that were there in the beginning for 50-70 days with no guarentee of anything.<br>

<br>
What I -hear- (rumor alert) is that the entire raid took place, rage was killed the required two times(human, dragon), and the clerics on the hill were not even sure IF it had happened or not. Sounds to me like they were not paying attention.<br>
<br>
I'm a strong supporter of the list.   I have clerics in my guild way down the list.  I've helped clerics I've never heard of before or since get their epics with it. But folks on the hill need to do their job-- it is earned, not a gimme. It is a WONDERFUL alternative to 8 clerics sitting there followed by a massive KS fest. <br>
<br>
But Epics are uberland and uberland includes getting a credible force there in a reasonable amount of time. If folks are afk for 20-30 minutes at a time, they can't expect folks to sit back and do nothing.<br>
<br>
If you think it is stupid to sit there for 12 days to do the camp, think back to when the list started-- sitting there for 12 days followed by a massive KS fest-- one person walks away the winner- the rest settle down to another 12 days and only one of them -- or even some random person-- will win.<br>
  Guilds rushing multiple times to SF and leaving with nothing but bitter confrontation and defeat.And it was always almost always one of the &quot;uber&quot; guilds that won the confrontation which gave them even more power to recruit clerics away from lower guilds since they could deliver epics and then more power to recruit folks since they had cleric epics for their raids.   There were clerics there for 30-40 days when they finally decided to set up the list.   The list is a godsend for &quot;casual&quot; and even fairly serious players as it allows them to pool their strength and to focus their vacation time to one camp.  It is the group might of the hobbesians vs the individual might of the nietzchians.<br>
<br>
  It is not perfect or fair or any more moral than the other systems but it is a lot more efficient for the clerics involved.  As it is even the &quot;easy&quot; 12-14 day camp can strain marriages and people's health.<br>
<br>
It's very unfortunate about the LD. From what I've seen here Melissa is prepared to be nice about it, but it is not cut and dried to me that she should.  Have to agree with Ullas that if she did it would not be bad for her rep.<br>

<br>
Yes I did suggest to camp along side the &quot;list&quot; cleric.  I myself am a cleric and feel the list was idiotic, mainly the way it was conceived and executed.<br>
<br>
Melissa did absolutely nothing wrong, spawn was there other clerics were sitting on thier bums, and she seized the opportunity.  people can whine and moan all they want not everyone agrees with this list and all of you that want to &quot;flame and try and blacklist&quot; everyone that does not conform to your monopolizing way of thinking is ludicrous.  I say Congratz Melissa enjoy your epic. <p>

So Melissa is a bad person and doesn't deserve to live because of Ragefire eh?  I say it's people like Melissa who have the moxy to step up and take action that will get Ragefire changed.  So when she comes up and says something even remotely related to a distant possibility of multiquesting the item to Chami, now she deserves to live?  Hmmph<br>
Chami was my guild sister back when VA still was around, I've grouped with her a few times, had some good times, too.  I like her and from what I've seen she is compassionate, warm and has a square head on her shoulders.  But sometimes the bad happens to the good and yes this sucks, but I'm afraid nothing has happened to Chami at all.  I'm sad because she got her hopes up to kill Ragefire and the job had already been done but in reality Melissa didn't do anything to Chami, she just killed ragefire.  I SERIOUSLY doubt it was personal.  <br>
But before everyone decides to aggro ragefire in a race to beat the other guilds, any chance we can let Chami get the next one? (that was a loaded question, think about it a while)<br>

try to avoid putting words into my mouth, particularly when you don't understand what I am saying. Doing that would be... what's the word you like so much.. &quot;pathetic&quot;.<br>

What I said was :<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
A cleric, who is not a supporter of the list, came into skyfire and found rage up. The only people camping the spawn were two afk clerics. This person (melissa?) had time to assemble a raid force, and killed rage, having engaged it first, NOT KSed, which per Verant policy on spawns, makes it their mob.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Xaanru's post suggesting that if someone wasn't on the list, swooped in at the last minute, and aggro'ed the spawn first, then it's just fine as long as they didn't break any Verant rules really bugs me<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Where did I say anything about swooping, grabbing away from someone who is currently camping, or anything about how long the person had been camping.<br>
<br>
What you fail to realize, is that the list, as it exists, guarantees that someone is &quot;camping&quot; (in theory) rage at all times (even if they are not there for up to two hours, according to the list rules) for the next two years. The bottom line is, it doesn't matter if a cleric were to sit there for one whole month, watching spawns get taken by the List members, then claim a spawn as theirs, becuase they were the only one in the zone when rage popped. Supporters of the list would still claim a camp steal. <br>
<br>
The fact is, and this was horrible luck on the part of the #1 cleric, is that there was nobody camping the spawn, when melissa got there. 2 afk clerics, who do not respond for enough time to assemble a raid force, kill the human form and dragon form rage (and still these people do not respond) is not camping. The one &quot;live&quot; camper, had a linkdead. I agree that is awful timing, and it sucks. However, that notwithstanding, Melissa found the spawn uncamped, up, and nobody assembling troops. The two characters parked in the zone as placeholders do not count as camping in my eyes. There was nobody behind the characters.<br>
<br>
My point is, for non-list supporters, situations like this are the only chance they have to get ragefire. It was not KSing, and only in the loosest possible interpretation could it be considered camp stealing. The point I was making is, as a list supporter, she knew it was camped, knew who was camping it, and had agreed to respect the camp, including the current rules for said camp (including the 2 hour rule involving linkdead clerics) and that is what makes it different (and since she was #8 on the list (/boggle), as part of the top 10 clerics, she could have changed the rules if she didn't like them). <br>
<br>
If some other cleric, having no such agreement, went to skyshrine, hailed and talked to the only two (afk) clerics there, and when he or she, over a significant period of time, got no response, assembled troops and took down zordak, then the dragon Rage, how could they possibly be considered KSers. Look at it this way, if there were no list, and I had gone in to camp ragefire, sat there for 5 days, and then my ISP went down, am I still camping? If you come into the zone, and find that I am not there, and ragefire is up, are you KSing if you kill him (particularly considering that I do not log back in for well over half an hour, long enough for you to get troops up, and kill zordak)? I say no. I also will always maintain that a toon with nobody behind it is not camping a mob, its just sitting there. Now, if you still find that pathetic, I pity you, for your twisted sense of ethics.<br>
<br>
BTW, my comment about the effort was in essence to say that sitting in the zone is less significant that completing the other parts of the quest. Someone who has killed ALL of the other quest mobs, has done something significant. The List does not recognize that effort, by locking a large portion of the server (even those who have completed the rest of the quest) out from the rage camp for at least two years. Compared to the achievement of having gotten the rest of the epic quest done, parking your character in skyshrine for a week really isn't that tough.<br>
<br>
Now, if you disagree, feel free to express your own opinions, but stop trying to put words into my mouth, or twist what I said into something it isn't. <br>

<br>
Lol lots of misinformed crap flying around, okay what happened was:<br>
<br>
<br>
Chami, Quaylon and Alilinkie were on the hill.<br>
<br>
Alilinkie as number 3 cleric was afk and in bed, I know this cause I was laying right next to her <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Quaylon told Chami he was going afk for a few minutes<br>
<br>
Chami then went LD for between 5 and 6 minutes<br>
<br>
When she got back on there was no sign of Rage and nothing being said in any of the zone wide channels or Ragefire channel.<br>
<br>
About 30 minutes later someone from EK (I think it was an EK person, forgive me if i have it wrong on this single point, the logs are long and I cant find this bit right now) let slip that RF was down and that Melissa had done it.<br>
<br>
According to Melissa she ran around on the hill for a short while /pokeing Chami, however Inkie was sitting right next to Chami and there is nothing in the text log to support this.<br>
<br>
Also Melissa freely admits that she sent no tells whatsoever to any of the three clerics or to anyone in there guilds to say RF was up.<br>
<br>
Again according to Melissa she then went to RF to check him out, apparently she didnt realise he was KoS, when he attacked her she then ran him to BW zone and called in her forces who took him down in short order.<br>
<br>
That is the facts of what happened. My own opinion is that this while not a classic &quot;KS&quot; incident according to Verants rules is still ethicaly a real bad thing.<br>
<br>
My reasoning for this is despite some of the bad information in some of the above posts is that Melissa was in fact on the cleric list, she was at position number 8 when this went down. By joining the list she agreed to be bound by its rules and conventions, these include sending /tells to the clerics on the hill in a higher position on the list and /tells to the guilds of those clerics. Melissa freely admits that she did neither.<br>
<br>
In fairness to Melissa I have to say that she did come and try to talk things out with Chami, unfortunately she made the mistake of trying to do it in a publiscised channel, as you can all imagine this turned into a complete flame fest !, of which I was just as guilty as everone else in taking part in.<br>
<br>
The strong impression that I and everyone else on the Chami side of the arguement got was that Melissa was feeling a little guilty and was unsure of what to do... that is until the officers of DA and EiE got involved and told her she was right and that the rest of us were wrong.<br>
<br>
Hope this explains what has happened, at least from my perspective.<br>
<br>
Hope you all have some fun<br>

<br>
A long while back my guild was to camp the guy in steamfont. the one that triggers one of the rogue epics mobs.. forgive me, I forget the name (Renux?).  Anyway, I get there and watch the trigger mob run around and follow it a bit while waiting for my guild to arrive.<br>
<br>
Shortly thereafter, while I am following the mob (I had NOT hailed it), another guild came and decided to hail for a turn in. (I was not visibly engaging the MOB).<br>
<br>
Well, I jumped down their throats.  I was also very, very wrong.  I did not hail the mob, nor had we the power there yet to take Renux.  <br>
<br>
Nonetheless, THEY showed class (Blood Meridian) and backed down, and I went ahead and got my spawn when my help arrived.<br>
<br>
Well, this is all fine and good, except I knew, almost immediately after, that no item was worth knowing that I had lost stature in the eyes of peers, and MYSELF.  I could not give back what I had taken, and it sucked.  To this day, some do not like me because of what I did.  What I did I did out of naievity, but that does not change how it looks to others).<br>
<br>
Later (please remember this is a story of a young-un, so hate was a big deal at the time) I won a shadow breastplate in hate.  I then had the opprtunity to make small amends, and I donating my looting rights of the BP to the person I had wronged (whos guild was letting me come on theur raid).  <br>
<br>
Melissa, you sound like a great person, and so does Chami.  If you have ANY doubt in your heart, MQ the item.  It can build NOTHING but goodwill.  You're on the list, and when your turn comes up, do you doubt that ALL of Rodcet will be at your side then?<br>
<br>
Those that are gracious (Blood Meridian - thank you) will always be remembered and trusted and helped.  Good will does come around.  <p><b><i><font face="Garamond"><font color="#993366"><font size=+2>

No one saw it happen.  They were afk long enough to hear about it happening from someone else.  If you leave yourself AFK and go to sleep, then you're not really there.  Your computer is on, but that's the extent of it.  Melissa has the respect of her guild and that's what's really important.  We support her and we know she's a good person.    <br>
  Having respect of her own guild for standing up for herself &gt;<br>
having respect of another guild for giving in to bullying.<br>
<br>
   We support Melissa and it seems to me that most the people who are against her are the ones who woke up from their afternoon nap and were *shocked* to find the mob not sitting there gift wrapped for them.  <br>
<br>
  &quot;Hey, guys.  I'm gonna go afk for a few days, I'll be back.  I'll see you..... HEY!!! Where is my mob!!!!&quot;<br>
