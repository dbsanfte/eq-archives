<br>
Me, I started EQ on a friends account around june or july of 99.  I thought role playing games were for geeks but my buddies were hooked.  They kept begging me to give it a try so we could all play together.  So my friend installed it on my computer and let me roll up a char just to check it out.<br>
<br>
My first character, Gnome Rogue.  I was completely new to this sorta game and really did little more than get lost and die.  Well when my hard drive crashed I had no more access to EQ and kinda missed it.  So I bought the game.<br>
<br>
My friend suggested I not play a rogue, that I should make a paladin.  They were &quot;tanks who can heal themselves&quot;.  How cool is that?!  So I rolled up a Dwarf Paladin.  My friend twinked him out with almost full bronze and a fine steel two hander, at the time you rarely saw people under lvl 30 in full bronze so this really was twinking.  After playing him to like level 10 I started to get the hang of the game and decided I wanted to start a new character and earn all my gear.  I picked a monk.<br>
<br>
The monk lasted about two hours, hated the fact he couldn't see and Freeport was such an ugly city.  All I knew of it was the desert feel to it, never zoned out into the commonlands.<br>
<br>
I then decided to make what I wanted in the first place, so I created Diggins.  Back in jr. high and high school I played a little bit of AD&amp;D and always dug the Roguesque characters.  I liked the role play of it and just dug the fact he was kinda like the sneaky little under dog.<br>
<br>
I secretly played him because I didn't want to hurt my friends feelings, after all he totally hooked up my Pally.  Around level 12 I quit playing the paladin alltogether.  My buddies would give me crap for playing a gimped class but I didn't care I loved it.  The rest is all history now, the paladin is lvl 24 now, still wearing mostly bronze and I break him out ever so often just to reminise about the early days when EQ was new and really exciting.<br>
<br>
As for Racial choice, the paladin was a Dwarf, he could see in the dark and I could actually find my way in Kaladim.  Not to mention, I really dug the scarred up one eyed model and no other race looked as cool to me as the Dwarf, oh and lets not forget the uber Dorf Roll (TM) so it was no contest. <p><a href =http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=78343> Diggins Ironpick</a><br>Assassin<br><a href = http://pub75.ezboard.com/bechoesrn> Echoes in Eternity</a><br>Rodcet Nife</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/udoogteglan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Doog Teglan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00bie</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#333333>(2/10/02 10:04:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why a Rogue?</span><hr size=1> Well about a year ago my friend told me about a cool game, well i checked it out and i ended up liking it. My first toon was a half elf warrior over on torv, but i came over to rodcet where my friend that introduced me to EQ was. I picked a rogue because the manual hinted they did a lot of damage. I dont really play any alts past level 10, i just dont have the time for them. Right now im working on my epic(waiting for the damn guy in lake rathe to spawn). Well i'll see you other rogues in-game.<br>

Starting back when I was little and sitting in on my older brothers' D&amp;D campaigns (which they eventually let me in on).<br>
<br>
The dark theives were my favorite in fantasy books and movies, and so when I finally started playing EQ (my brother kept hinting at it over and over), my very first character was a half elf rogue.<br>
<br>
I had made the char on torv I think because I didn't know what server my brother was on.  A day or two later I talked to him and found out he was on Rodcet.  So I made the same half elf rogue over here.<br>
<br>
I have a few alts.. most under 10th level.  A shaman in the 20's.  I like all the classes, but nothing is quite as fun as my rogue.  He will always be my main. Nearly 70 days of fun on him :P<br>

<br>
Tho my role playing is usually reduced to merely attempting to convince my party members that I am a &quot;non twinked&quot; warrior in black armor. I choose Dark Elf for my race because I wanted a character that I would feel totally free of any morals while playing. Altho the dorf roll is very cool... and you can get the mask from Guk, I am quite proud to be one of the very few *true* Dark Elf rogues. On a side note, no one ever believes me that my true race is Dark Elf. They all assume I have the mask... weird... Come to think of it, I have a lot of respect for people who do not believe anything I say in the first place... <br>
<br>
I always liked the &quot;lifestyle&quot; of a rogue. From when I was a juvenile rogue as a drunk teen-ager to now. <br>
<br>
I like saying things in group that have double meanings and the rewarding &quot;/em chuckle&quot; when someone can understand what I truly meant. <br>
<br>
I like looking at everyone's health bars after a fight and I am the only one at full health (/em likes evade) <br>
<br>
I like the Dervish Cutthroat's cry of &quot;Stop, Thief!!&quot; and the look on everyone's &quot;face&quot; as they say ... &quot;You said you were a warrior...&quot;<br>
<br>
I like attempting to fast talk my way into convincing *those people* that I am a warrior, and the Dervish says that when you taunt them properly.<br>
<br>
I am not uber enough to duel anyone close to my level and win. My black Iron armor does not stand up long when I fight a level 15 warrior with dual Centi Longswords... I do not resist any spells... Almost everyone can see me when I hit my &quot;hide&quot; button via &quot;see invis&quot; spells or items... So if challenged to a duel I usually attempt to fast talk my way out of it, or wait till the fool who challenged me is about to zone =) <br>
<br>
If I was in Everquest instead of &quot;Earth&quot; I would be a Rogue. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/uironpick.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ironpick</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00bie</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#333333>(2/12/02 9:54:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why a rogue?</span><hr size=1> I would swear mine was the first Sai on the server. your's makes four that I know of, 3 rogues and a bard.

Levelled up a warrior, did nice damage, took a heck of a lot and generally got used to &quot;red spam and ham&quot;.<br>
<br>
Gave a rogue a shot since I always found mobs to die a heck of a lot faster with a rogue around. Found that I liked playing such a fragile class that dealt a sickly amount of damage and was (more or less) in the fray, instead of being outside it. I played a wizard and found that I seemed to prefer melee. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So, I ditched Bertox (RL friends brought me to RN) and made a rogue, went with a barb since I thought, &quot;Might as well be a thug and not one of them fancy schmancy type rogues&quot;. If I could redo, I'd stay the same as I did. Fun class. Fun game. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=123190">
