I took my cleric out there to investigate. What i found upon arrival was Healeeyy, standing next to my friends grp nuking to death everything they pulled. I asked her what she was doing. According to her she was stopping us from KSing by KSing us, and that she wasnt going anywhere until we left. I informed her of the definition of KSing (according to Verant) and I told her that we werent going anywhere and i hope she doesnt have any plans for the night. She said she was just there to kill us. At the time I /reported along with one of my friends. All three of us petitioned. Some time after the fact upon the suggestion of a guild officer I scrolled up and took a screen shot of what she said. <br>
<br>
Last time i checked, I couldnt carve out a huge chunk of a zone and call it my own. I shudder to think about what ppl would say if I zoned into PoJ one night and claimed everything from zone in to zone out as mine. I've been on the game a long time, and as far as I knew a camp was a small contained area with set spawns as oppposed to random wandering mobs. And according to Verant, KSing is killing something after another player already has aggro. At no time did we pull ANY of their mobs. We had first aggro on everything we pulled.<br>
According to Verants policy, spawns are to be shared. Now i can understand where this isnt practical such as in the Haddan camp...hard to share 1 6-8 hour spawn..but in a wide open outdoor zone with dozens of mobs?

It shows what kind of a person you are.<br>
<br>
My group of 2 people (a Bard and a SK) was being threaten by Healeeyy as she constantly KSed us... all because we puilled tribals. They on the other hand had FULL group pulling one maybe two tribals every five mins or so.  Now, I saw them sitting down on the stairs not pulling with a full pop of MOBs out there. We weren't even close to them, matter of a fact from distance we were away... they looked like little ants; thats how far away we were.<br>
<br>
Then Fritzey&quot;sp?&quot; and others run over to us and claim we're KSing them! Now, I don't know about you guys, but I know my definition of KSing is running up to someones MOB and grabing agro off of them and then killing it. Now, off of that definition we did not do any such thing.  We had our little spawn(pop) area and we pulled from there.<br>
<br>
Healeeyy logs on and starts KSing us; each time we pull a MOB and then nukes the MOB dead! I swear guys, we had to have pulled 40 mins worth of pops, all awhile we told me the she was staying till she kill us. Now after the 40 mins she left, but the only reason she left was because we finally told her that we reported her, along with Fritzey&quot;sp?&quot; and Rubbyredd.  <br>

<br>
Here are the facts:<br>
1.) Fritzey of Netherworld was in a group in DSP at GE entrance. He and his group had been there for quite a long time. They had been chain pulling and stopped for a med break and repop when two other people show up, don't ask camp check, and start pulling the mobs that Fritzey's group had been doing.  The newcomers did not ask to share. They just took mobs.<br>
<br>
2.) After this continued for quite a while, and Fritzey's group was not showing exp gain, he asked for help from me.  I was tied up at the time and couldn't make it to see what was going on.  Healeeyy was available.<br>
<br>
3.) GM's/Guides do not recognize camps; however, players do. It is consider a common courtesy to one another. If the duo had taken time to shout &quot;camp check, please&quot;, then they could have gone somewhere else in a very large zone with ample opportunity for experience gain.<br>
<br>
While Healeeyy's strong actions may have been wrong, they were justified in dealing with 2 people that did not show courtesy to 6 other people.  Do two wrongs make a right? Of course, not! However, the entire situation would have never occurred if the duo had shown courtesy and respect to not just the 6 at the GE zone area, but to the entire zone, by asking for a camp check or by asking to share.  In Dsp, there are generally considered to be two areas where groups will congregate and grind, one is GE zoneline, the other is the tribals in front of ME zoneline.  A duo can reap huge experience by going out into middle of the zone and fighting zelniaks left and right with an occasional lightcrawler or wolf.<br>

<br>
As for camp stealing, how well do you think it would go over if I went to LCY in PoD and said, there's plenty of mobs for both groups and started pulling.  Noobs gotta learn to respect a camp sometime, or at least ask any group there if they can pull.  I don't care what Verant says, Verant doesn't play EQ.  Learn to 'play nice'! Learn to respect a camp!<br>

Camps are done for respect of other players.  GMs will not get involved in this because they do not want to be parents to a bunch of whiney players.  I notice a lot of people misinterpreting the GMs response to mean that there are no camps, and yet, they are the fastest to complain when someone moves in on their camp.  If there are no camps what is the point in asking for a camp check when you go into a zone?  It all comes down to respect.<br>
<br>
I zoned into GE looking for a group.  I asked for a camp check and went to GE.  The person there was leaving so I started a group there.  We were doing great at camping the trogs for several hours, and keeping the GE camp clear.  Warian then moved in and started picking off singles.  His response when I called him on this was petition.  Next Aenorok and Krolamdor moved in and started taking more trogs.  They also didn't think there was a need to respect the camp so well defined as GE.<br>
<br>
Then it came time for Kromik and Ryliee to move in and start camp stealing.  I also let them know that we were camped there.  They laughed at me and said there are no camps.  I asked again and they still refused to leave.  Again, I was told to petition.  At this point my group was no longer getting pulls of 4-5.  We were pulling one trog at a time for a group of 6.  My group got discouraged and started to leave, because there was no xp and no fun, thanks to Aenorok, Krolamdor, Warian, Kromik, Ryliee and Antiimatter (who joined Kromik and Ryliee later).<br>
<br>
This game is about respect for others.  Just because you CAN steal a camp without getting kicked doesn't mean you SHOULD.  My thought is don't complain when others don't respect you.  You dish it out and you can take it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/bguild75784.showUserPublicProfile?gid=quinayla>Quinayla</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00bie</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(3/9/03 8:22:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=67.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> RE: Healeeyy of Netherworld</span><hr size=1> My group of 2 people (a Bard and a SK) was being threaten by Healeeyy as she constantly KSed us... all because we puilled tribals.

Ryliee what are you smoking?  Every time I got done with one pull (of one tribal thanks to your camp stealing) there was only one more out there.  You deliberately positioned yourself there to take the tribals we were camping.  Even if you were such a noob, that you didn't know about camp checks, you could have left after I told you.  And we looked like ants?  Anyone who knows DSP knows that the little nook to the right of GE is not a far distance at all.  It's mabey a 3 sec walk.<br>
<br>
Then Fritzey&quot;sp?&quot; and others run over to us and claim we're KSing them! <br>
<br>
Fritzey said you were camp stealing politely several times then got mad because you wouldn't leave.  He never said you were ksing.<br>
<br>
Funny how innocent you are Ryliee.  I however, don't think it's funny that you warp what happened and try to make Healeeyy, one of the nicest players you'll meet, look bad.  Just stay a lowbie, and save yourself the trouble of not respecting camps in the planes and other high level zones. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/bguild75784.showUserPublicProfile?gid=diefenbakerbakendiefer>DiefenbakerBakendiefer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cons Dubious </span><br>  Posts: 201<br> <font color=#333333>(3/10/03 6:46:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=67.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE: Healeeyy of Netherworld</span><hr size=1> So is someone going to deny he ksed them until they left? we gonna see any proof this or that was done or said at all?<br>
I'd love to see a ss or log of this.<br>
<br>
So if we want to talk hows respect between fellow guildies as KSing a group CONTINUOUSLY until they leave, hows that for a mature response?<br>
<br>
Camp respect is gone in most zones. It sucks but it's true, I'll tell you especially in DSP and any other non 55+ zone (and even in some of those - I get it in PoV) your not going to get it, because people don't care anymore. Was grinding for 6 hours straight in the rockhopper caves working my @#%$ off... several different people get in zone, don't like the fact that i told them that cave was divied up between other people and their were no extra mobs to pull told me &quot;i don't care&quot; and not only that one guy trained me... not once.... not twice but 3 times in 10 minutes trained my @#%$ to get me to leave... Got 3 other people training me from my own mobs... hell they even brought over mobs that had aggroed them on trip, they somehow get on my cleric so us being indisposed they'd pull one of our camp mobs.<br>
<br>
It's sick it's pathetic but it's gonna hapen in newb zones. Whats worse is your not going to be the one to &quot;teach&quot; them the good ways of respect. This does not give you the right in anyway to act like a 3rd grader who screams and slaps until he/she gets their way. Hannabel I'm sorry but you are completely wrong about Haleyy's actions being justified. Like THE rule of EQ is that you have 0 right, NONE to ks someone - and as often as you did, bad. It's one of the few rules that will forever be punishable until the very end of this game, NOT justified. Silly silly thing to get so worked up over. If anyone were to get in trouble for ANYTHING it would ONLY be haleyy<br>
<br>
Now don't twist my words and get me wrong I definetly don't support the poster for camp stealing, i wouldn't like that done to me either, but what will i and have i done about things like this? Nothing but asking them to leave... its tough but don't be immature, don't be like that, don't ks all their mobs your just wasting EVERYONE'S time. Just stop saying all this about &quot;respect&quot; when the retaliations done are so petty.<br>

Well, thats fine because i consider your version complete busllshit. Fritzey seemd a little angry that he'd have to share spawns. I undersatnd. I have been in the same situation at GE several times. However, i never claimed all random wandering mobs within pulling range of GE mine. I never KS'd another group. If it got crowded and my group couldn't compete i went another place to grind.  Why? Primarily because i'm not an idiot. I know what a camp is and thats not it. I dont understand why Frizeys' group couldnt compete in the first place. One bard and one SK was screwing them up that much? So they call on Healeeyy to come to the rescue huh? Thats pathetic. If i were Friztey i'd be looking for a hole to crawl into and die. <br>
As for Healeeyy, yes i am sure she is very sweet and doesnt have a malicious bone in her body. However she also lacks and intelligent bone.  So what it basicly comes down to is she claims I stole a camp. I claim she KS'd. A guide witnessed both. The only diffrence here is what she did was against the rules...merry christmas... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/bguild75784.showUserPublicProfile?gid=brokenfang>Brokenfang</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cons Threateningly </span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#333333>(3/10/03 2:54:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=67.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Healeeyy of Netherworld</span><hr size=1> Hah, it's threads like this that make me glad I still click over here from time to time.<br>
<br>
Think you all need to listen to Dief a little more.  She's nailed it dead on.  <br>
<br>
Lets see if I've got this straight from my outside perspective.<br>
<br>
1) You have a pair of players that are relatively new to the game.  These aren't some high level players twinks.  These are people that have not been playing years on this server learning the server etiquette and keeping up with it's changes.  All they have to go on mainly is SoE's very clear policy that they do not support camps.<br>
<br>
Now, lets look at the state of player camp etiquette as it exists today.  With most players following the path of least resistance in regards to leveling anymore.  Many pre 50 outdoor zones are abondoned or have minimal amounts of players in them.  I haven't seen real camps established in these outdoor zones in a good number of months now.  They just don't exist anymore.<br>
<br>
2) Now, this duo comes in and starts pulling mobs that your group was also pulling.  Ok, it's annoying, but it happens.  Hopefully from this thread they now understand a little bit better that it's best to just move along to uncontested grounds.  Now the group of 6 that was there finds thier grinding brought almost to a halt?  To me something is really strange there.  And if I were to venture a guess, I'd have to assume that group of 6 really wasn't ready to be claiming that area if they couldn't compete with a group of 2.  From every level range I've played through, I've never once seen a group of 6 that was unable to drive off a group of 2 simply by chewing through all the spawns and leaving them with little to none.<br>
<br>
3) So Healeyy comes over.  And begins to nuke down any and every mob they pull.  To the person that claimed she doesn't have a malicious bone in her body.  This thread here shows that as complete bullshit.  If you felt you were wronged that's what the /report and /petition commands are for.  Instead you chose to take 'justice' into your own hands and extract revenge.  Revenge by its very nature is malicious.  And she pretty much admitted she was in the wrong by running off as soon as she was informed she was reported.<br>
<br>
In summary.  The best thing I get out of this is a list of names I hope never leave Netherworld.  People can be educated on server policy.  People that think they have the power to enforce thier law on other people are nothing but headaches. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.carpenocturnus.com/Brokenfang.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Both sides here are to blame, stop making Healeeyy out to be the only bad guy.  The two camp stealing noobs are as much to blame.  Verant be damned!  I don't care what they say is wrong, or what a guide witnessed.  Both are wrong!<br>
<br>
You say, 'Camps aren't respected in newbie zones anymore'.  Maybe its cause people like you reinforce they're disrespectful behavior!  God help us if these noobs ever attain some real levels!  Maybe instead of telling your 'new to the game', 'don't understand the rules', 'noob' friends to &quot;Petition, Petition!&quot;.  You should have told them that they should find they're own mobs to pull and camp stealing its wrong!<br>

Or even the gist of what I was saying on some counts.<br>
<br>
For starters, I don't know either side in this story.  My entire post was based on outsiders opinion going only by what I have read in this thread.  The people I was saying should have petitioned were the very people you're trying to defend, badly I might add.  <br>
<br>
Secondly.  Healeeyy -is- the only 'evil' person in this mess.  In my eyes.  On one hand you have a pair ignorant of player etiquette.  While what they did can be considered wrong by most peoples standards, myself included, ignorance does not equate to maliciousness or being 'evil'.  On the other hand, you have someone that came over, and for 40 minutes (I believe that's what was stated earlier?) intentionally, and knowingly KS'd thier pulls.  That intent was purely malicious, or 'evil' as you put it.<br>
<br>
I also have to laugh about me reinforcing disrespectful behavior.  To clue you in, I've been playing on this server for over three years now.  I've been running a guild for over a year now that has an upstanding reputation.  The few times I've even had to get involved with stupid @#%$ like this has always been solved with both parties happy.  Though I can count the times I've had to on one hand with fingers left over, since my members already know how to conduct themselves in a mature manner.<br>

<br>
And hey, don't tell me I haven't done my part in trying to teach some folks who don't know a few courtesy rules. I've done WELL over my fair share of ....&quot;community service&quot; but from my experience and experience of others i know, trying to say something to people you don't know especially, doesn't work, never ever has for me and i'm a damn PC and elaborate person, I've even tried flat out telling them &quot;The only thing your gonna accompish is that your gonna piss people off if you do this&quot;.<br>
<br>
And further more saying 'Hey go away or I'll ks you til you leave' teaches them absolutely NOTHING about camp respect. That teaches em 'Damn! There's some mean freakin people in this game!'<br>
<br>
Don't try to even COMPARE camp stealing to ksing... Don't put the acts of what those guys did in comparison to the retaliation done unto them. Especially to that extent, it's sick really... never heard or seen anything like that in my near 3 years playing. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~outcastadventurers/images/diefenoverlord.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

This was a group of 6 who had been successfully camping GE for hours when another player showed up and started to pull some mobs.  He was asked to leave and refused.  He was out there to solo tribals.  Whatever.  This didn't affect our group much.  Then two more people join in pulling as well.  They were also asked to leave and didn't at first.  Still not a huge deal.  Then two more show up and start pulling.  At this point there are no tribals to pull because this camp does not support 11 people.<br>
<br>
Again, these were Aenorok, Krolamdor, Warian, Kromik, Ryliee and Antimatter later (Poboy).<br>
<br>
If you knew more about DSP you would know that these are not random spawning mobs.  They wander some but all spawn in the area right outside of GE.  It's not a huge chunk of a zone.  It's a little strip of spawns in a huge zone.  You cannot take a full group out into the middle because others will aggro and it's dangerous for casters.  Thus hundreds of groups over the years have pulled these to the entrance of GE.<br>
<br>
You can support your real life friends.  I think you would do better to tell them not to camp steal. My group was there to work together for the benefit of everyone in it.  Not there to selfishly solo and make the game miserable for other groups.  The two people who Poboy says were new to the game and others assume to be just ignorant were asked to leave several times.  They were made aware of the problem with their actions.  Then they call up they rl friend and whine that now the game isn't fun for them either (Poboy who probably twinked their asses and pled them up without teaching them the game).<br>
<br>
Noobs need to stay in Blackburrow and Crushbone for a reason.  I'm so glad that my rl friends didn't help me out til I hit level 20 the first time around.  It taught me a hell of a lot.  And people love my groups because of it.<br>
<br>
Had Poboy told his friends to move along instead of supporting their poor judgement this would have been a non issue.  Had the camp stealers decided not to be so selfish this would have been a non issue.  Had Fritzey decided to give up and camp this would have been a non issue.<br>
<br>
To be honest, I don't care what people who support camp stealing think.  I don't do it and I don't want it done to me.  One is just as bad as the other, but I put the blame on the person who initiates it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/bguild75784.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hannabelvoltaire>Hannabel Voltaire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00bie</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(3/11/03 11:04:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=67.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Camp Stealers Suck</span><hr size=1> Ok, we all have read both sides of the incident, what lead to it, and what resulted.  However, one thing that hasn't been mentioned but was captured in a log (if she took my advice), were the tells that were being sent to Healeeyy.<br>
<br>
KS'ing in the game is wrong per server rule.<br>
<br>
Verbal harassment of a malicious nature is not only wrong in game, but is also addressed by Verant/Sony in disclaimers and codes of conduct.<br>
<br>
Healeeyy described the tells she was receiving from the people that she was trying to run off as colorful and candid and crude.  Those people that were sending her the tells should be glad that she is not a very malicious person or she could have easily sent the log of the tells to GM/Guide/Verant/Sony/whomever.  Now, I have not asked Healeeyy to see the text and I personally don't know if she took my suggestion and logged it; however that is not the point that I am slowly working towards. <br>
<br>
Earlier, I used the word &quot;justified&quot; to describe Healeeyy's actions.  Perhaps, I was wrong in rationalizing her action; however, when the people started to flame her in tell, that's when she more then likely went overboard. Now, I understand that the people that she was trying to run off were very angry and that they may have lost their cool and said things a bit extreme to her.  Does this condone her actions? No.  Does it shed a bit more light on the subject? Yes.  Will Healeeyy make the log of the tells public? Probably not. Hell, she has more then likely just forgotten about the issue. <br>
<br>
Now in regards to all involved on this thread, I bear no ill will and will help when I can.  I admit I was wrong to ask Healeeyy to go to DSP to address the campstealers when I wasn't available.<br>
<br>
AND I take responsibility for her actions.  If you want to blacklist some one, black list me.  However, if you ever need a port, I won't hold it against you.  Each of us have pissed someone off knowingly or unknowingly. That is life, get over it. Each of us pays the tuition of kids in Japan with our monthly contribution to Sony.  Live and learn..yada yada yada.  Ok, I'm rambling, sorry.<br>
<br>
If you want to see reasons why someone should truly be blacklisted, read the threads on Pooj and Sunchaser (yes, I was in Knights of Gamekey when Sunchaser pulled one of his bonehead moves).  I also agree with the suggestion that this thread be moved to the Red header.  If an incident with Healeeyy were to occur again, then by all means, put her here.<br>
<br>
Ok, I think I've ranted enough for today...<br>
<br>
See ya in game, look me up if you need a port (yes, Broken, I'll even port another wizard, hehe).<br>

You seem like a reasonable and respactable person.  In fact the only mistake you made in my eyes was attempting to claim Healeeyy's actions as justified.  And we all stand up for our friends.  Oftentimes even when we know they're wrong.  It takes a big person to come back and admit maybe they weren't so right as we wanted to believe.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to get into the whole rude tells thing.  To be honost, it's just another step on the cause and effect ladder that all stems from the initial point of conflict.  If sida A didn't do this the side B wouldn't have done that...yadda yadda..so on so forth.  <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, people like Grakt and Quinayla do your guild/group/friends no justice in thier style of response.<br>
<br>
Though, I'm going to admit I'm left with some questions now.  Now, these mobs spawn in a general area and roam?  I was under the impression it was a static camp we were talking about.  If we're talking critters that roam.  No camp, end of story.  For as long as I've been playing, roaming mobs in outdoor zones are strictly first agro and nothing else.<br>
<br>
My second question is.  From the orignal post.  I was under the impression by the time Poboy came out it was just his two friends there.  The later post listing other names seemed to indicate to me these were all separate 'incidents'.  If they were, then I stand by everything I've said previously.  If they weren't, and it ended up as a group of 5 vs a group of 6.  My ultimate feelings remain unchanged though my reasons would be different.  And I'd apologize for my little quip about a full group not being able to compete with a pair.<br>
<br>
Quinlya - a small tip.  Exagerating for effect is doing you no justice here.  Claiming something established in a zone 'over the years' for a zone less then two years old just sounds well....like you're grapsing at straws.<br>
<br>
Poboy - I will say one thing for the others though.  If you really want to see your friends prosper in this game, you might seriously consider advising them to avoid these tpyes of conflicts.  In this case, it really would have been better for them just to walk away.  I'm not saying they should let themselves be walked over.  But really, pick your battles wisely.  Not everything is worth fighting over.  Especially in a game where your social contacts have a direct impact on how well you prosper.<br>
<br>
Oh, I'll also be the first to admit I don't really know a thing about the spawns in DSP.  When Luclin launched I was already well above the level range to hunt there.  And quite honstly.  it doesn't rank anywhere near the top of a good xp zone for that level range.
