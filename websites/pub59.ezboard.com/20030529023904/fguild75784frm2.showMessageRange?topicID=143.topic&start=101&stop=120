I'm sure what I have to say has been stated in other words, but I felt the need to reiterate.<br>
<br>
The list has problems, that is that.  The point has been brought up that even if she didn't agree with all the rules of the list, Melissa WAS part of it and in the end did wrong by those rules (I'm sorry...  but I don't buy the little technicality defense...).  Frankly... I don't care so much if she broke the rules or not.  Forget about the stupid list.<br>
<br>
There is also the fact that she did not break any of the game rules as far as KSing and the like goes.  Yes, she got her epic piece fair and square.<br>
<br>
If she can live and be satisfied defending herself with the above two points, that is fine.  People view the game in different ways...some take it more serious than others.  <br>
<br>
That said, I think that the real issue for her should be one of what is morally right.  To show no respect for someone who has spent a HUGE chunk of their RL time waiting for that spawn can really make a huge statement about a person's character.  I understand that many people have given her a hard time and pulled her in many directions, and that can certainly influence her final decision... but it SHOULDN'T.   It should come down to the right, honest and decent thing to do... it should not be turned in out of spite and anger towards anyone who has been on Chami's side.  <br>
Again, I was not present at this incident, so I can only go by what has been said here... but from the situation as I understand it, I know that if I were in Melissa's shoes I absolutely could not live with myself if I took the epic piece for myself and ran.  She may have gotten the kill and looted it by breaking no technical rules, but she has broken a lot of trust, and now that she knows Chami's situation full and well, to still deny her of the epic piece that she sat and waited for so long would be just like spitting in her face in my honest opinion.  Either way, both clerics will eventually have their epics...whats really on the line is reputation.<br>
<br>
If its too late by now and Melissa has gotten her epic, I am very sorry Chami... at least you can know you have many people who were eager to defend you.  <br>
<br>
If it is not too late, I urge Melissa to think about kindness and respect for another human being's time rather than greed... even if many people HAVE been making nasty comments.<br>
<br>
Just my opinions here... not necessarily those of my guild.<br>

<br>
If you spend 40 years camping a spawn but aren't there when it shows up, or you're afk, or asleep, or a bot, it doesn't matter. It sucks for you, but it doesn't mean the person that did get it did anything wrong, immoral, or greedy.<br>
<br>
I see alot of people bringing things into their arguements that simply are irrelevant. In the logs, people were upset that Chami didn't get her epic because she's such a nice person. I hate to break it to ya but no matter how NICE you are it wont help you, she could be the sweetest person in the world but it doesn't score her any points here because it's irrelevant. Or that she had spent so much time camping it and her RL situation wouldn't allow for her to do it again. Sure, it sucks for her, and I am very sorry (and im sure i'm not alone) but it's still irrelevant as to whether or not RF was rightfully hers. What is relevant? That she wasn't there to claim the mob when it spawned, you can't expect people that dont know her to patronize her and leave it up because she's super nice or because she was there for the last few days. Life's not fair, get used to it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/umylesofrodcet.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Myles of  Rodcet</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#333333>(7/21/02 5:09:07 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: DA EiE take Ragefire 19th July 2002</span><hr size=1> Siri alot of people have made asses of themselves, Chami is NOT one of them.  Would you really hold Melissa back from MQing with Chami because OTHER people are acting like 6 year olds?  Spend 10 minuites talking to Chami and you will find out she is not someone that goes around saying things like Phuck &lt;insert guild here&gt;, guildwar, lets train them. <br>
<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------<br>
This is what chami had to say from the first log<br>
<br>
'shut up Cloud...I don't care if you are right or wrong, this hurt me and I never hurt anyone on Norrath..not ever'<br>
<br>
'I never did anything that was bad or harsh...and I think that you would feel the same..'<br>
<br>
'shut up cloud...it's over...<br>
----------------------------------------------------------<br>
 That is the person who would be the recipient of the MQ.  I think everything she said there was perfectly understandable.  I would hardly say Chami made an ass of herself.  I am assuming that by now Melissa has either done the MQ or got her stick.  I am not really writing this to tell her what to do, more to say that dont judge Chami by what other people were saying.  She deserves much better than that. <p><FONT COLOR="green" FACE="forte" size="6point" >Myles Bonaduce</FONT> <P>

<br>
I think the only person who seems to have been nice the whole way round on this is Chami and I don't even know her. I feel very sorry for her. I cannot imagine camping something for 2 weeks, let alone a month or more. You have my respect.<br>
<br>
But you were AFK. So was cleric #2.<br>
<br>
I used to think Melissa got her rage questionably. I am certainly no fan of the list, but if you sign it, essentially you say &quot;I agree with the list and will uphold it.&quot; She followed all of the procedures in place for LD/AFK clerics when Rage spawned and nothing happened. She got her friends to kill it with her.<br>
<br>
Grats Melisa. Hold your head high. You did nothing wrong. You have also done well in defending yourself. I would loathe to be in your situation.<br>
<br>
We can suggest changes all we want, but the fact is we have to deal with what we are dealt. Suggesting future changes to the quest (while many things can be done) does nothing for people who have to deal with the camp now.<br>
<br>
Ryee, your list (because it is yours, you enforce the rules) is flawed. Fix the flaws and maybe people will respect your list again someday.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Suggestions to fix the list</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
<br>
1) Require someone to send in screenshots of their Shimmering Pearl to the list and have them posted on a Pearl screenshots thread. Screenshots can be altered, yes, and anyone who does so I suppose will probably get away with it. Hard to prove something like this =/<br>
<br>
2) Minimum level 50 (yes, there are sub 50 clerics on the list). Note that provision 1 takes care of most level issues.<br>
<br>
3) People should not have to violate the EQ EULA to get their epic. Let people get some sleep for god's sake! Have people camp it in shifts of 8 hours. If Rage spawns during that person's designated 8 hours, great! They get rage! This means you are probably going to be in skyfire for a much longer time, however it also means you can have a *gasp* life! There can be many variations of this, just ease up on the camp requirement.<br>
<br>
Specifically for Ryee:<br>
4) Do not put your personal buddies in the list at arbitrary locations.<br>
<br>
5) Take a class in diplomacy. Your attitude does nothing to engender anyone to your cause.<br>
<br>
Not that my opinion matters... Of course nothing will ever be done until people realize that killing Rage outside &quot;The List&quot; is acceptable.<br>
<br>
**EDIT** I believe if Melisa were to MQ the heart, she would have to do most of it over again. It has been nearly a year since Xorena got her epic so I am fuzzy on the details. <p><center>

I can garuntee you that Chami will NEVER intentionally train anyone.  It kind of looks to me like the real Chami logged off pretty quick there so I doubt after those first few comments from her she even knows what has been said.<br>
<br>

Edit Kinare my understanding is that Chami was LD, not AFK.  (not that it matters anymore, the whole situation just plain sucks)<br>

<br>
I am an EXTREMELY vengeful person in RL, so yes, I probably would, just to spite Chami's supporters.  They did her a great disservice by opening their pieholes.  But what Melissa does is up to her.<br>
<br>
I feel bad for Chami, but it seems she has much bigger problems than what's going on in EQ, and she really should get her priorities in order.<br>

I think that has been established. <br>
<br>
This is 100% a moral issue.  Chami went LD.  Fine. So Melissa honestly sent tells/poked/tried a bit to communicate and got no response.  Fine.  So she proceeded to kill Ragefire since no one else seemed to be doing it. Whatever.  <br>
The thing is, after he was dead and looted...after the whole incident, she DID learn what the situation was...that a nice cleric had been camping it, NOT afk...and just happened to go LD.  Because it is possible to MQ the item, that is plain and simple the decent and respectable thing to do.  Melissa would still get her epic in due time, and gain a lot more respect that way... and Chami would not have to feel hurt and screwed over.  Its a matter of playing the game nicely.  And yes, it IS a GAME... all the more reason to be a good sport and not be greedy.  <br>
<br>
But once again, that is up to Melissa.  If she gets her own epic out of it...great...I hope she can wield it and feel happy, but I just know that my opinion of her character and personality will be much less because of it, and though I know she has a number of people still supporting her...I have no doubt that many people feel the same as I do.<br>

So she spent 2 weeks on one camp other than that how much do you really know about her.  I can tell you from experience that the vast majority of the time that EQ and RL came into conflict with her RL won over.  I dont think you have the slightest idea what her priorites are.  Do I?  Maybe not, but I have known Chami in game for close to 2 years.  I want to make this very clear Chami is not some pathetic loser that put EQ above everything else in her life.  Nor is she some vengeful, spiteful, meanhearted person who is going to be on these boards whining, flaming, or crying.  It really isnt fair to say OMG her priorites are so wrong because of ONE event from all the time she has played this game.  <br>
<br>
By the way I am not here to Flame the guilds of EiE/DA.  As much as I like Chami (which is a considerable amount), I didnt like the list.  It just sucks that it had to happen to her.  It sucks alot, I really cant think of a worse person it could have happened to.  I dont think there is a way to fix it and keep everyone happy.<br>
<br>
Also I think all of those people who were talking about training, cursing and swearing, and otherwise acting like idiots did Chami a pretty big disservice.  Look what you associated her name with.  I am sure you meant well I have never known her to act that way and I really doubt that is how she would want that handled. <p><FONT COLOR="green" FACE="forte" size="6point" >Myles Bonaduce</FONT> <P>

I doubt chami will even drop by to see what all is being said. She'll just have to spend another week in SF if she's able.

we all feel bad for Chami. no matter what Nugg, Razkum, or Ryee tries to tell you.  we all realize that these are real days and real hours a person is putting into this camp.  I think Chami has taken it rather well. better then the above mentioned people. she has my respect in that. <br>

Hrm. Perhaps you should apply that logic to both sides of the argument.<br>

<br>
I am really not sure what you mean by that.  If you mean that it isnt fair for me to say her priorities are in order.  I think I can safely say that I have seen evidence to support where her priorities are.  I have called Chami an in game friend for a long long time.  We dont talk as much now that we are not guyilded  together anymore, and especially since my play time has evaporated.  However, I have spent alot of in game time with Chami.  I know that she generally puts EQ below alot of other things. (family RL frineds work)  I know this from experience.  I would have to say, doing something as involved as the Ragefire camp is not something she does normally or maybe even ever before.  Just because she did it this once doesnt mean this is how she normally plays.  Because I have known her (in game) for a long time I can say pretty confidently (sp?) that this was an rare thing for her.  Of course if you really want to know I suggest talking to her about it.  <br>
    Anyways the reason I am here is because I dont want people to get the wrong idea about her.  She is being associated with some things that shouldnt have been said.  Things that she did not say.  I am here to defend the person of Chami, regardless of who is in the right or  wrong.  To me the person of Chami is far more important than who is right or wrong about this whole incident. <p><FONT COLOR="green" FACE="forte" size="6point" >Myles Bonaduce</FONT> <P>

It's a game. Yes, people put in inordinate amount of hours into it. I think that it's great that people are finally offering suggestions on how to fix the dumb ragefire list.<br>

I know what I say can be hard to get sometimes unless ya know me and how I think.<br>
<br>
My whole point was, you try to say Chami is this great great person, and to not judge her by one mistake she has made. <br>
<br>
Which, I don't disagree or agree with per sae, as I don't know Chami. <br>
<br>
However... the &quot;other side&quot; I was talking about was the fact that people try to paint Melissa as this horrible horrible person.<br>
<br>
Which, I don't disagree or agree with anyone over, because I don't know Melissa, either. <br>
<br>
I'm just saying that if you're going to apply the logic of &quot;don't hate soandso because of ONE incident&quot; then the people that are trying to say Melissa is a horrible person over ONE incident should apply that to their thinking as well.<br>
<br>
That make more sense? <p><center>Baroness Elawnah Zhir`Venhiruum<br>
