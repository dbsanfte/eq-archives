While I cannot say for sure whether he has a kael Bp to multiquest, I can confirm that Sons of Kings has not raided Kael at all, to say nothing of the arena. And when we do get to the point where we COULD raid for this armor, we sure as heck wouldn't let a druid loot the plate BP.<br>
<br>
I will go ahead and refresh some memories on some of his other exploits.<br>
<br>
Back in 2001 there was a GM event, during which the dragon Feydedar, spawned in Lake of Ill Omen. The guild who took the dragon down was saving the Pod of seawater (for druid epic, one of the hardest pieces), for a druid who was apparently rushing to the scene. Bagend ninjad the Pod of Seawater. He claimed he had no idea it was for the druid epic, and would have given it back if he could, so we let it slide.<br>
<br>
The next occurance, I was grouped with Bagend, in a pickup group in KC, when we got a T Staff to drop. Bagend was group leader, and MasterLoot, so he looted it. We all rolled, and someone else won. Bagend makes a comment in guild chat that the tstaff dropped, and someone else won it. He says something like &quot;maybe I should just Linkdead&quot;, then says &quot;nah&quot;. then less than a minute later, does go linkdead.<br>
He logs back on as one of his alts shortly thereafter, claiming he cannot get on as Bagend, there is some bug. Then a few seconds later, the guy who won the roll said &quot;hey he's in the zone,&quot; and a few seconds later, he was gone. He claimed to be naked at his bind point, even though there was no corpse where he had gone LD. Later he told me his corpse was down in the basement, and a GM helped him get it. Never tried to find the guy who won the roll, or give him the staff.<br>
<br>
Ok, getting skeptical at this point, but since we both liked going to KC, I ended up in another group with him. Had been out in DL, and he sent me a tell saying they need a cleric. I'm level 43 at the time, but decide to try it, after all, he was level 42, and the group he was in didn't seem to mind. The group had 2 clerics, and a druid, along with 3 melees, not well balanced, but I've seen worse. Anyway, despite being poorly balanced, Bagend (again the group leader) kept pushing the puller to go after the named mobs as the came on track. After 2 successive wipeouts, the group decided they had enough and disbanded. I got a tell from the other cleric (who was lvl 51 I think) saying that he was sorry for leaving, but bagend wasn't a good group leader. Anyway, the point of this is, I ended up mentioning to this cleric that bagend was lvl 42, and I was 43, and found out that he had lied to them, and said he was 48. <br>
<br>
Anyway, After these events, and some run-ins with other guild members, he got in an argument with our guild leader during a guild meeting, and was banished from the guild. He tried for a while to get back in, then the last I saw of him, he was in the guild &lt;Royal Blood&gt;.<br>
<br>
According to his posts to me on our old guild message board, which he created, he is now playing an alt &quot;to make a new start for himself&quot;<br>
<br>
See the message entitled Xaanru please read. I'm sure it won't be up long, now that I have posted the link, so if you see it before he removes it, please confirm that you have in this thread.<br>

<br>
Btw, elsewhere on this (the old SoK) site is an apology from him for the pod of seawater ninja, during the period that he was trying to reenter the guild.<br>
<br>
I'm sure he's going to accuse me of flaming him, but after talking to Bloodclot about the armor MQ, and how upset the person who he scammed was, I really don't care.<br>

 So was the armor Multiquest scam that got you put on the rodcet nife board blacklist your idea of a new start? I have been contacted in game about that one, by a guildmate of the person you scammed. I know, It was an &quot;accident&quot; just like the Tstaff ninja, and the pod of seawater ninja. But if you're going to tell people you got something while in our guild, and then scam them, which we know it was, because SoK never raided there with you, then deal with the outcomes.<br>
<br>
As you know I used to group with you quite a bit, and we even did some quests together. I had nothing against you, but you are just too dishonest. Lying about your level to get in groups, ninja looting, scamming ,and who knows what else you've done that I have NOT heard about. Lets see how long it takes before your thread is longer than Suncaster's.<br>
<br>
I'm not the only one who knows your alts, so it was bound to get out eventually. If you really want a fresh start, then stop scamming.<br>

 Well after much thought ive decided im going to say sorry to Fudal and ask for him to let me back in. Hopefully if all goes well ill get an invite (if you all will have me back of course) and all will be back to normal.<br>
<br>
Reason i want to come back is I miss all my friends and I feel VERY bad for just abondoning them like I did. I hope you all will forgive me for all those stupid things I did like ninja looting that Pod of Seawater in LOIO and any other things i may have done.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>

I have met Lancerblood and he is a bit of a whiner...dont know if that was a trait in Bagend.  If any of you know how dumb it is to sit in Solb at the zone out to lavastorm and expect to not get trained, here is a guy who whines about it.  You just dont sit there w/o paying attention, its to dangerous.  He also whined for about 10 mins over Naggy loot.  Rather than that, havent heard of &quot;Lancerblood&quot; scamming or Ninjalooting yet. <p><a href="http://www.archonsofchaos.com">Archons of Chaos</a> - <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=171870">Llrath - 48 Barbarian Rogue</a>

He created Bagend while a member of the guild, decided to make him his main, and was made an officer at one point.<br>
<br>
I grouped with his Bagend character with several alts as he levelled, and helped him do item transfers between the three characters listed. There is no speculation about these alts. If there were, I would not have posted them.<br>
<br>
But, yeah, whining was a trait of Bagend too. Go to the cleric board on this site, and read the post &quot;Now you know why I go anon&quot;, for a sample.<br>
<br>
And BTW, the one I cannot remember the full name of was a dwarven warrior, which he created because he said he had messed up when rolling Lancerblood, and put all his extra points in charisma. <p>Xaanru <br>

This Bagend guy sent me a tell about 2(?) weeks ago asking if he could join the Troubles Band. Even then I was suspicious about that name... (Had I heard somewhere before about him?)

<br>
Menacing Visage is currenty dealing with the issue, as we had no prior knowledge of Lancerblood being Bagend's alt. Several people contacted guild officers and we are currently dealing with the issue in guild, thoroughly.<br>
<br>
I apologize for whatever trouble Lancerblood has caused within Sol B, or any other zone for that matter. Menacing Visage is not one to tolerate misbehaviour and breaking of server etiquette and Verant's PnP rules.<br>

<br>
Bagend has created a whole new druid, named Froden and somehow managed to slither his way back into my guild, before we finally realized who it was and gave him the boot again.<br>
<br>
He claims to have sold the Lancerblood account, but later the night I ejected him from my guild, He was in the auction channel, looking to trades a 51 warrior (lancerblood) for ANY lvl 45 or higher char, and a lvl 55 necro (no clue of the name), for any non-necro 45 and up.<br>
<br>
In case anyone has forgotten this whole deal, here is the link to the 6 page thread on the main board, about his Ninja looting, MQ scamming, lying, and general bad deeds :<br>

Anyway, he also said he had a lvl 42 monk named vorlorian, but I have not yet seen this character, and it may or may not be true. <p>Xaanru <br>
