To realisticly get it you would have to buy the green scale, unless you get lucky enough to kill sev.  With the mana burn groups out right now, it makes it almost impossible.  SO you buy it, 100k+.  Well there are other weapons out there that are cheaper and BETTER than the epic, so stop there.  Most don't want to waste time on it.  Thanks for the info on the queen and isle though.  If I really, really wanted to I could get enough people to help me.  However I feel that it just wouldn't be worth it.  Spending a lot of RL time to do something that I would end up ditching when PoP comes out really seems like a waste of time.  <br>
<br>
Are there better things out there than the cleric epic?  Do we see 97% right click sticks dropping?  On the same token we aren't the only class who need the upgrade, but I'm sure they've complained as well. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=294603 Profile </a>

I'm on it.  And I don't even recall our last Sev kill.  Mostly guilds get him.  He's really easy.  <br>
<br>
The Manaburn team is the only group that really does VP...so you never know.  Personally I haven't heard of a wiz on Rodcet selling a green scale for 100k yet.<br>
<br>
Basically imo, the Risk vs Reward is just.  The time vs reward may not be.   The one that is good about the warrior epic is you are pretty much almost gaurentee'd drops on the items you need.  Lot of classes don't have that.<br>
<br>
Warriors just have the advantage of having 6 million melee weapons out there.  There is actually better held items for Clerics, one drops from NToV.  There are better items for Wizards, Mages, etc.  Sure the effect on their epic is still a great thing, but thats just part of their class.   <p><HR Width="25%" Align="Left">

<br>
then for cleric epic you would need to get a rare drop from trak, hrosh, cazic, inny, veeshan, vox, naggy.<br>
<br>
the rogue epic would be reduced to a 3/20.<br>
<br>
the monk epic would weigh 20 stone.<br>
<br>
the shaman epic would have the &quot;fireworks&quot; effect and not a dot.<br>
<br>
the druid epic would have a self port only to erud's crossing.<br>
<br>
ranger epic would require finding rare mobs in every zone that don't show up on tracking (they're sneaky).<br>
<br>
but hey, that's just my 2cp on risk vs reward.<br>

<br>
Like Khuul, my guild is not big. I'm a 60 warrior whose never seen the plane of air. My guild like Khuuls does not even have the resources to come near making it all the way to the aisle of the spiroc lord. We've done joint raids with guilds and haven't even reached the queen (died on the way to king)<br>
<br>
And my guild is unbelievable. They know what they're doing... smart people they listen. Just not enough resources. And, I'm sorry, but screw the ToV dragon. If I'm killing him I have better than epic.<br>
<br>
And Klaum summed up the epic comparison right there for ya... even melee wise the warrior epic is not worth it. I said this in another post but here's it again.<br>
<br>
In just a duel wield aspect:<br>
<br>
Bard Epic 16/26 eff haste (55%)<br>
Beastlord Epic 13/22 eff haste (40%)<br>
Monk epic (gloves) eff haste (40%)<br>
Ranger 13/21 eff haste (40%)<br>
Rogue 15/25 eff haste (40%)<br>
<br>
Warrior Epic 14/24 0 haste.<br>
<br>
Sorry but it's a known fact. Any class can tell you Warrior epic is a joke. I'm probably never going to see mine, I'd like to ... mainly for status, but it's hard *enough* for it to probably never happen.<br>

I might start my epic soon and do the easy stuff, ground spawns and stuff, partly out of boredom and partly because I think some day we'll get an epic.  Think about how out of date our weapons are now, and think about how out of date they will be with PoP.  I've heard our red blade is still used by some people, but what about the blue blade?  It sounds to be a worse weapon than a frosty from what I've heard, but of course I have no first hand info. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=294603 Profile </a>

<br>
Warriors are a class that is based on a equipment alot, especially melee weapons.  If the epic was the end all be all of weapons, you really think it would be any easier?<br>
<br>
Verant stated it before, to keep the game interesting, they had to keep providing upgrades to weapons.  Even Ranger epics eventually become unuseful compared to other weapons.   And SK and Paladin, and you can't tell me the Paladin epic is a PoS for the long involved quest.<br>
<br>
Seriously, I think for the reward, the warrior epic is a fine epic for the risk and time involved.  As I've said, the warrior epic can be a *major* aggro tool.  I've seen it first hand.  I created my guild from people from all over the server.  And taking a warrior from AoD, and a warrior from VA with his epic.  I tell you, that Epic proc'd like 7 times in a few melee rounds and trust me, that VA warrior had aggro.<br>
<br>
It does do it's job.  Haste comes from plenty of other items that warriors can use.  And if you don't have the resources to do Plane of Air, you are certainly not going to be killing Lord Vyemm in ToV.<br>
<br>
The bard epic is pretty much a pain to, that white scale is farely annoying.  The only hard part I see about the warrior epic is Isle 5 in Sky.  And it's just really not that hard.  <br>
<br>
I don't know what guild you are in, but if you play alot, you might want to consider moving to a higher end guild that has the resources to make you enjoy the game. <p><HR Width="25%" Align="Left">

Your post didn't relate to anything I said or asked, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you weren't talking to me.  <br>
<br>
I'm going to at least try and start doing my epic.  No I'm not getting the drops that are better than my epic.  You can see by my maglio and my sig that I'm only level 51.  My guild, or at least my guild + friends could most likely do everything that is required to get my Epic.  The only thing I would have to &quot;pray&quot; for is the green scale.  I starting it now because if we do ever get an upgrade, there will be a flood of warriors trying to get their epics.  <br>

I don't understand why you would worry about your epic if you are getting better drops anyways.<br>
---<br>
<br>
Well I don't have better now. But at this going rate it doesn't seem *that* much harder to get a MUCH better weapon than epic. Why do i want it? Status. Yes there are other small reasons but primarily status. If that makes me any less of a person *shrug* IMO If i see a warrior or a mage with an epic, I think that they have a lot of dedication and gull. <br>
<br>
---<br>

---<br>
<br>
I have no problem with the fact that there are better weapons out there but you seem to be missing the point. In comparison to every other epic it looks like crap. It does! And the difficulty is not as important as the fact that the difficulty ranking is nowhere near equal to the reward ranking.<br>
<br>
---<br>
Verant stated it before, to keep the game interesting, they had to keep providing upgrades to weapons. Even Ranger epics eventually become unuseful compared to other weapons. And SK and Paladin, and you can't tell me the Paladin epic is a PoS for the long involved quest.<br>

<br>
I'll say it again your missing the point. ITS NOT ABOUT IT 'HAVING TO BE THE BEST WEAPON IN THE GAME'. It's about (say it with me kiddies)  Risk vs Reward!! (thank you)<br>
<br>
---<br>
Seriously, I think for the reward, the warrior epic is a fine epic for the risk and time involved. As I've said, the warrior epic can be a *major* aggro tool. I've seen it first hand.

<br>
Ok so i'll share my &quot;first hand&quot; experience. 60 Rogue 60 warrior with epic. 60 rogue is out taunting 60 warrior with epic ... constantly. Is it the 60 rogue that's at fault? No sir... this is the same rogue i've ALWAYS grouped with... at this time i was ... 55/56 with &quot;meh&quot; weapons and I hold taunt off of said 60 rogue. Why is it in first hand experience? Cuz the 60 rogue is in the same room as me and i'm watching epic wielding warrior not pullin crap even while he was evading. Not once... not twice... the whole time. So don't tell me or anyone else epic is that uber of taunt. You should give the *PLAYER* credit and not the weapons. I won't deny the fact that the epic does have aggro... but it definetly doesn't do it itself (not saying it should... just pointing out it doesn't)<br>
<br>
---<br>
It does do it's job. Haste comes from plenty of other items that warriors can use. And if you don't have the resources to do Plane of Air, you are certainly not going to be killing Lord Vyemm in ToV.<br>

K thanks... just spent all my savings on RBG for 27% haste as everyone with epic has 40-55% - I can't stand it when people think it's ok because &quot;there are other haste items&quot;. And does it's job? See the problem is that you put epic Bard, Rogue, Ranger, SK, Beastlord in the same group all the melees are going to be outdamaging the warrior by far. The warrior has the worst ratio and 0 haste (rogue kinda comes in second with 15/25 but it has haste and 40attack). Now if you know your warrior so much, you know that along with taunting and procing and whatnot... damage effects aggro. So again, my little disclaimer I'm not saying it SHOULD be the best... I'm saying that it's not on par with the melee aspect<br>
<br>
---<br>
The bard epic is pretty much a pain to, that white scale is farely annoying. The only hard part I see about the warrior epic is Isle 5 in Sky. And it's just really not that hard.<br>
---<br>
<br>
*cheer* glad you find that the only hard one. But for me... and most warriors in the game - it's not that easy. I'll tell you again. I'm stuck on Green Scale - haven't had a chance at Sev and definetly not having a chance at ToV green scale. I'm stuck on Golem Metal at fear... which could possibly be done this Friday we hope... lots of fear wipes, sorry if we are that bad to not be as good as you to have a successful break in. I'm stuck on Queen chardok. Like i said before... haven't even successfuly MADE IT to KING. AND i'm stuck on the spiroc lord.<br>
<br>
You really really should understand just because something doesn't seem like an issue to you, it doesn't matter. Because there's people like me who can count guild members on fingers of their hands and allies more than likely got their guild thing going (which is completely understandable) - it's just not that easy. Your the first person i ever heard to say &quot;spiroc lord is the only real issue&quot; and it makes me laugh. And i'll be the first to tell you i don't think warrior epic is the harderst... i think mage epic is. But it's damn well worth it IMO. but again... your missing the point. Risk vs Reward. I don't think you'll ever see it thinking spiroc lord is the issue<br>
<br>
---<br>
I don't know what guild you are in, but if you play alot, you might want to consider moving to a higher end guild that has the resources to make you enjoy the game.<br>
---<br>
<br>
*sigh* Now that's the silliest statement i've heard you say. Yes please I'll stop having fun in my tight nit &quot;family&quot; to go to some uber guild and look exactly like everyone else. The point in this game, and all others... is to have fun. I'm in Outcast Adventurers (apparently you missed the big sig) and I am an officer there (again missed the big sig). We have fun... a lot of fun together. When we accomplish a task it matters. We did Umbral plains for the first time as a guild and it was a huge success and everyone was so happy for themselves and their guildies. When we complete an epic?! Oh lord it's a PARADE! And you could never convince me to leave them for all the uberest gear in the world. I don't want it! The epic isn't causing me to quit the game or anywhere near it... it's just an issue. I still have fun in EQ ok!? (jeebus just because we talk about how something sucks - we are automatically on strike!?)<br>
<br>
IMO a lot of people would see where i'm coming from... mainly because they were already thinkin it. But with you... this has got to be a losing struggle. Until you can read what people are saying... do the notes and compare things yourself (sorry but putting bard epic in line with warrior epic because of the white scale kinda doesn't help your case), like i did, I don't think there's a point to you posting more. Because we got your idea... you think it's not that hard and the warrior epic is uber. Thanks.<br>
<br>
Sorry but last word... everyone knows this but you...<br>
<br>
Warrior epic is definetly not par to Risk vs Reward<br>
<br>
That's the issue. We're allowed to point it out.<br>
<br>
As for me?<br>

&gt; me any less of a person *shrug* IMO If i see a warrior or a mage with<br>
&gt; an epic, I think that they have a lot of dedication and gull.<br>
<br>
This part was interesting. Since it's too late in game to upgrade the epics, they could only make it easier. If it was easier, it wouldn't have the same status since it wouldn't require this dedication and gull anymore, which would lead to you not wanting the epic.<br>
<br>
I don't see the issue with haste really, mobs required for epics drop droppable 36% hasteitems. Monk and bard epic have only spell-haste (which bards get from songs anyway), and sk epic doesn't have haste at all.<br>
<br>
&gt; damage effects aggro<br>
<br>
Damage affects surprisingly little, I've tanked through emperor and seru while doing 0 damage overall. Amount of swings on the other hand do affect some, and 24 is a bit slow. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=32021">Vesi</a> Lisko <<a href="http://www.ascentguild.com">Ascent</a>></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/uvesi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vesi</A> at: 8/28/02 7:09:42 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ueelyen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eelyen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#333333>(8/28/02 7:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Epic Upgrad</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Sorry but last word... everyone knows this but you...<br>

<br>
I disagree, It's perfectly in line with the Risk vs Reward.  None of the mobs in Kunark/PoS are at the difficulty level of NToV Spawns nor high end Luclin spawns where you say and we know better weapons drop. <br>
<br>
The Warrior epic is the best Kunark based weapon available to the warrior class.  For Risk vs Reward, I do think it is in line.  For Time vs reward, perhaps not.  You are right, I am part of a guild of all 60s, that find these encounters Trivial. <br>
<br>
But seriously, I've played this game for over 3 years, I was in the first Sev, Tal, and Gore battles.  I've seen the trials, I've seen the wipes.  But 2 years later, they are not really anything in comparison to what is out there now.  <br>
<br>
The Epics were not designed for a guild of level 51's (I know you are 60).  I don't know the *average* level of your guild, but when you take the average level of your group of people, maybe you would see that for your group, the warrior epic is just to hard.  When your average group is closer to the Kunark max where the epic's were designed for...you will probably find it alot easier.  <br>
<br>
And about your guild, I think it's great you are in a close group of friends and enjoying the game.  More power too ya. <p><HR Width="25%" Align="Left">

Actually I would rather have it that way.  <br>
<br>
/agree DiefenbakerBakendiefer<br>
<br>
I too am in a small guild.  There are 6 of my best RL friends in the guild, along with other good people that I've been playing EQ with in the last 2 years.  I wouldn't leave for &quot;uber loot&quot;, like the majority of EQ'ers.  When I play the game it's about hanging with my friends and having fun.  Increased loot due to leaving my friends behind is not my idea of &quot;fun&quot;.  <br>
<br>
I too just spent 27k on an RGB.  Why?  Because my haste item was an FBSS and lacking ac and stats in that spot really hurt.  I'm just glad I had the cash for get one, most people don't see that kind of cash at level 51.  Then again I'm only 51 because I take a lot of time trying to get cash LOL.  I think the haste issue isn't really about the epic.  Warriors need more right click haste items.  Right now there are 2 (plunder eyepatch and marv. belt) that don't require charges.  Both of which are bascially unobtainable by most.   <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=294603 Profile </a>

I may be in a high end guild where we raid and get loot alot.  But it's not just about loot, it's about doing and seeing more of the game.  To us, that is what makes the game fun.  Raiding and doing large scale encounters.<br>
<br>
When you get to close to 300 days playing time, you'll realize you can't group for 3+ years and the game retain fun.  Everquest I'm sorry to say is based around loot and advancing is highly loot oriented.  <br>
<br>
If you are in a smaller guild that can't get the resources together to do an encounter, the other recommendation I would recommend is finding another guild with similar interests and forming a sort of alliance.  And work on your epic's together. <p><HR Width="25%" Align="Left">

Manaburn is actually a gift to smaller guilds.  If you don't have any manaburners in your guild consider this.  One of you was telling me Green Scales are selling for 100k (who in the hell would pay this?), but anyways.... Why not take 10k, and on a day you know Sev is going to spawn...camp him with a couple friends and hire a couple manaburn wizards for around 5k each.  And when he spawns they will come over and Manaburn him with your guild and bam.  Easy kill. <p><HR Width="25%" Align="Left">

The difficulty of killing Sev, Talen, heading to Sky and doing Winglord isn't as difficult today as it was when everyone was prepping for Velious, back when ac was indeed king.<br>
<br>
Even in today's Luclin game with huge mob hitpoints, huge player hitpoints, heading to Sky isn't a challege, it's a chore. The warrior epic is worth getting for the parade that Deifenbaker was talking about and the great agro the red blade generates. The blue blade is a piece of crap... Who wants a 14/24 weapon that's a quest when they can get a 10/18 off a dragon as easy as Sev (Wuoshi) and get a weapon that swings a lot more (per Vesi's taunt arguement)?<br>
<br>
As far as getting the resources to do it, I feel that OA is a few months from being able to do your epic solo. Chardok Royals aren't hard, Sev is a joke (just have to catch him up), Fear is something everyone has to learn. Only point I'll agree is PoA again. Like Khuul said, talk to us and we'll figure something out. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Dief, the only agro generator on the epic is the red blade, proc that sucker and it's a bucketload of taunt.<br>
<br>
The warrior epic is worth the amount of time put into it, but it's only worth it if you haven't got access to Kreizenn's Flame or any decent Luclin/WestNorthToV named drop, it's just sad that all that effort and you only get half an epic (the other half stays in your scabbard).<br>
<br>
All in all, the chore of getting the warrior epic justifies the apparent gimpyness of it - only half of it is worth a damn!<br>

PITA stands for Pain In The @#%$.  A Fight noone wants to go to because either they don't get loot, or it ruins faction.  Planar Fights COULD be PITA fights, but aren't counted as such because planar raids are theoretically for everyone to have fun raiding.  Honest.<br>
<br>
For example the Shissar spirit in Fear would be both a PITA and Planar fight, but would only count towards the Planar fights.  Like the Golem is both PITA and Planar, but only counted as Planar.  And the Hate stone.<br>
<br>
The simple fact is- While the overall risk vs reward is probably OK for the warrior epic, Everyone ELSE's Risk vs Reward isn't.<br>
They don't &quot;get&quot; anything for working on the Warrior epic with you.  MOST epics either don't require that much raiding, Have an infinitely better reward to the guild as a whole, AND/OR Have a number of drops on Epic-only mobs.

<br>
Well on my epic status i'm still stuck on the green scale, queen chardok, fear metal, and spiroc lord.<br>
<br>
I'm going to try and camp Sev, leveled my own ranger high enough to just camp him with it. But i figure the only thing that's gonna happen is not getting people in time. With the scale selling for 175k (i don't know WHY - for 75k you can get a fleshgrinder)<br>
<br>
I might have a spiroc MQ, i hope. The trade for the blade is actually pretty resonable, but if i'm gonna get it from the MQ it's gonna be QUITE a while from now. Several several months at least i imagine.<br>
<br>
Queen, might take her down today or tomorrow if we have enough people. We've camped king 3 times now. Killed him a total of 6 or more times. The one time we said &quot;lets try queen&quot; was the time we had half of our raiding party and we knew it couldn't be done. Wish me luck on her takedown soon.<br>
