So, all of you who so choose, come post here, express your side, and I will come back and summarize with my side, let's get this out so that you all can see you have no reason to say two words to me regarding this entire issue.

<br>
You asked some ex guildmates about a Hate raid and they told you when we were going and next thing you know that night's raid was preempted.<br>
<br>
We told our folks that loose lips sink ships and you shouldn't tell people in competing raid groups anything about upcoming raids.<br>
<br>
Either - <br>
You were already going to raid Hate and went up at the originally scheduled time or...<br>
You were but moved it up after learning of the competing raid or...<br>
You were not but wanted to and when turned down you organized your own.<br>
<br>
In ANY of these cases, the correct response to your questions should have been, &quot;I do not know.&quot; or &quot;Not sure- couldn't tell you if we were.&quot;  The second they told you when we were going, it became impossible to keep the situation clean so it was as much their problem as yours.<br>

I'll bite on your little 'baited hook' here.  Funny how you said you posted it on the 'offended parties' boards, but it didn't appear on our guild board.<br>
<br>
I have nothing to hide here and I'll even reference your post on our guild board for others to view and make their own decisions.  We all know that people will form their own opinions anyway <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
As you and I talked about that night, my job as a Guild Leader is to find as much information as I can on an issue and make the best decision I can from that information.  I became involved in this as it was brought to my attention via guild officers.  Also since you were a prior member of our guild, I wanted to get to the bottom of this and find some kind of resolution.<br>
<br>
Of the 6 random people from your guild that I spoke with the night of the 'incident' 5 of them had no information or knowledge of this post on your board that you referenced.  One of them simply stated they could not comment on the subject.  The 5 others stated that it was basically a pick up type event.  Now on the flip side of that... of the random folks tied with our alliance, each stated that you attempted to join our event and were told that you needed to contact the raid leader of the event or that you were told no by the raid leader.<br>
<br>
I stated to you that night that after the research collected it all smelled fishy.  I'll state here that I also told you that there was not enough information collected by me to prove a deliberate pre-empt or otherwise.... still just fishy.  Not accusing... but not dismissing either.  As a result of that, our guild took precautions, which I also addressed was not intended to offend you.<br>
<br>
Here is the post on our board regarding this incident if any of you chose to want to view it:  <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub21.ezboard.com/fauroraknightsgeneral.showMessage?topicID=978.topic">Titled Kolena...</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
Of course didn't reference any banter here that was exchanged in tells between you and other individuals as I obviously cannot / did not witness their chat box.  Heck, half the time I can't keep up with my own.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I've known you for a long time.  I'm speaking the rest of this as just Kolena and not Kolena the guild leader.  Your 'invitation' on the 'offended parties' boards seems to me to be an act for attention or to fuel the fire, so to speak.  A fire that would have burned out in it's own time.  Adding to the fire or enticing people to continue this discussion doesn't prove that you did nothing wrong, which I'm sure was your intent.  However the maner in which you chose to present your 'invitation' seems to more or less prove that there might actually have been some truth to what others are saying about the 'assumed' pre-empt.  Regardless of what you say or do here, people will form their own opinions of what happened based on their knowledge of the actions that occurred.  My personal opinion... it still smells fishy  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center><A HREF="http://www.auroraknights.com"><img src="http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/auroraknights/images/kol.jpg"></a><br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=163661>Check out this Rangerette's gear</a></center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ukolena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kolena</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://hometown.aol.com/ktenderheart/images/flower.gif" BORDER=0> at: 6/17/02 6:42:08 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ulordullas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LordUllas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00bie</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(6/17/02 7:12:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=68.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zorach the punching bag, episode 1</span><hr size=1> Dead Issue<br>
<br>
As raid leader of the pre-empted raid it is a Dead issue as far as Im concerned.<br>
<br>
I talked with a couple of VA members that evening that I know well and the situation seemed like a random idea to go to Hate.  Thats not what bothers me.<br>
<br>
It's when someone who claims to be a good friend of a guild, Knows that guild has a raid scheduled an hour later , and doesnt try to stop his guildmates from pre-empting. <br>
<br>
So basically Zorach you go into what I call the &quot;Scum Bucket&quot; of Norrath as far as Im concerned because your greed overcomes all integrity.   <br>
<br>
This Placing you in the &quot;Scum Bucket&quot; in no way reflects my respect for VA in any shape or form.<br>
<br>
I will no longer banter with you on this discussion.<br>

If this is such a dead issue then I'd have no need to have come this far, but rather contrary, I've received tells, and have been thru various zones, where i use the ooc channel and some member of your alliance(i don't care much to /guildstatus or /whotarget everyone who says smart ass stuff in ooc, the nature of the insults i've received were enough to indicate where they came from) responds back some smart ass comments in regards to that day.  So a dead issue it appears not to be.<br>
Let's be realistic, you have a good idea when I left AK, about 2 months ago, hell, i spoke with Ullas/Abrahms about that in skyfire mountains a day or two before i actually left the guild, so that's 2 months I've been a member of VA, having deguilded AK and got invited to VA on the same day.  Now i don't know how all guilds run, but VA doesn't make someone an officer or raid leader if you are barely a full member, however one can initiate a pickup raid if they want to, and if people want to go.  Our charter strictly forbids pressuring anyone to attend or help among a number of other things and as i have read it, forbids interference of a pick up raid in the making.  As Auspix and I spoke, he directed me to speak to maxo as he was the raid leader, maxo wasn't online, so i decided to keep checkin if he's online every so often, to see if i can join in on the hate raid set for that nite.  somewhere close to 30 minutes later the word goes out in guildchat, soandso is forming a pickup hate raid, get to sro if you wanna go, we got all of it covered.  i ask around, what's the goal of hate? they say enchanter epic for i forget who(i'm still learning some of the older school members of VA, names and alts or what not) tons of response in guild chat, sure we'll go, lets do it.  I chime in, ok, meet in sro right now? yup, and off we all go, converging on sro.  of course nearly an hour ago me and auspix spoke, i think to myself, self...we gunna but heads here with brewmasters alliance, i tell(i think it was) Zalcor(i could be wrong), hey brewmasters have a raid tonite in hate..he says, we only here for an epic piece and we're gone, they can have hate, so i dismissed it. <br>
Nearly halfway thru the 1st floor clearing, I get slammed with an extremely high volume of tells stating how much of a jerk i am, how i am steaming piles of shit, and so on, by people who's names flew by almost as fast as their insults did.  Kolena took the time to be diplomatic about it and rather than insult, she inquired and her dialog with me was more polite than she needed to be.  Abrahms, on the other hand chose to grow up to the age of 12 and throw a tantrum at me, blaming me, King Zorach, leader of VA, for running his raid out of hate.<br>
This having happened, and main tank back from resetting his cable modem, i announce afk and form a write up for /guildchat, waving a red flag at any officer online...Pantha sends me tells, what's up?  I respond, giving detail on the position brewmasters had a raid set up for hate and they say I ruined it for them.  Pantha says, you have them send tells to me from now on and i relayed the message to appropriate people.  I went on to say, well if i'm getting this much bullshit from abrahms about ruining their party, then fuck him, lets stay up here and get my piece for natures defender.  So we did.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ok, that's what happened, and is about as accurate as i consider possible.  but ponder with me, these questions...do I wield enough power in VA to call a raid on hate and run some other 5 guild alliance out of there? Probably not(i've never tried).  Could i have stopped the raid that was already organized from going into hate after an epic piece?  Hell no.  Did I announce to the raid leader (which wasn't me, by the way, in case you haven't gotten the message by now, Abrahms you dumb ass) that there was another raid gunna do hate?  yes.  Did our raid leader consider that in his planning? Yes, he was very cool about it, the plan was after we got the epic piece we were going to leave the plane.  Does any guild have reserve rights on the plane of hate? Nope, if you were there first we would not have gone at that time, the same way you guys decided not to go knowing we were in there.  <br>
<br>
In conclusion...if this truly is a dead issue then the count of my tells from anyone related to this issue will now decrease to zero, correct?  Call me a scumbag all you want, the whole sticks and stones thing...you remember from kindergarten?  This issue now has closure in my opinion because now some of your members can read facts instead of what they hear second hand from people who are unwilling to bridle their tongue in the face of a trying time.  So before you decide to waste your breath(or typing time) and try to insult me in /ooc, which actually makes me look better, try to remember, nobody deliberately pre-empted you, it was coincidental timing at its most unfortunate for you guys....but....had abrahms not gone off on me, we would have left hate 70% intact for you to come on back and enjoy.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> somewhere close to 30 minutes later the word goes out in guildchat, soandso is forming a pickup hate raid, get to sro if you wanna go, we got all of it covered. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
TOTALLY contradicts what you told me in game, which was that this was posted.  Thanks for confirming that this was a pick up raid for you all.  <br>
<br>
And Z does have his greedy moments, one comes to mind (I'm sure he'll remember)  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    We are human and all have some greedy tendency at times.<br>
<br>
As far as what you and Abe think of each other, I personally think it should be kept between you two.  Calling each other names on a board doesn't flatter either of you. <p><center><A HREF="http://www.auroraknights.com"><img src="http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/auroraknights/images/kol.jpg"></a><br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=163661>Check out this Rangerette's gear</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/uzorach.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zorach</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#333333>(6/18/02 12:15:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=68.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zorach the punching bag, episode 1</span><hr size=1> i think we have differing definitions of &quot;pick up&quot; raid.  What we deem a &quot;pick up&quot; raid is 18 VA members, one of whom is an officer, a raid roster is formed, attendance taken, and loot reported to the officer and handled in the manner we normally do loot, and pressure to attend or hindring the attendance is forbidden.  Opposed to a &quot;pick up&quot; raid, we have &quot;scheduled&quot; raids, where attendance is mandatory.  So, while the language &quot;pick up&quot; raid fits what happened that friday, the way you interpret &quot;pick up&quot; raid differs from us.  When we say &quot;pick up&quot; raid, it means attendance is not mandatory, but if you want to go, have at it, not &quot;pick up&quot; raid meaning oh golly, lets randomly do something cuz i have nothing better to do.  An example of that would  be if Lodizal was discovered up, and someone needs help with him, he says, anyone available to help me with Lodi? THAT would be what you would call &quot;a pick up raid&quot;<br>
this run on hate was posted on our board, in a passworded area, short of giving the password to the thread, here it is<br>

 Shiss is still a random 24-72 hours average pop after server reset or last killed. CT has nothing to do with his spawn time except the fact that CT repops zone. <br>

Zalcor ended up leading the raid on hate that friday. <br>
<br>
i posted this addendum, because Kolena's opinion of me really matters to me, and I hate to have bad feelings between us.  But I guess the damage is done, and I may possibly have lost a friend.  I guess my initial feeling that we weren't as close as we were rings true after all, so leaving AK was a good move for me, as if you liked me as much as I'd hoped, then you wouldn't be in a rush to prove me wrong, but in a hurry to believe my side.  Sorry hun, but I really really liked you.  really.<br>
