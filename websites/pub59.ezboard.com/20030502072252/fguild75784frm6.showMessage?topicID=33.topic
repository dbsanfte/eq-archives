But as I sit here talking with my old EQ buddies ...I remember the grand times we used to have. For those of you that don't know / remember me, I am / was ... Slith Shadowstepper / Halion Khargos. Some of you know one or the other at least ...<br>
<br>
Anyways, my heros? I'll tell you a !LITTLE! story (promise little) about a guild named Honors Vanguard. It started in around October of 00' and stayed around to this day. Even tho I am pretty much the only Honor Vanguardian around, there still rests 11 alts with the tag, so hopefully it stays around. Anyways, my heros? Let's start showing the respect. Pardon if I can't list something about everyone ...I tried. Been almost 8 or 9 months ...can't remember much.<br>
<br>
<br>
Uuldiin -- Great druid. Great guy. He would die to help anyone in need, and is always there ...even if you don't play Everquest.<br>
<br>
Saleen Leadfoot -- Amazing strategist. This man could do it all if he had the time. You were there to keep me sane bud. <br>
<br>
Kaiyne Trueheart -- Kaiyne ...man you were the best. I had so much fun with you. And I had no fear with your swords defending me and the others.<br>
<br>
Faele -- What can I say, the lady has class. A sweet lady that helps when and where she can.<br>
<br>
Avriana Summerskye -- While she doesn't speak much unless she knows you, thats what makes her cute <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Otherwise, beware of her skills unless you wish to be begging for mercy.<br>
<br>
Vato Spiritcaller -- AHHH VATO!!! Now THIS is the man. Imagine, sitting in the middle of an area, NO cleric, and this guy just up and says the funniest thing in the world. No matter what, this guy is tops.<br>
<br>
Stalfos Night -- Yea, Stalfos ....another great strategist. He helped me keep my guild together thru a ton of @#%$. And I'm not trying to make it dramatic, this was the guy who held me in check before I did something rash and stupid.<br>
<br>
Rakzum Lappdancer -- Everyone knows this fat ass <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    And everyone loves her. And if you don't, then watch out and fear the day if I ever come to Everquest, because your head will soundly fall from your neck. Rakky baby, drop me a line sometime. We had to much fun on that beer run <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Cloudskipper -- Well, he was short. He was stumpy. He did bitch like a woman. But ....HE WAS THE CLIT COMMANDER! (Can I say that?) Cloud is the man of short people. He would come running to help if and usually when I screwed up. (Paw ring a bell ;p)?<br>
<br>
Lumilea Trueheart -- Sweet Lumi. Now this girl could talk, and she talked me silly. But it wasn't annoying, it was actually nice to have a voice NOT begging for something, that light in the darkness if you will.<br>
<br>
Dalnn -- Dwarf I believe. Great one at that. He was enthuisiastic beyond belief. A true hero.<br>
<br>
Grayheart Brokenblade -- One of my first members. And one of my last as well. Loyalty is this mans name, and wooping ass is his game.<br>
<br>
Galadwyn -- Think Gally was a mage. If I remember right, he always did the right thing when it came to it. Thanks bud, you brought smiles all the time.<br>
<br>
Mezlor -- Bard, and a great one at that. This Japanese (Chinese?) man could play the instruments, and make you laugh. Now Mez, don't get me wrong, but some of your typos were the funniest things I've ever seen in Everquest.<br>
<br>
Mochlodon Shadowscale<br>
Salumando Montano -- Sal, a good ranger, a great man again. Notice the pattern? This guy was a good friend.<br>
<br>
Brynne Spiritsong -- A quirky cute lil bard lady who always had a smile on her. If you ever had a bad day, this girl could make the sun shine in a hurricane.<br>
<br>
Pyranight Mystica -- A faithful wonderful lady. She was a bit reclusive, but when brought from her shell, she was as good as they get.<br>
<br>
Vuudar -- A shadowknight with a passion nearly unrivaled. A dark elf whose heart was in the right place, with the ass wooping skill to let evil know its place.<br>
<br>
Taviis<br>
Abell Moonwulf -- My friend Abell. This guy feared nothing ...well except me. Only cause I got him killed a lot, it was still damn fun.<br>
<br>
Asmodais Blaise -- A cleric halfling. Great guy, undead beware, this guy hits harder then you would think.<br>
<br>
Kinsonn -- A great guy. He always had the wrong thing to say at the right time, kinda made the guild laugh at him as he died over and over for the hell of it :P<br>
<br>
Soulknight Bloodsword -- While I didn't get to talk to him much, I remember him well. Even tho he knew the guild was higher in levels then he was, he still wanted to join and try to be a great guildmate. Respect is written all over my face for him. <br>
<br>
Ravenscale Soulsblood -- A wonderful monk, fearless, he was a friend that tried to do the right thing. Never fear, just trust in him and things will work in the end.<br>
<br>
Antiganus Angelfeather -- A loudmouth bard. (Hah!!) He was a wisecracking bastage!!! But he was also a close friend. He was there, forcing me to laugh at his stupid jokes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Weaselo Nightscale -- Good guy, helped a lot. Need a port? BOOM! Weasel Flight 489 taking off now!<br>
<br>
Aolor -- Patience. Thats him, wish I could have helped you out more, hope you understand ...<br>
<br>
Trowaa Speedwolf<br>
Genini Bobeen <br>
Zebreanna Quelantari -- A very very personal friend of mine. This lady helped me in the hours no one would. Did she turn her back? Hell no, screw the rest that did, mucho respect and love for her.<br>
<br>
Niruudar Wraithwolf<br>
Nnan -- A very funny enchantress. Laugh? Never! Fine I'll laugh damn it, but she was sweet =) Believe she is a Euro, fun fun fun :P<br>
<br>
Soen Dtranny -- A slight typo in his name on HIS part, but do ya get it? Soen Dtranny!  So End Tyranny! (Well that was what it was supposed to be :P Don't type drunk kids!)<br>
<br>
Ialadin -- A mage with an attitude. Screw with him? Hell no, unless you like the smell of your ass on fire! This guy was the man, well the elf :P A good friend and a first class mage.<br>
<br>
Trilk Annon -- What a guy, talk crap? Pow, eat Trilk's fist. Good friend to have, he is always there when needed.<br>
<br>
Cholis<br>
Valcroft Hardcastle -- A good guy. Carried a big freaking sword if I remember. Reminds me of a president of the US ...Walk lightly, and carry a BIG FREAKING STICK!<br>
<br>
Morganese<br>
<br>
Evilbringer -- Necro man! Buddy, very very reclusive, but man when he said what was on his mind. Woah. Or uh ... whatever came to mind ;p<br>
<br>
Mistloc<br>
Destorchian<br>
Jaycup Spikes -- A member that joined towards the end. This guy was Mr. Jester himself. I have the guildpage to prove it. Look at the jokes, cracks, laughs! Did Rak ever forgive you by the way? HEY EVERYBODY!! I'M LOOKING AT GAY PORN!! Bwahahahahhahahah<br>
  <br>
Dawenz<br>
<br>
Aurick -- Man, this guy was my man. I knew him since level 4 when I saved his ass from a bat! Now that is an OLD OLD friend. We practically &quot;grew up&quot; in Everquest together. For months, we were always together. Never apart, Aurick was my friend, and more. He was like a brother I never had (Tho I'll trade mine for him :P) Aurick ...your the best man I ever knew.<br>
<br>
And that is my respect for my guildmates. And they are all, each and every single last one, a hero in my eyes and heart. I know I haven't wrote for everyone, but thats cause I'm old ....19 and getting older ...bwah hah ...Now, lets see who else there is (Lets random name people :P)<br>
<br>
Noxlupus -- Good man, tried to be fair to a T. If he did wrong, and he knew it, he admitted it and tried to right his wrong. Now thats courage.<br>
<br>
Kolena -- A close friend. And she was there ....always there if she could and really needed to be. Never forget the angel of the forest ...<br>
<br>
Lilye -- What can I say? She is a great great lady. She was always helping me and talking. I feel kind of bad that I never see her anymore. Lilye ...hope your doing good.<br>
<br>
Cudget -- AHh Cudget. Now this man ....what fun!! Hell, I'd fight beside him anyday. A great leader, a great strategist ...tho who he dates ....well WHY he dates who he does is way way way beyond me *ducks*  Anyways, he and his guild have my total respect.<br>
<br>
Diefenbaker -- Wahhahah wanna fight BarBar!?!?!?! 2 spells and ka-BLAM! This one was out for the count. Did I mention I was drunk stupid ;p? But seriously (can I actually be serious?) (Note to self, post way to damn long) (Note to self, screw it, keep going) (Note to self, why the !)(#* are you talking to yourself?) (Note ...cause ...@#%$ I'm tired ....) Anyways, I love him! Smartass barbarian, always great to wack around <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    A good friend, a better target! DIEF!<br>
<br>
Avrohom -- The ORIGINAL was a great guy. Avi played the Paladin part so well I wanted to throttle him sometimes, even tho he was a great friend and a heart very like my own. A toast to the man!<br>
<br>
Merricks -- This man is crazy. I swear to God (myself?) no matter WHAT you think, this &quot;silent&quot; dark elf is the craziest mo fo around. And the funniest =)<br>
<br>
Domaris -- A very close friend back in the day. More then that too. I loved her with all my heart. She is loyal to her friends and defends them tooth and nail. Never mess with her or her friends, and you will be lucky.<br>
<br>
I KNOW there are more ...I know it ...so many people...<br>
<br>
Well, I'll just post again when I can remember.<br>
<br>
Anyways, these are my Heros. I hope one day I can talk to or see them again. Forever will they be in my mind and heart. I shall take my leave again silently, as I have entered silently. Thank you my heros, without you, Slith Shadowstepper and Halion Khargos would never have survived as long as they have. And remember ... I never needed a reason to help anyone, I still don't. You guys are the reason why. As long as you all are still yourselves, I KNOW in my heart, that love can stand through anything.<br>
<br>

<br>
I would like to post that the funnest times (even in my current guild <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . Have been with my very first guild for a 2 and a half year strech.. Honors vanguard.. i was a loyal Recruiter, i loved the people and What we did (even tho that paw raid was a total f*** up lol)<br>
<br>
Paw raid is what i remember most. We Cleared all the way to the pit , i remember a certain person saying: Oh there only 4, just jump down, we'll mez and kill em off.. Azule, slith and i are the first ones down. BAM all of a sudden 30+ gnolls (no joke) come out of no where and slaugher our raid of 15+ ppl HAHA.. guess who comes to save the day?! shortass gnome himself Cloudy =)..<br>
<br>
my second fond memorie?:<br>
Raid in (forgot where , najena? or paw):<br>
Where were swimming down a water tunnel to a diff room. Summoned up all our EB stones. we finnaly get up. about 7 of us exit the water including slith. . BLAM , slith and his pet are mezzed ROFL, His pet starts beating the crap outa everyone while Slith starts casting Rain DMG spells on everyone.. this was funny, cuase i just barely avoided his pet and rain spells lol. there were about 14 corpses on the ground when his pet was killed. and he decharmed.<br>
<br>
Ahh the good times.<br>
<br>
i'd Like to give a shoutout to everyone Slith posted. As most of them i knew and were good friends. Some have quit, some Gave chars away, but we will always remember em =).<br>

Anyways, glad your all having fun still. Wish more of the guild read this page to know I haven't forgotten them. But yea, I might drop by now and again in the next few months. Hopefully a few people remember me and we can have some more fun times. <p>&lt;size = &quot;2&quot; color = &quot;aqua&quot; font = &quot;times&quot;&gt;<br>
