No, they don't need an upgrade.&quot;  I don't play an SK, so I can't say one way or another with confidence that they don't need an upgrade either.  All I know is that I've seen them solo, and hold better aggro in groups.  Do they need to be nerfed?  No, we just need to be given better tools to hold aggro.  Like most people I don't have 400k sitting around for a BoC.  True, on a raid a warrior is important, but the thing is any more than 2 warriors is overkill.  We need to do more damage to have a purpose when not MT.  If we are crappy characters to have in a group, and solo, something's just not right.  I can see how pally's and SK's could be pissed about having shout LFG for hours on end, I've been there.  I however with no solo skills have nothing to do while I'm waiting.  (I don't even think /gems works with the new UI, LOL)  This is not a shot at SK's, as I know they can solo, but nowhere near the way a druid or necro can solo.  Now druids get a CH?  I understand that they were also not desired in groups, but they can solo like it's nobodies business.  What about mages?  Great at soloing, awesome in groups (although I'm not sure why some people don't want to group with them).  Monks and rogues do a ton of damage, although their solo ability is not great either, they are still better at it then warriors are.  I think they are both desired at raids and XP groups as well.  Ranger, do great damage, can solo, and are wanted in groups.  Shaman?  Definitely a good class for anything.  Enchanter, same as Shaman.  <br>
<br>
I still can't believe they upped clerics &quot;ability to solo&quot;.  What cleric wants to solo?  Plus if they need to solo they have a few nukes, which I think would be potent enough to solo alone, even if they are not mana efficient.  <br>
<br>
The one thing that I can't stand is VI's silence on the matter.  They haven't done anything to make the complaints stop, of course we've all heard about their great customer service.<br>
<br>
I could be wrong and my perception could be different than someone elses, especially an SK or Pally.  But I urge them to make a warrior and level him (no twinkage) and see how hard it really is.  You can't root a mob to save your as$, nor can you snare.  All you can do is fight and take damage.  That is all we do.  The only thing we do.  Now can you see how it bothers a warrior when another classes AC and HP are very close to his?<br>
<br>
Most of our disciplines are a joke, with the exception of defensive.  Not that the rest suck, but I'm sure the raid leader won't be happy with you when the MT dies and you're MT.  &quot;Sorry defensive doesn't refresh for another 20 minutes&quot;.  There should be a seperate time for offensive and defensive disc. in my opinion.  Even if it doesn't do much for our DPS, it would still just be fun.  That's the point of playing this game isn't?  <br>
<br>
<br>
...just the thoughts from my head...<br>

<br>
Yeah, I'd start a warrior, but...then I'd be bored.<br>
<br>
As far as solo?  A monk will solo more effectively.<br>
<br>
I don't think warriors need a better taunt ablity.  That pretty much trivializes aggro control, which is something that I enjoy having to work with on a raid.  Y'know, that strategy thing.<br>
<br>
I do think maybe they should recieve innate avoidance or absorbtion for damage.  I think Pallies and SK's need that too though, maybe a watered down version.<br>
<br>
But a lot of warriors bitch at the taunt ability of a SK (this has been drastically nerfed, btw, as of last patch with the resist changes).  So, I can get aggro?  I can't tank as well as a warrior can, why would I want to?  I've drawn aggro in some cases for placement or when the MT dies midfight, but in the case of placement I just FD or HS to give aggro back to the warrior.<br>
<br>
So, in a nutshell... an SK is a second rate tank, a fifth rate damage dealer, but can draw aggro on command.<br>
<br>
Erm, and disciplines, I won't even go into the joke that are the SK discs. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Not trying to bitch about my class, I really do love it, and wouldn't play anything else.  Just trying to show ya, you're not that bad off.<br>
<br>
PS AoE taunt...  The enchanter Visage line...  The SK voice line (there, ya got aggro).<br>

Even using the taunt button, a lot of warriors can't pull a mob off the monk.

It's a team effort.  If the monk gains aggro, he needs to FD.<br>
<br>
SK and enchanter +aggro spells help out, and that's a 20 % mod to hate.  That's huge.<br>
<br>
Then there is AoE taunt.  Yeah, I know most people don't have that.<br>
<br>
If the shield changes ever go live, they'll add in a block skill for all shield users.  Added that there is also talk of a change to add +hate to a bash and +aggro procs on some shields.<br>
<br>
It's not live, I don't know if it'll ever go live.  That 20 % hate mod though, mixed with proccing weapons will stick a mob to you, though, and is live.<br>
<br>
Most of that has to do with raiding.  As far as grinding, I have troubles keeping aggro from a monk if I don't have KEI in a grind group. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=155250"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="http://www.carpenocturnus.com/vember.gif"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ujaraxalle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaraxalle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#333333>(9/19/02 11:31:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warrior Upgrades...</span><hr size=1> If the shield thing goes live, warriors will no longer be the best tank class.  SK's and pally's will surpass us.  Why?  Because think about how much of an issue it is right now for a warrior to keep aggro.  We're damned if we do and damned if we don't.  <br>
<br>
DO use shields: <br>
<br>
There's no way we will do enough damage to keep aggro, and to have one less hand swinging for a proc, the amount of FD and evade to be used by monk/rogue will increase considerable.  Decreasing damage to the mob and increasing the # of CH's per mob.  Increasing the time to kill the mob, and increasing the percentage of failure.<br>
<br>
Don't use shields: <br>
<br>
The 3 Minute warrior is easily replaced by the an SK or pally.  The amount of damage they take will be less than ours b/c we aren't using a shield.  Descreasing the number of seconds in the CH chain.  Also, warriors dual wielding have an increased chance of ripiste, therefore increasing the amount of damage taken, and decreasing the CH timer again.  Also warriors don't get 1 handed 28/30 weapons the way SK's and pallys do, we're at a big disadvantage there.  A SK can keep aggro without ever hitting the attack button.  The same might be true with a pally, though I've never heard about it.  <br>
<br>
I think a block mod on the shields is a good idea, despite my above statements.  I do think warriors need something to compensate for them not being able to effectively use them.  <br>
<br>
Again dual wield is supposed to be a benefit, it does less damage than 2handers now, and if they add procs and block mods to the shields, it will basically be useless.  There needs to be a min damage or damage modifier to the offhand.  <br>
<br>
It's been 2 expansions now without any real upgrades, it's about time.<br>
<br>
This is the same argument I've posted again and again.  I'm ready to start cutting and pasting it now, LOL.<br>

<br>
Monks are just pretty good tanks.  Sorry.  I dont like it much either.  There have been plenty of times where I just don't feel like fighting for aggro, and I'll let them tank (or hell, sometimes they've got more hp and ac than me).

Seriously, take a look at your maglio and take a look at mine.  Because I'm a troll, I have superior starting stats.  Take a look at my gear.  It's all champions, cobalt and indicolite.  I've got pretty high AC in my non-visable armor peices.  Granted I know that I am 4 levels lower than you, but look at your stats.  Your AC is higher and your hit points are higher!  With my current gear at level 60 my hp will be about 2600 and my AC something like 1106.  I even have a better haste item than you and it doesn't matter.  I guarantee you that on a mob we both con blue, you will outdamage me and out aggro me.  (I think it would hold true if we were the same level, but don't take my word for it try it with a 55 warrior)  Once shields go live you will take damage better than me too.  Take a step back, the numbers don't lie.  JUST LOOK AT THE STATS! <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=294603 Profile </a>

If you don't average higher than 40, I'm sorry. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=155250"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="http://www.carpenocturnus.com/vember.gif"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ueldryc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eldryc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cons Dubious </span><br>  Posts: 110<br> <font color=#333333>(9/26/02 1:31:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warrior Upgrades...</span><hr size=1> face it, warriors are a reserve you pull out of the attic to tank in raids here and there and leech exp in grind groups that would be better with a different class.  In pretty much any 1 group thing, a lot of monks can tank as well or better than warriors (thanks godly block skill and stupd freaking AC softcap).  In these same groups, epic mage pets tank better than most 60 warriors, hands down, and obviously deal a lot more dmg too.  The dmg I can accept.  The better tanking I can't, but it's easily observed the many times I've been in groups like that and my cleric who usually keeps us healed said it's no contest.  When tanking the same types of mobs, the pet needs way less healing then I do.  A good 60 monk is closer to me in how much healing is required, but sometimes needs less.  I don't have enough recent personal experience with SK's and Paladins to say one way or another on them, other than from looking at the statistics they should be pretty close.  Furor from FoH described it well a few months ago when referring to warriors... &quot;put a skirt on Sally&quot;. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Keep some things in mind though.<br>
<br>
You need to be able to produce what you're saying. You need to prove you lack in whatever department due to whatever. And it has to be consistant.<br>
<br>
That one isolated incident where you were unable to do xxx will not suffice to make a game change.<br>
<br>
When you ask for upgrades, keep it in line with the &quot;classic&quot; warrior and their role. Even in D&amp;D Warriors were not &quot;powerful&quot;. But... they did keep their place as The Tank™.  <p><center><img src=http://image1ex.villagephotos.com/extern/712453.jpg></img><br><b>Hierophant<br>Bitter Monkeys<br>Rodcet</b><br><i>We just wanna rock your freakin' socks off~</i></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ujaraxalle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaraxalle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cons Threateningly </span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#333333>(9/27/02 8:36:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warrior Upgrades...</span><hr size=1> There is no place to post as far as I know, or I would have done it.

Personally I think the warrior epic is a good weapon.<br>
The work involved to attain it is not out of line. Yes there are better weapons. Also there are better armor drops than the velius armor quests. Everything has a flow to it. A steady progression to it. It seems to me poeple want to &quot;jump&quot; right into the &quot;top of the line modules&quot;. It just rearly works that way. Item upgrads are slow and hard work. I use my epics in grind groups and raids all the time. Yes i have better than epics. I choose my epics or combination of epic and another weapon about 75% of the time. I rearly have taunt issues and i am very happy with the epics. I would like to point out that the differants in a lvl 51 and a lvl 60 is huge! Now we have AA points. Well the same goes for that also. A lvl 60 no AA vs a lvl 60 with 20 AA is huge again. In the end its all about the gear. Yes there are ubar monks with 4.5k unbuffed hp but, in that same ubar guild sits a warrior with 6k unbuffed hp. Just cant compare a 3 year old lvl 60 warrior to a 1 year old lvl 60 warrior. It would be sad if the 3 year old charecter can be beat out by a 1 year old warrior. When i got my epics it was a great upgrade for me. Sure primal is better but my epic was achivable at the time and i needed better gear to adventure into ST for a primal. Its just like i said, &quot;There is a flow to things&quot;.<br>
Well thats about it for my thoughts on it for now.<br>
