Many players, most warriors, and some who can just &quot;see it&quot; think we seriously need an upgrade.  I'm one of those who feels that we are vastly underpowered.  From no special skills to save our own asses in a pinch, to lower damage output than the hybrids no counting spells.  To the new block mods on shields, the AC cap, and a constantly shrinking HP advantage.  Anyone who plays a warrior knows all about this, anyone who disagrees in my opinion simply has not played a warrior long enough to understand, or is completely UBER and doesn't realize that not all of us visit VT daily.  As far as Velious Quest armors go, it makes us warriors fall well below par.  <br>
<br>
Many people feel differently than the above, that is your choice.  What I want to discuss in this thread (for those who agree with me) is what the hell can we do to improve our situation?  Petition?  Write e-mails?  Post to some EQ message board?  Hand written letters for crying out loud?  <br>
<br>
<br>
First warriors need to decide what we want other than Gimick_upgrade_001.  Please also post ideas for potential upgrade that isn't overpowering or chessy, like giving us mana.  If you don't think we need an upgrade, this is not the place to post or flame, kindly take your thoughts to the tons of other boards where they are arguing about this topic.  This is a place to discuss what we want and how are we going to get it...<br>

Our main job is to suck up damage, so anything that decreases how much we get hit or how much damage we take would be right in line with the whole warrior &quot;thing&quot;, and would make us useful again as MT.<br>
<br>
However, it also might be nice if they gave us a more useful taunt ability.  Perhaps just fleshing out the existing taunt and making it actually add a small amount of hate instead of just temporarily moving us to the top of the hate list, only to be instantly knocked off again by the monk/rogue/ranger/wizard/cleric of the group.<br>
<br>
Honestly, if they'd just throw us a bone in these two categories, I'd probably shut up, hehe.<br>

Allow them to go up to 15-20%.  That would definitly help out warriors.<br>
<br>
Plus the taunt fix would be pretty decent.  And yes it would be nice if they raised the AC softcap to allow for more migitation of damage.  <p><HR Width="25%" Align="Left">

I used my ToD to see if I could get it to proc slow, I was happy to see that it proc'd on the second swing!  Here's what is disturbing, I was pretty much dead until a cleric friend of mine saw my peril and healed me.  How is it possible that a 51 warrior with pretty good ac (1020), using pretty sweet weapons (ToD proc'd and then I switched to my Black Acylia Halberd) got totally owned by a 50% slowed mob?  It was a Cockatrice too. meaning it was 44th lvl MAX.  I will also add that my str was 217 and I was wearing an iksar regen BP.  <br>
<br>
I was so pissed after it happened that I wrote VI a complaint e-mail to the devoloper's section.  yeah, I know nothing will come of it, but I felt that I had to do something other than whine to fellow warriors.  Here's what I got back in response.<br>

It's basically a blow off letter.  I didn't expect anything less, except maybe someone actually typing to me saying, &quot;We're working on balencing issues still, we're not sure what to do about warriors yet.&quot;  I knew it was too much to hope for, so I didn't put too much faith that I would get that reponse.  <br>

<br>
A manager at a fast food resturant was told that the girl taking her order was rude to her.  The manager apologized and said that she would speak with the employee.  The manager spoke with the girl and as it turns out, the customer was very rude to her.  The manager took the employee's word and knew that it most likely wouldn't happen again, she had been warned.  There was another complaint about the girl a week later, but this time about service.  There were a few complaints here an there about her, on with her forgetting to put fries on the tray, and one where she didn't make the order to go when it was supposed to be eaten in the resturnat.  Did the manager speak to her about it?  No, in that line of work you have to learn that customers are always going to complain, there will always be someone who is unhappy, and that there will always be mistakes.<br>
<br>
A new guy got hired a little while after that.  He too got a complaint about his attitude.  As always his boss asked him what happened and his boss gave him the benefit of the doubt that it wasn't the employee's fault, and if it was he had been warned.  A few days later there was a complaint about his attitude again.  The boss didn't ask him what happened and ignored it.  After a few more complaints in the next few weeks the manager asked the new guy why he had so many complaints?  The new guy gave some lame excuse of course.  After a few more complaints the new guy had to be fired.<br>
<br>
What's the difference between the guy and the girl?  The guy had made the same mistake again and again, AND was complained about by many different people.  Whereas the girls was a mistake here and there, and always something minor that she was improving on.<br>
<br>
My one complaint to them won't mean much, but if a lot of people complain and type them an e-mail once in a while maybe there will be something done to improve our situation.  That's still a maybe.  Our chances for success also improve if we all complain about the same thing.  In 90% of the things I've read, we want more HP's and the softcap to be moved for us, a defense mod and maybe a little more damage, but but not much.  Possibly getting a new skill, like protecting others would be helpful.  So by all means, send them complaints, and send them often.  Anytime you feel like you've been shafted because you're a warrior, write them.  If you're bored and have nothing to do, write them,  if you've just been killed by a mob because your sow left you when you were trying to run through a zone, write them, if you spent the night shouting LFG, write them.  You get the point.  It might not even help, but you've done your part to at least aggrivate the people who have aggrivate you. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=294603 Profile </a>

I mean they are basically a hybrid of warriors.  Their Damage output isn't as good as warriors and their heals hardly give them power in a real battle.  I'm not talking PvP.<br>
<br>
They don't have the ability to taunt like a warrior, Aggro is based off swings instead of damage for the most part.  So really I don't understand why so many warriors complain about this. <p><HR Width="25%" Align="Left">

Why would you got problems with SK's getting more aggro if you can't hold it? It's now my fault my spells aggro more than an Warrior itself.Other classes seem to like SK's having an aggro spell but let me see...you guys want more aggro it seem? k, I let you warriors get all the aggro from now on and I won't bother trying to peel some mob from an cleric cuz I let you warriors do it since you warriors think you are &quot;unbalance&quot;. <br>
<br>
Warriors got more hp, ac, an way higher skill cap, duel weild and better melee stats than Sk and you guys complaining how we keep aggro? You guys are not the really unbalance one's here. SK's themself got problems too ya know like our HT is such an joke when using it against an mob same lv as u or higher and it only bring their Hp down 5%. SK's spells at our lv are an joke too like my 2dmg DS/200hp self buff spell which is an lv60 SK buff. You guys should be glad we can get aggro and do other stuff. <br>
<br>
SK's are always considered an Alterative tank class for grp with there is no warriors lfg. Heh, you warriors have more important role than SK's too.For example, You less likely to see an SK be MT for an raid. Warriors are always and will be considered to be the #1 best tank class while Paladins/SK's will always be 2nd.<br>
<br>
btw Verant has Nerfed SK's Big Aggro spell (Shadow Votex, Disease Cloud, Darkness line) it seem, so now don't you feel better about yourself while Verant screw the SK's class and make the warrior class &quot;balance&quot; now? SK class is the most unbalance class so far in the game since most of our spells are not fitted to our lv, an lv60 SK should not be using an lv9 spell to get aggro,  and don't forget that 80% of SK's spells can be use by other classes due to it being some kinda of proc or effect of an weapon with an SK spell on it,etc.<br>
<br>
You guys shouldn't complain if you guys got it good alrdy being an tank and all while some classes are more unbalance than you are. And to answer why SK's can use spells is b/c we are half Necro and half warrior. <p>___________<BR>

Honestly we can't keep agro for $hit if we don't have EB weapons.  Any melee class can take it away from us at will.  We don't &quot;get&quot; aggro, others let us have it.  Dual wield?  Don't even complain about it because we don't get the 28/30 or other such weapons.  if you don't have 50k to blow on a weapon you get something that's 9/19, and hopefully a proc.  With 112 dex I'm lucky if I get one proc per fight.  Sure it's a little higher than that in groups, so maybe I get 2 procs per right, a whoping 200 damage on a 5k&gt; mob, can you say almost non-existant?  Sure they can give you some good aggro, if procs ever go off, they are completely unreliable.  An SK can keep aggro with spells alone, he doesn't even have to attack, it's been proven.  Why do people think that we are shouting to nerf another class?  VI has showed that they won't nerf anyone.  In fact they keep upgrading, and upgrading and upgrading, when is it our turn?  As far as the HP/AC advantage, the cap is about 1250, an SK can get to that very easily, no advantage there.  HP advantage?  When you are talking a 200hp difference, there really isn't a difference when the mobs start quadding for 200.  With the 2handers being upgraded a while back, dual wield means nothing except for a proc, which SK's can cast with a click of the button.  1hs weapons don't do the damage that 2hs weapons do.  Our attack skill caps may be higher, but the damage output is very close. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=294603 Profile </a>

Being that once i lose it to a cleric, it's easier for my SK roomate to get it back, then how he hands it back to me.  I think the person a few up missed what I was saying.  Along the lines Khuul was going, I think you missed the title of this thread, I think you were looking for the one titled &quot;SK's over Warriors&quot; or &quot;Warriors over SK's&quot;.  Maybe you were just looking to show the difference's between SK's and Warriors.

People have selective reading. People interpret things differently, best not try to try.<br>
<br>
For example your just gonna say &quot;I didn't say '&lt;insert class&gt; is overpowered' I said....&quot;<br>
<br>
and the next reply will be. &quot;My class is not overpowered. &lt;insert attacks&gt;&quot;<br>
