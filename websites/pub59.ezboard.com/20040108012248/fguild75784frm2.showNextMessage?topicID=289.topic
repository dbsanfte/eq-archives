<br>
--------------------<br>
<br>
I have recently noticed a problem with Rezz timers and without an answer of what to do, I tried something I was dreading - the chat server.<br>
<br>
The chat server had, in the past, answered none of my questions I have ever.... ever asked. And not exaggerating - 95% of the times I've been there The guides or GMs have just been chatting it up the entire time.<br>
<br>
Now I'm not a prude, I like to make sure theres some fun in the job but I'm never asking for brain surgery tips, a lot of simple questions I have asked for sometimes up to several hours.<br>
<br>
Tonight I had put forward what I was practicing. 4:10 this morning There were 2 guides and 1 GM on - about 7 at most people in chat. Saw about 3 of the players talking. When I entered Guid Kinolana-Rathe was talking casually to someone in the channel. I wait for the spam to clear and I say my question that was the along the lines of:<br>
<br>
&quot;My friend's corpse timer is going down while he's not online, what can I do&quot;<br>
<br>
3 seconds after someone asks about buying the Everquest trilogy. Kinolana and another guide (from VS or VZ or RZ server) replied to the man following my statement. I followed their replies with a &quot;.....&quot; hoping to strike attention at least. At this point I caught the GM saying some useful general information about Tech Support and what not (thought he was a bot it was so rehearsed). Then conversation ensues. Someone else asks about Tech Support the two guys answer him. Letting it slide I repeat the question about &quot;What should I do about my friend&quot;<br>
<br>
Needless to say it was overlooked again. Now I guess I could've asked AGAIN but I guess I tired of trying that so many times before and waited over an hour. So minutes later <br>
<br>
I irrately say &quot;GRRR Is this somewhere where I can get some questions answered or is this just a something for silly chat?&quot;<br>
<br>
The Guide oh so humurously responded with &quot;This is General Chat&quot; with the 'chat' highlighted. I remarked about if we're not able to get any help here why are they there? And the two guides informed me that sometimes they don't have answers to all the questions. At this time the GM had said a reply to what I originally asked, telling me exactly what to do. He had a nice long explanation of conning the corpse doing a /w all on him to show he wasn't online and report it.<br>
<br>
I sincerely thanked him. I remarked to the guides that if they didn't know the answer it would be considerate to say something at least. If you ask me Kinolana was not having a bright day because she had repeated what she said about not having all the answers (I'm not sure how that helped her case) and then said - this is great - &quot;what was the question&quot;. Her whole argument was thrown out the window because it just goes to show she didn't even KNOW what I said so her &quot;We don't have all the answers&quot; autoresponse is ridiculous! Then the other guide said if they had to respond to every question their head would explode. While I agree and will tolerate that response during peaktimes - I again repeat - 7 people, 7 players if that in the chat room, If they can't handle less than 7 that person needs to find a new line of work.<br>
<br>
I thanked the GM again sincerely and did what he suggested. Checking in later to get the names the first line I see is Kinolana saying something humurous and second line I see is another player asking if what he's typing is being seen.<br>
<br>
Chat servers need serious help, like I said fun on the job is great and all but to the extreme of people who've attempted to get help from there for over 3 years now NEVER EVER getting a single drop of help until kicking and screaming - that's when I hope their not on your payroll. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~outcastadventurers/images/diefenrox.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

I'm sure you know this, but it helps to set this up...  The guides are volunteers, the GM's are employees.  The GM's are the only ones allowed to decide WHEN a res is warranted, though guides did have the ability to do so when the GM approved it- either on a case by case basis or on the entire server outages.  Sometimes I think a guide needs GM approval to get a hall pass to use the bathroom.  That tends to stamp down any helpful traits the guides have, but they don't want to give up the free account that comes from spending time in the chat room. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/bguild75784.showUserPublicProfile?gid=diefenbakerbakendiefer>DiefenbakerBakendiefer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cons Dubious </span><br>  Posts: 196<br> <font color=#333333>(2/28/03 10:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=282.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~outcastadventurers/images/diefbook.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Letter to SoE</span><hr size=1> Aye i know about the difference between guides and GMs, but the point is that volunteers anywhere are volunteers for a reason, to help out, they can't tell me that since this is called a &quot;chat&quot; that they can ignore the volunteering part of their JOB and talk about every stupid idea that comes to their mind. I've noticed that the guides are the ones that are the problem but in the past it's not been the case. I have noticed GMs on SEVERAL occassions chatting it up just as much or more than the guides inside the channel. And for that matter, why are the GMs so ok with the guides always talking. The GM last night did not stand up or stand against the guides I was questioning. I realize it's probably not their boss but they are a freakin GM, they definetly have more seniority over the guides. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/bguild75784.showUserPublicProfile?gid=heimdallazureguardian>Heimdall Azureguardian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cons Indifferent </span><br>  Posts: 237<br> <font color=#333333>(3/1/03 10:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=282.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Letter to SoE</span><hr size=1> Yeah I know.

<br>
If you looked at what i asked I stated that my friend was *OFFLINE* and his corpse timer was counting down. Even if they offered a rezz the issue was he was offline so that wouldn't have helped out would it? I only asked what should i do about the rezz timer counting down... that's it. BUT i was asking a question and was ignored.... again. If you don't know... say &quot;I don't know&quot; and viola! I'm gone!<br>
<br>
Or if you want, you can IGNORE me talk about stupid crap and then when i ask you why am i being ignored you start repeating &quot;we don't have all the answers&quot; and admit you didn't know what the question was, that's adding fuel to the fire.<br>
<br>
This is NOT about guides not having the authority to do something, this is about the fact that everytime, no matter how short the trip, i have come in here, the guides and sometimes the gms are doing NOTHING but chatting it up in there. I swear i would have more luck petitioning at 2 am til a guide or gm comes on then to sit in an empty chat room with me and 3 other guides and gms.<br>
<br>
Apparently i wasn't clear about this in my letter because i got an automated response saying that 'there are some problems due to the release of LoY and they hope in time they will be resolved' blah blah blah bullshi.t<br>
<br>
Oh and what the GM told me to do was to do a /w all on the person then con their corpse and report it.

<br>
Also, Dief, I agree with you about the chatrooms.  Some people do go there to chat; however, the majority are people that have an in-game problem and no GM/Guide is visible in the game so they have no clue when their petition has a chance at being answered.  I myself had a problem once where my warrior went LD in RM after being aggroed by some wicked casting sphynx.  When I got back on, I got a necro and cleric to agree to accompany me to RM.  However, I couldn't leave my bind zone (SH).  I tried everything. A friend summoned me a suit of plate armor, I crashed.  I go to the bank, open account, crash.  I was super bugged.  I petitioned and got diddly for response.  I was at the point that I didn't care about a rez, I just wanted my gear.  After being frustrated about not having 2 Guides answer a petition after sitting in SH for 3 hours, naked (Gems gets real old after 5 minutes), I went to the chat room.<br>
<br>
The chat room was spam, help, spam, help, spam, look at me I'm uber spam, help... I got the response after 90minutes to contact tech support.  So I log out and contact tech support, they tell me it is an ingame issue not a tech support issue and forward my problem to the head GM.<br>
<br>
Day2:  I log on and still have problems with crashing.  I petition, no dice after 2 hours. I head to chat room. A GM is there and after talking with me, he tells me to log on.  I do so. He tells me that he talked with a more tech oriented Gm and was given the suggestion that I should open my files and delete the RM file, then run patcher and let it reload. I do this..still bugged.  I am in the process of typing new petition when the GM sends me a tell saying any luck?  He then heads to RM and tells me he is looking at my corpse, am I ready for rez?  I say yes.  After 3 minutes, he sends tell what are you doing in SH still? I say waiting on rez.  He told me umm, I already did. I said I never received it.  He tried to port me out, rez me, nothing would work.  He told me to hang tight a second cause he was making this top priority and getting a hold of his technical friend. After about 10 minutes, he told me to log off, shut down EQ, and come back in 10 minutes. I asked why? He said they were going to roll back my char file. <br>
<br>
I did as instructed. I logged back in and hadn't even done anything when he sent me a tell saying ready to zone? I said yes and next thing I know I am in RM at my body. He apologizes and explains that somehow when I went LD and died, my file on the server became corrupted.  He said that he hoped I didn't lose too much exp or gear from the roll back, I was honest and told him I had maybe lost a blue if that. He then said besides being in RM, do you have any clue where you are?  I looked around and said no, he then took me to LR zoneline and summoned me a stack of ale <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Now my problem was resolved. However, the chat room experience was ridiculous. Guides talking about Bud Light commercial, auto responding Tech Support banner at the top of your screen, etc.  If they would be honest and say, Thad (my warrior), I didn't catch your question could you repeat? That would be fine.  Or if they would answer, &quot;I don't have an answer right now, but I'll try to get one for you&quot; that would be great.  However, to just dismiss paying customers concerns is wrong, regardless if the volunteer for Verant or work for Verant.<br>

As for your experience.... I've never heard anything like that, must've been a nightmare. It's good you got a GM so helpful and willing to work with you, that's pretty impressive, but exact same problems with my encounters in chat room that's for sure. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/bguild75784.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eldryc>Eldryc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cons Dubious </span><br>  Posts: 122<br> <font color=#333333>(4/15/03 12:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=282.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gah</span><hr size=1> &quot;Well, i cannot remburse you for your lost item, You handed an item into<br>

<br>
I thought NPCs were supposed to hand back items that they don't need?  I know they are actually.  So if you got nothing back from the NPC and said item was not something silly like only part of a multiquest, then you got screwed and it is in fact a bug.  To have the GM tell you something like that it total BS and a great example of why people have been saying for years that SOE's customer service totally sucks.  It's a bug, take care of my problem and report the bug, GM, don't give me this utter BS &quot;better luck next time&quot; crap.  But wait, that would be GOOD customer service.  Nevermind.  It won't happen.<br>
