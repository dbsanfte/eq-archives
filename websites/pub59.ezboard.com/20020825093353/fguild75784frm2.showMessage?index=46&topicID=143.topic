<br>
Melissa knows about the list, and is on the short end of the list.<br>
<br>
Cleric goes LD on the hill, and the number 2 cleric is AFK. Rage pop... Notice The Sick Humor of Verant at work  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Melissa gets agro of Rage??  First off how do you &quot;just get&quot; agro??  What would be correctly stated is Melissa took agro for whatever reason.  I mean why rush it??  Was there another guild in zone that was gonna grab him???   Why pull him to BW zone, &quot;Cause folks dont know the way&quot;???  &quot;Cause clerics on the hill would die&quot; *cough*  BS  *cough*.   Even the newest of players can follow the instructions &quot;Put the wall to your right and follow.&quot;  So somehow Rage was agroed and for some reason he was pulled to BW zone to be killed. Whatever reason is not important, just thought I would point out some flaws in what I see posted.<br>
<br>
SO Main cleric is LD,  Rage is standing there.  A cleric on the short end of the list takes him and kills him.<br>
<br>
No verant rule was broken.  But someones Integrity is greatly at stake here.Melissa by posting she hasnt turned in the piece yet is obviously feeling that there might be some wrong doing here.  Straight up rules wise, there is no issue.  But morally , yes.<br>
<br>
BUt I have to admire her for not questing the piece already and entertaining the idea of MQ it with Chami.<br>
<br>
So Melissa I lay it out to you like this.  You keep the piece and you will ALWAYS pretty much know you slighted someone over it and lots of folks will not like you that have never met you. And you will probably never enjoy your epic. I base this on the fact that you havent turned it in yet, so something in your soul is tuggin at you.  It will always have a taint to it.<br>
<br>
BUT, on the other hand if you did MQ this with Chami.  OMG!!!<br>
<br>
You would be one of the most Well Known, Well Respected people in all of Rodcet Nife. I dont know you, but I know I would go out of my way to help you if you ever needed it because of the character you would have shown.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fate has placed you in a peculiar position.  You for some reason decide to visit cleric hill or run past it on the way to somewhere else.  Ragefire has spawned, 3 clerics are camping on the hill, one LD, 2 Afk for whatever reason.<br>
<br>
So you got a tough decision to make. But I can tell ya, MQing it with Chami is a complete win win, cause you are so low on the list.<br>
<br>
I personally wont be mad at you are the guilds involved, cause you didnt KS it.  But I would be disappointed as I know alot of other folks would be.  You were on the list, and folks were honoring your position on the list.  One would hope you would do the same.<br>
<br>
Goodluck on whatever decision you make <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
On to other areas....   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
This list being broken is a unjustified statement.   The camp it self is what sucks.  The lists is the means to an end.<br>
<br>
What, about 30-40 Clerics have gotten thier epics so far on it, with only two times that there were a problem.  Only one KS by the bottomfeeders ( Arirang).  I say thats not bad.<br>
<br>
No matter what you do reroll, draw random or whatever people will whine about it one way or the other.  This thing has been in place for months and has proven to work for ALL guilds.  <br>
<br>
A camp where only 2 clerics have to spend 14 days is way better then the 8-10 that were there in the beginning for 50-70 days with no guarentee of anything.<br>

<br>
Yes I did suggest to camp along side the &quot;list&quot; cleric.  I myself am a cleric and feel the list was idiotic, mainly the way it was conceived and executed.<br>
<br>
Melissa did absolutely nothing wrong, spawn was there other clerics were sitting on thier bums, and she seized the opportunity.  people can whine and moan all they want not everyone agrees with this list and all of you that want to &quot;flame and try and blacklist&quot; everyone that does not conform to your monopolizing way of thinking is ludicrous.  I say Congratz Melissa enjoy your epic. <p>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
A cleric, who is not a supporter of the list, came into skyfire and found rage up. The only people camping the spawn were two afk clerics. This person (melissa?) had time to assemble a raid force, and killed rage, having engaged it first, NOT KSed, which per Verant policy on spawns, makes it their mob.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Xaanru's post suggesting that if someone wasn't on the list, swooped in at the last minute, and aggro'ed the spawn first, then it's just fine as long as they didn't break any Verant rules really bugs me<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Where did I say anything about swooping, grabbing away from someone who is currently camping, or anything about how long the person had been camping.<br>
<br>
What you fail to realize, is that the list, as it exists, guarantees that someone is &quot;camping&quot; (in theory) rage at all times (even if they are not there for up to two hours, according to the list rules) for the next two years. The bottom line is, it doesn't matter if a cleric were to sit there for one whole month, watching spawns get taken by the List members, then claim a spawn as theirs, becuase they were the only one in the zone when rage popped. Supporters of the list would still claim a camp steal. <br>
<br>
The fact is, and this was horrible luck on the part of the #1 cleric, is that there was nobody camping the spawn, when melissa got there. 2 afk clerics, who do not respond for enough time to assemble a raid force, kill the human form and dragon form rage (and still these people do not respond) is not camping. The one &quot;live&quot; camper, had a linkdead. I agree that is awful timing, and it sucks. However, that notwithstanding, Melissa found the spawn uncamped, up, and nobody assembling troops. The two characters parked in the zone as placeholders do not count as camping in my eyes. There was nobody behind the characters.<br>
<br>
My point is, for non-list supporters, situations like this are the only chance they have to get ragefire. It was not KSing, and only in the loosest possible interpretation could it be considered camp stealing. The point I was making is, as a list supporter, she knew it was camped, knew who was camping it, and had agreed to respect the camp, including the current rules for said camp (including the 2 hour rule involving linkdead clerics) and that is what makes it different (and since she was #8 on the list (/boggle), as part of the top 10 clerics, she could have changed the rules if she didn't like them). <br>
<br>
If some other cleric, having no such agreement, went to skyshrine, hailed and talked to the only two (afk) clerics there, and when he or she, over a significant period of time, got no response, assembled troops and took down zordak, then the dragon Rage, how could they possibly be considered KSers. Look at it this way, if there were no list, and I had gone in to camp ragefire, sat there for 5 days, and then my ISP went down, am I still camping? If you come into the zone, and find that I am not there, and ragefire is up, are you KSing if you kill him (particularly considering that I do not log back in for well over half an hour, long enough for you to get troops up, and kill zordak)? I say no. I also will always maintain that a toon with nobody behind it is not camping a mob, its just sitting there. Now, if you still find that pathetic, I pity you, for your twisted sense of ethics.<br>
<br>
BTW, my comment about the effort was in essence to say that sitting in the zone is less significant that completing the other parts of the quest. Someone who has killed ALL of the other quest mobs, has done something significant. The List does not recognize that effort, by locking a large portion of the server (even those who have completed the rest of the quest) out from the rage camp for at least two years. Compared to the achievement of having gotten the rest of the epic quest done, parking your character in skyshrine for a week really isn't that tough.<br>
<br>
Now, if you disagree, feel free to express your own opinions, but stop trying to put words into my mouth, or twist what I said into something it isn't. <br>

<br>
Lol lots of misinformed crap flying around, okay what happened was:<br>
<br>
<br>
Chami, Quaylon and Alilinkie were on the hill.<br>
<br>
Alilinkie as number 3 cleric was afk and in bed, I know this cause I was laying right next to her <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Quaylon told Chami he was going afk for a few minutes<br>
<br>
Chami then went LD for between 5 and 6 minutes<br>
<br>
When she got back on there was no sign of Rage and nothing being said in any of the zone wide channels or Ragefire channel.<br>
<br>
About 30 minutes later someone from EK (I think it was an EK person, forgive me if i have it wrong on this single point, the logs are long and I cant find this bit right now) let slip that RF was down and that Melissa had done it.<br>
<br>
According to Melissa she ran around on the hill for a short while /pokeing Chami, however Inkie was sitting right next to Chami and there is nothing in the text log to support this.<br>
<br>
Also Melissa freely admits that she sent no tells whatsoever to any of the three clerics or to anyone in there guilds to say RF was up.<br>
<br>
Again according to Melissa she then went to RF to check him out, apparently she didnt realise he was KoS, when he attacked her she then ran him to BW zone and called in her forces who took him down in short order.<br>
<br>
That is the facts of what happened. My own opinion is that this while not a classic &quot;KS&quot; incident according to Verants rules is still ethicaly a real bad thing.<br>
<br>
My reasoning for this is despite some of the bad information in some of the above posts is that Melissa was in fact on the cleric list, she was at position number 8 when this went down. By joining the list she agreed to be bound by its rules and conventions, these include sending /tells to the clerics on the hill in a higher position on the list and /tells to the guilds of those clerics. Melissa freely admits that she did neither.<br>
<br>
In fairness to Melissa I have to say that she did come and try to talk things out with Chami, unfortunately she made the mistake of trying to do it in a publiscised channel, as you can all imagine this turned into a complete flame fest !, of which I was just as guilty as everone else in taking part in.<br>
<br>
The strong impression that I and everyone else on the Chami side of the arguement got was that Melissa was feeling a little guilty and was unsure of what to do... that is until the officers of DA and EiE got involved and told her she was right and that the rest of us were wrong.<br>
<br>
Hope this explains what has happened, at least from my perspective.<br>
<br>
Hope you all have some fun<br>

<br>
A long while back my guild was to camp the guy in steamfont. the one that triggers one of the rogue epics mobs.. forgive me, I forget the name (Renux?).  Anyway, I get there and watch the trigger mob run around and follow it a bit while waiting for my guild to arrive.<br>
<br>
Shortly thereafter, while I am following the mob (I had NOT hailed it), another guild came and decided to hail for a turn in. (I was not visibly engaging the MOB).<br>
<br>
Well, I jumped down their throats.  I was also very, very wrong.  I did not hail the mob, nor had we the power there yet to take Renux.  <br>
<br>
Nonetheless, THEY showed class (Blood Meridian) and backed down, and I went ahead and got my spawn when my help arrived.<br>
<br>
Well, this is all fine and good, except I knew, almost immediately after, that no item was worth knowing that I had lost stature in the eyes of peers, and MYSELF.  I could not give back what I had taken, and it sucked.  To this day, some do not like me because of what I did.  What I did I did out of naievity, but that does not change how it looks to others).<br>
<br>
Later (please remember this is a story of a young-un, so hate was a big deal at the time) I won a shadow breastplate in hate.  I then had the opprtunity to make small amends, and I donating my looting rights of the BP to the person I had wronged (whos guild was letting me come on theur raid).  <br>
<br>
Melissa, you sound like a great person, and so does Chami.  If you have ANY doubt in your heart, MQ the item.  It can build NOTHING but goodwill.  You're on the list, and when your turn comes up, do you doubt that ALL of Rodcet will be at your side then?<br>
<br>
Those that are gracious (Blood Meridian - thank you) will always be remembered and trusted and helped.  Good will does come around.  <p><b><i><font face="Garamond"><font color="#993366"><font size=+2>

I spoke with Blader of SoF and to some extent Doraf the other night about what happened.  I promised to get back to them on this once we'd made a final decision.  Since I don't know the SoF message board and figure this pertains to all parties involved on the server I'm posting it here.<br>
<br>
In light of our first &quot;encounter&quot; with the Ragefire list the other night we discussed amongst oursleves and have decided the following....<br>
<br>
<br>
EiE does not acknowledge the existance of any server wide &quot;list&quot; on Ragefire.  In our eyes it is a FFA spawn just like everything else.<br>

And EiE has every right to take this position.  They have no clerics on the list.  Assuming that EiE will KS is not right, they have never made it a practice to behave in such a manner and I don't think they will ever KS as a guild -- they are not KS'ers.  <br>
<br>
Flaming each other will only make the Ragefire Camp situation worse than it already is.  <br>
<br>
Who am I?  #17 on the Ragefire List, been on the list since April and started at #33.  I will not allow the Ragefire Camp situation to ruin the fun I get from playing EQ -- and I will not have it ruin the fun my guild gets from EQ -- and it saddens me to see people behaving so meanly toward one another. <p>Dyaan Truesite<BR>

In our eyes it is a FFA spawn just like everything else.&quot;<br>
<br>
EiE can take their uber attitude and shove it.  I rank them right up there with Arirang now.  They COULD work to change the way the list is done or they could at least have enough honor to camp ragefire along with whoever the list claims is up so that the clerics present have at least both put the time in.  That wouldn't be popular with some people either, but it would be more respectable than the FFA bull crap.  But of course this uber guild wants it to be FFA like the old kunark dragons.  It means that a handful of guilds will get virtually every ragefire spawn that's up.  Even if they reach the point that all of their active clerics have their epics, they can keep killing and we can look forward to ragefire epic pieces being auctioned for hundreds of k plat.  I don't buy for a second that the spawn will sit there because every top tier guild has something better to do.  A few dragons are staying up for a bit now but they don't have as valuable of a prize as completing a cleric epic and barring several manaburn wizards, they aren't all quite as simple to take down as Rage is.<br>
<br>
xaanru, I regard it as a camp steal, plain and simple.  I agree that if the 2nd and 3rd clerics were afk for a long time, they don't count.  I'm talking about the LD person who was camping it.  Someone is gone for (someone said 5-6 minutes), let's say 5-10 minutes.  Everyone knows that camp has people at it all the time.  Obviously only the tiniest of efforts was made to contact the person who was camping it before taking the spawn.   They might have waited a few minutes tops, and then they went for it.  It all went down pretty fast.  From what I hear from a friend who was porting them in, some Shades of Fury people did show up in time to see Ragefire's corpse, so they were trying to assemble.  EiE/DA/Ascent.... they didn't care about someone's camping efforts.  They raced in there and took it because as the quote above says, they regard it as FFA like other dragons. <br>
<br>
Even the old Ragefire had a camp that was respected by almost all other players.  The cleric who camped after Nagafen died and kept the fire giants cleared the whole time owned the camp.  Most of the top guilds did not try to go FFA on it.  They let the person who spent the time camping it and clearing fire giants bring in a force and take a shot at it.  It's probably a bad thing that now we don't have any mobs that need clearing to hold the camp.  People respect it less.  But Ragefire has NEVER been a FFA race, at least not on this server.  A few of the top guilds would love to see it that way though.<br>
<br>

<br>
p.s. no, i'm not saying that all members of top tier guilds are bad.  Some are really nice.  I refer to those who's actions make them fit the negative stereotype many people have about being &quot;uber&quot; quite well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ujeet.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jeet</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_yellowspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#333333>(7/20/02 12:41:42 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://jeeteq.100megsfree3.com/charge.gif height=85 width=160></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: DA EiE take Ragefire 19th July 2002</span><hr size=1> &quot;It means that a handful of guilds will get virtually every ragefire spawn that's up&quot;<br>

<br>
Callon, In THIS PARTICULAR instance, I actually agree with you. However, it is because Melissa knew it was camped, and had agreed to a set of rules that included contingencies for LD campers. <br>
<br>
From the ragefire rules on the cleric board:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
4)Both #1 and #2 cleric agree to share the camp responsibilities, in order that should 1 or the other cleric go LD, or the like, the camp is still covered. This insures placement and prevents KSing the camp if possible. Both clerics are expected to hold the camp at all times. The #2 cleric is expected to rally support as much as possible to help Cleric #1 when Ragefire does indeed spawn.<br>
<br>
6)If Cleric #1 goes LD, and RF spawns, cleric #2 is to immediately inform Cleric #1's guild that RF has spawned and to mobilize thier forces and get to Skyfire ASAP. Cleric #2 is expected to send out the call to thier own forces as well to assemble. Cleric #2 must inform Cleric #1's guild of the LD, and if no one can get Cleric #1's character online within 30 minutes then cleric #2 can claim the &quot;rights&quot; to that particular RF spawn, and Cleric #1 then is pushed back one spot. If both cleric 1 and 2 cannot log on during a RF spawn, for whatever reason, then Cleric #3 has the right to RF, and so on down the list. Should, for any reason, any single cleric miss 2 RF spawns, they are dropped to the end of the list. This does not apply to a cleric who &quot;passes&quot; his turn voluntarily, when he is offered the #1 or #2 position. This only applies to the actual person whose turn it is at RF, and is activley camping it.<br>
<br>
9) It is between the # 1 &amp; #2 clerics to work out how they will stay at the camp, including being AFK. It will be assumed, that even if no AFK flag is on, a lack of response from that person will still be treated as being AFK. There have been, in the past, people who believed they could simply be AFK the entire time, and let the other person &quot;do all the work&quot;. Under no circumstances, should anyone be AFK for more than 2 hours. But, it is up to the other person whether to allow the AFK or not. But remember a simple rule: Do unto others, as you would have them do to you. Tolorance can make an unbearable camp much easier to do.<br>
<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The only problem I have with this particular instance is that the Melissa had agreed to this set of rules, and did not follow them. Clearly these rules require that she wait 30 minutes for the camping cleric to return.<br>
<br>
If, on the other hand, someone of the not-involved-with-the-list variety had come in to Skyfire, without any specific information on who was camping rage, and found only the two afk clerics, it would not have been camp stealing. I know that I personally, would not consider 30 minutes a reasonable time to wait, &quot;just to see if someone happened to LD&quot; unless I knew that they had for certain.<br>
<br>
Also, while I was not there, and cannot verify times, I find it hard to see how anyone could have gathered the forces to take down Zordak, then Ragefire, and then killed both, in 5 or 6 minutes. In addition, that would mean that Melissa happened to begin gathering forces, EXACTLY at the moment that the other cleric went LD. They would have had to be already grouped up, with porters in the group, somehow forseeing that the other cleric would LD, and knowing the rage would pop at the same time. <p>Xaanru <br>

<br>
I've got to say Maxo that any solution that so obviously puts a strain on people's marriages and requires them to spend essentially every second of their yearly vacation time to get an item can't possibly be the best solution.  I'd like for you to really consider how absurd this is: you're risking divorce for an EQ item.  The cleric epic is more important than your marriage.  (And if you've got a family and you're taking vacation time to get it, the cleric epic is more important than the time you have with your family.)<br>
<br>
And your example of what life was like prior to this &quot;solution&quot; overlooks something.<br>
<br>
With that, no one needs to camp the thing for 12 days, and in fact will only be hurting themselves doing so.<br>
<br>
Check the spawn every now and then, if it's up, go to it.  If it's not up, come back later.<br>

Liken it to &quot;the first couple on the dance floor&quot; once more and more guilds see that this is the way to actually get RF, guess what they're going to start doing?  EiE/DA killed ragefire.  It happened.  Much more of this will happen in the upcoming future, as more and more &quot;couples&quot; get brave enough to step onto the dance floor.  Regardless of how this is supposed to make me feel, I live in the real world and I play in the high end game.  The big dogs play like big dogs and they don't hold back to honor some list that serves more to prevent them from getting a mob, than to allow it.  Is EiE/DA evil? nope.  You have to see the other side...you who believe in the list, do so with a certain amount of passion....but imagine the other people who believe AGAINST the list with equal or more passion.  I mean really, 1 mob, one time a week, for over two thousand people?  What do you expect to happen? (i say 2000 people, because ragefire is put in this game that anyone on server can help kill, not just clerics)<br>
So, ideas.  Sure I have an idea, here it is<br>
Make the human version indifferent to everyone(beta neutral), make him permanently rooted and hit like the Scions.  Make the previous steps in the cleric required to be sequentially done, and required for a certain thingy to turn in to ragefire, and have the dragon spawn a little ways off.  Make the minimum level to be able to trigger the spawn at lvl 57, so the clerics going in there have familiarity with casting the spell reviviscence, so they can grow to appreciate the right click effect more sweetly, and be more grateful for having the darn thing, and so some lvl 52 cleric doesn't get a right click lvl 56 spell when they're not able to even begin to use the real spell.  Then make the human version despawn for a few hours or days whatever.<br>
That's my idea, but how in the hell do we get verant to listen to ideas?  By making them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
**edit**<br>
oh yea, before i forget, note i said EiE/DA KILLED ragefire, because that's what they did, they did not KS, or camp steal or anything...the ones on the hill dropped the ball, someone else would have picked it up, had EiE/DA not been there.  Arirang, on the other hand, they did kill steal and camp jump, the whole nine yards. <p><p align="center">[58 Knight] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=105849" target="_blank">Zorach</a>

&quot;And so what? I can't force you not to kill someone in real life... I can't force you not to do anything....

<br>
That is true and applicable to the RF list only if everyone agrees that the existence of the list in its current form is somehow morally correct.  Since that is not the case (except by those whom the list favors), your argument is invalid.<br>
<br>
If you all feel the need to &quot;blacklist&quot; Melissa/DA/EiE, well, it's your prerogative.  I hope it makes you feel better, because that's about the only effect it could have on anyone involved.  &quot;Uberguilds&quot; tend to be self-sufficient anyways (one of the reasons for being in ANY guild, right?).<br>
<br>
As for Melissa's being on the RF list:  two wrongs don't make a right, but it isn't any less objectionable than trying to bind an entire server to the rules of a few.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And Re: the RF list, I believe I said it once before on Flamevault:  good intentions do not justify a bad idea.  If you want the list to work, fix it.  Lots of people have thrown out ideas (including myself, on FV at least).  But the truth of the matter is, RF is FFA, and uberguilds will almost always win out over non-uberguilds.  That's the advantage of being an uberguild.  To quote Frank Zappa, &quot;...and the meek shall inherit nothing.&quot;<br>
