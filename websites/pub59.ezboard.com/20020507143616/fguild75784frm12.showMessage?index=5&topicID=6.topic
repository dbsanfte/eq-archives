I am really not in favor of posting the list publicly, as I feel it will cause a snowball effect, and then the list will be like 200 ppl long and more ppl will get discouraged with this alrdy fek'ed up camp <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Tho I am talking with the #1 cleric about this now.  <br>
<br>
I have suggested that if we are going to make it public this is the forum that we should use.  With any luck, we will resolve this situation soon and come to a healthy decision on this.<br>
<br>
Lastly, plz let me add that even tho this camp is horrid, if everyone follows the list and rules, (it has been running so smooth) it will continue to flow by.  Verant has delt us a bad hand, and rather than kill each other over it, or be less than honorable about the whole mess, I really think that the list/rules are the best way to handle it.<br>

/em dons flame retardent cloak<br>
<br>
The way this has been enforced lately (im referencing Lodizal camp here for a comparison) is that first aggro means beans. First group with sufficient firepower to kill the mob is the one who is going to get to kill the mob. First aggro means jack to the GM's.<br>
<br>
Guild A had a druid aggro Lodizal, while his guild assembled ASAP for Lodi.   Guild B appears, and while assembling, one of thier member takes aggro from Guild A.  This went on for a couple of minutes with guild A and B taking the aggro from each other. (mind you, Guild A clearly had first aggro, no simultaneous casts or anything) Unfortunately for the druid of guild A, he was in wolfform, and on the third ping pong of taking his aggro back, with his guild in place and ready, crossed in front of the pack of gnolls, and was killed. (he wouldnt have died if he hadnt had to regain aggro 3 or more times from guild B) Guild B kills Lodi, and gets all the loot.<br>
<br>
Here's the kicker.<br>
<br>
GM shows up when Guild A petitions that they were Kssed. Gm looks at the situation and acknoledges that Guild A had first aggro. But in her estimation, guild B had sufficient power to kill Lodi in the zone first, (this is probably true by a minute or 2 because guild B was higher level and could be successful with fewer people than guild A) first aggro meant nothing, they were allowed to steal the aggro and full rights to the loot.<br>
<br>
This policy is starting to be applied to many mobs, and across servers, and Ragefire is certainly no exception. I have seen GM's estimate (on other servers) that Rage is do'able by ONE group of 60's, so where you may want to assemble 3 or 4 groups to be safe, one group of 60's can sweep in, steal aggro, kill rage and loot it, and it is perfectly acceptable behaivor. (By the GM standards)<br>
<br>
Mind you, I'm not condoning that kind of behaivor, I'm merely stating that it is possible, and you cannot rely on your list, and especially first aggro to save you in this situation. Be warned.<br>

<br>
Is a gd shame that ppl feel that they can come in and take over a kill, no matter if it was engaged first or group amassed first.  In the real world I only deal with ppl of honor, and once you have proven to me that you have no honor, I no longer deal with you.  In the game world I deal with ppl in the same manner.<br>
<br>
I am but one person, but I have been in EQ since beta, and I do know alot of ppl.  Generally these ppl respect what I say, and inturn will shun any player or group that I have shunned due to them not playing fair and or having honor.  <br>
<br>
I will be damned if I know cleric A has been camping ragefire and then he pops, word gets out, and the poor cleric gets KS'ed.  I will do everything in my power to make sure that does not happen.  How sad that we as ppl behind the pixels, feel an item is of more importance than honor.  How sad!!!<br>
<br>
I have had my epic for awhile now, but I am still in RF channel, still on the mailing lists, and still very much involved...due to the fact that I do NOT want to see all of our HARD work going down the drain. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
I mean get real, as a cleric are you going to ask your guild to amass in SF and sit there for 24/7 untill RF pops...for a posible 9 days and a possible KS?  Or are you more willing to ask your guild to back you up when the time comes, as you are on a list and know when your time is due to be up?  <br>
<br>
Dunno it just makes me sad to know that there are guilds out there that could care less about doing the right thing, when most of them in real life would never hurt another person over a material item.  Maybe I am a do-gooder, or an ass, or just too gd niave, but I beleive in the goodness of ppl and can only hope that ppl ingame are as honorable as they are out of it!!!<br>
<br>
Lastly let me state here, for the record, that if anyone tries to KS a RF that one of our good clerics are camping, putting in the time they need to, sitting on their ass and awake for hours on end, and painstakingly paying their dues....well lets just suffice it to say, you have made more than a few enimies in this game.  Not that it matters but you will have made one person so unhappy that if they ever saw you in r/l they would most deff punch you in the nose!  Nuff said <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Sorry all but I am getting wind of things I do not want to hear, and all the boards I have been on that talk of not giving a chit about the time a person puts into this game.  I am just so dis- heartened over all this that I needed to vent.  Forgive me for being human.<br>

The only thing I would add is that it should be a rule that you are ragefire ready to sign up. Cause I can bet half of the people on that list signed up are still waiting on a singed scroll, and imo thats not fair to the people that have been waiting on just ragefire for a long time. And it would cut down the list a little bit cause now you don't need the pearl to spawn him, so in theory you could sign up for the list... get your heart and then start your epic. Or sign up for the list when your level 35 cause you know by the time it's your turn you will be 50.<br>

<br>
To preface, when I sent her my first e-mail it was before I had received the rules of the list so I did not know if I felt that they were fair. I have since read the rules and agree that it is a very good solution to an aggregous problem that we are powerless to change.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
I beam with pride in knowing that Rodcet Nife's players have devised this excellent way of organizing a rotation for the Ragefire NPC, so that camp disputes and killstealing/ninjalooting can be avoided entirely by having the entire server agree to this process of assigning a chance at killing Ragefire. To my knowledge, I am the only server GM who has not had to settle a single incident regarding Ragefire. For this reason, I am extremely proud and grateful that I have such wonderful players who have, in the spirit of teamwork and creative thinking, come up with their own system to manage themselves, without needing my assistance to do it for them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
She does go on to warn that although she cannot enforce the list, she thinks that it would be a very bad idea to attempt to steal the camp. &quot;The reprecussions for killstealing and ninjalooting are severe, and the punishments handed out by fellow players is worse than any kind of disciplinary action I could ever execute.&quot; <p>Zarconeth<br>

I have and so has everyone else that is on this list worked very hard for what we have and where we are and it would be a shame to see these wonderful clerics hurt... They like everyone else wants their epic and we as past rage clerics will do what we can to see that they hold the prized possession we do....You KS it keeps them from getting their Water Sprinkler of Nem Ankh which means YOU DONT GET NO REZ !!!!!!!!!! <br>

campers, is the person camping.  In order to be<br>
added to the list, you must contact the person<br>
camping, not any of the other clerics.  Before<br>
being added to the list, the person that wants to<br>
be added, must agree to a few things.<br>
 <br>
2) They should be online or available as much<br>
as possible for the person before them on the<br>
list.  Both of these clerics should be in<br>
Skyfire, and &quot;holding the camp&quot;.  Holding the<br>
camp serves two purposes, 1- keeping other<br>
people from KS'ing or trying to; and  2-keeping<br>
someone online in skyfire in case Ragefire<br>
spawns.<br>
 <br>
3) In order to be added to the list, they <br>
must agree to maintain the list when it is their<br>
turn at Ragefire.<br>
 <br>
4) They agree to do everything in their power<br>
to help the person before them in line kill<br>
Ragefire.  That means that a bigger guild may<br>
actually help a smaller guild with their epic.<br>
 <br>
5) They agree to do everything in their power<br>
to help the person after them in line kill<br>
Ragefire.  That means going back to Skyfire IF<br>
POSSIBLE, with as many people that want to help. <br>
IF  POSSIBLE means this, unless you are at<br>
a big raid, or a guild meeting, you should <br>
try to come.  This should not happen all that<br>
often, considering there are already 2 people,<br>
and 2 guilds willing to help one another out.<br>
 <br>
6) If cleric #1 is camping and goes linkdead,<br>
afk, or cannot find a sub to play his/her<br>
character, and Ragefire spawns,  cleric #2 who is <br>
next in line should inform cleric # 1's guild<br>
that Ragefire has spawned, and get them to<br>
mobilize. Cleric # 2 should also mobilize  their<br>
own forces to help, and if cleric # 1 does not<br>
get back online  quickly (let's say 30 minutes)<br>
and there is nobody that can log him on, person<br>
next in line has &quot;rights&quot; to that Ragefire spawn.<br>
Original person camping has all rights to<br>
the next spawn of Ragefire, the only thing <br>
that would change, is person next in line.  Hence<br>
cleric # 1 would get bumped back a spot and<br>
cleric # 2 would get the current rage pop.  This<br>
is done so that someone in zone doesn't KS Rage,<br>
or so that he doesn't despawn. (note): if #1 and<br>
#2 are not there, they both get bumped back a<br>
spot and # 3 takes the spawn and so on.<br>
 <br>
7) Two people from the same guild cannot camp<br>
Ragefire back to back. This could be seen as<br>
spawn monopolizing, and we want to keep it fair. <br>
Also If you are unavailable for 2 Rage spawns<br>
back to back, you get booted to the end of the<br>
line. (this applies to only the #1,#2, and<br>
Possibly the #3 clerics, I would think).<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Each and everyone of the first 10 clerics on<br>
the list must /autojoin ragefire...If you do not<br>
do this and you miss something, you will only<br>
have yourself to blame.  10-20 on list should be<br>
in ragefire channel but it is not mandatory that<br>
they do this.  This channel is for the clerics to<br>
discuss possible KS'ers and possible changes, and<br>
so on.  <br>
 <br>
9) Lastly, When cleric #1 is camping and cleric<br>
#2 needs to go afk, it is up to #2 to imform #1<br>
that they are gonna be afk for extended periods<br>
of time, they have a guild meeting, they need to<br>
log for an hour or so, ect.  It is soley up to #1<br>
to agree or disagree with the time that #2 needs<br>
away...This also goes for #1 needing to leave and<br>
#2 will have to say if it is cool or not. Just<br>
remember to be nice and try to be understanding<br>
with each other, it is far better to help each<br>
other than to stab the other in the back.  <br>
 <br>
*when I was camping rage as #2 thecklos would let<br>
me log if I needed to, as well as if he needed<br>
to, he knew that I would watch spawn for him and<br>
tell his guild if rage popped. Adarys and Cynara<br>
also have done the same for each other.  IMHO it<br>
is the only way to be honorable, this set of<br>
rules has worked well so far and will continue to<br>
do so IF you all take an active part and help<br>
each other =).<br>
