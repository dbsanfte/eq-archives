I've asked a few Guides what their take on the &quot;Ragefire list&quot; was and they all gave me the same answer... &quot;Whoever gets aggro first, gets first shot to kill it.  That list is of no importance to us&quot;.  So my question is this... why bother?<br>
<br>
There's enough rules to get on it, but yet there's STILL over 100 people on the thing.  Just because a list exists, does NOT mean it is the end-all, be-all.  I could take a few wizzies, a warrior and a cleric next week, go manaburn his sorry butt after getting aggro and nobody could say otherwise.  Why?  Because that's how it was written, the &quot;waiting list&quot; to me... is stupid.  Especially since whoever is at the bottom of this &quot;list&quot; and follows it now won't even SEE their epic for a good, oh, 18 months!  I've only been PLAYING 18 months.<br>
<br>
This list... is ridiculous.  When Rage was in Naggy's Lair, you basically saw, 3 people... the cleric camping, the next in line and a 'friend of theirs' and that was all the &quot;list&quot; had to it.  Why do people add such stupid politics to a GAME?!  Everytime I look at this so-called &quot;Ragefire List&quot; I crack myself up by all the people actually thinking this is &quot;gospel&quot; and willing to wait 18 months (that's estimating 1 Ragefire per 5 days or so) for a mob that's a free for all, like every other one.  You notice how no other epic has this kind of list, at all?<br>
<br>
Call me weird, but the cleric epic is NOT a required item, NO epic is a required item.  Not everyone has the time to invest nor thinks the returns are that great for the time invested (like most quests).  However, this is not a rant about epic 'quality', it's just this stupid list that everybody seems to think is &quot;gospel&quot; and anyone that goes against it seems to get flamed pretty good, but ready <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
In short, Ragefire list is pointless, only makes the bottleneck that was in Naggy's Lair... worse.  The whole 3 clerics there waiting I didn't mind so much... however this list of 103 is ridiculous!  And oddly enough, my cleric is level 8 (oooh), but I haven't touched him in a LONG time (at least 2 months now) due to clerics, in my opinion, being a fairly boring class as it's mostly &quot;heal, sit and med, heal, sit and med&quot; *snore* but that's just my 2cp <p>[58 Troubadour] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=33907">Singhawk Stormbringer</a> (Half Elf)

Also they had to wait for a 45-52 raid on nagafen in order to even still be in the zone to fight Ragefire, without getting the 53+ members TL'd out to lavastorm.  As suddenly and unspokenly as the current list had developed, I agree wasn't very fair, but on the flipside those who've gotten their epics now because they landed on the top of this new list would say otherwise.  What I think personally should happen will piss alot of people off, but in some odd way has some logic to it...I think Rodcet Nife players should make the ragefire camp the ugliest thing ever seen in the game everquest, kill steal, aggro steal, train the groups there with guardian wurms, make it as ugly as can physically be, screw whether or not you get warned.  Why? have you ever petitioned? HAHA petitioning will never get this solved, its like writing a letter to your congressman.  So unless you want your petitions or suggestions to go to a &quot;Verant paper shredder&quot; then Rodcet Nife will have to MAKE them notice that ragefire is @#%$ up.  <br>
Verant says, &quot;this is done to control the influx of epic weapons to the server&quot; which of course is bull in my opinion, its how they keep the players playing and spending that 15 bucks a month.  If they wanted to control the amount of epics coming into the server, why not bottleneck some other step to the cleric epic?  Why not make Ixblat this @#%$ hard to spawn?  Or Plasmatic Priest?  Remember what made verant change the spawn to skyfire mountains? what it petitions or emails? no, it was blatant kill stealing and rampant &quot;i don't give a @#%$&quot; behavior that people got sick of.<br>
This is just my take on it, and I'm probably in the wrong frame of mind right now, but imagine cleric number 103 who for all means could be down to RF as their very last step in their epic, god that would suck.  But hey, I'm a paladin and I'll never have to worry about it, I'm just part of team melee who is called in to distract this mob while the pain is dealt out. <p><p align="center">[57 Knight] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=105849" target="_blank">Zorach</a>

<br>
The biggest change I can think of as it stands now is, instead of having every cleric on the face of the planet with it, is make a &quot;designated guild cleric&quot; with it, maybe 2 or 3 tops as backups in-case that one is out sick, out of town, etc.  Granted, the cleric epic is nice, but um...<br>
<br>
1) It's a 56 spell, there's enough mana regen opportunities, the &quot;but it's a 96% mana free rez&quot; is not an excuse, you'll just have to *gasp* wait a little longer instead of chain rezzing everybody<br>
2) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NO</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> epic (including the cleric) is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> required</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to reach certain content.  To be honest, I've seen more people successfully do &quot;whatever&quot; without epics than with them.<br>
<br>
That's my few cents, but I say, whoever is ready to go for Ragefire for the cleric epic, Go for it!  For all I say... IGNORE THE LIST!  You have JUST as much a right to sit there as that list says...

TIME.<br>
<br>
the Cleric epic is probably thee most powerful item in the game. without that little cliky rez it would take a guild of 40 or so members on a wipe and 1 cleric making camp, about an hour, if not an hour and a half to get back up to raid strength, rezzing a tank or two, rezzing another cleric, then a chanter, bard...whatnot, it would take a good amount of time to rez everyone and to get them back to raid status.<br>
<br>
with a cleric  epic, it takes that same raid abuot 15-20 min to get running again. click on every corpse and just keep clicking till everyone is standing, no cast it 5 times, and med for 5 min to get mana for another rez. much less buff mana (granted MGB Aego does cut down this as well).<br>
<br>
also, end game encounters are heavily into resists. anyone Epic is probably THE BEST resist item for that slot, much less the stats and other stuff. anyone that says there is beter, is technically correct, but how many of us are really going to be able to get into sleepers tomb, kill the big guy in sseru, or kill the big named dragons in nToV anytime soon?<br>
<br>
if the list were put out server wide and everyone had an equal chance to get a position on the list. then i would support it. but as it was introduced to a few and then a few more, it was not fair to the rest of the server. i do not support breaking verant's rules. but this list is a contrived devices to try and help control it. but right now, even without server down times, number 103 is going to be waiting for over 2 years.  with server outages and patches and such...i'd expect 2.5...<br>

Imagine if the cleric epic difficulty was on a scale of say the Bard or Magician epic. There wouldn't be so much competition for one stinking spawn.<br>

First off Verant does NOT enforce this list.  Secondly the list is not supported by most people.  Thirdly it has been proven that the spawn can be taken with out disciplinary actions on Verants part.  What happened before is bound to happen again since there are a lot of frustrated clerics and guilds out there.  I really don't think the list is going to hold up till 103.  <br>
<br>
Remember it is not anyones RIGHT to get an epic it is a symbol of hard work and dedication.  The list implies the people at the top of the list have more RIGHT to an epic than the people at the bottom and I think that is in no way true.  Personally I think that if they want the list to last they need to put level 60s at the front of the list then 59s then 58s and throw out anyone lower till they get their levels.  The epic is a symbol of prestige especially with the clerics and I really don't think a level 53 cleric has earned that kind of honor. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=97672">

Let us analyze for a moment the differences between the dragon portions of the cleric epic quest versus other epic quests. Ragefire drops a single item required for cleric epic...whereas Talendor can drop up to 4 books for the paladin epic not to mention red scale for warrior/bard epic(i think), and the time we killed Severilous by accident, he DID drop 3 books for paladin epic, other times he drops green scale for bard epic, Gorenaire drops a white scale, the other book for paladin epic(again, can drop up to 4), Faydedar can drop a scale for bard epic, we're looking at all these different mobs that can drop items needed for multi class epic quest requirements...why is Ragefire the only mob to drop the impure heart?  why does he only drop one and never more than that?  why is his spawn time so limited and unchartable, so as to necessitate having someone sit there for a week straight?  are any other mobs in the game in relation to epic quests, are they contested in any manner, way, shape or form?  We all have brains and can arrive at our own answers to these question and come out pretty unanimous about it.  And it can be worded in a manner similar to this...<br>
Verant wants every player in the game to die trying to kill their mobs.  Verant makes mobs in this game so powerful that if nobody is attacking it, it will regenerate whatever amount of health is has in seconds.  Verant wants to have large amounts of people to die every time they attempt the high end mobs, and they don't want the people to get back to business fast enough to finish a mob they just wiped on.  Hell, according to the limitations built into the game, you shouldn't ever have the honor to see a cleric with five thousand mana, as that would make the cleric too powerful (/bitchslap verant) <br>
Verant sure as hell doesn't want us to easily overcome obstacles they put in our way.  Getting a raid together with a bunch of clerics with epics would mean almost no downtime.  Imagine a full raid with 15 clerics with epics, hell as soon as a tank falls, another takes his place and like a minute later, dead tank is a rezzed tank and pretty much ready to re-enter the fight, thus helping to enable a raid to finish the job they started.  Verant knows this and they don't want it to be that easy for us to pull off, and so they &quot;limit the influx of cleric epics&quot; into the server, and tada, you got yourself a controversy.  So, while I may have been terse earlier, I'm certainly not being so now, and it is clear to me, the problem is one Verant is not readily willing to change, as the current arrangements fit their liking too much, it will take serverwide action to jar them from their stubbornness.  And also since speaking to verant, whether by email, petition, report has been and most often will be answered with responses defending their side and why things should remain the same, how can the &quot;list&quot; we have adopted on RN exist in even as few as 100 days, let alone 100 individual spawn cycles?  Verant is tacitly telling us &quot;we're not going to help unless the server turns to crap&quot;  so putting 2 and 2 together and arriving at 4, i say the only real path to a solution is what i said in my post above, the entire RN community make ragefire the most disgusting sight in video entertainment.  Talking has proven not to get anywhere, so what else is there to do?  KS'ing and camp stealing has proven to have gotten results, you see RF in skyfire now don't ya?  How did he get there?<br>
Yes this is going to frustrate everyone who has given up hope and got on the list, praying to get RF sometime in this year and a half, rather than never, but the initial frustration might just yield to satisfactory results, too many people are pissed about this.<br>
Jesus Christ, did i just write a damn thesis on this or what?<br>

The epic quest can be completed by any 51+ cleric. A 51 cleric has as much right to his/her epic as a 60 cleric. Sure, a 60 cleric may/will put the epic to better use, but that cleric does not automatically have more RIGHT to hold RF camp than any other 51+ cleric.<br>

<br>
The problem with this is that some poor cleric just spent the better part of a week camping in Skyfire and then someone shows up on the last day and takes it.  Whether you like the list or not, you'd still be royally screwing over the person who had been camping it.  She can go for it if she doesn't mind a good portion of the server hating her, I guess.  At that point it's like any other long camp (only worse obviously).  Most people will respect the person who has put the time in and revile the latecomer who swooped in to take the spawn.  <br>
<br>
I agree 100+ names is absolutely ridiculous, but I think the fault is with Verant for such a stupid quest setup.  The list, which swelled out of control, was an attempt to make the best out of a bad situation.<br>
