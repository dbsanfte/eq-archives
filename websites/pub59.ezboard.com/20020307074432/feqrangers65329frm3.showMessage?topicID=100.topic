There is quite a bit of places to go. me personnally i have explored the QHills area till lvl 12, do not hunt wolves and bears as there is a named ranger that will hunt you down hehe. then went to Blackburrow, now that place is just about camped all the time and you will experience trains, stay there till at least lvl 15 and head on over to GFay and do the trueshot quest, i just hope you have been practicing your fletching by this point, i stayed here doing CB on downtime while waiting for the clockworks to spawn till i hit 18,had my trueshot and started on over too Oasis till i hit 20. tried the lake of ill omen but being so low could not solo to well here left at 21. now 2 choices you have you can go to EK yes EK it is never camped and experience is decent and with track we have an advantage. Or go to HHP, but here you might need grouping, i have never hunted here myself but have heard about it. now you can stay in EK till about 24 cause you will probably get bored. Now 2nd chioce is going over to SK or everfrost, both good zones and the mammoths if you con right drop some good tusks to make even more money on.  Now, when i hit 28 i went to Iceclad but had to get into a group there till i hit 30. tried crystal caverns but cannot solo there either. i am back at the lake of ill and can now solo what i couldnt solo 2 lvls earlier. <br>as for armour i wear a mix of ivy etched and rygor, for ivy i recommend tunic, helm, and one bracer, for rygor bracer, legs, arms, gloves. also i wear a bloodstain mantle, cougarskin mask, black steel wrap belt, forest loop, cougar claw earring and a orc fang necklace. wis ring and a resist ring. still looking for a good pair of boots though hehe. weapons is a trueshot, SSOY and SSOM(short sword of morin) this is a quest that is done and sword is nodrop. i will be getting a GBJS i believe is what it is called from a friend. now i did not start out as a twink i pretty much built him up from scratch and some guilds if you are lucky will give you stuff too. <br>be safe and happy hunting.<br>Tatsou Wolfrunner<br>Ranger on the Tribunal  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#006400><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/utejaye.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tejaye</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#ADFF2f>(10/6/01 7:48:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/feqrangers65329frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=100.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ranger vs SK</span><hr size=1> Thank you all for the advice.

Im at 45 now, pretty much soloed since 28 or so. And have my plans in place for where I will solo till around 50(GD most likely). Being a druid first is a good advantage. You are used to the spells Rangers get. As for a few pointers.. once you get panic animal... you know the rest there. Also, I see sooo many people not using the flame line of dot's. I still use my flame lick at 45. Its an ac reducer, gotta love hitting more often. And most peeps that havent watched or played a druid dont understand stacking dot's. At 44 I finally soloed my first hg/... never really tried before that.. was really only skilling up at archery <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Can you say triple dot?(I know they are low level.. but thats the tools you have) snare/root/flamelick/stinging swarm/arrows.. reapeat till hes around 40% hp if your froggy and your ac/agi are ok. This works for me. Animals of note from my exp.. and i havent been everywhere yet. The Karanas for Griffs.. all different levels.. then kitties/rhino's in loio/ot.. Just a few ideas from me, and I'm not a ranger god.. yet. always something to learn. Anyways, my soloing these days really stems from the deaths that i get saving my groups in certain situations(ie.  pulling the gob tower under water in Lake Rathe for the first time).. Recovering lost exp from that, has alot of pride involved.(most common joke i use these days when talking about where im at in a level is .. how many deaths im above the level *grin*) And last note.. so far the best peeling tactic I have used is a snare/flamelick.. Works too well lol. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>Thanks for reading this far.

I grouped thru most of my lower levels but now at 52 I have enough archery power (Velium bow, fleeting quiver, tolans bracer, SC wraps) and spells to solo comfortably with little down time.  Side note, if you have the money, get a horse to fight/med at the same time.
