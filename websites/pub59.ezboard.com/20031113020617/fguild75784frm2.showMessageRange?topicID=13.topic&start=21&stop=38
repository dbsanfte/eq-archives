But the fact is it doesn't belong to you. We lease the game...we don't own the server nor the items they made...we merely lease the right to use the code that makes the base of the items, the graphics, everything. If this was a tangible item, made of wood like furniture...I would understand...but this item is made of lines of code...all lines of code which they still own. And you didn't buy the item in truth....you merely found a bundle of binary code or used another bundle to acquire another bundle. (excuse me if I do not use the most technical or exact terms but I hope my point is getting across) The item is not real...and thus why pay real money for an item that is not? If they just up and decided to delete every server...what then? You wouldn't be compensated...because you don't own any item..you spent time collecting them yes....but only because you paid Verant to do so. What it all boils down to is....it's entertainment...and no offense...but if a person goes into a movie and doesn't expect a bit of risk for it to be bad....(shakes head). Hell....for example I thought Dungeons &amp; Dragons (the movie) was a waste of my time and money...but at the same time I knew I risked seeing a bad movie when I CHOSE to go see it.<br>

Neither of it is &quot;physical&quot; in the literary sense, but they are both very real.  They both have value.  That value belongs to someone.  I think it is their right to do with that value as they please.  And if you went to see Dungeons and Dragons, and you didn't like it, you'd be like me.  Neither of us asked for our money back, but that doesn't mean that some other person didn't.  They may not have gotten anything back, but it was their right to ask, and not have some greater power, such as the government, enforce a overall ban on asking for that refund.  It's not whether anyone else decides that they want to buy your stuff for what you want, it's just that you get a chance to sell without some greater power, such as Verant, enforcing a overall ban on selling.<br>

I think Dracorum is an opinionated person. =)<br>
<br>
I have a better example for you then the government example, because face it, if we use the government as an example everyone will be able to come up with some obscure instance... Lets take a house... I buy a house. Of course, I cannot afford the 150,000 dollars so I get the bank to get me a loan. (This should work with Drac's skewed we are &quot;leasing&quot; our EQ time example...) During my time of &quot;owning&quot; the house, I make changes to it. I invest time into improving it or... trashing it with drunken parties. heh. Now when I want to move to another house... I still do not &quot;own&quot; my house. Yet, if I can find some sucker to buy it, then I can make a profit or take a loss. It is totally up to me what I charge for the house. If I charge 500,000 dollars and someone *does* buy it, then good for me. I can then pay off my loan and obtain another loan for another house.<br>
<br>
Does the bank restrict me on how much I can sell for? No. All that restricts me is what someone will pay for it. If I put a lot of time into improvements ( Like made my garage into a level 50 garage hehe) Then I can probably sell for more then I paid. If I wasted my time being a drunk (most likely) then I will be lucky to break even.<br>
<br>
I agree Verant &quot;owns&quot; the bytes of data... but they do not &quot;own&quot; the time anyone puts into their characters. If you truly believe they do &quot;own&quot; that time, and can look me in the eye and tell me you would not be mad if they deleted you for no reason tomorrow (and all of your uber gear) then I will pay more attention to your one-sided banter...<br>

On the contrary I think companies like BSI if allowed to continue will have the monopoly.  Not only that, but could potentially ruin gameplay.  Heres why:<br>
<br>
They say that in order to get certain items you need to be a full-time gamer. However, if they are allowed to &quot;aquire&quot; these items for us and resell them, do you think normal gamers will be able to get them? No, of course not.  Think about it.  That item will be camped/monopolized by companies like BSI who send people to get those items in the same time we could be using to get them ourselves.  Those companies  &quot;steal&quot; the time we payed to play the game/camp the item only to sell them back to us b/c we couldn't get that item b/c they were camping it....who has the monopoly now?  Basically the only way to get certain items would be to buy it from them, or get extremely lucky, and catch that camp at a time when they weren't holding it (good luck).<br>
<br>
If this ever happened in Everquest, I would start looking for other ways to spend my time.  If i pay to play a game, I would like to be able to aquire an item myself instead of having to pay even more to get it.  Sure, its nice to have the option to buy it online, but to legaliz it, and turn it into a profitable buisness will end up stealing from the people who play in the end.<br>

<br>
You make a good, valid point.<br>
<br>
The only thing I see wrong with your logic, is that how the game *already* is. I agree it would be worse if &quot;farming&quot; for Ebay was &quot;legalized&quot;...<br>
<br>
However, I come home from work, spend some time with my family, log on around 9 or 10 then log off 11 or midnight. The odds of me being able to find anything uncamped at that time are very very very slim...<br>
<br>
So, IMHO, it will not affect me at all who is camping the item, because 99 times out of 100 it is camped already.<br>
<br>
Make sense?<br>

I think you have a very valid point.  I think that the way things are now with people selling items on ebay is more or less bearable. There are many items I would love to have and cannot obtain, but i still can't justify me going to ebay to buy something.  As you said, its a pain because things are already farmed enough as it is.  That alone has cost me getting many of the items i wanted (Cloak of Truth to name one). It will only get worse if this is legallized.  I'm in the same situation as you are in tems of play time.   I just think that if we have companies dedicated to farming these items, that it will eventually get out of hand.  Whereas it is not making a major impact (that I can see) now, I can definetly see it blowing up.  <br>
<br>
I totally understand the appeal to many players.  But to those who wish not to pay more money, and are willing to spend the time, its kind of unfair.  The point of alot of these items is that they are also status symbols.   Having them shows what you went through to get them or buy them with game currency.  To make it so everyone potentially has access, would cheapen the gameplay.  Thats just my opinion.<br>
<br>
In another thought, I would think that being in that line of buisness would be very unstable.  What if verant all of a sudden made an item no-drop at whim (they tend to do this kind of thing).  Man, that would suck if you were workin for a farming CO that had alot of income from that item.  Then, as they say.. easy come easy go.<br>
<br>
For me, the bottom line is this - <br>
Whatever happens, as long as they can balance it so that if I choose to camp an item I won't have to compete with a professional farmer, I would have no problem.  Until then, I remain skeptical of the overall advantage to having this system in place.<br>

VI would have all the control they wanted, as they have access to account info they could perform thorough security checks to ensure fraud wasn't being committed (say if someone hacked the password), and they would make a reasonable commission on the &quot;sale&quot;.<br>
<br>
I think this might solve the Ebay/Black market selling of accounts and items, and help reduce the fraud....<br>

I believe this may be essentially the same argument in terms. Wehn we break it down...this is completely Verant's intellectual property....they thought up the game....designed it....and built it...thus they have every right to dictate what they do with it. No arguments. It is first there private property and thus people have absolutely no right to profit from their program but themselves. Even if it may seem you are selling your &quot;time&quot;....tough. I see the argument as closed. Verant has the basic right of their property...customers can suck it up and deal. If you don't like it, don't play. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/bguild75784.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=averx>Averx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00bie</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#333333>(2/24/02 7:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: PS- Formatting?</span><hr size=1> Drac -<br>

How many people post on here using your account?<br>
<br>
You just said three different opinions in three different posts...<br>
<br>
I *still* disagree - no matter what you read. (but if you read it on the internet.. it MUST be true!!) Blizzard of all companies should not be able to talk. Were they not the ones who had the online game with the massive abuse of cheat codes? (ala Diablow?)<br>
<br>
So Drac, now tell me, would you care if they deleted you tomorrow? Your char is *their* property after all. I think you would be mad as hell. Heck, people scream when verant does stuff like that on the *TEST* server...<br>
<br>
IMHO - a person who farms Centi Longswords to sell in EC for 1k a pop is the exact same as a person who farms them to sell on Ebay. <br>
<br>
I thought this &quot;agree to disagree&quot; thing was a sound idea.. but apparently someone else using the &quot;Dracorum Draconaeus&quot; account thought that one up... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/uavattarheavensblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Avattar Heavensblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Melancholy Faith</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#333333>(2/25/02 5:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: PS- Formatting?</span><hr size=1> Yeah, I'd have to agree with you on that all the way on that Averx.<br>
