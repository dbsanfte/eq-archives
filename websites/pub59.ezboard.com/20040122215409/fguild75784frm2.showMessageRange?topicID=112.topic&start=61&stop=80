The hate raids were actually a good source of income since I made about 1k+ after each raid, thats including paying for the hate stones and giving clerics some gems.<br>

<br>
As to Lancer, well, I've always liked him as a player, he was very proactive and helpful and upbeat when he was in MV.  However I guess he was making some bad decisions on the side, but it looks like he's making a real ongoing effort to repay what he stole.<br>
<br>
I really wish some people on here would give him a break and a chance to prove that he's changed.  The Helm of Radulkan that he sold is a VERY nice item, one that he won on a raid, he did not buy it with scam money.  Selling a nice rare helm like that to help repay the people he stole from is something that I see as a very big step in the right direction.<br>
<br>
Please stop giving him $%&amp;* in the meantime while he does what he can to right his past wrongs.  Most people who have done things like he did make ZERO effort to make up for it and they don't seem to catch half the flak that Lancer does.<br>
<br>
Keep it up Lancer. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Lancerblood existed before Bagend. He just switched the druid to his main because he liked playing Bagend more, at the time (his usual reason was that he had misallocated all his points into charisma by mistake). Also, there had been some complaints from people in highkeep about Lancerblood, and he may have wanted to let the steam blow over on him. <br>
<br>
After being removed from SoK, and failing at his attempts to rejoin (which also included apologies, and swearing that he had learned and would play nice) he was in &lt;Royal Blood&gt; for a while, and played bagend as his main until the heat on him got to be too much, from scams, etc.<br>
<br>
At this point, he apparently decided to unretire Lancerblood, had his sidekick (a cleric who will remain unnamed, as he's a pretty nice guy) PL lancerblood rapidly up from lvl 24 to somwhere in the 40's and then apparently managed to join &lt;Menacing Visage&gt;, not revealing that he was the same guy they had earlier rejected as Bagend.<br>
<br>
When I had last seen Lancerblood, he was in crafted, with a couple centis, lvl 24, Bagend's alt. Suddenly, I see him posting on this site, as &quot;Lancerblood, the confused warrior,&quot; with a magelo profile that includes some really nice stuff. I had at that point assumed that he had bought the items by selling off Bagend's stuff, which was above average (since he had 15kpp from the Tstaff he ninja'd). <br>
<br>
One day I noticed a post to the blacklist from Lancerblood, complaining about someone else's behavior. I posted a reply, saying basically just that that was funny, considering Lancerblood was also Bagend. At that point, I was unaware of these BP MQ scams. However, Bagend must have seen that he was nailed, because the next time I logged on, he immediately sent me tells, accusing me of flaming him, etc. I couldn't understand quite why he was so upset, since all I had said was that Lancerblood was Bagend. Well, then I got the tell from Bloodclot, who asked if I was certain they were the same person, and told me about the BP scam. That was when I decided to publicly post my knowledge of Bagend/Lancerblood's history on the blacklist.<br>
<br>
In my humble opinion, If the link between the two character had not been made public, there would never have been any refunds. I honestly believe he just sees this as being easier than starting another character from scratch. Notice he isn't making any HUGE sacrifices. Ok, so he sold his helm, but he kept 3k to buy a new one. I know a LOT of post 50 character who do not have 3k helms. He gave back a few pieces of cobalt, that he says he bought with the MQ cash. Considering the amount of time he spends in KC, it seems just as likely that those are a few items he either won the roll on, or got given on a NBG basis while grinding there.<br>
<br>
If what foulwind says is true, and he is buying thurg MQ armor for himself, he probably felt he didn't need the cobalt any more, and nobody could ask him to give back the quest armor, as it is no drop. I'm glad that at least some of the people he scammed are getting SOME of their money back, but I really don't expect a sea change in bagend/lancerblood.<br>
<br>
Other comments : I REALLY doubt he deleted Bagend. He's probably just semi-retired until most folks forget about these scams, or he has a chance to get him renamed.<br>
<br>
Also, while in SoK, Bagend caused a few members to quit, mainly due to what was described to me as Loot-Hungry behavior while on raids. It has always seemed to me that his main interest in the game was loot/gear, and that caused a lot of problems within our guild, which is a less rigid, friendship type guild.<br>
<br>
Anyway, this is just my two cents worth, take it for what you will.<br>

<br>
Well, as someone who didn't like what Lancerblood did at all, and found him a little annoying as Bagend even before the scams, I will jump in to defend him in one respect.  For whatever it's worth, he really did delete Bagend.  I was bored and annoyed and resurrected the Bagend name.  One night he was spamming the auction channel about his hate raid, annoying practically everyone in the channel, so I decided to check if he really did delete Bagend.  He did, so I joined his Hate raid channel to be annoying since he was spamming the auction channel every 2 minutes about his hate raid.<br>
<br>
So yes, he was telling the truth about deleting Bagend.  And yes, I'm an annoying ass.<br>

IMO he has earned points for what he has done so far.  He may have been forced to own up to his misdeeds but no one forced him to try and pay back people.  I think he also knows that even if he pays everyone back and cleans up his act there will always be a few people out there that will never fully trust him.  Remember behind the toon is a person who makes mistakes.  <br>
<br>
People forget there are other people trying to play and enjoy the game until they are reminded of it.  Also there is a certain amount of pride in having worked hard to get a coveted item that I do not think the scamers will ever feel.  Hopefully Lancerblood has learned part of the joy of the item is not the item itself but the working to obtain it by yourself, earning the money, or with a group of people. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=97672">

Too many scams on this server<br>
<br>
I for one dont condone his behavior, and I agree he is looking for the easier way out.  Now that you have admitted your thievery, just pay the people back and find a rock to crawl under.  If what you said is true, that you applied to leave this server, and GM's said it will take 1-3 weeks, I think the server would rejoice, but to get any sympathy from me, you would have to take Suncaster with you.<br>

Mostly because the game is getting boring to me because I personally dont like to mindlessly grind every night (IF i even get a group) and never be able to raid unless I lead my own raid.  But thanks for warning the other server Kyyro, you make it a point to make my life miserable.<br>
<br>
Applying to Cascaide Point is my last attempt at being guilded on rodcet nife, Im just asking for someone to give me a chance.<br>
<br>
I have many friends on RF but like I said there is no fun in being without a guild, not having the power to ever hope to get your epic because you cant get in a guild is very depressing.<br>
<br>
Yes, I know this was my own fault.  But this is a game to me and I personally dont have much fun grinding every night (The only time I get to raid is when I lead a raid or join another open raid).  <br>
<br>
Yes, IF I decide to transfer everyone will be payed back BEFORE I do the transfer.  Although even If I do that I find It sad that im going to have to make a new ezboard account because people like Kyyro track me down =p, even though I would be leaving on good terms.<br>
<br>
Also note that Im still not 100% sure im going to transfer, this really depends on if anyone decides to give me a chance, and im still not sure If I want to leave my friends behind.<br>
<br>
But really Kyrro, do you find it fun to try and make my life miserable?<br>
<br>
Edit: forgot to mention, Xaanru im not going to be on very much during the WEEK because I dont get home until about 6 pm every night, NOT because the transfers take some time, like I said Im not 100% sure if im transfering yet.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thats my 2 cents on this issue<br>
