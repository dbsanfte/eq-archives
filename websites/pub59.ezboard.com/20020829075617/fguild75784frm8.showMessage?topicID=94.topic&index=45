Nope, did not miss it but I would refute it.  How many mages are there with epic pets?<br>
<br>
As far as a warrior being useless in a grind group - I doubt useless is right - how about not needed over as much over other classes anymore?  <br>
<br>
I count a total of 14 classes (may have missed one or 2).  Why should 1 class be needed in every grind group?  Heck I have seen plenty of grind groups that &quot;had&quot; to have a cleric, chanter, and a warrior - passing on bards, druids, and sk/paladins - mages, wizard, necro never even getting considered.<br>

Yes, I'm mainly talking about exp groups, but that's a big portion of the game for most people.  I believe it's very signficant that a particular class is so dominant in exp groups and can gain levels so quickly.  I'm fortunate enough to reap the benefits of being grouped with such a mage so I'm probably insane to complain about it, but it's still very frustrating seeing how insignificant your main character's contribution is.  In a number of situations it is probably helpful to have 1 player tank to help control mob placement, pull, etc.  It's quicker for the mage to solo/duo, but assuming we're talking about a larger group, yeah, having a player tank is useful.  But you just want 1.  It doesn't have to be a warrior by any means and there's little use for having more than 1.  The mage will handle the add, or a couple adds.  Wherever did the idea come from that 2 mobs = dead mage anyway?  Even solo against a lot of exp mobs, I just don't think that's true at all.  The epic pet can very easily tank 2.  Even the regular pet could tank two for awhile, likely long enough for the mage to burn down the first mob it's beating on even without overnuking and pulling aggro, thus reducing it to 1 on 1 fairly quickly.  but anyway, that's getting pretty sidetracked...<br>
<br>
&quot;Heck I have seen plenty of grind<br>
                     groups that &quot;had&quot; to have a cleric, chanter, and a warrior - passing on<br>

                     considered.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't know how else to put this... those groups are stupid, very very stupid.  If you want fast exp and you're passing up high level mages for your group, then you're being stupid.  Well, maybe ignorant is a better term since a lot of people just don't realize what crazy damage they can kick out.  <br>

<br>
I'm not going to argue that warriors bring less to a group now then they once did.  Hell, most of the time when I grind it's with a ranger and rogue in the group, replace either of them with a warrior and I watch the xp slow considerably.  And there are very few times the warriors extra AC makes a difference over the rangers.<br>
<br>
Arguing that mages are overpowered though, I still have to disagree with.  Even going through your own routine.  You're using buffs from your brother and enchanter friends.  And your gear sounds on the above average side.  Would say that you're an exception more then a rule.<br>
<br>
Instead of complaining about the powers another class has.  Maybe you should be working with others of your class to get it upgraded.

It is like a policeman telling a fireman he can't do his own job correctly when the fireman points out a general problem he has seen with the pay/benefits/hours, etc.  a policeman has over a fireman.

<br>
Nowhere did I say or even hint that someone didn't know how to play thier class.  And I'm sorry to disagree, but the very foundation of this thread is about someone who singled out mages as being overpowered.  Thus in need of a nerf.  As it's developed it's been shown pretty clearly it's not so much the mage that's over powered but rather the warrior that is underpowered.  That is not a comment based on the ability of the player but about the available skills of any warrior.  It was my personal suggestion that his time would be better spent lobbying to have his class improved rather then having another nerfed.<br>

I admit, I have been guilty of the same a couple of times, but I normally try to look at the subject of the disagreement in my replies, not the person.  All that does is make people angry, or angrier, and never solves anything.  I LIKE a good argument.

Monks are *suppost* to do more damage than a Warrior. Just like Rangers, they lack ac and hp to make up for that. That's also why they get the skills like Block and whatnot (In the case of Rangers, Jolt). They can't take the aggro.<br>

actually that's not true in a grind group anymore, Elawnah.  Because of the AC softcap and several other reasons, other classes will tank just as well as a warrior.  Basically several classes are close enough to equal now in tanking ability that in a grind group it doesn't matter.  Go with the one that does the most damage (monk most likely) or one that supplies other utility that you need.  But that's a different discussion.  <br>
<br>
Here's the simplest scenario since it is in essence what my grind groups can get the majority of fights down to.  Yes, it's oversimplified, but it represents well what we go for on exp grinds and we can set up this type of 1 on 1 in most situations --<br>
<br>
Take a 60 warrior with decent gear, not uber guild stuff, just solid gear.  Hell, give him 200k for it.  I have 200k+ in gear and that's not counting much value for several pieces, including the bp and legs, which are no drop.  don't worry about how much the mage has in gear.  It doesn't matter.  They need an epic so assume much of their plat went toward buying MQ's or something.  The rest of it can be mediocre gear.  Figure, i don't know, 100k total for some mediocre gear and a bunch of MQ's to help get the epic.  anyway, that's too much detail for a simple test, so moving on...<br>
<br>
Now make an epic mage pet.  Use the water one.  It does great dmg.  Any of them will probably work though.  Throw on the buffs.  Assume you've got nice buffs (DS, haste, aego, etc. etc.).  Have a cleric ready to heal.  Bring in the average blue con grind group mob.  Bring one mob for the pet and one for the warrior.  If a mob dies, assume that it's very quickly replaced by another mob.  Now pay attention while they fight for a few minutes.  I guarantee you that the mage pet will kill it's mobs faster.  It's not close.  Okay, fine, I can deal with that if the old thought that pets are good dmg dealers but not good dmg takers applies.  It doesn't.  That warrior will require far more healing than the pet does.  I don't know entirely why that is.  The pet does have 30hp per tick extra regen, but that's only 300 per minute.  The warrior is going to be at the AC softcap for grind mobs.  But for whatever reason, but pet will not need near the healing that the warrior does.  That's the bottom line... better dmg but also better tanking.  Now how that's even a little balanced,  I have no idea.  If it does better damage, it should NOT take damage as well.  Period.<br>
<br>
-- Callon<br>
<br>
p.s. upgrade the mob quality a bit with some of our recent fights... the epic pet tanked Deep (part of the monk epic fight in LOIO) and did so easily.  A player tank would almost certainly have needed more heals than the epic pet did.  I'm not sure what else our friendly neighborhood mage has tanked with the pet that's a bit stronger than the average grind mob.<br>

<br>
this comment was to revnick, but anyway... what we've seen by grinding together and by the two of them going without me is eye opening.  Also keep in mind that if he's benefitting from cleric buffs, then so am I when i'm there.  But then we've virtually always had clerics in our grind groups and often chanters.  The mage's dmg drops off a bit without c3 up, but it's not a huge amount by any means.  We've spent quite a bit of time grinding after c3 dropped or was dispelled.  And if there's no chanter to c3 the mage and cleric, then there's also no chanter to haste me.  That's actually worse.  The mage destroys us meleers by even more if we don't have chanter haste, even if it means he lacks c3.  So... point is you can't dismiss the issue by claiming this case is an exception.  The gear for everyone is pretty solid, but not totally uber.  It also doesn't make a big difference in a mage'd damage output.<br>

I haven't argued warriors are underpowered these days.  I even said myself in my own grind groups I prefer a ranger and a rogue over a warrior.  What I don't get is why you're still so focused on a mage.  Rangers, monks, rogues.  All can consistanly outdamage a warrior as well.  Hell, at the risk of being offensive (and I don't intend to be) a lot of classes can outdamage a warrior.  Instead of focusing on one whom you apparently feel is stronger then the rest (whether people agree or not is irrelevent) why not focus your opinion on your classes weaknesses on VI.  <br>
<br>
You've obviously put a lot of testing and comparison.  Get some hard numbers to go with it, you'ld be surprised what they listen to. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ucuedyen2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cuedyen2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#333333>(8/19/02 5:33:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=94.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: verant's pet class (rant)</span><hr size=1> Not being sarcastic - this is one of the better discussions I have read where people are stating vastly different opinions and it has not degraded into a mud slinging contest.<br>
<br>
We will all have different opinions - depending mostly on which classes we play the most or are more familiar with.  <br>
<br>
My first character and the one I enjoy the most is my Paladin.  That being said - I do enjoy the fact that I can get in groups in place of warriors now.  Do you have any idea how frustrating it is to not get in a grind group because you are not a &quot;tank&quot;.  Up until February I was still hearing this a lot.  Thats when I stopped trying and turned to smithing for my gaming enjoyment.<br>
<br>
I personally think verant is doing a fantastic job of balancing (again its all from your perspective).  From the hybrid upgrades to the removal of the 10% healing penalty for non-clerics.  That being said - they are not finished.  There will be more tweaks to casters (which does affect hybrids) and bards are being left for last.  <br>
<br>
It would not bother me would be to see the epic pet downgraded slightly (non-mage here) - then again the epic pet as is does not bother me either.  I will ask again - what percentage of 55+ mages have epics?  I really don't know.  <br>
<br>
Ignoring epic-pets.<br>
<br>
Monks and rougues should outdamage warriors - but neither should come close to taking the damage of a warrior.  IMHO, paladins and sk should come close (but not exceed) to taking a beating like a warrior but do no-where near the damage.  This allows &quot;grind&quot; groups to be viable with various classes.  I guess I am still sensitive to the fact that hybrids are or were unwanted classes in grind groups.  I was shocked a couple of weeks ago when a cleric I know (through a server chat channel) said they would never take a paladin or SK as a MT in a grind group because they were mana sponges.  I thought people had gotten over that. <br>

But lately people have wanted to play mages again, mostly because of the upgrades. And this also affects the number of mage epics which enter the game.<br>
<br>
Anyway, there will always be a place for warriors. The feeling that you need a warrior to tank for you in most places is so in-grown that it is hard to change. Just as the feeling that mages/wizards/necros and others don't add much to a grind group. Of course there will be some who see things differently, but there will always be a lot of people who don't. <p><html>

<br>
I think I can answer this for him.  I think what set Callon off was the fact that the mage pet could already kick the shiit out of him against mobs and varant decided to upgrade them even more by adding 1000 hp and increasing their damage.  Another small change is that the DS now casts almost as soon as the pet is cast, it used to take a random amount of time.  Granted, this was a bug, but it still somewhat effected the pet's effectiveness.  To be fair, I have heard him complain on numerous times about monks being able to tank better then wars, I think he just used mages b/c of the recent upgrades as I stated and the fact they were supposed to help &quot;balance&quot;.  I do think you made a good point with the numbers though man, would not be a bad idea at all. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><p align="center"><b><font size="2">Revnick Lifeweaver</font></b><font size="2">

A couple of months ago, after I got my epic, people would stop me as I ran around to ask what weapon I was holding and would be amazed when I told them what it was. I dont know how to explain it other then saying sometimes I felt like a rare spawn LOL.  I was amazed how many people still asked me for Clarity or a port after I got it LOL.<br>
Since the changes, I have noticed a great many mages have started poping up again which is great. It was kind of sad to see that people felt so down about a class they just quit playing them. What it comes down to is everyone wants to feel wanted, we all put large amounts of time into leveling these characters. It is a terrible feeling shouting for groups and not being able to get one, especially when you are a class that cant solo.  Even classes who can solo often like to group because Everquest is by nature a social game and being alone all the time can get old.  <br>
<br>
For those of you who may have been curious, here is the HPs on pets now after last patch:<br>
Monster Summoning 3 - 3250hp<br>
Greater Voc: Earth - 3250hp<br>
Greater Voc: Water - 2650hp<br>
Greater Voc: Air - 2650hp<br>
Epic - 4000hp  <br>

I've grouped with Tiyra since she was level 20 in LOIO, and let me tell you that the pet has always outdamaged me (It's supposed to, I agee with that).  When we were fighting together in DL I noticed that not only could it do more damage than me, but could definitely tank better than me.  Why?  It could hold it's own again 2 mobs while I got slapped around with one.  It's massive regen allowed it to have little downtime as compared to myself (without healer).  Yes many people agree that it's time for a warrior upgrade, and epic upgrade.  (Please don't agrue I said many, not all).  I play a warrior and I definitely feel that way.  I'm for the most part going to be playing a necro alt in the next few months.  Why?  Because<br>
<br>
1. Have a hard time finding a group<br>
<br>
2. Only have a spand of time of about 2 hours a day, in which case by the time I get a group, I have to log.<br>
<br>
3. I can't solo so why should I get on just to frustrate myself?<br>
<br>
I would rather have a ranger in my group if I were anything other than a warrior.  He has buffs, sow (I know a lot of people have run 3 now though).  I agree that a lot of classes should outdamage a warrior.  A monk, all he does is damage.  A rogue all he does is a lot of sneaky damage.  <br>
<br>
I feel the balance is way screwed up from my standpoint, even though it might be skewed.  I also look at what the game has become.  I've heard that each mob in Vex Thal takes about 45 minutes to kill.  Even if it's half that, it's not a game I want to be a part of.  They've balanced the game so that only hardcare gamers have a shot at going certain places.  Only hardcore warriors have a shot at being good MT's.  Warriors, a class that can't solo and is being slowly replaced in groups?  Who wants to play that class?  Me?  I'm going to be playing a necro and selling trading gear for my warrior in hopes that we get an upgrade soon.<br>
<br>
Why did Callon go after mages specifically?  Because they are good at soloing and wanted in groups now, and are still getting upgrades.  The part of balancing that VI screwed up isn't the coding for the classes.  It's the gear, and the AC cap.  At 50 I grouped with an SK who has 5 less hitpoints than me and 20 higher AC.   His str was 235 (although it was buffed) and I couldn't keep aggro from him so I told him that he was the new MT for the group.  Think back to the kunark days when warriors had their own armor, with AC that couldn't be compared to on any other class.  That's all out the window now.<br>
<br>
  Warriors are being outdamaged so badly now that they need incredibly high aggro weapons to keep taunt.  Should they upgrade our damage?  No, not really, we want what everyone wants, for the d4mn taunt button to be fixed.  No one knows what it does now &quot;exactly&quot; anyway.  <br>
<br>
I know that I've been a little of topic, but the people in this board have taken time to read all of this and comment without flaming anyone.  I invite your comments, what should warriors do?  I've thought about this at length, some ideas, like &quot;Have warriors boycott EQ for a week.&quot; and such wouldn't hold, the &quot;uber&quot; warriors most likely wouldn't go along with it.  I feel complaining to VI makes up sound like whinners, and I don't think they listen anyway.<br>
