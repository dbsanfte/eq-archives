I love playing Rogue/bard classes. i dunno why. when i play D&amp;D i always chose to be either a rogue, or a bard. <p>Got Bard?

<br>
Very early on I had a few encounters with enchanters that made me realize how powerful enchanters were. So Iumuno was born as a twink. Yep I am a twink! <br>
<br>
I kept playing the magician though, because back then with the weapons available, magician damage output was unmatched along with a very respectable disposable tank and good soloability made for a very strong class. I had a lot of fun playing my mage, and though I liked the intricacies and the subtle power of the enchanter, I (thought!) had a lot of time invested in my magician and wanted to keep him as my main, plus playing an enchanter at lower levels when you don't know much about the game is extremely hard, and is an exercise in stamina through the repeated deaths.<br>
<br>
Then came Kunark, and the benefits for magicians were disappointing. I don't want to go into a class debate, but it took them 2 years to fix the issues with magicians, who now with their many recent upgrades hold a solid position again in class balance (imo). Anyway, bottom line is, playing an underpowered class was depressing. I had fun with my friends and everything, never had grouping difficulties, but I didn't like feeling obsolete. The choice was obvious. My mage was level 52, and my enchanter 29, so one day around september 2000 I just decided Iumuno was now my primary character, and I never looked back since.<br>
<br>
Enchanters are extremely powerful up to a certain point in the game. When grouping with people of similar level, and fighting content aimed at your intented level, I believe no class come close in matching the power of a skilled enchanter from level 30-55. Since then, I played a rogue and cleric up to the high 40's, and except when playing the cleric in high danger situations (most of the time it's mind numbing), I never experienced anything that came close to the exhilaration you feel when you turn a desperate situation into excellent xp through teamwork effort, skill, concentration and a little luck. The feeling (for me) is very akin to consuming drugs. <br>
<br>
At level 60 it's different now. Playing an enchanter is like having a half life. Your traditional skills (mez, charm) aren't nearly as needed or as useful, but new AA skills kinda mutated the enchanter into the tank-mage class, with a ridiculously overpowered combo of damage output, tanking, and the widest arsenal of spells of all casters with the possible exceptions of shamans. On the other hand, in raids, most of your abilities DON'T work. When you grind as a level 60 enchanter you could easily mem 16 spells and make a regular use of all of them. When you raid, you will have a hard time memming 8 useful combat spells. The entire high end content is designed so every combat oriented enchanter abilities don't work. So you end up being needed only for buffs, and for the non-organisationally-impaired it's just not very hard to do for a single enchanter and as many groups as lag can sustain it. <br>
<br>
So it ends up being a very strange situation. In one situation you can't help but thinking &quot;wow I did a good job and I was useful&quot;, and then you run into another and you can't help feeling useless. It depend on how you're playing the game I guess. <br>

I screwed around with a mix of characters...<br>
<br>
The Human city was more developed and I liked the balanced stats... Then I kept getting told that Enchanters were going to be able to create Enchanted items... I thought about how sweet it would be to make enchanted swords and armor so I picked and Enchanter... Then I picked his name Vulcan (After the smith of the gods) but it wouldn't let me have it. So After bouncing about 40 names off the server it let me have VULCANSMITH.  <br>
The sir name at 50 SOJOURN(er) to take a break, rest or holiday to refresh or revitalize.<br>
<br>
Why not human...<br>
As an enchanter  I have the most extensive line of vision enhansment of any class. I get invisability early on and could explore more. I can Infiltrate almost anyplace in the game given time work my way there....hehehe<br>
<br>
Well not understanding the drawbacks and thinking I might like to rollplay... I picked Karana as a diety... Well... At this point I think I'm the last NON-Agnostic/Non-Twinked Chanter on the server...lol<br>
<br>
At this point Im just to stuborn to start Vulcan Over again...<br>
The upside Is I can take a few more BONKs from MOBs before I die...lol<br>

My friends had already picked wizard, magician, enchanter, cleric, monk, and shaman. I wanted to choose a different class. Ideally I wanted to be a master archer, raining death from above on my enemies. Hence choice came down to warrior and ranger. I ended up choosing wood elf ranger because my friend said that I'd get to cast spells. Hehe!<br>
<br>
My next character was high elf mage. I thought that controlling a pet was really cool plus the benefit of solo power.<br>
