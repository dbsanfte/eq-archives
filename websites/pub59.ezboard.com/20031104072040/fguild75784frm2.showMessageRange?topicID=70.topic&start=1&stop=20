I personally highly doubt they would raise the level limit due to the huge amount of coding it would take to scale old world, kunark, luclin, velious exp to 61 to say 70 levels, and frankly VI employess aint that pro-active. <br>
<br>
PoP looks to be visually pleasing, but if it shows the same trends that most of Luclin has shown I'm guessing it's going to be another 14 zones of time wasting goodness, mmmm mmm =)<br>
<br>
On a side note, Tigole posted a good rant about the uncaring VI employess just trying to shove another expansion down our throats so we will overlook the utter crappiness that Luclin end-game encounters have shown.  www.legacyofsteel.net on his April 13th post, &quot;Dead as Intended&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/usinghawkstormbringer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Singhawk Stormbringer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00bie</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#333333>(4/16/02 9:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=70.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Planes of Power?</span><hr size=1> Even I've noticed that a lot of Luclin content is going almost completely unused now.  Fungus Grove was a great Velks alternative the first weekend Luclin came out (and I mean a GREAT Velks alternative, that zone ruled), but as soon as it was &quot;tuned&quot;, it cleared out like people avoiding the plague (bad cliche too) and now your lucky to see more than 12 in zone, the Sunday night I was there on opening weekend, there was a good 96 in zone and NO shortage of mobs anywhere to be found.<br>
<br>
Was in Maiden's Eye a little bit Saturday night... ghost town, like 4 people in zone, used to be slammed to the gills on Saturdays and most days.  The Grey, always near empty unless people are going through for Ssra Temple, which is more a raid zone than a grind zone.  Grieg's is mostly green/light blue to 55, let alone any higher (at least by the zone anyway, wasn't able to get much further in before I had to leave for the afternoon last time I was there, which was a good month ago now as I remember it vividly).  Akheva has always been pretty empty too, along with Acrylia (I know where Akheva is, but don't ask me to find Acrylia... no clue, but I know it's a haul).<br>
<br>
That's the biggest problem with Luclin content, time sink getting from point A to point B as the only way in is via Nexus.  Nexus to The Grey is a long trek, Nexus to Grimling is long too.  Shar Vahl is laggy as all get out (even with clip plane way down).  There are some serious Luclin design issues that VI needs to look over and go &quot;How can we make this so it's used?&quot; as now, Shar Vahl usually has all of 6 people in.  Most people I know have their newly created Vah Shir moved to Norrath so they can at least function without horrid framerates (I know I had mine moved...) <p>[21 Shaman] <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=80537 target=_blank>Karaab Spiritcaller</a><br>

even with Selo's, it takes a good 15-30 minutes to get from, say, Nexus to Katta or The Grey or anything like that.<br>

Yes, bards can run fast, I can clear Antonica in under 20 minutes (Freeport - Qeynos) and Firiona - Seb in about 10 minutes, Iceclad - Cobalt in about 15 minutes, but I was more specifically talking those without bard speed, not me.<br>

Silly Bards.<br>

What i'm really hoping for is a another zone similar to ToV.  Too many guilds are getting to be HoT able, no fun fighting over something.<br>
<br>
Would be nice, if they included an arangement of new raid zones too. Kinda like things similar to hate, fear, but things for 55+ or even only 60's.<br>
<br>
Hehe.  This will probally be another expansion that I don't buy for months after it comes out, just so I don't need to worry about them having to work out all the bugs.<br>

Better yet *bonk*<br>
<br>
I'm assuming your in either AOD or AL.  As I am sure you know, very few guilds can even compare with the AOD/AL alliance.  *Please notice I said Alliance and not guild*<br>
<br>
I am very aware of the problems between these OMG SO UBER guilds have in TOV.  Especially in NTOV.<br>
<br>
My comment was made more of an example than anything else.  Of course, you can not compare NTOV to HOT. Great, thats fine, but in order for us not so uber guilds to even dream of attempting the @#%$ guilds like AOD/AL are attempting, we must equip ourselves.  This means taking the stepping stones. Ya know, kinda like the crafted to kael to hot to other tov and other higher end mobs.  HOT to us at the present time, may be equal to your NTOV at the same time.<br>
<br>
And come to think of it! I do remember the King incident. One of my very good friends happened to be there! and I heard all about it when I got home from class.<br>
<br>
This is a perfect example of why I refrain from joining any of these high end guilds.<br>
<br>
*I* do not know what it is like to fight?  Hehe, unless you know me, which you don't quite yet (oh yes, grats on being moderator #4 of these boards), don't make careless assumptions of what I do and don't do.<br>
<br>
*boggle* Wonders if those screen shots of AL training giants on EK are fake?<br>
<br>
Anywho, if a certain guild like, hmmm, EK decides they want to bind zerg a mob, guess what thats there perogitive.  Sure, a lot of people may not agree with them, but guess what else! They'll probally be able to get the mob down opposed to the people who criticize them.  And nevermind the fact that if a guild has the forces in the guild, and the opposing guid does not, too bad.  The guild with the forces get the kill.  The less fortunate guild should not be botching up their attempt becuase they don't feel that the other guild should not be using the strategy that they have decided to use.  Its that whole respect thing again.<br>
<br>
And that certain GM who despawned the pop.. hehe.. more power to you.  I'd like to see that more, maybe it would stop alot of the bitching, complaining, training, threatning, shiznet that goes on. <br>
<br>
Any who, one of the biggest problem on this server is lack of respect not only between the high-end guild, but also the medium guilds.<br>
<br>

<br>
Fighting is not on my &quot;to do&quot; list period.  <br>
<br>
Maybe I took this post out of context, but I feel especially that comment was very derogatory to any person not in one of those so called uber guilds.<br>
<br>
Step back and reevaluate, becuase I'd bet money that you had to climb those stepping stones to be where you are today.<br>
<br>
This post in no way, was bashing any guild or persons.  It is just what I see.  *grin*<br>
<br>
Everyone makes mistakes, no guild or person is going to be perfect in the public eye no matter how hard they try.  <br>
<br>
I shoulda probally posted this under my own name as this is *NOT* the moderators opinion but I'm too lazy to change accounts now that this is all printed.<br>

I think part of the reason why I do not spend so much time up in luclin is the fact that if something happens down on norrath (sev pops or something to that effect), it really can be difficult find a ride down.  If i'm in a rush... waitin for the spires really is not an option.  /shrug<br>

My guild may be HoT able in a few days, weeks, or months, depending on how much our people level and gain equipment.  Equipment is the second most important thing in the game next to levels, and is even more important in the high end when there are no levels left to gain.  Planes of Power is just going to be a lot of zones where the uberguilds will go, leaving us to attempt what they attempted at the same time in their advancement.  While they kill uber_mob_001, my guild may be struggling in NToV for the first time ever.  I say Planes of Power needs to relieve the stress on the high end zones by adding more of the same caliber or more. <p><A

What do I mean with this?<br>
<br>
Most probably know how on a given high end mob there's usually around 20% &quot;super&quot; items that you pray will drop (CoF from Nagafen for example, monk robe from Ventani etc), 60% ok stuff and 20% crap that you rather not get. What was the problem with this was that the highest end guilds often want the 20% top end items and end up farming the monster even way beyond having the worst 20% rot, but having the 60% rot at times too.<br>
<br>
Now in their infinite wisdom Verant did some bad things with Luclin. Now for Ssra encounters it seems there's 10% super items, 20% ok ones and 70% just straight out rot. Arch Lich is something many of you've seen dead on www.legacyofsteel.net and others... we've killed him 7-8 times and I think _3_ items are on primaries? Wtf is up with that? A ToV dragon drops as good stuff... and here we reach the problem.<br>
<br>
Velious risk vs reward is way better than Luclin risk vs reward, which means that a guild equipping itself is most definitely better off in Velious.<br>
<br>
So what does this mean to the average player? Most of all it reflects in guilds that did quite a bit of Velious high end before Luclin _still_ being in Velious. This mostly means Eastern Keep/Arirang and Avatars of Discord/Arcane Legacy. They should have been able to move on to Luclin, but since they still need gear from NToV etc, they didn't. Other new guilds moved up and the overcrowding got just ridiculous. Ascent is the only guild focusing on Luclin, and even we kill HoT nameds and Tunare which are contested mobs.<br>
<br>
What is even worse is that I don't see any guild moving on before PoP, so if you're a newcomer wanting to do NToV... well, you better be prepared to wait until EK/VA, Arirang, DF, AoD/AL and DA/EiE are done. Considering how long it took for us to equip ourselves they'll be done sometime in late 2003 unless PoP offers a real alternative.<br>

Luclin caused huge mudflation and things like warrior useable 1 hand weapons with around a 1 to 2 dmg ratio and some stats went from costing several k pre-luclin to costing a few hundred plat post-luclin centi weapon flood.  Many people also snagged things like the ac20 +15 str/wis melee belt (even monk useable!) out of ME.  It was very easy to get.  Granted now they've nerfed the crap out of the drop rates and you hardly see those anymore, but for awhile they rotted.  Anyway, the effect has been to bring a lot more people up to a certain level of gear while still leaving it very difficult to take the next step and improve beyond that.  And as previously mentioned, it's sent people back to velious who would have rather moved on by now.  <br>
<br>
by the way, as long as we're talking about high end luclin encounters, what's with this ssra emperor?  I've only heard of one guild that even knows how to make the bane weapons needed to hurt him (FoH).  The recipe apparently doesn't exist in the game.  I've no clue how they figured it out.  And legacy of steel has a post about killing Blood and then having the emperor spawn and DT everyone.  I'm not sure if that meant everyone died simultaneously or just DT'ed one at a time.  I thought all at once cause they said Blood's earring loots rotted, but maybe those were left to rot because they sucked. heh... oh, and do ya think verant will ever finish luclin? lol...<br>

<br>
This is incorrect, people just don't advertise. For example Vesi, Honch, Kariena, Prellius and some others have Shissar Bane weapons in Ascent. Prolly a lot more by now. Triton of Povar (www.tritonguild.com) has by far the most shissarbane weapons actually.<br>
<br>
What Tigole ranted about was Serubane weapons. We have that recipe as well, and he should be going down soon. These two are really the last hope of Luclin risk vs reward though. Seru is looking pretty good as far as his equipment goes atleast, but those two will not occupy more guilds than just one... the rest will probably stay in Velious.<br>
<br>
&quot; I'm not sure if that meant everyone died simultaneously or just DT'ed one at a time. I thought all at once cause they said Blood's earring loots rotted, but maybe those were left to rot because they sucked. &quot;<br>
<br>
The Emperor isn't alone so the combination was 8 mobs hitting for 300 something and emperor DTing. That will rip through a force of 30 or so pretty awful fast. The reference to it DTing was them trying to CR somewhere in the area behind emperor portal, and apparently anyone logging in got a DT.<br>
