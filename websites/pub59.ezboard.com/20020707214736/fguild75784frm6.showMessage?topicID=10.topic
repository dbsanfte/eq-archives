Yes, I had auto-follow on....in a tunnel...yes, I know.... and yes, I did say ranger.... ;-) <br><br>Anyway, I zoned - never been here before so I have no clue where I'm zoning into - and fell instantly for 10,000 pts of damage. As I was falling - onto a large pile of corpses, apparently i'm not the only one who has done this! - the words &quot;You have entered The Hole&quot; flashed before my panicked eyes, striking pure terror into my 26th-level heart. <br><br>LOADING, please wait...<br><br>So there I am, a naked wood elf ranger somewhere in Norrath, with a corpse with all my money and gear on it stuck somewhere in a 60th level dungeon I have only heard horror stories about. What the hell do i do??? Of course, I petition. I didn't expect a GM rez or anything - I *have* petitioned before, after all! - but I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, and I thought that at least a GM would be able to suggest something. Just in case, however, I sent mayday /tells to everyone on my friends list, asking for advice. One of the friends I was grouped with, Hawkrus, logged on his wizard, Valerya, to port me back to Tox to wait. Other friends shouted in zones for high-level necromancers and advice. Meanwhile I splashed around in the fountain in Paineel with Hawkrus and Bumbly trying to keep me calm.<br><br>Hawkrus logged on his rogue to go down there and try to drag her corpse out. Armed with only his lockpicks, odd pieces of ravenscale and his l33t trap-sensing skillz, our gallant rogue died several times to hordes of elementals. Other friends, Fiztbane and Lanat, showed up to join my Paineel pool party and see what they could do. While keeping me entertained with his dancing and shape-shifting skills, Fiztbane got talking to a 50-something enchanter (henceforth known as the Random Heroic Enchanter, or RHE for short) who happened to be passing through. He suggested making level 1 rogues who could go into the Hole without aggroing anything and get my corpse back. The RHE and another friend, Hamdrin, created level 1 rogues, Corpul and Dragginguy, specially for the mission. My druid buddy, Bumbly, supplied fish scales from his baking supplies (knew those would come in handy someday!) so that Fiztbane could chain cast Enduring Breath on them. Meanwhile Hawkrus made me practise my swimming so that I would be able to swim through to the Hole to retrieve my corpse. <br><br>Then followed a long and anxious wait while the little rogues crept through the tunnels to find my corpse and drag it back.  By this time, several nail-biting hours had passed since i fell off that stupid ledge, and all my friends were still there. (Needless to say, I still hadnt received a reply to my petition). The scene at the Hole entrance (the way normal people go into it) began to resemble a Baywatch beach rescue, complete with scantily-clad redheads, hunky barbarian types and - of course - gnomes, all nervously waiting for news. Eventually the little guys made it all the way through, and dragged my corpse back to the zone line. Since I had never been in there before, someone would have to go in with me while i looted, and then get me back out. This is where the RHE logged on his wife's druid and swam through the rocks (more Enduring Breath) with me to the corpse. Once i had looted, he ported us back to Tox Forest and ran with me back to Paineel. By now it was about 3am on Labor Day. <br><br>I want to publicly thank the friends - and the completely random players - who gave up FIVE HOURS of their night (and several times, the lives of multiple characters!) - to rescue a careless ranger. So *THANK YOU* to Hawkrus, Bumbly, Valerya, Lanat, Fiztbane, Hamdrin, and of course, the rogues, Corpul and Draggingguy. To my everlasting shame, I dont remember the Random Heroic Enchanter's name, but you know who you are.<br><br>/Salute<br><br>Ioldari, Ranger of Tunare (aka SorshaaTroublesBand).<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/usorshaatroublesband.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SorshaaTroublesBand</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0> at: 2/18/02 4:18:48 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/bguild75784.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=averx>Averx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00bie</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#333333>(2/18/02 10:14:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rescued from the Hole... a tale of high drama in low pla</span><hr size=1> Lockpick is such a great skill...<br><br>There are more doors that &quot;cannot&quot; be picked then can... sigh.<br><br>Sounds like yall had fun!
