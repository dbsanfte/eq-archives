He is a shammy and not a very good one at that. We were fighting in the RCY camp and he kept Cannibalizing him self to get mana. Now I have nothing againts shammies for doing this even though I don't like it too much, but this is besides the point. I understand doing it for buffing a group but this fool goes and starts slowing every enemy that pops up and of course he gets aggroed and gets killed. Of course he blames me for his death. On my side I was healing others and could not get to him before he died. He then starts tell me off for not doing my job. As you all know me for being blunt I made an off color comment about shammies who do this kind of thing and he went nutts. He began with swears left and right both aimed at the group and at me. The leader disbanded him for his foul mouth plus they were on my side. I was going to rez him but he grabed his body before I could do this. I the sufered a leathal wave upon wave of insults and swearing. Now I have nothing really againts swearing in general but I do when it is aimed at people in general. (it is just plain rude)<br>
So I would not have to suffer his verbal abuse I put him on my ignore list. A few minutes later he trained a dog on us we killed it with no problem, but then he came back with 3 dogs and two undead poped in the room while he took off and zoned so he would not suffer the backlash of his actions. Our leader who was called Soulcaster got wasted and the rest of us barley got out with our lives thankfully our Warrior pulled them off the rest of us while we made our escape. Once I had recovered mana, soulcaster was trained out side of KC in DL which I suspect was Badoink again, but I am not sure because I took a smoke break to get my anger down and to get some mana back on my character. I went back inside to grab his body which with good luck that RCY was clear but as I was trying to get his consent (even though I did not know he was afk) while I was neverously waiting here come our old freind Badoink again with 2 dogs in tow. Now being a cleric I just threw on some healing over time and I was fine. After I zoned out to DL I found Soulcasters second body there rezzed it. H e then came back on I got his consent went back got his body and rezzed him. As you can see this was very upsetting and I feel that he is a very poor sport who may bey some just snotty nose 13 year old kid who acted like he was 10. Word of warning stay weary of Badoink he is very bad news in my view, if you group with him you do so at your own risk. I have heard from others that he has bad news so this is why I am putting this up<br>
<br>
Thanks for hearing me out and I hope you take my advice of staying clear of him.<br>

The group healer should keep him/her healed, or at the very least someone should keep a regen on him/her. <p><img src="http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/auroraknights/images/kharnesig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ukikamany.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kikamany</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#333333>(6/14/02 8:52 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Badoink</span><hr size=1> *note* a shammy can cast regen upon themselves and at higher lvl chloro<br>

<br>
It sounds from your description like this guy went over the top, with swearing and training.  However, as a cleric you do need to be aware that shaman must cannibalize FREQUENTLY to play their class well.  Cann is a class-defining ability and helps make up for the smaller mana pools that shaman typically have.  I usually let the cleric know that I consider 80% health to be FULL HEALTH for me and not to bother healing me unless I get under 60%.<br>
<br>
As far as slowing the mobs - that's a shaman's job.  If you are single-pulling the shaman may have the luxury of waiting a few seconds to ensure that the MT gets aggro before casting.  If multiples were pulled and there's no chanter, I will usually take the adds, slow them, pull them to the side, and attempt to root.  This does sometimes get me in trouble.  If there IS a chanter, I will slow EVERY mezz'd mob just as soon as I can in order to ensure that I get aggro when mez breaks instead of the low-AC chanter - and that sometimes gets me in trouble, too.<br>
<br>
A properly equipped shaman of a level to operate in KC should have an AC in the 800's at the very least; well-equipped shaman have an AC in the 900's or even 1000's and can tank a single, slowed mob for probably 30-40 seconds before getting into trouble.  Many shaman do not understand the importance of AC until their 50's however, so it's possible this guy is on a learning curve where he's realizing that he needs to sacrifice some WIS for AC/HP.  Reaching level 50 with a defense skill of 150 is unfortunate, but common.<br>
<br>
BTW, my lvl 53 shaman (my highest level character, no really uber gear) has an unbuffed AC of 860 and self-buffed AC of 898.  And I can tank those KC mobs easily without undue loss of HP, at least for long enough to root them and back off.<br>
<br>
A REALLY bad shaman would have been nuking.  A nuking shaman, unless it's the right-click JBB, is a shaman to stay away from :-) <p>Twoflower Tourist

I try and heal all I can, but thats not my main concern my main concern was the way he acted after the fact. Dying in the game is a fact of life it happens get over it. The only time I get mad about it is when I get stuck in a Death loop or for some reason my body can't be located. I have died 3 times more than there are members in my guild, I and others like me have learned to deal with it.<br>

Shammy needs to cannibalize, however, what Badoinks problem (IMHO) was, he was Cannibalizing too much. I can mentally picture him using it till he gets to one bubble of health (which I have seen shammys do...) then gain agro and boom, its all over but the literal crying...<br>
<br>
So yea, we use Canni, but we dont have to get ourselves so low we cant defend if a mob agro's. <br>

One idea though is in a group if possible is have a pally or ranger throw a few heals on the shaman between fights so the Cleric is not taking the full duties on this.  As a ranger and my boyfriend is a shaman I keep him and other shaman in Force of nature since it stacks with all other regens.  Some times I also add cloro if he has not had mana to cast group regrowth.  We all know shaman need to cani to get mana but both extremes are bad.  I have grouped with shaman who pay no attention to how low they cani and slow immediately when they have 2 bubbles of health then get mad when they die.  I have also grouped with shaman who don't cani at all and I end up being slower with my epic and they are always out of mana and so is the cleric.   Both ends are a good way to get a group killed or slow down grinding.  Shaman need to be able to fall between these 2 extremes and if they can't keep up with slowing while reasonable cani'ing then they need to say something about needing someone to heal them so they have mana for that pace or someone needs to slow down pulling. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=97672">

<br>
I was under my main, a Cleric, in Sebilis.  My tank and I zone in and get a great group of 5 together.  He was our Shaman.  We proceed to take the zone out in Seb ... doing great ... had a wipe.<br>
<br>
Well, we get back in there and I finally rez everyone, myself last of course, and sit to med.  A 60 Ranger by the name of Dymonds (?) comes over  (mind you, us casters are oom!) yelling for help.  I manage to get a heal off on her and help her out.  Next thing I know she pulls more (at the behest of this Shaman I believe) and comes back and yells for help again.<br>
<br>
Ok, so we invited her into this group thinking they would both be great additions.<br>
<br>
WRONG!<br>
<br>
Still trying to med (10 mana at this point in time) this Ranger keeps pulling .. and pulling .. and pulling, not listening to the OOM message I am giving.  Shaman, does nothing.  She dies.  Luckily my tank lived!  Well, so did everyone else.  Come to find out this Ranger was his real life cousin.  He stands up, drags her corpse and proceeds to go &quot;linkdead&quot; at the entrance of Sebilis, leaving us with a group of 4 at the zone out and nothing but threats and nasty comments from this Ranger.<br>
<br>
He never healed.  He rarely slowed.  He didn't believe in DoT's.  I don't know where his mana went, but he sure never used it with us!<br>
<br>
I hope this helps out some.<br>

I can't tell you how many times I've went off on a cleric for using CHeal. I mean, how dare they use a class defining spell like that. <br>

Editor's note: No Karnor's stories should be posted. You should never enter the zone for any reason. No if/and/buts. I would estimate at least half the people in KC are complete idiots, and if we allowed KC posts there would be hundreds matching the infamous Willonas/Cuntcaster threads. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/urequiskrist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RequisKrist</A> at: 6/15/02 7:31:16 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/uzorach.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zorach</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#333333>(6/15/02 10:25 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Badoink</span><hr size=1> Ya know, I used to enjoy grouping with him, but I was in KC the day this guy posted about Badoink doing all that, and stepping aside and stating just facts, yes it happened just like he said.  I'm not gunna debate how to play the shaman class, or anything else, but I will back up the facts and yes, Badoink did intentionally train people in KC that day, i surmise he was angry with them, of course I wasn't in that group, nor was I in tells with them, but I saw the results, even tried to intercept mobs and bring them to the right hand side, till it got too much for me, and had to zone out myself. <p><p align="center">[57 Knight] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=105849" target="_blank">Zorach</a>

<br>
This is beside the point also, but GET USED TO IT!<br>
<br>
Shaman need to canni to keep up with slows and other buffs. You will spend way more mana healing tanks from an unslowed mob than a slowed one. Use some of the sved mana to heal the shaman. If the shaman canni past 40%, well then he takes that risk.<br>
<br>
As far as the swearing and childlike behavior, Badoink sounds pretty bad. <br>

I have told her about what son/cousin has been doing while using her account... and she said she will change passwords. I too have dealt with this shammy... put them both in a group not knowing that Dymonds and Badionk was the same until I tried talking to Dymonds and found out it was not the person I KNOW. And I know Baboink was Cann when he didnt even use mana I was the one slowing/healing and buffing... so I know he was not using mana. I will tell Dymonds of the blacklist so she can straighten this all out. Blacklist Badionk but not Dymonds...

I grouped with Badoink once.<br>
Icky<br>
I asked why they were using Cann. as we had been waiting for a long time in KC when it was over camped.... no spawns to kill... Me being the healer for the group, and a druid, and still full mana, i was curious... the reply was &quot;to get mana&quot;<br>
A moment later the puller asked  &quot;Mana&quot;  Badoink replied  &quot;FM&quot;   ... and kept casting Cann.  A few moments go by and I got curious, so I asked   &quot;why do you use Cann when you are at full mana?&quot;   Badoink's reply was not very polite.  =(<br>
I dont group with Badoink any more.  <p><center><a href="http://www.geocities.com/kewiannlime/index.html"><img src="http://www.geocities.com/kewiannlime/images/kewi.txt" border="0"></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ulabbie54.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Labbie54</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00bie</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(8/22/02 9:09 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Badoink</span><hr size=1> Hehe I've never played a shammy so I know nothing about cannibalize <p><p>  <select name="select" size="1" style="font size="9"">
