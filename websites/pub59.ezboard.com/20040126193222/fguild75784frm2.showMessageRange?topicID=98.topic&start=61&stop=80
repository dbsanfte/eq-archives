<br>
Look around, whos being idioits with intentional trains, insults, racisal &amp; foul languages etc etc right now??<br>
<br>
Zapo said well on above posts, majority of this boards don't trust us and treating us as KS bitchs, but in otherside we still have many of friends who trust us and supports. <br>
<br>
I am not here to persuade you guys at all since I wasn't online when rage incident did happen, and ofcourse I don't think most of poeple who flaming us right now wasn there either.<br>
I am here to protect our low level casucal players from insults, trains, foul languages, and racial issues.<br>
<br>
Don't buff, do'nt group blah blah blah stuffs thats what boycott is about right??  But like I said above some morons who knows shit uses foul languages, racial issues, trains etc etc to express their feeling on our LOWBIES (Yes we have low level players.) will never accepted in any situation. <br>

I wont tolerate that in my guild and I expect most guilds who post to this board wont either.  Anyone caught doing that from my guild will get one warning only then booted if it happens again.  And they can bet they wont get an offer to be an officer.<br>
<br>
And I do feel sorry for those people in Arirang that do not participate in any bad behavior because now people will always wonder how they are going to act.<br>
<br>
It might help if Arirang gave back to the server to mend some of these bad feelings.  Perhaps set up a Buff and Aid station on a given weekend.  There is nothing like helping others to mend bad feelings.<br>

I don't think this board is the whole server, but I HAVE been on this server for 3 years, and I have seen how Arirang acts, and I know LOTS of people, and 99% of them DISLIKE Arirang and it's actions.  This latest item is the final straw in my book, so I went public.  I have made no slurs, done no name calling, nor do I do trains on ANY Arirang member, I just say what I feel.  If you don't like it, change your guild's actions, or deal with it.  I have heard, and followed, the advice before not to judge anyone based on the actions of a guild, but Arirang has pushed me beyond my limits for that one.  Hananoken, you were brave to come here and post about this, but don't expect me to become an Arirang cheerleader because you posted here.<br>
<br>
You are the one using foul language, and indirectly accusing me of stuff I would take no part in.  I have cussed no one, trained no one, nor have I done anything to anyone.  I don't like Arirang's actions, I don't like their atitudes, and I think anyone who stays in Arirang is condoning them, therefore I will no longer help nor hinder any Arirang member in any way.  If you catch me training, abusing, or in any way harming an Arirang member, anytime, anywhere, I will resign my character and my position and leave EQ.  I can say that because I don't do those kind of things.  Otherwise, leave me alone and I will leave you alone.  THAT is the position I am pursuing, and urging others to pursue.  In my guild, if someone is caught acting in any way like you have said folks are acting, we will investigate, and disband if found to be true, Arirang or not.  We do NOT condone those kinds of activities, nor do we condone our members KSing anyone.  <br>
<br>
I do not speak for our guild on the subject of boycotting Arirang, only Kolena, our guild leader can, but I can speak for myself, and urge others to follow my lead. <p>Kharne Bloodyhand<BR>

Neither towards Arirang or anyone else, as it has always been.<br>
<br>
Anyone caught doing it wont get a trial. <br>
PA will not lower itself 1 inch. <br>
<br>
I hope Arirang feels another item was worth this, and that you make good use of another clickstick.<br>
<br>
I still believe that talk solves more than fists. <br>
<br>
Trying to be the least objective in the matter you can see from Aris own logg its not clear on the matter.<br>
Problem for Arirang is there was friends from atleast 6-7 other guilds in zone who witnessed this act. Its not slander or flames who brings you bad rep, its the knowledge from so many who was at scene to help PA get RF that you did not hold back and give the correct people full chance of their kill.<br>
<br>
I went as far as to say it might have been a mistake from Arirangs side. <br>
But by not even acknowledge the possibility of making an mistake is only driving you further into the mud.<br>
<br>
Our log, wich shows the GU from Arirang is not a copy of yours, but since we had some supporters from Arirang talking in both GU and tells, we will not release it since that only get friends in trouble. It would not help us anyway, Helenithia has given verdict.<br>

All the list does is give small guilds like drunken fishermen who can field mnaybe 5 55+ people assurance that they will get help because the person behiond them wants their epic so of course he is going to help them VI didnt intend for the RF camp to be some touchy feely love fest[/Q]<br>
<br>
[Q]Pkson:  well... again here... the waiting List of RF still unfair.. Shall we list up all mob camp sit and makeing a BOOk of list so let all ppl know u are FRIENDLY waiting for it.. -_-... Hello! this is a game for competitions.. if few ppl set up a group to decide how to distribut mob for fair issue.. that's against the game rule.. all I can say is .. yes! Sorry for kill the mob maybe we take a little advantage ..and a bit rude to the one who waiting for it long time .. but we don’t need to obey the List-bullshit that other players made.. u can sit at camp side asking if it’s camped . u can wait.. but u cant make a list for it and claim u camped it .. what a lazy idea to doing such take advantage from other players… so u got who is wrong in the first place?? And stop using like “ but never forget “.. mob will spawn again.. and its still FFA.. cuase we all payed for this in MONEY!![/q]<br>
<br>
These are quoted from the Arirang web site.  It strikes me odd they have determined what Verant's intentions are.  What if this game was nothing about loot and money?  Competition for what exactly?  I mean what value are these things really?  Absolutely can't be taken from the game.  So what are you gaining by playing the game?  <br>
<br>
Could you possibly be gaining the ability to work together as a community?  Now that is something you can certainly take away from the game and it will serve you well throughout a lifetime.  Could it be learning to respect others?  Definitely something you can benefit from outside the game.<br>
<br>
Pixels are only damaging your eyes.  So if these pixels mean nothing...what is left?<br>
<br>
Personally...I think EQ is one big Touchy Feely Love Fest /Grin<br>

Ragefire KSed.</span><hr size=1> Well I think it is appearent, once again, the GM's of EQ have chosen the road with least resistance over the road less traveled.<br>
<br>
I would like to make one thing clear, doing things the right way, and doing the right thing, are two VERY distinct things.  VI is great at upholding their policies, the GM's give up the most human thing of common sense and inference to uphold their policies, which are nothing more than idle threats and false hopes for the victims of other players who feel that somehow they can compensate for their inferiorities on an online game.  <br>
<br>
I think every civil person in eq has logged on to boards swamped by anon posters screaming how strong is right, blah blah blah, and we all can't help but wonder if they are compensating for their RL's where they can't get anything accomplished, they are the weak of the weak....this isn't meant as an insult, but rather an explanation for why some guild would even consider this-i stand corrected, why some people in a guild would consider a KS attempt.    <br>
<br>
I think that is something that should be made PERFECTLY clear, I am a PA member, and there were arirang members who told everyone to back off.  These people should not be blamed for the rest of their actions, however, by staying in the guild and by supporting them, you are condoning their actions, and by doing so you become as guilty, and deserving of the decreased reputation of Arirang.<br>
<br>
As for the GM's, by doing nothing, they too are condoning the actions, the rules placed by VI are pointless, its the players rule of curtosy that we, as players, value the most.  Arirang has broke both sets of rules, ours and theirs.  For that Arirang will always be viewed as weak....No matter what they do, accomplish, or succeed in-the players on our server will forever see Arirang as a guild of weak souled individuals.  <br>
<br>
I personally won't have anything to do with Arirang, not because they screwed a friend of mine, or a new found friend (the number 2 cleric) but because they screwed over the player code, the list (although i don't think is efficient, it is civil and at least something to deal with the bottleneck VI created for us), and every other person out there that will ever think of camping any spawn.<br>
<br>
Erkild has killed Rage, he will have his click stick, but i can't help but feel for the next cleric that will camp there for 2 weeks straight, the hours their friends and family will give them in support, and then when the day comes, some bunch of ego maniacs comes along and crushes that....Something must be done....<br>
<br>
Unfortunatly, what can be done?  Join guilds that are bigger and stronger than Arirang?  Maybe this is a precedent for Ascent to walk all over Arirang, cause frankly they CAN do it, there is nothing Arirang can do that Ascent can't in their sleep.  But this won't solve the problem, does that mean we are to fear ascent? or better yet, is it right for Arirang to fear Ascent?<br>
<br>
My suggestion, or at least what i'll be doing, is petitioning the GM, daily if need be, to be elevated to Helen, to say i'm discontented with the policy of VI...she will respond &quot;there is nothing i can do&quot; and i'll respond &quot; talk to you tomorrow&quot;.  <br>
<br>
They work for us, we pay countless money to play a game, in which the guides, gm's and administrators feel they have the power to do what they want, they don't understand that they will be on the street if we didn't play....I think its time that we, as players, for the first time in 3 years, stop bitching on the boards, and flood them with complaints....it is our right as consumers, and if this will force them to hire more GM's, find more guides, or change policies then its a start.<br>
<br>
Helen has ruled, most will believe it is a cowards way out, but what is done is done....but what about next time?  There is no supporter of Arirang here that can honestly say that when they are camping any mob for any length of time, and someone KSes that they will shrug and say, they were stronger oh well....anyone who does post that should receive zero credit.<br>

Tell them you will stop playing, whatever it takes.  It may take a large group, working together, to leave the game if VI doesn't do anything.  We need to make our voice heard.  This camp is stupid, and it doesn't even fit witht the tempo and feel of most of the other epics. &lt;most, not all I know&gt;  Petition nightly. <p>Kharne Bloodyhand<BR>

Ragefire KSed.</span><hr size=1> One note I'd like to add. I am not sure, but I was under the impression that GMs could not affect or change game content/design (in so far as changing spawn times, etc)  that is the game designers and Verant/Sony. The GMs are simply the police and handymen for Verant/Sony, although they may force spawns, etc under special circumstances, and that they just abide and enforce the rules that VI/Sony place before them.<br>
<br>
Spamming the GMs isn't going to affect change, it'll just clog up thier inbox. However it <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   may</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> prompt them to take the issue up with Verant/Sony to facilitate changes, and if it does then /salute Salo, it would be a job well done and something I'd raise a glass to.<br>
<br>
The people that made the Ragefire the silly camp it is are the programmers, play testers, businessmen and women that (more often than not) don't test the game. That's what Beta Testers, Test Server and such are for. I would agree with the cleric list being a severe bottleneck, but it's a good compromise for the current situation, and it doesn't look like that situation is going to change. Choosing to ignore that is at the risk to your reputation.<br>

If we don't do something, this will continue to happen.  The only way Verant is going to listen is if we have an overwhelming response to this, otherwise we should all shut up about the rage camp because no one is willing to do anything about it.  It is all well and good to whine and cry on these different boards, now do something about it.  Course, I guess it is just easier to whine and cry than do something for a lot of folks... <p>Kharne Bloodyhand<BR>

If you want to say something while you are in game put it under feedback as well as posting on the verant forums and using emails.   <br>
Also we all know there is a lot of hard feelings over this issue with PA and Ariang but it is like everyone is beating a dead dog.  It is done, over with, and the verdict has come in.  Move on, get over it, and take what ever lesson you got from it away with you.   <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=97672">

But neither were 97% of you either.<br>
<br>
Even if they engaged while he was still aggro from the 2 people that were still alive, I seriously doubt 2 people were going to finish him off with him still around the halfway mark on HP, even if PA was res'ing people back in.<br>
<br>
It may not have been the classy thing to do, but saying they outright KSd is nonsence. I've had many good dealings with Arirang, one of my best friends is in that guild and the people I've met have been cool. So stop using them to place your blame and throw the blame where it is deserved (hihi Verant). <p><center>Baroness Elawnah Zhir`Venhiruum<br>
