While a warrior may not be able to do the damage a mage could, a mage cant tank. (anywhere near as effectively)  This is how the game is balanced, no class can do everything.  Yet every class has something they can contribute.  If soloing is your goal then you should play a class that is more suited to that.  If melee is your preference then try a ranger or a shadowknight.  They both have a good combination of spells that allow them to solo fairly safely, without high end gear.  Of course in doing so you wont be as good a tank as a warrior, but that is the trade off for the ability to solo.  <p><FONT COLOR="green" FACE="forte" size="6point" >Myles Bonaduce</FONT> <P>

<br>
The essence of his argument was that warriors were not as needed as before - people were actually taking paladins/sk as secondary tanks in grind groups over warriors.  What he failed to realize is this is balance - you will take one class over another.  You no longer need the &quot;holy trinity&quot; other classes can substitute.   In his mind it was better when you wanted 2 warriors, cleric, enchanter, and a rogue in a group and filled in the last position with anyone else.<br>
<br>
This sounds much the same.  In a grind group you will still want a couple of tanks (unless AE) but with class balancing other classes may be invited to play.  <br>
<br>
I don't know how many times I have been in an xp group needing another person and mages/druids/wizards/necro's pop up LFG and the party does not want them.  So now these classes are getting upgraded - good.  I hope that more balancing comes about.  <br>
<br>
And you will always have people who complain - no matter what VI does.   Everyone is entitled to an opinion but to say VI does not listen - how can they listen to everyone when everyone has a different opinion?  So if they (VI) disagree they don't understand balance and they don't listen.<br>

<br>
First, I soloed my way from level 1 to 60 becuase no one ever wanted to group with me, ever. As soon as I got my epic, I have found that people alway want me for groups when I could easily solo instead lol.<br>
<br>
Second, grouping with a 60 epic mage is different then what you are use to in a normal grind group.  Ussually in a normal grind group we have grown up on in Everquest, you will try for some kind of slower to minumize the damage being taken by the Tanks in the group, this is not as needed when you have a 60 mage in the group that can throw out a 33pt group DS for the tanks and a 50pt DS on an epic pet. Someone commented that grind mobs are a joke and I do agree completely with that statement.  For me there is no reason to bother slowing these mobs when you can have them destroy themselves on a nasty DS. <br>
<br>
I have watched the epic pet outdamage many combos of 60 melee like a warrior and rogue or 2 monks.  I do have a pretty good comparison in that I played a monk to 58 with epic before switching to a Mage. The Damage Per Second that a mage can product when needed is amazing.  I think Eldryc did a good job of fielding comments in this area because it is one of those things you have to see to believe. How I normally keep up with the fast pace pulling where the mage pet is alway taking one or more adds is I am lucky enough to have several Flowing Thoughts item, the 58 mana regen spell, and have many 60 chanter fiends to supply KEI. Also since my brother plays a 60 cleric, it is possible to use mod rods to fill our mana bars close to full if KEI is not availible. Of coarse having a 60 cleric healing the epic pet is also very helpful <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
A lot has been said about how hard the mage epic is compared to other epics.  I have played Everquest for over 2 1/2 years now and made many friends on our server.  I found the mage epic to be easy with the help of friends.  <br>
I didn't start the epic until level 53 when one of my friends who farms hate found Magis up with the staff.  Once I got that piece, most of the rest fell into place in a couple days.  I MQed the Peggy Cloak, Undertoe, and CoM torch with RL friends and bought the phinny staff and sky crown.  The two I bought were very expensive, but I had a lot of money from alway soloing.  <br>
<br>
Finally, I would like to address some of the things people said about multiple mobs and mages taking hits.  I am at almost 1800hps with my Arch Shielding self buff. Since I picked an erudite I wear gear that gives me Hps and Mana where i can.  When I group with my brother (which is about 97% of the time) I will have aego which puts me over 3k hps.  So when I need to take a hit, i can.  <br>
When someone pulled more the one mob, I will do the following: if the mobs are seperated by poor pathing I will simply have the pet &quot;pick off&quot; the trailing mob.  If they are grouped tightly together I will try to find the one the Target the one the tank is not on and hit it with Scars of Sigil which is a very fast casting relatively low damage spell that will almost alway instantly peel the mob off the melee and on to me.  Once the mob has hit me or tried too the epic pet will get mad and attack. Epic pet almost alway leads in with a stun, whether it hits or not the mob is alway very mad at the epic pet and has completely forgot about me.  <br>
<br>
Overall, I would just say that mages are a wonderful class and if you get the chance grab a mage in your group and see what you have been missing.<br>

First of all, I think some plp missed the whole point of Callon's rant which was that his class is essentially useless now in both grind groups and in some cases, raids.  A little while back we discovered that some of the high end guilds were using monks to tank b/c they have the block skill and therefore took less damage then a war.  Less hit points? not with TOV gear.  Less AC? Same, not with TOV gear.  Yeah well warriors have defensive........ ever heard of stonestance?  Throw in the triple attack and damn.  Granted people still use warriors most of the time but just the fact of this would have pissed me off too being a warrior, because that was essentially all they were good for, raids.  <br>
<br>
In grind groups, the mage epic pet litterally kicks the shiit out of melee in time it takes to kill mobs.  We fought at toiler hill in ME one night with me (60 cleric), callon (60 War), Tiyra (59 Mage, at the time) and a 59 Monk w/epic.  Each person was basically single pulling and on average the mage pet was killing stuff about twice as fast as callon and the monk usually had his next mob at about 75% health by the time the one callon was on dropped.  Throw in the fact that I casted one Celetial elixer (1500 hp) on the pet for BOTH mobs and could either cast 2 or 3 on callon or 1 ce and a CH, thats just insane.<br>
<br>
Couple things plp might not know or just failed to realize.  In grind groups, Epic pets have a minimum hit of 22 damage and a max of 81.  Warriors minimum hit...... 1.  Now granted a warrior can crit for a lot more then that, but your talking about a pet that can hit no lower then 22 and seriously doesnt miss much compared to most melee (I have a ranger so I know how much melee miss).  Throw in that they can quad hit too, procs a 130 ish DD that goes off ever other minutes (the spam is sick if you dont turn it off) and a 80 point stun that lasts for 6 seconds.  Oh yeah, and that 50pt damage shield everytime the mob hits them, or 65 if I cast mark of retribution.  The fact alone that their minimum damgae is so high and they dont miss much explains so much why the pet just kicks the shiit out of stuff.  Another point, what happens if the pet dies?  Well if the mage is well prepared and has resummoned the epic at some point, a brand new ass kicking pet in 20 seconds.  Some people dont zone that fast after dying =P.  <br>
<br>
Should we care? To be perfectly honest, I am reaping the benefits b/c me and him can duo and get insane exp with little drain on my mana bar, hell I nuke once a battle most of the time.  The thing that sucks though is that in grind situations this pet can absolutly destroy mobs that other melee have trouble with.  I think Myles (hey buddy) brought up the point about the pets not being able to think, taunt or break mez etc...  I have seen numours times in group where my brother has broke a mez with a Scars of Sigil, had the mob agro on him and was able to step away seconds later after barely taking any damage.  The stun the pet procs is a uber taunt, things generally dont come off the pet once that stun lands.  When duoing I can chain cast CH on the pet with three mobs on it if I wanted to and get little if no agro b/c they dont have the coding in place for that from what I can tell.  Any other melee that has three mobs and after a remedy I'll be running around getting my ass kicked, let along a CH.  <br>
<br>
I think what finally blew Callon over the top was the fact that they improved the pets more recently.  The pet was kick ass before, its didnt need more power.  I have seen a group of mages do some sick shiit.  A little while ago, some of the mages on the server gathered together and camped epic stuff together.  I saw 6 mage pets taking out mobs left and right, if one died, SEND IN ANOTHER, WOOT!!!!!.   The mage epic is long,but to say it is the hardest is just wrong.  Sure it as a lot of little annoying shiit to camp, but what epic doesnt?  Throw in the fact that they can generally easily solo the mobs they need to camp minus the one hard part of each of the 4 orbs and its really not all that hard.  I mean hell, the crown from the POA is DROPPABLE, come on now.  Sure you need a decent amount of money to MQ a lot of the pieces, but like my brother said they can make a lot of money soloing stuff.  <br>
<br>
I leveled mostly by pick up groups till I hit about lvl 56.  I went back and thought about the number of times that I grouped with mages and couldnt think of very many.  I would venture to say that the number is probably around 10 times in 56 levels, I always remember my groups being cleric/enc + melee with the occasional druid thrown in.  I think being creatures of habit, most of us are not used to grouping with mages for really no good reason.  The point that mages suck in groups is utter BS because they can blast hard and the pets do nice damage even before the epic.  Granted, mages are generally a solo type class and most plp know that going into them, but anyone that wont take a mage in thier group when they needed damage is just dumb IMO especially if they have their epic.  I have more I could write, but I think that is way more then enough for now.  Off to go get some insane exp with my brother.........<br>

Nope, did not miss it but I would refute it.  How many mages are there with epic pets?<br>
<br>
As far as a warrior being useless in a grind group - I doubt useless is right - how about not needed over as much over other classes anymore?  <br>
<br>
I count a total of 14 classes (may have missed one or 2).  Why should 1 class be needed in every grind group?  Heck I have seen plenty of grind groups that &quot;had&quot; to have a cleric, chanter, and a warrior - passing on bards, druids, and sk/paladins - mages, wizard, necro never even getting considered.<br>

Yes, I'm mainly talking about exp groups, but that's a big portion of the game for most people.  I believe it's very signficant that a particular class is so dominant in exp groups and can gain levels so quickly.  I'm fortunate enough to reap the benefits of being grouped with such a mage so I'm probably insane to complain about it, but it's still very frustrating seeing how insignificant your main character's contribution is.  In a number of situations it is probably helpful to have 1 player tank to help control mob placement, pull, etc.  It's quicker for the mage to solo/duo, but assuming we're talking about a larger group, yeah, having a player tank is useful.  But you just want 1.  It doesn't have to be a warrior by any means and there's little use for having more than 1.  The mage will handle the add, or a couple adds.  Wherever did the idea come from that 2 mobs = dead mage anyway?  Even solo against a lot of exp mobs, I just don't think that's true at all.  The epic pet can very easily tank 2.  Even the regular pet could tank two for awhile, likely long enough for the mage to burn down the first mob it's beating on even without overnuking and pulling aggro, thus reducing it to 1 on 1 fairly quickly.  but anyway, that's getting pretty sidetracked...<br>
<br>
&quot;Heck I have seen plenty of grind<br>
                     groups that &quot;had&quot; to have a cleric, chanter, and a warrior - passing on<br>
                     bards, druids, and sk/paladins - mages, wizard, necro never even getting<br>
                     considered.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't know how else to put this... those groups are stupid, very very stupid.  If you want fast exp and you're passing up high level mages for your group, then you're being stupid.  Well, maybe ignorant is a better term since a lot of people just don't realize what crazy damage they can kick out.  <br>

I'm not going to argue that warriors bring less to a group now then they once did.  Hell, most of the time when I grind it's with a ranger and rogue in the group, replace either of them with a warrior and I watch the xp slow considerably.  And there are very few times the warriors extra AC makes a difference over the rangers.<br>
<br>
Arguing that mages are overpowered though, I still have to disagree with.  Even going through your own routine.  You're using buffs from your brother and enchanter friends.  And your gear sounds on the above average side.  Would say that you're an exception more then a rule.<br>

Instead of complaining about the powers another class has.  Maybe you should be working with others of your class to get it upgraded.

<br>
Nowhere did I say or even hint that someone didn't know how to play thier class.  And I'm sorry to disagree, but the very foundation of this thread is about someone who singled out mages as being overpowered.  Thus in need of a nerf.  As it's developed it's been shown pretty clearly it's not so much the mage that's over powered but rather the warrior that is underpowered.  That is not a comment based on the ability of the player but about the available skills of any warrior.  It was my personal suggestion that his time would be better spent lobbying to have his class improved rather then having another nerfed.<br>

Monks are *suppost* to do more damage than a Warrior. Just like Rangers, they lack ac and hp to make up for that. That's also why they get the skills like Block and whatnot (In the case of Rangers, Jolt). They can't take the aggro.<br>

actually that's not true in a grind group anymore, Elawnah.  Because of the AC softcap and several other reasons, other classes will tank just as well as a warrior.  Basically several classes are close enough to equal now in tanking ability that in a grind group it doesn't matter.  Go with the one that does the most damage (monk most likely) or one that supplies other utility that you need.  But that's a different discussion.  <br>
<br>
Here's the simplest scenario since it is in essence what my grind groups can get the majority of fights down to.  Yes, it's oversimplified, but it represents well what we go for on exp grinds and we can set up this type of 1 on 1 in most situations --<br>
<br>
Take a 60 warrior with decent gear, not uber guild stuff, just solid gear.  Hell, give him 200k for it.  I have 200k+ in gear and that's not counting much value for several pieces, including the bp and legs, which are no drop.  don't worry about how much the mage has in gear.  It doesn't matter.  They need an epic so assume much of their plat went toward buying MQ's or something.  The rest of it can be mediocre gear.  Figure, i don't know, 100k total for some mediocre gear and a bunch of MQ's to help get the epic.  anyway, that's too much detail for a simple test, so moving on...<br>
<br>
Now make an epic mage pet.  Use the water one.  It does great dmg.  Any of them will probably work though.  Throw on the buffs.  Assume you've got nice buffs (DS, haste, aego, etc. etc.).  Have a cleric ready to heal.  Bring in the average blue con grind group mob.  Bring one mob for the pet and one for the warrior.  If a mob dies, assume that it's very quickly replaced by another mob.  Now pay attention while they fight for a few minutes.  I guarantee you that the mage pet will kill it's mobs faster.  It's not close.  Okay, fine, I can deal with that if the old thought that pets are good dmg dealers but not good dmg takers applies.  It doesn't.  That warrior will require far more healing than the pet does.  I don't know entirely why that is.  The pet does have 30hp per tick extra regen, but that's only 300 per minute.  The warrior is going to be at the AC softcap for grind mobs.  But for whatever reason, but pet will not need near the healing that the warrior does.  That's the bottom line... better dmg but also better tanking.  Now how that's even a little balanced,  I have no idea.  If it does better damage, it should NOT take damage as well.  Period.<br>
<br>
-- Callon<br>
<br>
p.s. upgrade the mob quality a bit with some of our recent fights... the epic pet tanked Deep (part of the monk epic fight in LOIO) and did so easily.  A player tank would almost certainly have needed more heals than the epic pet did.  I'm not sure what else our friendly neighborhood mage has tanked with the pet that's a bit stronger than the average grind mob.<br>

this comment was to revnick, but anyway... what we've seen by grinding together and by the two of them going without me is eye opening.  Also keep in mind that if he's benefitting from cleric buffs, then so am I when i'm there.  But then we've virtually always had clerics in our grind groups and often chanters.  The mage's dmg drops off a bit without c3 up, but it's not a huge amount by any means.  We've spent quite a bit of time grinding after c3 dropped or was dispelled.  And if there's no chanter to c3 the mage and cleric, then there's also no chanter to haste me.  That's actually worse.  The mage destroys us meleers by even more if we don't have chanter haste, even if it means he lacks c3.  So... point is you can't dismiss the issue by claiming this case is an exception.  The gear for everyone is pretty solid, but not totally uber.  It also doesn't make a big difference in a mage'd damage output.<br>

I haven't argued warriors are underpowered these days.  I even said myself in my own grind groups I prefer a ranger and a rogue over a warrior.  What I don't get is why you're still so focused on a mage.  Rangers, monks, rogues.  All can consistanly outdamage a warrior as well.  Hell, at the risk of being offensive (and I don't intend to be) a lot of classes can outdamage a warrior.  Instead of focusing on one whom you apparently feel is stronger then the rest (whether people agree or not is irrelevent) why not focus your opinion on your classes weaknesses on VI.  <br>
<br>

<br>
We will all have different opinions - depending mostly on which classes we play the most or are more familiar with.  <br>
<br>
My first character and the one I enjoy the most is my Paladin.  That being said - I do enjoy the fact that I can get in groups in place of warriors now.  Do you have any idea how frustrating it is to not get in a grind group because you are not a &quot;tank&quot;.  Up until February I was still hearing this a lot.  Thats when I stopped trying and turned to smithing for my gaming enjoyment.<br>
<br>
I personally think verant is doing a fantastic job of balancing (again its all from your perspective).  From the hybrid upgrades to the removal of the 10% healing penalty for non-clerics.  That being said - they are not finished.  There will be more tweaks to casters (which does affect hybrids) and bards are being left for last.  <br>
<br>
It would not bother me would be to see the epic pet downgraded slightly (non-mage here) - then again the epic pet as is does not bother me either.  I will ask again - what percentage of 55+ mages have epics?  I really don't know.  <br>
<br>
Ignoring epic-pets.<br>
<br>
Monks and rougues should outdamage warriors - but neither should come close to taking the damage of a warrior.  IMHO, paladins and sk should come close (but not exceed) to taking a beating like a warrior but do no-where near the damage.  This allows &quot;grind&quot; groups to be viable with various classes.  I guess I am still sensitive to the fact that hybrids are or were unwanted classes in grind groups.  I was shocked a couple of weeks ago when a cleric I know (through a server chat channel) said they would never take a paladin or SK as a MT in a grind group because they were mana sponges.  I thought people had gotten over that. <br>

But lately people have wanted to play mages again, mostly because of the upgrades. And this also affects the number of mage epics which enter the game.<br>
<br>
Anyway, there will always be a place for warriors. The feeling that you need a warrior to tank for you in most places is so in-grown that it is hard to change. Just as the feeling that mages/wizards/necros and others don't add much to a grind group. Of course there will be some who see things differently, but there will always be a lot of people who don't. <p><html>
