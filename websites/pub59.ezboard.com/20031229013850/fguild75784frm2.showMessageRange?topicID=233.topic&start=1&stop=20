<br>
For someone who is currently stuyding to become a physician, I found these &quot;addictive qualities&quot; facinating.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/10/17/48hours/main525965.shtml">www.cbsnews.com/stories/2...5965.shtml</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
The unfortunate suicide of  Shawn Woolley last year was also featured, although I don't think EQ was entirely to blame.<br>
<br>
Liz Woolley (Shawn's mother) did make a very interesting observation I'd like to point out.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> by design. “I think the way the game is written is that when you first start playing it, it is fun, and you make great accomplishments. And then the further you get into it, the higher level you get, the longer you have to stay on it to move onward<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
My family and friends still can't believe I spent 55+ hours of my real life to &quot;camp&quot; Rage Fire in SolB last year for my epic (big hugs to everyone who helped me with that!). <br>
<br>
One year later, upon reflection, it does sound pretty fugged up.   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Bottom line, EQ is &quot;just&quot; a computer game.  However, we all know the power of &quot;Evercrack&quot;.  When the game begins to interfere with one's daily &quot;routine&quot;: school, work, family and friends, and becomes a &quot;way of life&quot;, obviously an &quot;addiction&quot; of sorts has manifested itself. <br>
<br>
Just as with other sorts of recreational activites, alchohol, drugs, sex etc  &quot;too much of a good thing can harm you&quot;... well maybe not sex  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Seriously though..we are all adults (well most of us) and I'm confident that most players know their limits and keep a healthy balance of EQ and RL.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately 48hrs portrayed EQ as this evil PC game. It is a pity they (CBS) couldn't have focused more on the positives of EQ such as the strong online friendships formed through cooperation, teamwork and working towards a common goal.<br>
<br>
Hmm think I'll go log in now  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I thought the most interesting tidbit was where the mom knew the kid had some bad wiring, (If you'll pardon the layman's terms), had him diagnosed, and still thinks its the game's fault he shot himself.

Hence, no &quot;child&quot; tragically died. It was a consenting adult that was at worst, slightly mentally deprived. If you classify EQ as an addiction, then it's a very safe one, if you take CBS's stance that it's a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  dangerous</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> addiction, then it's a much safer addiction than cigarette smoking or alcoholism.<br>
<br>
As far as investigative reporting goes, that was an atrocious example of what it is. That piece struck me as shallow, hardly researched and was very... imcomplete. She failed to ask <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  why</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the game is addictive. The interaction with other &quot;living, breathing&quot; people.<br>
<br>
All in all, it was so badly done that it was more of a joke than a serious piece of journalism. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><center><img src=http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Gandel/fullsize/dancinpanda.gif>

It is hard for us as players to watch something that most of us do ourselves.  I find it sad that he plays the game that much when he has a family growing up around him.  The guild I was helping to run recently disbanded and we had always been very close to each other.  We talked a lot about relationships on a thread on our messaged board about being lonely and generally bitching about women.  Well, after the guild folding three guys have posted having dates and actually going out and talking to women more.  I know thats not hugh, but I take it as a good thing b/c they are encounters that most likely would not have happened.  I think a lot of people use the game as a subconcious excuse to not do stuff in real life.  Now the piece they showed first was a little to the extreme, but from the number of people I have got to know on the game, it happens a lot.<br>
<br>
As far as the piece on the guy who killed himself, they protrayed that whole thing for something it wasnt.  From what I got from the piece, he fell in love with someone in EQ and probably found out it was a man in RL or that she was married and went into depression.  Now, if you have a child that is pretty well adjusted and is living in a kept up apartment and all of a sudden he stops cleaning up and letting you in, wouldnt you do something about it?  Especially since the kid had a mental handicap that he already had to deal with.  <br>
<br>
Overall I think the segment was good in the aspect of showing how addictive the game can be, but I think it lost me by trying to portray the game as being evil.  The interview she did with the creator was the best if you ask me b/c he said exactly how it was. <p><p align="center"><b><font size="2">Revnick Lifeweaver</font></b><font size="2">

BUT...<br>
A &quot;softball&quot; piece on a relatively unimportant topic... NOT 48 hours?!?  Say it ain't so.  Bah.  Investigative journalism?  Give me a break.  You're looking in the wrong place for it.  <br>
EQ is only a demon because some guy shot himself in front of a computer monitor (my condolences), Ben Stein's kid was &quot;addicted&quot;, and the parent company is Sony.  Of course, the tag line in that last piece was that Mom (Liz) is considering suing Sony..... duh.  If people could take some responsibility for their own actions in this country, we could all take a break from this kind of crap.  Then again, I'll be skiing in hell before that happens.

Anyway, from what I am hearing they didn't ask the most important questions:<br>
<br>
Define addiction.<br>
Is EQ addictive. (We know the answer)<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
What hobbies are on par with EQ?<br>
What personality type is most prone to EQ addiction?<br>
<br>
Probably a dozen other questions I could come up with if I cared...<br>

People seem so quick to blame a game.  Sure the game had become an important part of his life, but he was out of balance.  I feel sorry for the guy... he needed some help and didn't get it.  His mother didn't pick up on the signs enough to help him, and rather than feeling any guilt, its much easier to blame it entirely on the game, which she is doing.  I'm sorry for her loss, but lashing out at a game isn't the answer.<br>
<br>
Sadly, many people ARE addicted to EQ in an unhealthy way.  In those situations, their loved ones should help them to cut back...to find other things in their life that can give them happiness.  Trying to sue Sony, or going on tv to @#%$ about it isn't the answer...thats not going to save your loved one.  The one good message out of the program (at least the bits I saw), was the wake up call for people to recognize if someone they love is depressed and addicted.  But portraying the game as evil is entirely too one-sided.  There are many many players out there that enjoy the rest of their life just as much.  Don't we deserve some credit?   <p><SPAN STYLE="position:relative; width:200; height:15; filter:glow(color=#c11b17,strength=2)">

 So whats the problem? I guess like anything in life there are always those that take it to the extream and the rest of us get to &quot;suffer&quot; for it. In this case EQ and those that play it are the ones who are now the addicts and evil ones?<br>
 I think not.<br>

Yeah they didn't really delve into the whole subject of him already having problems (they just mentioned he had problems that's it) but from before you can sure find that it wasn't Everquest that had ruined his life or anything.

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Compulsive physiological and psychological need for a habit-forming substance.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If someone drinks 3 beers a night, would you consider him/her an alcoholic? Take Homer Simpson for example, he goes to the bar with friends and drinks close to every night. Would you consider him a alcoholic? Most people would. Exchange alcohol with Everquest. Most players log in every night and play for 2 hours or more.  To some people EQ is something they need and must have. It can be many things from depression, lack of friends, etc that makes you need to log into EQ night after night. Because in EQ you are popular, you have a lot of friends, people depend on you, and so on.<br>
<br>
Bad day at work? Nothing a little EQ can solve. Your wife left you?…. and so on<br>
<br>

I find it comical that of everything happening in the world, 48 hours felt it necessary to point of the evils of a computer game! <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I personally felt it was necessary to point out. EQ is ruining peoples lives right and left, and they don't even realize it because they are so far gone into EQ. How many people in EQ do you know that have gotten a divorce because of the game? How many people in EQ do you know that has lost their job because of EQ, etc?  And after that happens their addiction just gets worse. <br>
NOTE: Caeadarie, I’m not flaming you, I just decided to use your reply as a quote, nothing personal. =-)<br>
<br>
I have two RL friends that play EQ, my first fiend has tried to quit over and over, lately he quit for 3 months and I thought he was done with EQ. He started playing again a week ago.... My other friend couldn't go more than 2 weeks without logging in.<br>
<br>
I quit EQ about 7 months ago, and if I got the Internet where I lived I can guarantee I would be playing EQ right now. The only way I could kick my habit was to move somewhere else, disconnect my phone and my Internet. And for the first couple of months it was hard... very hard. At one point I ordered Internet service and went out to buy a modem. At the store I just stood there and looked at the modem I was about to buy going over everything... It took all of my strength to force myself to walk out of that store and not go back.<br>
<br>
Seven months later I only have a very slight desire to log in. But I won't lie, there is still a very small desire to log back in and see all of my old friends, but I know I can't. But on the other hand I have put my addictive habits on other things, such as video games. But the difference is I may beat Kingdom Hearts in 4 days with a total of 45 hours, but it ended and my life went back to normal... With EQ the game never ended.<br>
<br>
<br>
I know most of you think you don't have a problem, and say to yourself I can quit anytime... try it then, it's not as easy as you think. <br>
<br>
Everquest is a drug, it fills in that hole of your life. Everyone has something they hate about themselves, and for most of us EQ fills in that hole. The same can be said about heroin, alcohol, etc. I know right now your saying that EQ shouldn't be compared to a drug, it's not damaging to you.  Well how much weight have you gained since you started playing? How many nights have you only gotten 4 hours of sleep because you played too long? Most of the problems with EQ are not physical but psychological. <br>
<br>
I saw the 48-hrs show and I liked what John Smeadly said about EQ being a game. That you need the will power to say enough is enough and step back before it becomes more than a game. It is very easy to get addicted to EQ, and before you know it you can't quit and it's a part of your life. I didn't have that will power and EQ controlled my life for a long time, I would stay up late at night, show up late to work the next day, run home after work and play EQ all night. I was very moody and showed pretty much every sign of being an addict.<br>
<br>
But this isn't always the case for everyone. It is very possible to have a very normal life and play EQ. The difference is that person doesn't depend on EQ and doesn't &quot;need&quot; to play EQ. If you depend on EQ, and can't live without it then you are so very addicted. <br>
<br>
Sorry for the long reply. ^_^<br>

<br>
But on the other hand, I know very well that I am one of those people who could live without the game, yet I do play often (mainly because I live in the boondocks :P)....  but because of shows like that, my family and friends who don't play are going to/do think I play an evil drug of a game.  And that is not the case for everyone.  Sure, many people take it way too far for their health, but I just wish the show could have been a little less one-sided. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/emeliaratliff/Jazzsig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

My gripe wasn't with 48 hours calling it an addiction. It was in the sensationalist method of reporting that they chose. They also are choosing to profit and extend their viewer base by exploiting a mother's grief. <br>
<br>
So until 48 hours sets up a help hotline for people addicted to TV during a program where they talk to the mother of someone who killed themselves with the TV on - I can't take them seriously as a news reporter. Hundreds of thousands more people are addicted to TV than are addicted to computer games. Being a news medium should require that you present an objective report... more and more US news isn't doing that from my point of view.  I have been turning to BBC and some other news sources. <br>
<br>
And yeah I have been &quot;addicted&quot; to computer/console games since the early 80s. But I can and do walk away to do outside stuff, as do most people. So I look at it as my choice of how to spend my spare time. <br>
<br>
When I am not on the PC I read a lot, or watch movies, or several other things that would fit into the category of addiction. <br>
<br>
But if someone is mentally retarded, has epilepsy, has been diagnosed with a disorder, shuts out their immediate family, and somehow obtains a gun.... 48hours didn't even point out some of those things like the police did, or other news sources did. The police investigating found no proof that everquest was connected. The only thing that's even close is that was on when they found him and his character was dead ... and hey we should all know that its pretty easy to die if you aren't at the controls in this game. <br>
<br>
So if someone with these problems kills themselves - even if it was proven as game related - that's a reason to condemn or slander a product ? Technically the 21 year old adult was likely using the product in violation of Sony's warning label for epilepsy.  <br>
<br>
I feel real bad that the person killed themselves - whatever the reasons were. But I just don't feel it was justified running a report on the addictive quality of an entertainment product without ALSO pointing out that all entertainment can be addictive - including the medium you are broadcasting the message on... <br>

In this day and age it's very easy to get addicted to many things. The Internet is a good one, many people are addicted to online chat groups, email, forums, etc.  I know I am. ;)  <br>
<br>
The only point I'm trying to make is that Everquest can be a very addictive game to some people. An addiction to EQ isn't necessary a horrible thing...  unless your life starts to flow around EQ. Then that addiction has the potential to destroy your life, family, and friends. But the same can be said for any addiction, and people can get addicted to pretty much anything these days: TV, Video Games, Working out, Baseball, Gambling, drugs, etc. So yes I classify EQ as a addictive product, but it's very possible NOT to get addicted. I gamble about once every 3 months, but I don't have to go gambling in Wendover every 3 months. It's something I enjoy occasionally and there is no problem with that.<br>
<br>
I thought the 48 hours broadcast was ok in the sense that they lightly touched on issues. But the only part I really took in was the interview with John Smeadly. The story about Shawn Woolley  was sad, but no I don't think Everquest was to blame.  The mother is looking for someone to blame and she really needs to look in the mirror. She knew her son had a problem but did nothing about it until it was too late. I don't blame video games for kids killing each other; I blame the parents. And that’s all I'm going to say about that. I really hated that part on 48 hours, it was way overboard and extremely stupid.<br>

This isn't a physically addictive product like cigarettes or alchohol or even nicatine. <br>
<br>
So I  feel that the blame for being addicted is in the people not being able to control themselves and their &quot;habit&quot;. <br>
<br>
This happens with many things for sure, but I have to disagree whenever I see people blaming EQ for their marriage or relationships breaking up. That happened because the two people involved couldn't come to a compromise solution. If the husband started going out drinking 3 or 4 nights a week and they weren't able to come up with a way of cutting that back together so they can spend time... it's really the same thing. <br>
<br>
And I feel that those things happen because of people - and blaming a product doesn't help those people FIX their underlying problem. If someone is able to neglect their responsibilities for any addiction, then they have a problem. As the Sony rep said how are we supposed to identify people who might have problems with our entertainment product ? <br>

Very well said...<br>
<br>
&quot;If the husband started going out drinking 3 or 4 nights a week and they weren't able to come up with a way of cutting that back together so they can spend time... it's really the same thing. &quot;<br>
Except that, just like you say, that at least has SOME physical addiction qualities... EQ = None.  <br>
