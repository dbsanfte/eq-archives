I had 2 full groups up on the 7th floor, keeping torches and drakes cleared so I could pull bats.  If Tess popped from the bats, then the adds were already cleared and no worries.<br>
<br>
After about an hour of doing this, in /shout someone asks for a floor check.  I respond in /ooc 7th.  They ask for how long.  I say about three hours.  He stats that the torches are his and a buddy rogue grind spot and that I should share.<br>
<br>
What would you say next?  How do we handle TFS floor camps?<br>
<br>
Thanks for any input. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/uazulezlapdancer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AzulezLapdancer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 206<br> <font color=#333333>(6/5/02 9:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=103.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How does our server handle TFS floors</span><hr size=1> Unfortunatly, as there are 'no' established camps, theres nothing you can really do.<br>
<br>
Even with a third party meditator, they would make you guyz come to an agreement, and most likely share the camp/floor.<br>
<br>
If I was the one already up there tho, and people were trying to move in, I would be sure gain aggro quickly and kill quickly. and move to the next area quickly.<br>
<br>
When the boss mob pops, just be damn sure you are the one with first aggro.  Unfortunatly, theres not much more you can do.<br>
<br>
Good luck with it, I'm sure its frustrating as hell.<br>

But that wasn't the case last night.  They insisted on staying and after numerious times of telling them we are camping the bats to pop Tess, that I would not be responsible if they died.<br>
<br>
I didn't want anyone killed, no did I want anyone to get trained if things went wrong.  It was adding additional responsibility to me for the safety of others, when I wouldn't have to if they would have respected the camp and moved on.<br>
<br>
Anytime I do a camp check, that's what I do most of the time.  And since you mention that their is &quot;no&quot; established camps, why even do a &quot;camp check&quot; or &quot;floor check&quot;?  Is this some sort of double standard?

<br>
Most people ask to save time or effort of getting to a camp spot only to find it camped. <br>
Most people respect &quot;camps&quot;.<br>
<br>
But I guess the play nice policy does not force you to respect camps.<br>
<br>
I guess 90% of the players respect others camp, then there are the few, like in the Ragefire thread, that feel they are the only people playing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/uvulcansmith.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vulcansmith</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#333333>(6/5/02 11:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=103.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How does our server handle TFS floors</span><hr size=1> Well you had 2 full groups...<br>
Thats 12 people to call out various camps right?<br>
<br>
So assign each person in a group a floor and have them ooc the floor on camp check...<br>
<br>
A group doing this can hold the entire bottom level in L Guk... I've seen it done by groups sitting at the scribe room. They keep calling out the camps as people left untill they held the entire damn level!<br>
<br>
Nothing says you can't try this for yourself I guess...<br>
<br>
Just remember too...<br>
Keep a chanter along...<br>
If someone is trying to KS you on a camp...<br>
Have the chanter charm the MOB and they can no longer hit it...Just keep it charmed untill they give up or take it someplace safe to kill it...lol<br>
Just be ready to peel the MOB off the chanter after its released...<br>
<br>
Good luck. <p><p><img src=http://vulcansforge.freeservers.com/Images/VulcanSmith.jpg

Was trying to group in highkeep, and three toons were trying to hog the whole basement. They said since they were there first, they could claim all the camps. In my experience in the past (have levelled 3 characters up in highkeep), people would only take more than one room if nobody else wanted the others (and all I wanted was the Lookout room). These guys were camping GR, and pulling from LR and WR. There was a lvl 45 in rr, soloing, and I was too low for that anyway. To make a long story short, they kept KSing mobs I had already aggroed, until the lvl 45 came up and helped make sure they got no exp from them. Finally, they gave up, but there was only 45 minutes left til the patch, so didn't get much done. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
BTW, their names were Rikath and Rovas (the third was a cleric, who I won't name becuase she stayed out of it, and even healed me a few times), and they used incessant foul language, the entire time. Chased off the poor pally I was grouped with, who only wanted his ghoulbane piece.<br>
<br>
Basically, the bottom line is PNP doesn't respect camps, but the unofficial etiquette is one group, one camp, and in the case of these TOFS guys (the original post), they should have respected your camp. It's a good way to get blacklisted, if you frequently ks someone's mobs, or hog multiple camps.<br>
<br>
My experience with TOFS is that each floor is considered a camp. Poeple usually wait for the group in front of them to move up, or if they have keys, go on to the next floor. <p>Xaanru <br>

<br>
There's not much you can do about it except remember the names.<br>
<br>
Though what I did a few times after people barged in my camp, is stop killing anything and withdraw in a safe spot if I was pretty sure they couldn't hold the camp and were just leeching off my efforts at breaking and holding the camp. It's not really &quot;nice&quot; but it's passive and effective.<br>
