<br>
Someone comes here and disagrees with you. Why do you insist they are terrible? I have seen some pretty bad things said by people that aren't being &quot;voted off&quot; so to speak... but you allow that to remain. (Threatening someone IRL... for example.)<br>
<br>
Just grow up and realize not everyone is going to agree with everything everyone says. It's a part of life you have to learn to deal with. Get over it. &quot;Negitive attitudes&quot; and, god forbid, sarcasm, is a part of everyday life. So don't get so offended when someone shows it. Either 1) ignore them, as Im sure they do to you anyway, or 2) Stand up for yourself.<br>
<br>
Most of the people I see here with &quot;condecending attitudes&quot; post daily. &quot;I hate soandso because they KSd my orc pawn.&quot;, &quot;I don't like uberuildX.&quot;. I hate to be so damn blunt but really, get over it. It's not that big of a deal to begin with. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ufalconlore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Falconlore</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dragon Fodder</span><br>  Posts: 152<br> <font color=#333333>(6/26/02 12:01:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=81.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vote him off the Island!</span><hr size=1> Elawnah we don't mind sarcasm or people expressing opinions but he has used way to much foul language, which is why so many of his posts have been deleted,  and all he ever does is ridicule the board and the people who use it.

You are always very negative, snide, and condescending.  You tell others to grow up, maybe you should look at yourself.  I don't necessarily support what is being said here, but the stuff you have to say always makes it worse.  It is NOT the fact that you disagree, but HOW you choose to do it.  That includes some of the other trolls on this board as well.  There is a difference between reasoned discourse and childish name calling. <p>Kharne Bloodyhand <BR>

<br>
First of all, my &quot;snide&quot; comments, as you like to call them... appear in what kind of threads? Lets examine:<br>
<br>
*Arirang bashing thread.<br>
*this thread<br>
<br>
Basically, in threads where one person or group of people are being trashed and no one is sticking up for them. I express my oponion, get flamed back... mostly by you... and THEN I say something &quot;snide&quot;. Funny though, as you do the same. If someone dosen't say something that you agree with, you resort to flaming them. Yes, what I say is harsh at times, but god damn it's not like I eat babies or something. <br>
<br>
I suppose it may be hard for you to comprehend the fact that not everybody in the world speaks kindly of everyone and everything all the time. And it may be hard for you to understand that while I may not add &quot;huggles&quot; to every damn post, I'm by no means rude all the time.<br>
<br>
This thread alone is inflamitory and rude and snide and all of those other &quot;horrible&quot; things you like to lable my posts as. But do you say anything to them? Nope. Just when I disagree with the majoriy on the issue do you have a problem with what I say. I'm sure if I had used the same &quot;tone&quot; in my origional post on this topic, but instead of defending the accused I condemed them as you have, you wouldn't have taken issue with my statements one bit. Hypocrisy at it's finest, ladies and gentlemen.<br>
<br>
Yes, my origional statements were harsh, and I even awknowledged that. But if your skin is so thin that a few &quot;harsh&quot; statements get to you, you needn't join online forums anymore, because I can guarentee you that I'm not the only mean person out there.<br>
<br>
In retrospect, I probably shouldn't have used the words I did. Not much I can do to change that though.<br>
<br>
It simply amazes me that you're so hell bent on making me out to be this terrible person. I feel strongly about what I believe, and I believe that everyone, including you, should have their say on any topic. But understand that not everyone will see things the same way as you, and they will express that too. Hell, sometimes I even argue the other point of view, for no other reason than to see people like you get their panties in a bunch over it.<br>
<br>
Do I need to grow up? Not really. The whole point of me saying the opposite of what others say is to get people to think about what they're saying. And, to some degree, it works. Well, let me rephrase that, it works with people that take the time to think about it, and that's something you don't really do much of... thinking of the other point of view, that is. Hmm. Could this be the reason you're no longer an officer of your guild?<br>
<br>
I'll continue to be the pain in your neck for as long as you intend to hold some grudge against me. When you take the time to think about the things I say, and interpret them, and relate them to your point of view, I'm pretty sure things will be diffrent. But again, if you don't think about the things I say, you're going to think my entire point is to argue, when that's simply not it at all.<br>

Your posts always seem to add a scathing remark to what would otherwise be a good point or position.  Why?  Tell you what, I will just let you do your thing, and keep right on doing mine.  I don't think I will ever get through to you, so not going to try anymore.  Why don't we just agree to disagree and leave it at that. <p>Kharne Bloodyhand <BR>

The fact is El is posting her opinion just the same as you are.  I think El raises alot of valid points, and she can do so in anyway that she chooses as long as she stays within the written rules of the board.  If you dont like the way she speaks, then dont read her posts. It is that simple.  I wasnt aware that our posts had to pass the Kharne test of civility.  I like this forum because it caters to those of us who play in a more casual atmosphere, who dont have the time to join hardcore guilds, or would rather stay with their friends.  the fact that it is moderated is fine with me, as long as we are only moderating certain things like foul language, blatant and hurtful lies, and other things of that sort.   <p><FONT COLOR="green" FACE="forte" size="6point" >Myles Bonaduce</FONT> <P>

Where as long as you did not break some EZboard rule you could do and say what you wanted.  If that is the case then why all the concern?  For being unmoderated ya'll are being kinda reserved.  You could just get to the point, which seems to be &quot;@#%$ off and die&quot; and that would be legal here. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=76592"> Matil Trynstum
