<br>
&quot;To be honest there is so much content out there that the idea of a server wide list is kind of obsolete. There is rarely a time when a guild cant find something to do, granted that doesnt mean that you will always get what you want everytime.&quot;<br>
<br>
I understand the arguments that a raid schedule would become a way for some guilds to &quot;plot&quot; to steal the zone just before a guild that was scheduling time would get there, but to me, Myles has shown why it is pointless to undercut a schedule.  The fact is, there is so much content and so much out there to do, that even if a guild undercut another guild and &quot;stole&quot; their raid, it really wouldn't hurt that bad.  It would be fairly easy to go on to something else.  <br>
<br>
Maybe my topic is confusing some people in this respect:  I do NOT mean to try to start a Ragefire list of sorts.  Let's put  the Ragefire and other named spawn lists aside for a moment.  <br>
<br>
What I'm talking about is a schedule for raiding zones like Hate, Droga, or even the smaller ones like Unrest or Mistmoore.  It could be looked at as more an invitation for people to come out and maybe see what a guild is like if you group with them, or a chance to pick up a group in a little used zone.  <br>
<br>
Doesn't anyone else get tired of having to go to the same tired zones to get a group when you are below 50th level?  Let's face it, there is a cycle.  It usually runs like this:<br>
Loil<br>
FM<br>
OT<br>
DL<br>
So levels 20-50 are pretty much cut out for you.  Yes, you can group in other zones, but it's no where near as easy as the zones I just listed.  A list would be condusive to letting the below 50 characters get to do something besides pulling those goofy chickens and cats to the ledge in Overthere.  <br>

Lots of jerks in the world, and we are not protected from them in our game.<br>
<br>
I'm afraid I have to agree with what has been said against a server wide list when raiding involves highly desirable loot outcome.  Greed is ugly.  <br>
<br>
Even without the list, it's ugly face is shown.  Although I have not participated in high end raiding, I read a lot.  There is backstabbing on a daily basis.   Duel guilded players sharing information about scheduled raids, etc.  Although there are other areas to raid if a spawn is taken, the prep time is difficult anyway, and adding a spawn change could break a scheduled raid.  <br>
<br>
I think the solution is to find a guild that fits your play style (*wink* Givins)<br>
<br>
Would anyone care to expand on the alliance?  Although I am not a member at this time, I love the concept.  From what I understand, this is a group of guilds scheduling raids together.  It's not perfect, but from what I've seen, working well.<br>
<br>
And in defense of the &quot;newbie&quot; comment. Givins is not a newbie.  He is an intelligent human being experiencing for himself new areas of the game as he levels.  I had the pleasure of grouping with him, and I felt comfortable.  For those that know this chicken @#%$, you know that doesn't come easy.<br>
<br>
I did not buy the game last week.  I enjoy the game.  I play often, but I don't spend every waking hour playing the game.  When I do play, I don't spend every moment grinding.  I play the way &quot;I&quot; want.  I've been playing for over a year and a half.  My highest char (of 10) is 40. I ENJOY the game (and my monthly fee) this way.  Although I have not participated in the high end game, I've viewed it at many levels.  Looking  over a shoulder, reading the channels (since luclin...love it), and reading the experiences of others on boards.  Please don't judge others on their style of play by insinuating they are a newb.  I've met level 50+ players that leveled fast, but don't know jack. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/bguild75784.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=skyscreamer>Skyscreamer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00bie</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(8/4/02 2:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wishing for a server wide raid schedule</span><hr size=1> Amen, Lhyra.  Just because someone is now uber-in-their-own-mind, doesn't give them a lisence to be rude, in game or on a messageboard.  <br>
<br>
Givins has expressed the same concern that alot of people have: that is, there are many, many zones out there that are alot of fun, but empty.  You really can't experience them unless you BYOG (group or guild).  On a Tuesday night when you're not in the mood to grind, it would be cool to tag along with a guild who's raiding, at any given level (whether it's Splitpaw or Kael).  Raids aren't limited to the level 55+ game.<br>
<br>
The problem is, I don't think many guilds raid low- to mid-level areas, except on weekends.  The high level guilds might raid several times a week, but I doubt that Dalnir or Mistmoore or ToFS see anything resembling a raid from Monday to Friday.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ueqfoulwind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQFoulwind</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cons Threateningly </span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#333333>(8/5/02 5:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://millennium.fortunecity.com/celesteville/649/oscar.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wishing for a server wide raid schedule</span><hr size=1> How do I put this nicely ?<br>
<br>
I don't.<br>
<br>
Everyone wanting lists and schedules please get over it.<br>
<br>
Want to group somewhere ? Find a zone (yourself) see who's there (yourself) LFG (yourself) or /tell your friends and ask them to come (yourself).<br>
<br>
Why must everyone need everything handed to them ? Already, hell levels have been removed, so everyone under 50 has been handed several levels worth of xp already. Then newb quest armor is added. I remember buying a combine Scimitar so I could have magic slash and wearing my own patchwork armor. Again, something handed to them.<br>
<br>
Want a raid ? Here are some suggestions.<br>
<br>
1) Make friends and organize one. Don't sit on your hands waiting for some guild to let you tag along.<br>
<br>
2) Form a guild, organize raids, and understand why you don't want tagalongs.<br>
<br>
3) Join a guild that raids and knows what they are doing.<br>
<br>
4) Make a Druid, port for cash, buy your stuff.<br>
<br>
Why grind ?<br>
<br>
With level come a few things..experience, hit points, AC, Resists, armor (useable by level) and personal skill. If you don't have it..take a look at whats out there, and then get some of it.<br>
<br>
Enough pretend irony, enough feigned insult, enough uber-hate. If you don't strive to be the best at whatever you do its noones fault of your own that you may or may not suck.<br>
It is possible to experience high-end content in this game and still have fun.<br>
<br>
As for raids being limited to the 55+ people. They aren't at all.<br>
BUT, they are a hell of alot more fun when the risk/reward is high and you can actually contribute more than just being a mana sink.<br>

First about the planes pre-Kunark... then when Kunark came out it even happened for a bit when all the high end guilds were out leveling. It was the only calendar RN has ever had, and it only functioned because the &quot;top 25%&quot; of the server wasn't affected by it. Then came the FA quests and they just had to put the drops in the planes and so much for that calendar.<br>
<br>
Calling what that 25% in the high end greed is comparable to calling those wanting a calendar die hard communists. If you want to be negative, both statements are true, but one might want to atleast TRY to be bit more positive...<br>
<br>
Anyway I can say right here that RN will be a FCFS server as long as I play atleast.<br>

<br>
I've seen servers that use schedules, and rotations on various mobs.  And it normally starts out fine and good, assuming everyone agrees to abide by it.  But it always grows out of hand.  Example the Ragefire list.  You call it an entirely different thing, but really it's not, it's just done for a single spawn instead of a zone.  Sooner or later the capable guilds are going to get tired of waiting.  You can call it greed.  But it's not really a fair comment now is it?  <br>
<br>
Example, it took me two months roughly to get the final piece for my epic.  From Fear.  I had to spend each day seeing who was in the zone, finding out if the golem was up, if so when he went down.  Tracking times to know when I could go after him with a suffecient force from my guild.  I had to work for it and two months later I got it.  In RL I know a wizard from another server.  They play on rotations.  He's up in 6 months to get his epic.  When his guild is completely able to go in there just about any time and take it down.<br>
<br>
I don't agree with the fact that this game is about greed and rapid mobilization and competition.  But it's also why I chose not to play the high end game and stick with a small guild capable of challanging ourselves enough to have fun.  But this game is about work if you want to do anything from planes on up.<br>
<br>
There's also a reason most guilds don't normally take tag alongs on thier raids.  I know for CN, the only people non guilded with us are either applicants, or close friends to a member who can vouch for them.  It took us a good amount of time to get our abilities in synch and learn to work with each other.  When you add an unknown into the mix, you never know what you're gonna screw up.  I think that's as much as or more of a reason a schedule would never work then the relative few guilds that would actually use it for pre-empting. <p><img src=http://www.carpenocturnus.com/Brokenfang.gif>

There's quite a bit of hostility around here. It doesn't seem the least bit warranted.<br>

Clearly a list/schedule isn't going to work on Rodcet with strong guilds opposed to it.<br>
<br>
It's equally clear to me that it is working on Brell.<br>
<br>
That's fine - different strokes for different folks. On Brell I'll appreciate the real-life convenience of *knowing* that I'll be raiding Fear next Tuesday. On Rodcet I'll play it by ear.<br>

I've got no reason to accuse anyone else of wanting things handed to them, or lack of effort, or whining, or newbieness, or imply that they have gotten undeserved xp, or begging, or to laugh at anyone. Nor have I done those things.<br>
<br>
Lighten up.<br>
<br>
To go back to ktadema's original post - looks like you're not going to see a calendar. You might be able to get around to the message boards of some guilds (see Guild Links forum) and see if they have upcoming events listed - there are some who occasionally allow strangers to tag along. Some points made here are valid, sometimes it turns out disastrous, but more often in my experience the extras do blend in without serious trouble. Certainly some guilds will not have their upcoming events viewable by the public, and that's fine. (Someone will post that it's &quot;stupid&quot; to have it public viewable, and he's entitled to his opinion - but I won't always agree with it.)<br>

<br>
What I meant by work is.  This game is designed to provide challanges.  To over come them you have to work at it.  Being as how this is not a single player game and that there's thousands of other real people in the game with you at any time, one of those challanges is having to deal with the schedules of other people.  Not to mention simply learning how to handle the encounter(s) your attempting.<br>
<br>
There's a lot of things in this world that I do for fun, that require work.  I like to shoot pool.  But I wasn't very good when I first started playing.  I had to work at it to keep from getting humiliated every time I played.  I like to play football on occasion.  I need to work at keeping in shape so that I'm not out of breath running 30 feet.  I like to play everquest.  I have to work at my leveling, and keeping in touch with other guilds/people to find out what they're doing so that I can either a) not step on thier toes or b) plan around them.<br>
<br>
I don't find every little thing in EQ to be fun.  But the enjoyment I do take from the game is worth the work I put into it.  For me at least.<br>

That was directed at the n00b idiots that are always begging, and act like folks owe them something.  That leads to the list mentality, and other things, but I was NOT dumping on anyone, and as far as EQ being work, I enjoy Starcraft, Mechwarrior4, and other games, but you have to work at them to get good.  It is fun, but you don't just have it all handed to you on a silver platter; yet many in EQ seem to think it should be that way.  Grinding is work.  ESPECIALLY post 50.  It is still fun, but it is not easy.  It is time consuming, and sometimes tedious, especially waiting for a rare spawn, but worth it in the end.  Since when is a difference of opinion hostility?  Too many folks take a good argument and ruin it by getting their feelings all hurt.  Passions run strong on different subjects, so relax.  If someone calls you out, have a shot back at them, but don't get all misty eyed over it, it USUALLY isn't personal. <p>Kharne Bloodyhand <BR>

I started this thread with a light hearted wish, something that I thought was a good idea.  I guess I'm almost looking back at my leveling and seeing ways that the game/server could be improved, and made better.<br>
<br>
Some of the muck and insults that have been thrown back are puzzling.  Since when is an idea just an opportunity to call people names or talk about people's work habits?  Did I really say something to deserve that?  Do I know you?<br>
<br>
Some of the response has been enlightening.  For instance, I didn't know that Rodcet Nife once had tried this and it had failed.  I guess I am a &quot;newbie&quot; after all.  Or however you want to define a newbie.  <br>
<br>
Seems to me like a couple of you guys are &quot;newbies&quot; on civility and trying to discuss an idea constructively.  <br>
<br>
I really don't want to dwell on the flames.  If some of you people want to hijack my thread and turn it into a flame war, why don't you take it to the appropriate forum?<br>
<br>
In the meantime, I think that any idea of putting a schedule on a 50+ area is out of the question.  But the arguments that I hear do not seem like they would apply to the lower level dungeons.  (below 50)  <br>
<br>
By the way, let me end my post by saying thanks to the people that are writing constructive criticism.  Bring that on all you want, I don't mind being told I'm wrong.  <br>

Part of what makes me not want a list is the simple fact that most often any dispute can be settled by talking first.  You want an example:  Pre list Ragefire,  My guild Carpe Nocturnus butted heads with Brew Masters.  We both were ready to take over the Ragefire spawn and neither wanted to back down.  After a little bit of arguing we actually talked to each other and came to an agreement.  Now our 2 guilds feel like we can call on each other for help if needed, and have on occasion.  Keep in mind we came to this agreement over one of the most heavily fought after (non high end) mobs in the game.  Without the aid of any list or schedule.  And before anyone tries to say but the high end guilds wouldnt have worked things out with us.  We have also dealt with guilds like Ascent or the old Harbingers of Storms.  (in the case of Ascent I beleive it was a group of Ascent players not an &quot;official&quot; ascent raid)  It was never a matter of of having a schedule ro anything like that, it was more a matter of just talking like adults, and understanding that although I may not get what I want this time, the next time around I usually will.  Keeping that in mind, along with the fact that there is just so much out there to do I think having a server wide schedule is unneeded, and would in my mind only cause problems.  For instance last week on my guilds raid day we were scheduled to go to hate in search of the mage staff, when we logged on there was another guild there, so people scattered looking for a good spot to do, after discussing a few alternatives we ended up in ToV and had a nice fun raid.  Everyone there had a good time.<br>
<br>
All that being said, I can understand the appeal of being able to plan your RL around certain raids.  I know I dont get to do everything I want to do in EQ because RL takes precedence.  Our solution in our guild was just to pick certain times of the week when we would be raiding and then make the best of that time.  True we often times have to change plans at the last second, but we nearly always find something to do, and on the rare occasion that there was nothing that sounded appealing we would more than likely head right off to the arena. <p><FONT COLOR="green" FACE="forte" size="6point" >Myles Bonaduce</FONT> <P>

Where I disagree with you is that &quot;that leads to the list mentality&quot; - or at least, if that does, then I also believe there are some other, valid reasons for wanting a list (/schedule/whatever) as well. Enough so that merely wishing for a list doesn't necessarily mean that one is one of the above-mentioned idiots, who wants everything handed to him on a silver platter. Maybe you agree with that and maybe you don't, it won't bother me much, I just needed to speak out against some overgeneralization that I thought I saw.<br>
