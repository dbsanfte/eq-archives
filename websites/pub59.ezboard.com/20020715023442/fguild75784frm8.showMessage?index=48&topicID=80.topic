<br>
You might not like VNBoards, but people are capale of using their own 'filter' of people to pay attn to people to ignore. I, for one, don't need someone censoring what I read for me.<br>
<br>
I started coming to this board when Ciname posted all over the place that this was going to be the server board. Noone wants to read a moderated and censored piece of shit.<br>
I try to read it every day, some days trolling, some days being nice, some days not giving a shit.<br>
<br>
Leave the board alone. Banning people is not a good idea. Don't push your beliefs of decency on me. Don't move posts around. I have a brain and when I want to use it I will.<br>

Lighten the hell up and get FEWER moderators.<br>

Some people (read alot) are tired of these childish behavior encountered on other board and want an adult decent conversation where respect and intellect is shown. Rules are there to enforce this kind of environnement and if you find the rules to be affecting ya that much then wonder why because for 400 other people it doesnt. <p><center><a href=" http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=169401">

Do you think having a &quot;blacklist&quot; section is a good way to elicit adult-like behavior? What happens when the person who got &quot;blacklisted&quot; sees there name on there, do you not expect flames and profanity? And as far as people like Requis, I see no reason to make such a big deal about his/her posts. Sure, they may be a little inflamatory, and he always, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> always</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> will disagree just for the sake of disagreeing, but if you really feel offended or discouraged by him/her or anyone else on here then you should just back away from the computer and go visit a doctor. I agree with those that say this board is overmoderated, if you want it to be the server's board then you cannot expect everyone to abide by some rules. Sure, there's a point where one must draw the line, absolutely no reason to try and keep idiots/trolls around, but at the same time some people are by nature more inflamatory and profane... for the denizens of this board to ever be anything but a minority, you've gotta reach a compramise. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/uvetoafauna.showPublicProfile?language=EN>vetoafauna</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#333333>(6/27/02 8:45:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/vzvrn/fullsize/buddyavatar2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The secret to being 'unblacklisted'</span><hr size=1> might also help to be able to edit one's own posts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ukharnebloodyhand.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kharne Bloodyhand</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cons Dubious </span><br>  Posts: 195<br> <font color=#333333>(6/27/02 9:12:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.creativegraphixs.com/grfxfrlts/img1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The secret to being 'unblacklisted'</span><hr size=1> lol veto...  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/auroraknights/images/kharnesig1.jpg

<br>
And this rule is to be followed by all, unless of course there is a &quot;good&quot; reason to bash a guild.  <br>
<br>
The problem with this is it is all a matter of perspective.  For example....  <br>
<br>
I and 23 of my friends have a horrible run in with Guild XYZ.  Guild XYZ trained us, KS'd our rare once-a-week spawn, etc.  <br>
<br>
I come here and post about it.  I'm guild bashing with a very valid reason based on my experience.<br>
<br>
You and 25 of your friends have had nothing but wonderful run-ins with Guild XYZ.  You post how wonderful Guild XYZ is, and your 25 friends post about it.   You also all post how I must be wrong since I'm the only one posting about my &quot;bad&quot; run-in (my friends, for the sake of this argument, don't frequent this board).   <br>
<br>
In your mind, you're right and my post has absolutely no merit whatsoever.  I know differently though.  So who really is right?  You because you have friends that frequent this board and post - or me?  Who decides what is a &quot;fair&quot; guild bashing and what is not?<br>
<br>
My personal opinion, if you're going to make rules and expect others to adhere to them - then you need to as well.  You cannot make a rule and then make exceptions to that rule based on your own sense of &quot;fair play&quot;.   <br>
<br>
One of your rules is no guild bashing.   <p><BR><font color=blue size=1><i>Be prepared,  for I a can go from sweetheart to Satan's spawn in the time it takes mez to break<i></font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ucorwildelyonhart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Corwil Delyonhart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#333333>(6/27/02 10:14:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The secret to being 'unblacklisted'</span><hr size=1> There is a simple difference in &quot;parts&quot; of that thread. <br>
<br>
A lot of what was stated was FACT. Remove the posts in the thread stating that such and such guild is horrible or whatever those are guild bashing, but the fact remains that someone was camping something for a week and someone else came and took it after they failed on their first attempt. Whether that's right or wrong is up to everyone to interpret, but reporting it occuring isn't especially given a significant portion of the rodcet community has treated them differently as a result of what occured. <br>
<br>
They gave them a first attempt, but not a second. The fact of that is fine to post imho, and frankly should be encouraged. Even your example with you and 23 of your friends having a run in with a guild is valid as long as you don't cross the line and state that guild x sucks in a public forum. <br>
<br>
Guild bashing is attacking another guild - and what was removed was doing that for no reason other than to attack a guild. Heck the person doing the attacking even won one of the big items on that raid and he was still complaining about it. If you don't like raiding with another guild, you don't post in a public forum trashing them about the raid you went on and won an item from, you just stop raiding with them. <br>
<br>
It's not like they did anything like what the thread you want removed was like - they were raiding VS and from what was posted there wasn't even two guilds contesting it - just one whiny kid saying they would have run the raid differently and how awful the other guild is because they didn't run it their way. And worse it was done in horrible language that would get you a backhand if most moral fathers heard their kid say such things. <br>
<br>
There are a lot of minors on rodcet, it's safe to assume they read boards associated with Rodcet. This board chose to have moderation and is run by a private group of people. I have posted this before, but if you strongly dislike the rules on this board  - then don't come here. You can post on Flamevault or VN boards which have less moderation and might be more in line with your language preferences. <br>
<br>
But if you do come here and swear in front of kids with a parent running the forum - expect to get that backhand. <br>

Every single incident is open to interpretation based on each individuals perspective.<br>
<br>
Every single individual has their own sense of what is right and what is wrong. <br>
<br>
If there is a rule &quot;No guild bashing&quot; - it's either a rule everyone needs to abide by or no one.   <br>
<br>
You (you being whoever) can't make exceptions based on what you consider right or wrong, if you want this to be &quot;The RN Board&quot;.<br>
<br>
Like Vetofauna said, if you want this to be a private board, that's fine - you're doing great.  On the other hand, if you want it to be a RN board, for the entire RN community, the rules need to be applied to everyone in every situation. <p><BR><font color=blue size=1><i>Be prepared,  for I a can go from sweetheart to Satan's spawn in the time it takes mez to break<i></font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/uvetoafauna.showPublicProfile?language=EN>vetoafauna</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#333333>(6/27/02 10:59:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/vzvrn/fullsize/buddyavatar2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The secret to being 'unblacklisted'</span><hr size=1> I wouldn't exactly say that there was alot of fact in the ragefire KS thread, the only &quot;fact&quot; in the whole damn thing imo was what was logged, and the fact that ragefire did spawn. Nothing else is verifiable, even helen didn't know what was fact.<br>
<br>
&quot;Early today, Ragefire showed his rare face. Our two group force went to engage, killing Zordak for the experience and poping ragefire, upon gaining agro, dravack, our MA, started to windle down rage, when Arirang and their group of KS classes (including mana burn wizard) took the kill and their cleric taking the loot....saying your weak, we are strong and laughing....&quot;<br>
<br>
Fact: Ragefire popped, PA and arirang had people present to kill it (see log)<br>
Unverifiable: Arirang KS'd PA.<br>
Fiction: Arirang had a manaburn wizard, Arirang called PA weak (see log)<br>
<br>
&quot;It gets even more disturbing, for the last 2 days of our 13 day camp, a monk showed up, afk, level 17, damn near naked, and when we sent tells would never respond...to test our theory, we got an AE mob over to him so he poped up, he ran somewhere else, and FD'd where we sent him a tell...again no response...we petitioned a GM, but they couldn't do anything because the monk hadn't done anything yet.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fact: GM cannot do anything about someone who hasn't broken any rules. PA cleric had camped Ragefire (see channel)<br>
Unverifiable: 17 monk was hanging out in Skyfire.<br>
<br>
&quot;We have logs of our first engagement, the mocking of Arirang, and (through a secret source) their guild conversation the night before, discussing what classes and people would be needed to make the best KS group. This conversation also included when it would be the best time to engage the mob....ie: after our tank had agro.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fact: PA had a secret source in Arirang (see log, Zalkor)<br>
Unverifiable: PA has logs. Arirang was discussing the best way to KS from PA.<br>
<br>
&quot;I want to point out that this is bigger than any KS we have ever seen, not because it is a PA member, but because there is a list of rules and policy for camping rage, it was the first time Rodcet Nife got together to deal with a game problem, and 15 guilds agreeing to, and upholding the contract for months...it was a civil arrangement to one of the biggest VI problems we have in the game.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fact: 15 guilds came to a civil agreement (see cleric board)<br>
Unverifiable: This was the biggest KS PA has seen, since they have yet to prove that it was a KS.<br>
Fiction: It was the first time Rodcet Nife got together to deal with a game problem (the list is an agreement between said guilds, not Rodcet Nife server, and it isn't the first time a group of people came together to solve a problem)<br>
<br>
&quot;I would like to point out one other thing as well, even though PA was number 1 and Glorius tides 2, jordynede, spudds, tarus, and numerous other clerics will all be bumped back by the underhanded plannings of a single guild...in fact, if nothing is done, the whole list might fall to pieces because there is no way to ensure it won't happen again....&quot;<br>
<br>
Fact: Other clerics will get bumped back on the list (First cleric did not get epic piece)<br>
Unverifiable: The whole list might fall to pieces. Arirang's actions were &quot;underhanded plannings&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What i ask of you guys, is simple and not time consuming, boycott Arirang, don't res, don't port, don't group....that is a simple request....IF you feel more strongly about this, i urge you to contact alliances, friends, and petition our GM's....I want to remind you that we are paying customers, the complaints of a few may fall on deaf ears, the complaints of hundreds (all logged on VI's server) will not fall upon deaf ears...and at the very least we may be able to prevent this happening to another cleric.....for erkild, he has spent 13 days straight, molding his life around this game, asking for help, taking time away from his girlfriend, family and work, and now, he must wait another 5-7 days....that is, unless the GM's have a reason to be harsh in this matter.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fact: The poster wants people to boycott Arirang and to petition to GMs. Erkild spent days camping Ragefire.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now... a factual post would have been something like:<br>
<br>
&quot;Early tonight, Ragefire spawned. PA had been camping him for several days. PA and Arirang both had force in the zone to kill Ragefire. PA has a secret source in Arirang. 15 guilds, not including Arirang, had a list for Ragefire and PA cleric is on top of this list. PA failed to kill Ragefire and Arirang got the kill. It may have been KS'd, we have to wait for the GM's rule. Because PA cleric did not get Ragefire, other clerics on the list will not move up. I want you to boycott Arirang because they killed Ragefire when PA was supposed to&quot;<br>
<br>
All of which is fine, until the last sentence (or paragraph in the original poster's case.) There was no fact in the last paragraph of his post that was relevant to the events in Skyfire, the entire point of this paragraph was guild bashing. Regardless of reasoning, guild bashing is against the rules on this board.<br>
<br>
Coming to a board such as this and asking for people to blinding boycott members of another guild, for ANY reason, is no worse than flaming/swearing/trolling. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ucorwildelyonhart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Corwil Delyonhart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#333333>(6/27/02 11:13:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The secret to being 'unblacklisted'</span><hr size=1> I believe you missed what I was saying as well. One was guildbashing for the sake of guildbashing - and the other was an accused kill steal. <br>
<br>
I agree that A LOT of that thread should have been removed as it wasn't pertinent to the situation being reported and simply bashing a guild. However the intent of the thread and a decent percentage of the posts were not entirely perspective based - there were considerable facts that were proven by both sides and an investigation on a hotly contested spawn was also taken by the then server GM. <br>
<br>
Given Verant's track record for their customer service - anything that the server GM investigated on such a hotly contested issue for the Rodcet community ... is worth reading. <br>
<br>
What interpretation of the reported facts is up to the reader, but the facts themselves *if* posted without blatant verbal attacks - should be allowed here. Whether you agree with one side or the other is moot. The event occured and it was reported here initially as an fyi from one side to the Rodcet community as a whole. Both sides presented their case, and people walked away from it supporting either one side or the other, but if you filter out the white noise from posts - they came out with a clearer picture of what occured. <br>
<br>
This is also a discussion that occured on numerous server  boards in large part due to the impact of the event on the people on the server. Would you want news pertinent to so many of us not to appear in any shape or form ? <br>

<br>
Even not disputing any of the facts you posted - wasn't finding all of that out worth the jibberish you had to filter through to get it ? Things were being said in the &quot;rumor&quot; mill all over the server in game. Isn't a post on a server forum that shows both sides of the story better than the rumors circulating in game ? <br>
<br>
Given what I heard about the event in game in ooc or shout - I much prefer what was posted here as an information source to finding out what happened. <br>
<br>
I would agree that removing some of the posts in that thread would be warranted as they are blatant guildbashing, but in no way should the whole thread be deleted. And I strongly disagree that future threads of events of equal impact on the server community should be banned from being posted here. <br>

So we don't need to continue with the bull crap.  We have tweaked the rules a bit.  You can read the full thing in the Messages from the Admin section, or just read the tweaked section here.<br>
<br>
*If something disappears from any forum check the other forums before breaking out your flamethrower . There is a better than average chance it got moved somewhere.<br>
<br>
*As a general guideline, the only time we'll delete a post from this point on is if it violates EZ-Board's rules.  Mind you, this still means that it can be moved to the appropriate section on the board.<br>
<br>
As for moderation:<br>
<br>
General Discussions/ooc/quest/etc: People looking to talk about in game things.  Keep it at a civil level of discussion.  The moderators will generally try to exercise discretion in what is &quot;acceptable&quot; content.<br>
<br>
Red forum: Anything goes (as long as EZ-Board says it's ok) Won't touch it, delete from it, moderate it or do anything else with it otherwise.<br>
<br>
If, in the context of your communications on these forums, you become such a pain in the ass that an admin decides that the board is better off without ya, then you'll find yourself banned. We don't have any problem with differing opinions, or even flames, but if it gets too outrageous (as defined by us) we reserve the right to remove you from this forum without warning. If a user of this forum makes it less fun for the other participants, including the admins, you won't have &quot;rules&quot; to hide behind. This is for the enjoyment of all, if you get your enjoyment at other people's expense, expect not to be able to access these boards.<br>

Also because of the fact it was so strong an issue to so many people they left the thread fairly unmoderated except for people who could not use decent language.  Thirdly you will notice none of the moderators posted an opinion to boycott or not what ever their personal opinions were.   Fourth you will notice in the end we all decided it was best to close that thread, the USERS not the moderators.  <br>
<br>
On another subject there is a difference between guild bashing and reporting a bad run in with another guild.  That is why there is a chance for both sides to post, that way it can be decided if there is enough supporting evidence from several other people if the thread should even be left up.  Secondly there are enough people that read this board that a link will be posted on other boards or something will be said to that person/guild in game that both sides will come to discuss the issue.   Not everyone takes what is posted here as pure truth we usually compare it to our own experiences then decide from there.  Remember not everyone supported the few that posted to boycott, in fact several people posted against it.  There were also people like me that didn't post much if any on the subject.  <br>
<br>
Lastly no one is forcing anyone to use this board.  Rules are posted to keep people within certain boundaries so this does not turn into flamevault.  Rules are also posted to allow both sides to have a say then when all that is said and done the post may be taken away after a period of time where it is posted that the accusations were unfounded.  Please let us not rehash ragefire it is a dead horse no one will forget for a long time, everyone has made their minds up on the subject at this point.  <br>
<br>
I personally like having a moderated board, I read a smaller percentage of childish posts that use nothing but foul language and flaming someone up one side and down the other but never say why. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=97672">

Yes, there is a difference between guild bashing and reporting a bad run in with another guild, but if you cannot report a bad run in with another guild without guild bashing then you're still breaking rules, regardless of how strong the issue is. To come here and complain about Arirang taking your ragefire is perfectly fine, even with all of the non factual content he posted. But to come here asking people to boycott people based on their guild tag, and to flood the GMs with petitions, is in breech of the rules. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/uincubustisinflamous.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Incubustis Inflamous</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#333333>(6/29/02 12:42:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The secret to being 'unblacklisted'</span><hr size=1> whatever... the arirang/PA thing is over.. as for the forum... if you disagree don't read it... its about KSing not guild bashing... and Requis... go back to your old damn server. <p>Incubustis Inflamous<BR>
