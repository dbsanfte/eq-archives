<br>
How many of you play but don't want to?<br>
/raise<br>
<br>
My name is Mary, I'm 21 years old. I play EQ, level 61 barbarian warrior named Diefenbaker. Guild Officer of Outcast Adventurers close allies of Exiled Knights. I play EQ because i have to. I have friends i love in this game, i've had fun with a lot of people IRL from the game as well, met some cool people and partied with them as well. I thank them for this.<br>
<br>
Nice to meet you all. I hate this fuc.king game.<br>
<br>
But I will continue playing it unfortunately. I have reasons. Smaller ones being that my guild needs me. I MT all the raids our guild and alliance does together because i'm the highest level and most geared up for it. I have epic and full velious armor minus a bp but thank you to my favorite sexy troll for taking care of me til i get velious. Even if I don't MT the raids, lotta grind groups within my guild are in need of tanks. I use to be the only warrior, but the MIA one and 2 recruits were added. But still.... i'm ony high enough and geared enough to do some groups people are asking.<br>
<br>
Oh fuc.king well, i still can enjoy it some of the time.<br>
<br>
Well here's the big one, i'm a guild officer (i will note that i love OA, and wouldn't leave them for any other guild in the world), they should make appearances frequently right? On top of that my boyfriend who i love more than anything else in this world combined is the incredibly great guild leader. Everyone loves Cudget, he's a wonderful guild leader and a great person. And he loves this game...... he'll play everyday... every single day in this world if he had the opportunity. I've learned to move past that i guess but i know he needs me in game for reasons above and a lot more on top of that as well.<br>
<br>
but I got a question. When it's obvious that you need someone, why would you make them feel like shi.t?<br>
<br>
<br>
Sometimes people have to step the fuc.k back, look at what just happened and think &quot;should I chew this person out, or thank them&quot; Think real fuc.king hard, because if you have to chew them out YOUR FUC.KING WRONG!<br>
<br>
Small example. I mean this is so small, it shouldn't matter but it was the straw that broke the camels back.<br>
<br>
Today I was solely playing for someone who needed a tank in a small raid and in a grind group. I didn't want to play (as usual) I was under the weather I tried to get out of it, couldn't get out of it. The person who wanted to grind bitc.hed because the exp was as.s - we had a slow as.s break in. And I guess since it was all my fault because I was the only one giving ideas on where to go so he complained to me. Fuc.k that.<br>
<br>
Then shi.t goes wrong. I managed to 2box a wizzie and war and evac 7 people out of a sticky situation. Well I woulda but a group member went LD. I brought my wizard to 4c (who was getting no exp for anything, only losing) and it saved everyone's life. The cleric was oom and the mezzed mob was dotted and I evaced 7 people, the cleric goes LD 1/2 before the 2nd evac went off (cancelled first time because of someone getting out of range).<br>
<br>
Bottom line, cleric managed to gate when he got back in and I was chewed out by a group member because I did not allow them to committ suicide by going there trying to retrieve the cleric.<br>
<br>
After all that bullshi.t we should be happy we didn't have to wait 40 minutes to get resituated, we should be happy that the cleric made it out safely. I was hoping they'd be happy that they got evaced out, that I managed to get everyone out (minus cleric) very smoothly, that I took my fuc.king time today to help them, to try my hardest, to waste my fuc.king day trying to help people. No I just get chewed out. Fuc.king thank you. Fuc.king thanks to all the people out there who have done shi.t like this and LET ME TELL YOU there is a fuc.king BUTTLOAD of you guys. <br>
<br>
I have to keep playing, I know it's my choice not to play but bottom line I have to. To all of you people who fit the above description in ruining my day:  would you please for FUC.KS SAKE THINK BEFORE TALKING!!! And at some point could someone THANK me for helping them, not telling me what i'm doing wrong, not telling me I did the wrong thing not telling me that I'M WRONG! FUC.KING THANK ME IF I TRY MY HARDEST TO HELP YOU!! Don't flatter me for a half hour, don't flatter me at all. Just say &quot;Thank you&quot; or &quot;thanks&quot; or &quot;thnx&quot; for FUC.KING EVEN &quot;TY&quot;!!!<br>
<br>
If you see me in game, I beg you to help me out. I have to play EQ, it's basically my fuc.king job. Please don't make it hard on me if you could help it. Big way of doing this - don't even bother talking to me. I'm sorry but this isn't a game to me anymore it's not fun I don't enjoy it. If I help you say nothing but a form of thank you and you will get it in return from me. But I will just tank from now on it's my god damn job and i'm just going to do that. Fuc.k fun, that's only for children.<br>

If you really hate it, then you have to find a way to play less or not at all.  When your spouse plays (mine does) this makes slowing down or quitting oh so hard, because one or the other of you wants to play more.<br>
<br>
Bottom line though,  your life is your life.  Use your days as YOU want to, and noone else.  An officer doesn't sign up for life.  I have no doubt you've done your share.  Make your own decision, and I'm sure those that matter will support you.<br>

Wow, that bites...I'm sorry you had to go through all that.  I'd be pissed off as well too if that had happened to me.<br>
<br>
I feel the same way when someone finds me god knows how through whatever channels they're using when they're not even in the same zone to ask/beg for a port.  Pisses me even more when they take their sweet time getting to the meeting point, then leave once ported without even a thank you.  So yes, I sympathize with you Dief.  Guess we have to deal with ungrateful people once in awhile *grumble.*<br>

The game itself just stopped being fun to me.  In fact it very much felt like work. And I ended up staying for a lot of the same reasons you are now.  Leading a guild, some outstanding friendships I've made.  It was mostly for the people that I stayed, those that have become so close to me even through a game that I feel I've known them for years.  <br>
<br>
I was the guy that would drop anything to go help out a guildmate or friend.  Whether I wanted to or not.  I would spend 2 - 3 hours per night of my logged in time handling guild affairs and another 4 or 5 hours before I even logged in researching new raid locations, planning things and fielding questions,comments.concerns in emails.<br>

The problem is, I became bitter.  To the point I was getting tells daily from someone I unintentionally pissed off because I was bitching about everything.  And if you crossed me, I came down pretty harsh.<br>
<br>
Finally I did have to step back, and just take some me time.  For me, it was just letting the guild things go and just playing the game to play again.  Thankfully I'm blessed with officers and members I can count on and they picked up the slack I left allowing me that time, or I'm not sure I would still be playing now.  <br>
<br>
Which is really the best suggestion I can make to you.  If you feel you need to play, then take some time off to play.  Do the things that -you- want to do.  You might disappoint some people now and then that want you to grind or tank a raid or something.  But I'll bet those people will be more disappointed when you're not around at all because you just can't stand it anymore.<br>
<br>
Probably a lot of babbling and not a lot of help.  But I do hope it all works out for you whatever you decide to do.  I've only had that one chance to group with you, and we've only talked on occasion.  But enough that I'ld be sorry to see you go, or to see you miserable because you feel pressured to stay and not having any fun.   <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.carpenocturnus.com/Brokenfang.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

As i was telling some officers of my guild (one of em happened to stumble upon this heh) I am to the point where i'm just down right bitter.<br>
<br>
if anyone talks to me about anything for more than 1 or 2 lines of conversation or people start asking me questions and giving me suggestions to something in the game i've just stopped talking, sometimes put myself on afk or logged without a word... i just don't care.<br>
<br>
Oh and just a warning to anyone else who may feel like this. Don't even attempt the trials under any circumstance if your at this stage. It's like a nuclear bomb waiting to go off. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/bguild75784.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jazzifruit>Jazzifruit</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cons Threateningly </span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#333333>(11/20/02 7:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=119.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .........</span><hr size=1> /comfort Dief <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I think many, many people understand those feelings.  I've had many nights that I've logged on when I really didn't feel like it either cause I promised I'd help someone, or maybe just to talk to friends.  I'll end up sitting there chatting some, then I feel restless and bitter because I don't actually want to be logged on.  <br>
<br>
Best advice I can give is listen to what YOU want.  The game can offer many fun experiences, a sense of achievement, and above all...great friends.  But none of this is going to be good at all if you are feeling bitter and unhappy.  I understand that powerful feeling of being needed, but the truth is, these are your FRIENDS, and they will have to care about your well-being.  Its great to be dependable, but not at the cost of your happiness.  So let your friends know, explain the situation to them, and take some time to relax...either playing and doing different things, or not playing at all.  I have all the sympathy in the world for how you feel, but no matter what you say, I'll never agree that this has to be a JOB for you.  Even if it feels like that, it IS a game, bottom line.  It gets messy and complicated, and taking a step back is easier said than done, but you really gotta do whatever will make you feel better.<br>
<br>
So...thanks for being so helpful dagnabit! Now go relax! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/bguild75784.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caeddartalsilvanthae>Caeddar TalSilvanthae</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00bie</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(11/25/02 9:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=119.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .........</span><hr size=1> Hiya Deif, <br>

h.ell yes i am.. that was a good thing to do what you did... as a cleric i always think of the many over the one ... better that most get out than none... heh as a cleric i'm often in situations where i have to decide who's gonna bite it so we all can live ... similar situation i suppose as far as that goes... i'm sure that cleric was very happy about what you did and would have thanked you...<br>
<br>
as for the game ... i can only hope that takeing break helps to bring some fun back in the game ... you are definately one of those people i'm glad to have met in EQ and had some fun times with ya <br>

Don't just quit, sell your account.<br>
<br>
There are reasons for it.<br>
<br>
EQ, as most are willing to admit,is an addiction.<br>
Giving your account to a friend is like giving your money to a friend and saying &quot;Don't let me buy Coke&quot;   that is    until the day you tell him, &quot;Gimme my damn money back !&quot;<br>
<br>
If you sell your acount you will...<br>
1) See some kind of return on your investment of time and at least break even on the monthly fee<br>
2) You will not be able to turn it back on, or recover it frm a friend.<br>
<br>
I've hated this game for quite some time, when I finally got sick of it, I made sure I couldn't come back. I got my guild to kick me out, I sold all my possessions, and finally sold the account. I don't even post on my game name anymore because the guy that does have my account is damn nice guy and isn't trying to lie and say he's me.<br>
<br>
This is a few months ago and I still read the boards...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Quitting EQ is like quitting smoking, its a b.itch.<br>
<br>
It takes up entirely too much time and all of us are going to sit back one day and say, &quot; Oh my God, 274 days played...I could have (insert dream here)&quot;<br>

<br>
Reasons being.... It's one of the very few moments a day i get to spend time with him, playing eq gives me something to talk about with him and understand what he spends most of his time doing and it just flat out gives me something to do while he's playing eq and i got nothing (don't even bother listing other things i could be doing in it's place - i don't read, i don't like tv that much, i'm already playing 6 different games on my comp, i don't have very many friends and even less  money and i'm not physically active)<br>
<br>
I have said most of the other reasons why i can't quit and i don't want to elaborate again but i agree it's an addiction and to put it to terms basically i'm a smoker trying to quit with a live-in boyfriend chain smoking 3 packs a day because he's &quot;lead smoker&quot;(?) . <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/bguild75784.showUserPublicProfile?gid=diefenbakerbakendiefer>DiefenbakerBakendiefer</A> at: 1/27/03 8:24:52 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/bguild75784.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kelcekindredsouls>KelceKindredsouls</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cons Threateningly </span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#333333>(1/27/03 12:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=119.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .........</span><hr size=1> Necessity can tone down the addiction Dief, get Cudget some side employment or something; worked for friends of mine.
