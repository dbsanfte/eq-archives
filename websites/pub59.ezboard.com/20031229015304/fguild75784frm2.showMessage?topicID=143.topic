I thought I used stronger words than that.  <br>
<br>
As it was not the other clerics turns, both were sleeping.  <br>
<br>
From what I have gathered in assisting camping this blasted spawn for Chami, is that Quaylon (sp?) sleeps at nites and his son watches the rage spawn while he plays DAOC.<br>
<br>
Alilinkie is not even &quot;required&quot; by the so called rules of this list to be on that hill.  However, for the past few days she has sat on the hill ( #3 cleric mind you ) 24 hours a day to be sure that she does not miss her turn.<br>
<br>
From what I was told, Chami went LD, and the other clerics on the hill did not see rage pop for one reason or another.<br>
<br>
Chami promptly came back and there was no rage up in the spot it was susposed to be in.  We were all under the impression that it was a 'false' call.<br>
<br>
However, after pulling teeth from several EIE/DA/Ascent members, it was confirmed that Rage had been killed.  And not by the clerics camping it.<br>
<br>
I find it rather amusing that EIE/DA/Ascent and the rest of the people that assisted you found it neccisary to pull rage ALL the way from the spawn point, to the BW zones.  That in itself leads be to believe that you knew what you were doing was wrong.<br>
<br>
Chami is one of the sweetest persons I have EVER had the privlage of knowing in my EQ career.  There has not been one night that I have sat on her so she could sleep that I have not received dozens of tells of people saying hi.  Asking how the camps going etc etc.  This is becuase Chami is one of the kindest people in this game.  This is why there are a lot of pissed off people over this, including myself.<br>
<br>
Like I mentioned to you before.  Chami is not some child out on school vacation.  She is not some single female/male that was able to take a couple weeks off from work to camp this spawn.  She has a family, and a real life.  This camp horribly distrupts that.  Yes she chose to do that camp, but I'm sure you can understand the time and effort that everyone one of the clerics on this list have put into camping this spawn.  Tonight I feel you disrespected that.<br>
<br>
However, I do appricate that you came back and are willing to speak with Chami.  And I hope that you do what you know what  is the right and honorable thing to do.<br>
<br>
  Its not an easy decision, this I know.  But, please if only for a few minutes, put yourself in Chami's shoes.   You know the current situation with Chami and her RL schedule. <br>
<br>
  Theres nothing else I can really say.  7am, and I'm still too riled up to sleep.  I'll eagerly be awaiting your decision when i log on this afternoon.<br>

Pulling to bw zone is standard issue Talendor tactics, it was just probably a spot more people were familiar with (and near both portals).

<br>
A cleric, who is not a supporter of the list, came into skyfire and found rage up. The only people camping the spawn were two afk clerics. This person (melissa?) had time to assemble a raid force, and killed rage, having engaged it first, NOT KSed, which per Verant policy on spawns, makes it their mob.<br>
<br>
So they broke no Verant rule. They did not follow the list, which basically is their choice. This was inevitable, with a list 103 people long and growing. I made a comment in the other thread about ragefire which explains my feelings about the whole thing.<br>
<br>
This sounds to me like someone legitimately, within the rules, managed to get a spawn, in spite of the list. Personally, I have no problem with this, unless I am missing some important point.<br>
<br>
&lt;edit&gt; I wanted to add two more things. First, I cannot access the ragefire list, as the site for clerics is down. I have assumed that melissa was not on the list. If she was, then, by joining the list, she had agreed to its rules, and violated those rules in this instance (in that case she should give the MQ to the cleric who had the camp). Second, this post is my personal opinion, not that of my guild or any other member of the guild. <p>Xaanru <br>

I was typing my edit while you made this reply.<br>
<br>
I was unable to check the list, because the cleric site was down. Oddly, now that you tell me she was on the list, I must switch sides on this. By putting her name on the list, she was agreeing to abide by the rules of the list, including the godly power given to the &quot;top ten&quot; on the list. Clearly Melissa would have been willing to take the camp, and benefit from the protections that the list and its rules provide. <br>
<br>
Can't have it both ways. MQ the epic for the number 1 cleric. You should not have taken the spawn, not because it is against Verant policy (its not), but because in joining the list, you agreed not to. <p>Xaanru <br>

She broke the line, and her own word, IMHO.  If she is now having second thoughts, then that is all well and good.  What happened to personal integrity?  <br>
<br>
I actually agree that, as long as no TECHNICAL KS happened, then folks that aren't on the list and don't agree with it have done nothing wrong if they take Rage without actually KSing.  Doesn't say too much about their character IMHO, but there it is.  Melissa was on the list, she should have removed herself, or lived by her position on the list, and removing right before it was to spawn don't work either. <br>
<br>
There are 2 schools of thought on this, basically, and neither appears ready to agree with the other.  I won't get into a flame war over this, and this is all simply my opinion.  I hope it is resolved so that Chami gets her clicky, but technically, Melissa did not do anything wrong, as far as Verant is concerned.  Her reputation, on the other hand, is about to take a severe beating with some folks, and reputation is VERY important in EQ.  She needs to decide what she feels is the right thing to do, and do it, whatever her decision is.  If she decides to keep it, then she lives with any consequences of that decision.  If she decides to MQ it with Chami, same thing, but I feel her reputation will not suffer as much if she does. <p>Kharne Bloodyhand <BR>

Then it's basically a race to get a force ready and aggro ragefire first.  Okay, but even if you agree with that, that doesn't sound like what happened here.  She didn't camp it for days alongside the list cleric.  She swooped in at the end and grabbed it.  I'm not trying to flame and I'm glad she hasn't turned it in and is willing to talk about it.  It seems pretty straightforward to me though.  If one wants to respect the cleric who spent days waiting for the pop, then the drop gets MQ'ed and the issue is settled.  If Melissa is number 12 on the list and given that some of the clerics probably get skipped because they don't show up, it won't be all that long before she's up anyway. <br>
<br>
I think the claim by someone else above that people on the list would move up and down week after week without getting anywhere is mostly BS.  I read the recent controversy thread on the cleric board where the list is posted.  It looks like there were 2 names added to the list that people were debating and it was because a previous cleric hadn't reported them to the person running the list.  Two.  Doesn't sound like a week after week problem.  <br>
<br>
Xaanru's post suggesting that if someone wasn't on the list, swooped in at the last minute, and aggro'ed the spawn first, then it's just fine as long as they didn't break any Verant rules really bugs me.  That makes as much sense as saying that in RL all behavior is perfectly acceptable and it's fine to treat people however you want as long as you don't break the law.  Sad.  Screw the verant rules.  It's about having respect for the effort of other players, not about whether or not some stupid verant rule was broken.  Now in this particular instance there was the issue of the main cleric being LD.  I don't know how long she was LD, but surely some effort could have been made to find out if someone was there.  Now maybe there was an attempt to contact the afk clerics and figure out what was going on.   I don't know.  But those who think it's perfectly fine to grab a spawn from someone who's been camping it for that long -- and to her credit Melissa isn't really the one saying this stuff -- are showing a sad lack of respect for others.  Might makes right I guess. <br>
<br>
hmm...  I see singhawk also doesn't give a crap if someone else has been sitting there for a week.  What the heck, if ya manage to swoop in at the last minute and do your turn in first. yippeee! Screw other people's much greater effort.  there's no set Verant rule against it so it must be okay!  Real nice.  Sounds like an attitude better suited to Unreal tournaments.<br>

<br>
Certainly, under Verant's rules, this is allowable. However, by putting your name on the List, you are entering an agreement with the other members of the list ot abide by the list's rules.<br>
<br>
You receive a guaranteed spot in line, with the assurance that the other clerics on the list will respect that spot. In exchange, you agree to respect the camps of the other clerics on the list. You also agree to abide by the rules set forth by the list makers, and modified by the top ten clerics.<br>
<br>
Most of the important interactions in Everquest rely on a certain level of trust. A person's word is very important in the high end game.<br>
<br>
Consider an armor MQ. You put 15kpp in the trade window, and click trade, receiving nothing back. Under verant policy, this means you just GAVE the 15k to the other person. Now you have to trust their word that they will honor the agreement. They do not have to, verant will not ban them. However, the EQ community will be upset with them, and may, as has happened in the past, blacklist the person.<br>
<br>
While this is not the same thing, it is a case of relying on a person's trust. If I had been the #1 cleric on the list, and knew this other cleric was in skyshrine, I would not have worried, as I would have trusted that they would abide by the agreement they made. On the other hand, if a cleric not on the list were there, I would have panicked, since they had not given their word, and had no reason not to take the spawn.<br>
<br>
I hope you can see that this is, in essence, a betrayal of trust, but ONLY because they had joined the list, and agreed to it's rules.<br>
