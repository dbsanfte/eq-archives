And if the mage was<br>
                     outdamaging your warrior and monk I would get a better warrior and<br>
                     monk.&quot;<br>
<br>
that's a 60 monk with epic and a 60 warrior primary fleshgrinder, which outdamages the warrior epic so don't give me this complete bullshiit about &quot;get a better warrior and monk.  The only way we're going to do better is to have high end velious/luclin uber mob no drop loot.  The mage destroys us.  And yes, I'm counting the dmg shield on myself and on the pet, which obviously has a better one at 50 points.  It's a grind group.  It's standard to pull extra mobs and let the pet tank one.  <br>
<br>
Yes, as someone said it's just grind groups.  Reality is unless you're in a raid every night guild, that's a large portion of the game.  If you're getting to L60, getting AA, etc. you're spending a large amount of your time grinding.  That's the way it is. Well, when everyone in the group besides the mage and maybe the healer is a @#%$ exp leech on the uber as hell mage, that's bullshit.  The mage is so far beyond everyone else that it's laughable.  In many cases the chanter/shaman slows are even annoying to our mage.  And you sure as hell better not mez the adds unless we have 4+ mobs.  It's faster and still very efficient thanks to great pet damage mitigation and regen to NOT slow the mobs on his pet so they kill themselves on the DS.  <br>
<br>
&quot;And the stuff about the mage epic being hard so it should be better<br>
                     being crap. You're opinion, you're welcome to it. But in my mind a quest<br>
                     as difficult to do as the mage epic should have a powerful reward. Yea,<br>
                     you can but the MQ rights to a lot of it, but not everyone has 70k lying<br>
                     around, and some people actually do prefer to earn thier equipment<br>
                     rather then sitting and playing the trading game all thier time.&quot;<br>
<br>
The point is there are other epics that are just as hard if not harder and don't have nearly as uber of a reward.  The epic pet is insane.  Our latest grind was in akheva killing the stupid little centis.  I typically would try to pull a couple so the pet had something to beat on.  We had a druid give it regrowth and I kind of wondered how well it tanked.  Well, it didn't need heals.  It could go one on one with centi after centi and it didn't even need a @#%$ HEAL.  The only time it needed heals from anyone was when the mage took out 2-3 mobs at a time, all piled on his pet.  Did the 60 warrior need heals?  Hell yes.  Every @#%$ fight.  So on experience mobs the pet not only does a ton of damage, it tanks way better than a decently outfitted 60 warrior.  Nope, not everyone has 70k lying around.  So what?  It still makes the quest easier.  Getting 70k to buy most of the epic is a hell of a lot easier than some epic quests.  I wish the pathetic excuse for a warrior epic could be gotten so easily and it's a vastly inferior reward.  I was strictly speaking about the difficulty of the quest.  If you can MQ parts of it, then that effects the difficulty whether you personally want to go the MQ route or not.  It does make it easier and difficulty doesn't justify the absolutely ridiculous recent upgrades that make it so powerful.  The @#%$ pet has more base hit points now than most 60 warriors.<br>
<br>
The &quot;learn to live with it&quot; comment is a copout.  Fine, ignore the blatant imbalancing that is all the dumb fucks at verant can do these days.  Others of us had the misfortune to play classes that are now pieces of @#%$ while verant continues to pump up the most powerful even more.  I love how anytime there's a class imbalance thread, there are always the &quot;quit whining!&quot; people who seldom bother to address the issues, they just repeat their mantra over and over.<br>
<br>
&quot;I would be more worried about your place than<br>
                     somebody else's.&quot;<br>
<br>
Warriors don't have a real place in a grind group anymore. Their place is &quot;experience leech&quot;.  You let them suck exp up through their levels, spend a fortune on gear (gee, wish I could get most of the way to an uber as hell overpowered item for a mere 70k), and then you might as well stuff them in the closet until raid time.  <br>
<br>
It IS a balance issue and yes, it's primarily with exp groups.  But when one class is so clearly dominant over the others in such a large area of the game, that matters.  When one class can go out and solo or duo nonstop for super fast experience and level up much faster than others, that's an issue.  When a 60 mage who's played a number of other classes is telling me himself that the class is ridiculously powerful, that he can't believe they upgraded the uber epic pet again, and that he's tearing through levels with incredible ease compared to every other class he has experience with, something is wrong.  <br>

Perhaps Verant knows more about PoP and the weapons in it and is taking the pet balancing as part of caster balancing that they are doing now with that in mind ? <br>
<br>
Just speculation, but it might explain why they are a tad out of whack now. <br>

The reason are addressing your issues is this is just NOT an issue.  It is someone looking at a small portion of the game.   Question would an epic mage pet be smart enough to taunt a mob before breaking a mez, answer no(as a matter of fact it cant break mez).  Question on a large pull can an epic pet taunt multiple mobs to help with crowd control (sure it can take one but how about 2 or 3), more than likely answer no.  Can an epic pet correctly place a mob so a rogue can use their skills, answer no.  If you were asking about a well played warrior, the answer is in all cases yes.  If I were going into CT to grind, and needed a tank I would take a warrior 10 times out of 10 over an epic mage, if I were looking for a damage dealer over a tank then yes I would prefer the mage.  The warrior brings other skills than just damage, they are better at tanking and controlling the mobs than a pet will ever be.  I say that because there is more to tanking than just taking the next available mob.<br>
<br>
Also for many people grinding in groups isnt the biggest part of the game anymore.  Verant knows this and is reorganizing the game accordingly.  Large portions of people consider raiding their main priority, and have done what they consider the needed grinding already.  Others prefer soloing or 2 person groups to doing a full group grind.  I do not consider grind groups to be so clearly dominant.  Does an epic mage gain exp as fast as a quad kiting wizard or druid, i doubt it.  Before you ask, no I am not in a high end guild, no I am not level 60. (I am 59)  I prefer to raid, in fact it is all I have time for, (that means I am excluded from the high end game but so be it)  I have a whopping 1 AA point.  This game is about learning your job and doing it.  So I do not consider this to be imbalancing at all.  Mages can finally be productive on raids other than being a COHer and a mod rod factory.  I am more than willing to accept that mages have an advantage in grind groups, to make them more involved on raids.<br>
<br>
To phrase this another way, Mages have an advantage in a grind group IF there is already a tank.  What about in other situations? <p><FONT COLOR="green" FACE="forte" size="6point" >Myles Bonaduce</FONT> <P>

<br>
I was thinking about starting my epic (warrior), and please someone tell me how much the green scale costs?  Oh wait, like 70k?  What do you mean that's just one small part of the quest?  Let me tell you, if I could buy my epic for so cheap I would.  The truth is that I can't even buy the green scale if I had the 70k, why?  Because the same guilds take the green scale mobs every time they pop.  So I don't want to hear that mage epic is the hardest epic, that's Bull$hit.  <br>
<br>
Make a druid or a necro if I want to solo?  Why the f0ck should I start a whole new class simply because I just want to log in for an hour and play, instead of 5 hours like normal EQ'ers.  Ever try playing for an hour on a warrior?  By the time you get anywhere you have ten minutes.  I've even parked myself in a grind zone, and IF, if I'm able to solo a mob and bind wounds and set off again, I can do what, 3 mobs within 20 minutes?  <br>
<br>
Are you telling me that mages are not the greatest for raids?  How many epic mages have you turned down for a raid that you've had?  There nukes don't land well, oh @#%$ I guess I'll just have to use my mage pet that will do more damage than a rogue anyway, maybe summon myself some beer and play spin the bottle.<br>
<br>
So you're saying<br>
<br>
Xp group/super uber<br>
Raid/above average<br>
<br>
Some how=average?<br>
<br>
Don't listen to VI, they don't play their game nor do they know how it works.  We're not slamming mages, it's not their fault that they are overpowered.  We're slamming VI, just agree with us, we have the right to whine just like everyone else, only VI doesn't care or listen to warriors.  <br>
<br>
I'd like to see if mages complain about their epic if a minimum of 5 pet spells drop in the new expansion, and all of them are better than their epic. wouldn't they want an upgrade then too?  How many weapons are better than the warrior epic?  It's our EPIC for crying out loud.  You don't see new cleric rezz sticks dropping do you?  Or new monk h2h weapons that have an 8 delay?  I would like to see the game balenced, I would like to not have to start a new character because VI f0cked up their own game.

Do you have any idea how hard it has been to be a mage ? Tell me, if 90% of the people on the server are looking for a 6th memeber to add to a group, which will they pick. A warrior/rogue/monk or a mage. Easy enough. I will give you a hint, it's not the mage. Ok, that settled.<br>
<br>
Even if mage pets have gotten upgrades lately, I do not feel that they are unjust. There are still places where mage pets are not allowed, even with all the changes that have been made. And also, if you are a mage that can't stand to solo then the pet upgrade is something that helps the /boggle group and isn't something you should be upset about. Me, I have always liked to be able to kill things better than before. <br>
And the mages who were soloing before are still soloing. They might be able to kill things a little faster now but they still have to dodge out of the way of the quad kiters out there. '<br>
<br>
A mage is all about offencive power. It's how it was from day one of the mage. This power was taken away greatly with every add-on. When the best weapon in the game was a Yak then yes, mages were perhaps too powerful in offence. But always remember, the ONLY way a mage can get out if something is hitting him is gate. <br>
The weapons and armor in the game now makes people laugh at a twink who has a weapon 'as bad' as a Yak. And remember, it is not until now that mages have gotten an upgrade in pets. So I think we damn well deserve to get one now. And no, I still don't think it's too much of an upgrade. <br>
<br>
You say the mage you are with can outdamage two well outfitted melee types ? Try having him do it all night long. It can't be done. The mage will have to med from time to time. I highly doubt that the pet alone can take kill. <br>
<br>
Mages can be really godo against one mob solo. Add one more and the mage is toast. And I still don't see mages soloing in WW like druids, rangers and shamans do with ease. No way in heck I could solo Talendor. So you have to look at it in a broader view. Mages are good at some things. But they really really suck at others. Mages have given up very much to get the offencive power they have at the moment. Power which has only now been given back, power we had before RoK<br>

When I grind I take one of two roles, a main tank role or a backup tank/healer role.  When I pull all I care about is having a moment to hit a few times and get 5 or 600 points of melee taunt on a mob to ensure he'll follow me back to the group without losing interest in me if someone nukes him in attempt to get him.  Once I'm back in group, if I'm main tank, which I enjoy being, then as long as I can keep that thing facing me so the whole group can kill it, then its all good.  If I'm a backup tank then I just prefer to do my damage and collect the exp when it dies.  If I do too much dmg too fast /shrug I just toss a quick cel heal, turn off attack, let the main get his aggro back and continue.  <br>
Although alot of the time I can do more damage than most of the melee in my group, its not of dire importance for me to make sure of that or to brag later.  I just do my job, and keep my eyes out for anyone in my grind group that receives undue aggro and to reclaim it.  <br>
Actually I like when people outdamage me in a group, cuz it means they are doing a LOT of damage, and thus the mob(s) die faster, like the ranger I've grouped with alot recently in Velks, during pulls he walks away from the group and just fires arrows at mobs for pretty steady hits for 400's just about every 7 seconds and the occasional crit up to 1500.  And since I can overtaunt nearly every single time, everythings fine. <p><a

When EQ came out 3 classes could solo the whole game, meaning that they could reach level 60 with out gropuping at all, Druid,Necros and, Mages. They took away some of the Necro's power and now they can't do it at all. Druids still can but it is very hard and depends on the druid wisdom, mana and casting skills. But in the case of Mages they have always been able to and now the keep getting more and more power. To say they are over compinsating is a cop out, they have been able to solo the whole game and it doesn't matter what there mana is they send the pet and when the pet dies cast another, I've seen mages solo things just like that when they can't stick spells. I don't know how hard the mage epic really is but i do i know i have a friend who is a 44 mage and she has about half the epic done already in a guild that is not raid-capable yet.<br>
simply put a mage pet shouldn't be outdamageing any melee class let alone a warrior and rouge the mage pet should be a damage dealer behind the warrior,ranger, rouge and monk dealers if a mage pet can tank and out damage a warior what good is the warrior whay would you need one in the group just pull one and let the pet tank it. Mages may have been ignored but when the game started they were more powerful than warriors in all groups then the warriors were put on par with mages and the mages complained i guess the squeaky whell does get the grease.<br>

<br>
Since EQ is technically a RPG, we'll use that as an example:<br>
<br>
Wizards in D&amp;D are powerful. Pure, raw, power. What happens when they get hit? Splat.<br>
<br>
Warriors in D&amp;D are powerful. Brute power. They can stand there and take a beating over and over and over and keep standing there.<br>
<br>
Wizards in EQ are powerful. Raw, nuke your ass down power.<br>
<br>
Warriors in EQ are powerful. They can stand there and take it like a man, so to speak, and keep fighting.<br>
<br>
I compare Wizards and Warriors because they're diffrent ends of the spectrum.<br>
<br>
Every class is powerful in their own way. Stop whining or play another one. Simple as that.<br>
<br>
The classes, to a pretty good extent, are equally powerful in diffrent ways. (With a few exceptions)<br>
<br>
It's like Warriors bitching that they can't solo. Big deal, man. You don't need to solo.<br>
<br>
I don't know where I'm going with this but I'm pretty sure it should make sense.  <p><center><i>Baroness Elawnah Zhir'Venhiruum</i><br>59 Preserver<br>Bitter Monkeys<br>Rodcet Nife</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ujinaday.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jinaday</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#333333>(8/17/02 5:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=94.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: verant's pet class (rant)</span><hr size=1> But the point is the classes were balanced for what there were untill the mages got this pet which is bay far better than just about anything else in the (excpet for maybe wizzy mana burn) and what do warriors get nothing new the power them up it's not a point of soloing it's a point of one class being utterky more powerful than another class VI is always preaching balance and that's why this came out the classes are not balanced any more now if the warrior epic was worth it or if warriors got a power boost then this argument would be pointless <p>Rodcet Nife
