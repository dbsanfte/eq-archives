Yes, it's a very neat tip, I agree. I thought it was common knowledge... my appologies. Saying something like &quot;and to think this whole time I've just been using F8&quot; would be a flame. All I did was ask a question. <br>
<br>
If you read all of my posts, you'll find that I actually don't flame people constantly. As a matter of fact, I was one of two people that didn't jump on the &quot;boycott Arirang&quot; bandwagon. The only reason it got as ugly as it did was because someone else wouldn't let it go. Hey, I'm not the one coming to the boards saying &quot;so and so KSd my orc pawn. I hate them. You need to hate them too.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't go places looking for trouble. Honestly. I will continue to state my oponion just as everyone else does. I'm sorry if that pisses you off. I have yet to start a flame here, I've only defended people that I thought were getting treated poorly by the rest of the community. I'll restrain myself next time and just sit back and allow it to happen.<br>
<br>
But anyway, to summarize, I am sorry you took what I said as a flame, as that was not my intent. <p><center><i> Baroness Elawnah Zhir`Venhiruum</i><br>

It was very snide and condescending.  Express your opinion, but when someone is giving a tip, and you smack them down that way, that is not defending anyone.  You are simply not very nice, and to me, defending ANYONE in Arirang does not count as being nice. (you brought it up here, not me)  I don't see any use in continuing to discuss this with you, as you are convinced you are so right, and holier than thou...  <br>
<br>
I am sorry that this turned into any kind of flame with my help, but Elawnah just continues to piss me off.  I will not make any more negative comments in this thread, and let it try to get back on track... <p><img src="http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/auroraknights/images/kharnesig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/uelawnah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elawnah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#333333>(6/16/02 5:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=110.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Good tip, and a polite request</span><hr size=1> Okay this is getting silly. I appologised for a sarcastic comment. I *meant what I said* when I appologised. My intent was not to flame anyone, though I can see how it could be seen that way (hence the appology).<br>
<br>
I've kept out all profanity. I've shown far more personal restraint than you have twards those that disagree with me. I have never, ever said in any form that I am better than anyone here. And I've never said only my oponion is right.<br>
<br>
As a matter of fact, I have yet to say one bad thing about you Kharne, and all you have done is repeadly attack me and throw around personal insults. We can play the quote game here, but it's not needed.<br>
<br>
You don't like me. That's been made perfectly clear. No, that will not make me go away. Sorry. Why don't you send me a tell in-game sometime and maybe we can work out our diffrences. Or would you rather just continue to belittle every single post I make here? The choice is up to you. You have yet to see me flame or get ugly over something, but it dosen't mean I wont. And no, it's not a threat before you even read that far into it. <p><center><i> Baroness Elawnah Zhir`Venhiruum</i><br>

As with 99.99999% of the people in this game I am sure she has strong opinions and convictions.  You know some people do not express them selves well on paper, their words come off differently than they were intended.  I know while I speak well, often times my tone of voice will be off and people will misinterpret what I am saying and that is vocally.   When you are reading someone's wording you can not hear their tone of voice and that can lead every one to their own conclusions of what was meant.  The same sentence can come out with 20 different emotions and effects if different words are enunciated more than others where you put the lifts and falls in your voice.  Why do you think teachers so often ask, and what do you think the author meant by this.  While authors use imagery, their words are interpreted by each person who reads them.  If you were to take one of the sentences that you say sounds sarcastic but if you were reading it to yourself and that is how you hear it in your head.  But it may have been in a mussing surprised sort of way in her head.  Maybe you should slow down and instead of pre judging all her posts as &quot;bad tempered and sarcastic&quot; try reading the post aloud in several different tones of voice.   In the end you might find that they may not be in the tone you first thought.<br>
<br>
Secondly She may not have understood that he was talking about making a last second hotkey without going to your socials.  She may have thought that he was talking about &quot; PLEASE ASSIST (BLANK)!&quot; as it is so shouted on raids where someone is on the wrong mob.   That is common knowledge and should not be posted as a helpful hint.  Where as I did not know there was a way to make a macro hotkey.  I for one did not understand what he meant till after I read someone else's post later on then went back up and read it.  She may have type the wrong words but she apologized and it should have been left at that.<br>
<br>
that is my 2 coppers. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=97672">

but it goes both way. the author should re-read what they have written (i know i miss this sometimes too), to remove any conotations that could be misinterpreted. <br>

i know notepad get's alot of work when i have to type a long post. just to remove possible flame starters.<br>
