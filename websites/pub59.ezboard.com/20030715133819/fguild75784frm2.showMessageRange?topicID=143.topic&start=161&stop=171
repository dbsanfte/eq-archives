That is the way it is. For some classes they are even useful. However the desperate *NEED* for cleric epic weapons is not propogated by them but by YOU. I have several cleric friends whom I am very close to. I have gotten tells from all of them at one point or another &quot;I just got kicked out of such and such group for a 51 cleric with their epic&quot;. So you take a lesser cleric in a better guild for a better (or faster) rez that you are sure to need taking a 51 cleric with little experience to your camp over a 55-58 cleric who was busy learning to be a cleric instead of a dwagon camper. So the lesson we teach our clerics is you are useless to me without a 56 rez. Said cleric get's 56 and now they cannot rez fast enough. Skill is clericing is apparently worthless, it's how fast can you rez me after that lack of skill becomes apparent. So Nuggruk and you other fools can scream and cry all you want about Rage being KS'd. It would not be an issue if people like you actually gave a @#%$ about the clerics themselves, and not their rezzing toy. There would be no talk of ruined marriages and all that BS if you considered the cleric type people for who they are and not what they have. <br>

The point I was making was just to express the sadness I feel that so few people would do what I strongly believe to be the right and honest thing in this situation.  Just because it is legal and ok for someone else to come and take the &quot;FFA&quot; mob that someone has been camping for a week or more, does that necessarily make it right and honorable?  I suppose being honorable is that person's choice, and to me its sad if they choose to throw out honor for their own greed.  It just made me feel very sad to hear you claim that someone who spent a week of their life camping it is &quot;retarded&quot; .... yes, perhaps they should be prepared for something bad like that to happen... but really they were just someone giving it their best shot.  No disrespect meant to your guild at all, but not everyone has the powerful numbers you guys do, nor the ability to swoop in and kill something that big on a moment's notice.  Therefore they try to camp something and plan ahead to be best prepared.  No, this does not make them retarded...and yes, it takes patience...and I believe that deserves respect, no matter how legal and possible it is that they may not actually get the spawn for themself.  <br>
<br>
I remember when I was getting my epic, another rogue in my guild was ready as well...and we scheduled a General killing party.  Unfortunately, when she went first, some rotten luck and the aggro of a skeleton got her box eaten with no General spawn.  Needless to say she was pretty bummed (no box means redoing the rest of the epic...not impossible..but a serious downer).  So when it was my turn to pop the General, I did so and we killed him...then I let her loot him.  Some people could (and did) call me a fool for giving up my epic to her, but she had waited longer than me...and it just felt like the right thing to do.  Do I think I HAD to do that? Not at all.  Do I think that doing that makes me the best person in the world? No way.  But it felt really great... and in the end it all worked out, as she did her best to help me get caught up to that point again.  We have both had our epics for a long time now, and I know I certainly feel much better about it knowing that we helped each other rather than me just telling her &quot;bummer&quot; and watching her have to do it all over.  <br>
/shrug...  not a rule that everyone has to or does follow... but its a great feeling and I just strongly recommend it to anyone.  <br>
<br>
Ok...I'm done <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  *gets off her soapbox*<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 1) Does Verant (VI) INTEND that only SOME clerics will have their epic?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Answer: Yes, of course this is their intent. Earlier this year, their change to the RF part of the Cleric epic quest, VI has in fact greatly reduced the frequency of sprinklers entering the world. VI justified this change as &quot;reducing the bottleneck&quot; of the SolB RF camp. In reality they have created a monstrosity, which we know as &quot;the list&quot; today.<br>
<br>
<br>
Consider this; prior to the change there was no list per say. How can this be? What right does the cleric sitting in Naggy's Lair, clearing FG's every 7 hrs have to &quot;claim&quot; the RF camp?<br>
<br>
Simply put, it was understood that the cleric/guild putting the time in, keeping a force on standby to clear FG's had &quot;rights&quot; to the RF camp. They WORKED for it, they EARNED the right to &quot;camp&quot; RF!<br>
<br>
During my RF camp I had many discussions with GM's about &quot;who can claim the camp&quot; after me, &quot;I'm here now clearing FG's with my guild, I lead a Naggy raid to secure the camp, no one else is doing the work except for me and my guild etc&quot;. Their official view (as it is today) is &quot;there is NO list&quot;!  Does VI acknowledge the current RF &quot;list&quot;?. Perhaps, but they have turned a blind eye to the current dilemma.  <br>
<br>
I will guarantee you given the situation, (just as with Lodizal or any other mob) first person/guild to gain agro will win rights to the prize, regardless if poorcleric_111 was camping him for the past 5 days. Remember guys, there is really no &quot;list&quot; per say. At least not in VI's official view.<br>
<br>
VI's official take is this for RF and any other mob: &quot;First person/group/guild to have forces in place to attack the mob, and gain agro has rights to the kill&quot;<br>
<br>
My personal opinion, I do not recognize the list. It is a cop out. Why should the current RF spawn in Sky Fire be treated differently then any other mob in EQ?<br>
<br>
Lose the list, petition your GM (I have) to have VI change the cleric epic RF portion back to the old way, or something better this stupid SF spawn.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just my 2cp. GL to those on the &quot;list&quot;, you guys sure do have it easy, so quit your belly aching.<br>
<br>

The only difference between your example and mine is that mine's actually happened.&quot;<br>
<br>
what proof do you have that anything a transaction like this one ever happened?  That's a pretty serious accusation against the people who maintained the list to claim that they allowed people to sell off their position on teh list and put other cleric's names in for them.<br>
<br>
and in response to Jeet -- <br>
&quot;The time you are referring to is like after AoD/AL and EK were more or less done getting a good number of their epics done. There weren't exactly alot of guilds doing Chardok royals back when this quest came out. So yes when the uber guilds were still in need of epics, this spawn was quite FFA.&quot;<br>
<br>
I see, so as long as the ubers still need their cleric epics, it should be FFA.  Well obviously you'd want that because that's the setup that most benefits the top few guilds.  People after that decided to be more civil about it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Anything after that is inconsequential, you weren't competing with fast mobilizing groups.&quot;<br>
<br>
So because later guilds couldn't be as fast as you at mobilizing for ragefire, it was inconsequential?  I don't think so.  It would have taken them longer to assemble a sufficient force then say, Ascent, but they definitely could have raced each other to the kill if they wanted to.  They chose not to and instead to allow whoever had kept the fire giants cleared and was still camping it to have first shot at Ragefire.  No, it's not in Verant's rules.  It was a players' agreement to respect the camps and each other's time.  The top tier guilds seem much more likely to have an &quot;I'll take it when I want it&quot; attitude rather than cooperating with other players/guilds.  It's all about the lewtz.  <br>
<br>
And to Siri -- <br>
You seem to be saying that since someone is too stupid to realize that all mobs are FFA, which is simply a Verant rule and something that you happen to agree with, then they are not worthy of respect and therefore there's no reason to be nice to them.  If people are dumb enough to expect others to be good without a law to force them to be good, then they aren't worthy of kindness, at least not if it requires any personal sacrifice.  Great attitude there... I simply can't imagine why so many players have a negative view of the so called uber guilds.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>

Jeet is talking about a time before Ascent was a guild.  You lack the experience and perspective to understand his argument.  I see a lot of bad mouthing of other people in this thread now. That is nice.  You wanna come here and flame a person, and then their guild/alliance and then complain about the attitude of THOSE people when they stand up and defend themselves.  There is no right/wrong black/white in this issue.  There is  alot of grey.  How much, in this case, seems to be based on whether you are either pro-list or anti-list, for the &quot;rules&quot; or think they need changing etc..  Anything that is not FFA is never going to be anything more than a gentleman's agreement to begin with.  According to the &quot;rules&quot; that are in place Melissa did not break any of them.  THEN you wanna talk about the spirit versus the letter of the law, and doing what is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;fair&quot;.  So just following the rules is not enough.  Then why do you have them?  Hell, follow the rules and you get flamed on a board like this.  Apparently doing what was right was not good enough for someone because they felt the need to start this &quot;list&quot; and make these &quot;rules&quot;.  Now it has to be both ways.  Looks more to me like someone's friend got their feelings hurt and so they came here to do some name calling to make themselves feel better over it.  Then a lot of people jump on the &quot;anti-uber&quot; band wagon based on heresay and we are left with what we have here.  Leave your spite and jealousy behind and look at the facts.  You will see a lot different picture than the one you are painting.<br>

<br>
I don't agree with it.  However, I accept it.  I'm not the one trying to create my own rules, then bind the entire server to them.<br>
<br>
And why the adverb &quot;simply&quot;?  Rules are rules;  attempting to trivialize them does not change that.  No player in the game is above the rules, and has the right to expect more than what the rules entitle them to receive.<br>
<br>
&quot;then they are not worthy of respect and therefore there's no reason to be nice to them. If people are dumb enough to expect others to be good without a law to force them to be good, then they aren't worthy of kindness, at least not if it requires any personal sacrifice.&quot;<br>
<br>
If that's the only thing I have to go on to get an impression of what that person is like, then yeah, they're going to come across to me as a dumbass.  One would hope they would know better, but they either lack or choose to ignore common sense in favor of how they want things to be.<br>
<br>
&quot;Great attitude there... I simply can't imagine why so many players have a negative view of the so called uber guilds.&quot;<br>
<br>
Why, because we aren't as charitable to non-ubers as you would like us to be?  It's up to you as an individual/guild to earn what you want.  If someone does a random act of kindness for you, well cool, you scored.  But the notion that it's somehow okay to expect it is ridiculous.  I am very inclined to be nice to strangers, but the second they start asking for it as though they are entitled, that inclination goes away.  That doesn't mean I won't take the time to CR someone who desperately needs it and asks me nicely.  However, if someone expects to have FFA_mob_01 uncontested just because he was there before I was, he had better get used to disappointment.<br>
<br>
I have every right to decide when and how I will be charitable.<br>

<br>
In a word, yes.<br>
<br>
In more words, I don't necessarily agree that that is the best way to do things.  But I NEVER expect not to be steamrolled (or whatever you want to call it) when camping a FFA mob, and nobody else should either.  If I'm camping something, and someone else decides to camp the spawn at the last minute, you had better believe I'm going to ask for help immediately, and not give him any time (or as little time as possible) to get his own group together to beat me to the kill.  But I won't be a retard and expect him to leave.<br>
<br>
Quite frankly, I never would have even considered steamrolling anyone for any FFA mob, until this crap with the RF list started.  Now I will gladly steamroll anyone on the list who thinks the list somehow entitles him to RF uncontested, IF that is the will of the Cleric I am helping at the time.  But I'm not out to get anyone;  I have better things to do than camp RF for a guild Cleric, with the hopes of steamrolling someone else.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Oh, I almost forgot to address this:<br>
<br>
&quot;I simply can't imagine why so many players have a negative view of the so called uber guilds.&quot;<br>
<br>
Everything I post that people find so distasteful is my view only.  Lumping every uberguild in with me isn't necessarily fair to them.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
