Mythic Entertainment is named as the defendant in this case filed on Febuary 5th 11:50AM involving various anti-trust, copyright, and anti-competitive issues. BlackSnow Interactive (BSI) is a group of individuals that play, buy, and sell in various Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPG). Growing from only one person nearly two years ago, to seven full-time people, this group has successfully developed a market in which they are able to supply players with gaming currency, items, or characters at competitive prices. Mythic wants BSI to cease all sales immediately. <br>
<br>
After entering the DAoC market, shortly after its release, BSI created a website and began listing their sales on various auction sites, such as Ebay. BSI’s Director of Sales, Lee Caldwell, was quoted as saying, “What it comes down to is, does a MMORPG player have rights to his time, or does Mythic own that player’s time? It is unfair of Mythic to stop those who wish to sell their items, currency or even their own accounts, which were created with their own time. Mythic, in my opinion, and hopefully the court’s, does not have the copyright ownership to regulate what a player does with his or her own time or to determine how much that time is worth on the free market.“ <br>
<br>
Caldwell goes on to say, “Mythic’s attempt to stifle competition in their own game makes it possible for only full-time gamers to succeed in the game and most MMORPG players can’t compete on that level. The person that plays just a few hours a week, can’t put in the time required to build their character or collect the items needed to join others in the online battles. No one has stood up to any of these software giants, until now.” <br>

What they do on thier own time is thier business...but when it effects the game and the other people that play the game then it becomes a problem and the company that runs the game has the right to say no...<br>

Just  a thought.<br>
<br>
Verant/Mythic/Funcom was never gonna touch that money anyways, because they don't sell items to people for money, so I don't see why a company would be so upset about it. I believe its a honor that people would spend 1000 bucks just to be high level in a game I made lol.<br>

<br>
I think they (BSI) had/ have a good idea. People like me who cannot play all weekend long because we have jobs and families cannot camp a mob all weekend. Or even one night. <br>
<br>
So those people who truly want to &quot;keep up wth the Joneses&quot; and have the cool items and are willing to buy them with 'real' money, can &quot;Keep up&quot;. I personally don't make enough extra money to buy crap off of Ebay (nor could I justify an expense to my boss hehe) but I like the idea for people in my similiar situation. <br>
<br>
You don't like a 'professional' player farming something? I don't like that because I can play a few hours a week I have no chance of getting anything &quot;uber&quot;. <br>
<br>
IMHO I think Verant should just put them out of business... Have a page off of the Sony page that you enter your station ID into and can buy these things at normal Ebay prices. You buy it online and viola, it appears in your bank next time you log on. Verant could make even more money and not have to resort to stupid ideas like &quot;EQ Legends&quot;...<br>
<br>
And Ebayers are not the only people who &quot;farm&quot;. They are the same as the people who &quot;farm&quot; crap just to sell in EC. Like guilds farming GEBs all week long...<br>

What would be so bad about someone who does not have the time or platinum to have a way to get the same gear as those of you without jobs or families that can play EQ all the time?<br>

What would be so bad about less farming? (If I can buy online, why waste my time farming? If EQ can sell online cheaper then I want to, why would I make a career out of farming?)<br>

As far as the &quot;gov&quot; supporting people... Well, that is a whole nother rant.

<br>
Selling stuff off may or may not be the most moral idea when it comes to game balancing and whatnot, but it is a right people should have.  As a 17 year old, I can't compete with someone if they want to buy items/accounts for RL money, as I am paying for insurance, car, friends, girls, school, everything.  I have only so many hours a week with which to work due to said schooling.  I may not like other people getting ahead of me, I may not like that I will be the worst equiped EQ player because of lack of time or RL money to give to EQ, but that doesn't change my opinion that if you have pumped your time into EQ and you want to get out, you should have a way to find some sort of compensation for your blown time.  No, I won't be selling off my account when I'm done (prolly no buyers anyways =P), but in the interests of what is right and wrong, I don't feel that Verant or any other company should be able to restrict you on what you do with your time.<br>
<br>
What people do with their rights may not always be the best, but it is important to maintain those rights.<br>
<br>
I hope I've gotten my point across, but in case it doesn't make much sense, allow me to (attempt to) clarify:<br>
I pay Verant RL money to play their game.  I put time into said game.  My time could be spent working.  Thus, time = money.  Therefore, I am paying Verant a monthly amount to play the game and I am GIVING Verant more money (time) that I will never see a return on in the real world.  I say giving, because this time will never affect the real world, with the exception of ruined marriages, relationships, jobs, etc.  UNLESS, I sell off my account.  If Verant made any other kind of RL money off of your time, such as advertising, I would even be in favor of Verant paying YOU a lil somethin somethin in return.<br>
<br>
Where is their right to say that you cannot receive some kind of compensation for your time, if a buyer is obliging?<br>
This game is not their life's work, items and accounts are not unique quotes, and they do not have a right to &quot;publish&quot; other peoples time.<br>
<br>
&lt;quote&gt; It's idiotic to think people should be allowed to make money off another person's product without at least paying them royalties. &lt;quote&gt;<br>
OK, my product is my character, and they are making money off of the time I have put into it.  Where are my royalties?<br>
<br>
Lilye is right, it does take the game out of it, but not on such a wholescale level that it completely affects the game world.  Items will always end up on lower level characters...in what is called twinking.  People will always level at an astonishing rate beyond what they should...in what is called powerleveling.  If you were to say you can't sell your account, in essense, your time, then you would also have to disallow twinking and powerleveling as well.  Those two activities upset the balance of the game as well, but on a much larger scale.<br>
<br>
In closing, I will not buy or sell items or accounts for RL money, however, I feel that it is the right of people to do with their time as they please.  (Where that time has to do with legal and allowed acts; please, no out of context crap in this argument)<br>

But please, if you would, don't attack me, or my life, attack my argument more.  And my eyes ARE open.   If I went to a basketball game, I do expect to be paid back.  That payment is fun, if you will.  An example: I'm a pretty tolerant guy, but I have been to movies that have sucked sooo terribly bad or have been so offensive, that people have demanded their money back -- and gotten it.  They went for the payment of fun...they paid to be entertained.  People play EQ to be entertained, in one form or another, and often times along with other reasons.  But in the end, if you aren't having fun, then what have you paid for?  <br>
<br>
There is no way for Verant to set a price on fun, so I think the people that want to sell their items and accounts should be able to -- whatever it means to them (this is not to say that anyone must pay what they want...only that they be allowed to sell).  As for Verant paying us, that was merely an exaggeration to further illustrate my point.<br>
<br>
I am not saying that Verant should pay us back for our time.  I am only stating that Verant should not have the right to decide if we can receive that payment from someone else who IS willing.  Personally, I don't think people should buy and sell accounts, but what I want doesn't factor into what I think is moral or immoral, right or wrong, justice or injustice.  I want justice, so to speak.<br>
Read that again:  &quot;I don't think people should buy and sell accounts.&quot;  But, someone else may think otherwise.  That is their right.  They have that right.  And I think they have the right to sell their @#%$ if it makes em happy.  <br>
<br>
In its most base form, EQ boils down to a collection of memories and time.  Analogy:  I buy a house.  I love my house.  I live in my house for 10 years, accumulating furniture, curtains, bird feeders, cool salt and pepper shakers, and a basketball hoop.  And memories.  A sewage plant is erected near my home.  The smell is unbearable.  I can no longer stand to live here.  Do I just give it up and walk away?  I paid to live in this house, I CHOSE to live here; can I be prevented from selling off the furniture in my house because it now carries the stench or the entire house because of how much time I invested in it?  Do memories mean nothing?  That house was my first.  That character was my first.  I paid off my mortgage.  I made it to level 50.  I had barbecues.  I punted gnomes.  I joined a guild.  I made a bunch of great friends.  My home contains memories of all these things, just as my character does.  And NO ONE, not you, not Verant, not some GM can tell me what those memories mean to me as I consider getting rid of a source of those memories.  It is my right to set the price on that; Verant cannot own my memories or my time, they belong to me.<br>
