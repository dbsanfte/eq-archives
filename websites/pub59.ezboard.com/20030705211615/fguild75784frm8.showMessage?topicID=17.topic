<br>
let's see, he drops i think 4 epic pieces mixed in with his normal crappy ass drops (malise wands that sorta thing) and he's quite stingy with most of the drops, except the robe usually.<br>
<br>
I got lucky on my phin camp, took me a mere 9 kills to get him to put out a BCS, but I remember Azmoran killed him about 42 times and never got a staff, he finally got lucky with Aanen felt like being nice and payed some guy 40k or something to MQ with Azmo. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ufalconlore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Falconlore</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00bie</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#333333>(4/15/02 11:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Long Camps</span><hr size=1> I just LOVE the burning priest camp in scarlet dessert.  I have camped it 4 times helping guild and BF for sheild quest.  First time Camped it 4 hours then had to raid then came back after raid waited 5 hours for camp and and the person camping it had to log and the priest spawned 8 hours later so my 4 + thier 10 + my 8 = 22 hours.  Secondtime they left again after I had waited for spot for 2 hours  I camped it for 12 dont know how long they held camp before they left.  3rd time I camped it 21 hours my BF came and helped me and let me take a nap.  4th time I logged in the ph was not camped I killed it and got booted  looked on the net for a few came back and the person I was starting camp for was fighting the burning priest after 1 kill.  /em shoots Burning Priest in the head in frustration. <p>Falconlore Asguardian

For the druid +10 wis book. 7 1/2 hours for that.. but boi was I proud... <br>
<br>
/em Azulez thought she was uuuuuuber!<br>
<br>
Next one was a little nastier... I *HAD* to get gatorscale leggins for my druid, but as a TRUE newb... there was no way I could afford the 700pp for the leggins.  I finally got the camp (this is when this camp was actually some what popular) and camped the AC for 14 hours, eating a few unrezzed deaths!  AC finally spawned and dropped the arms! LOL.. i wanted to cry.. fortunatly the next person in line had gotten legs and wanted arms so we traded.  <br>
<br>
FYI in case ya didn't figure it out AC = Ancient Croc...<br>
<br>
Only other camp I did was the old Ragefire camp.<br>
<br>
/rude to VI for that one<br>
<br>
Me and my boyfriend took turns watching that camp for 4 days.  Considering he stayed up 18 hours a day to watch that camp, I would camp it for as long as I could keep my eyes open, wake him up, and then go to bed.  LOL.. best part was he camped it on his four days off.  The first night of his work rotation, ragefire popped not even an hour after he left for work! LOL... the ironcy.. the ironcy..<br>
<br>
Anywho...<br>

I'm sure there are numerous rants about it.  They were supposedly trying to cut down on competition for spawn when they changed it. /boggle.  They made it spawn less (5-7 days apart) and now all clerics can camp it no matter where they are in their epic.  People are handing out their account password to half their guild and camping it literally 24/7 for 3 weeks while they wait in line.  Unbelievable.  Most of the clerics I know have given up on getting their epics.  Verant once again shows that they have no idea how their game works.<br>

Nor was it to lessen competition or the bottleneck. (other epics have bottlenecks that are equally as bad) The purpose of the move was to separate ragefire's spawn from the Nagafen spawn. Waiting for a 52 and lower group to kill Nagafen, so THEN the cleric could camp Ragefire is what Verant was trying to avoid. I saw this somewhere on a more &quot;official&quot; site. (prob casterrealm news)<br>
<br>
Verant had to move it to some zone where there was already a red dragon polygonal model, and Skyfire was it. The intent of the Ragefire change was not to make it easier or reduce competition, but to get him away from being dependant on when Naggy was killed.<br>

I kinda doubt it.  Sorry, but the people at Verant are real morons on this one.  Also it was supposed to be a max of 3 day spawn time.  If I remember right, Verant said as much.  It's not.  It's 5-7 days.  They basically cut the rate of epics entering the game in half and haven't bothered to fix it.  Exactly how hard is to set the timer in their code?  Hint -- shouldn't be hard at all.  Oh yeah, they have no idea how their game works. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
