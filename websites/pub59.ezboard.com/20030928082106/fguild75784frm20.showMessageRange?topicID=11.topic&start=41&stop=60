A lot of people say there are tons of better weapons than the warrior epics, which is true. But most of those weapons are not within the means of attaining for the average player. That's why the warrior epic isn't too bad. I know because I use them myself.<br>
<br>
Jaraxalle this is not a hit on you, but it's merely some advice. You should be thinking about getting weapons that are within your means. At level 51, the warrior epics are not within your means. If you tried to fight Severilous you'd be stunned for the whole fight and I'd be surprised if you got a swing in.  Look for some nice weapons within you means and fight for them, stuff like Defiance and Lamentation. Or if you have some cash go to the bazaar and look for a Frostbringer or Crescent Blades of Luclin.<br>
<br>
In my mind the warrior epics take a solid team of people 55-60 to get, they are a little harder but they are well worth it. Getting the warrior epics is just a stepping stone to harder stuff. If you combine the red sword and Horrifying Visage on an MT, you can easily generate enough agro to MT a lot of big mobs.<br>
<br>
As far as doing each step, well you aren't going to succeed on the first try more than likely. But not succeeding is no reason to give up, it's a way you learn in this game. We didn't get to the Spiroc Island in PoA until our second raid to PoA. We didn't take the queen until our second try. Those two encounters are probably the toughest parts of the warrior epic. If you can gather a raid force, you can at least learn how to do them.<br>
<br>
There are plenty of warriors that never get their epics, they go on to get better weapons. But I am sure if you asked them, if they were given the opportunity to complete the epics, they might want to do it just for fun. Seeing the blue and red lightsabers is pretty cool in itself. At any rate, it's a nice thing the warrior epics aren't a given. Not to knock rangers, but their epics are almost a given, for them it's not if they will get their epics, it's really about when.<br>
<br>
The way I see it, I am glad the warrior epic is not easy. I like it that way because every warrior on the server isn't running around with them. It's a prestige item and definitely still an achievement, because there are still encounters that can't be 1-grouped.<br>

I don't take offense, I know I'm a little low for getting my epic.  However, wouldn't it be nice to get something fixed before you get it?<br>
<br>
I mean I won't get my epic most likely, simply because of the lame cost involed in getting an inferior weapon.  Like Heimdall said I can get better weapons for cheaper.  I saw a fleshgrinder for 40k the other day, the green scale alone would be more than that let alone everything else.  <br>
<br>
Can't we make it something that is worth getting?  I don't really care if it's made harder or added onto.  Make it something that we can be proud of.  <br>
<br>
When I started this thread, I wanted to know what the warrior community wanted for an upgrade.  What would most people feel is a sufficient upgrade?  Thie thread was hijacked long ago with shouts of &quot;it will never happen&quot;, and &quot;non-warriors saying it doesn't need an upgrade&quot;.  I don't think there was one good suggestion for an upgrade.  One person did suggest right click true north, LOL.  <br>
<br>
I thought this would spark some good ideas, some interesting conversation, and some positive comments.  Apparently not. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ujaraxalle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaraxalle</A> at: 10/10/02 2:56:04 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/umigatolsmashmouth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Migatol Smashmouth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#333333>(10/10/02 4:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Epic Upgrad</span><hr size=1> The value of the warrior epic is not in it's damage delay, it's all in the stats and the proc.<br>
<br>
First off the warrior epics provide +15 STA and +100 HPs, that's roughly +190 HPs overall, which is very nice. Next they give +10 to all resists, also a very nice bonus especially since the resist revamp.<br>
<br>
But the most valuable part of the epics is the Rage of Vallon proc. That gives you 500 points of agro, and does a 100 point DD. It procs a lot, I usually get at least 5+ procs per fight, that amounts to about 2500 points of agro and 500 points of damage per fight while grinding and far more on big mobs like dragons.<br>
<br>
There's only one other 1-hand slash in game that delivers direct increase of agro similar to the Rage Vallon in the game, that would be Bloodfrenzy which is off Vyzh`dra the Cursed in Ssraeahza Temple.<br>
<br>
So to tell you the truth, yes the warrior epic doesn't have a superior damage/delay, but it is a very good set of warrior swords as the 1hs versions. Considering the difficulty of acquiring the warrior epic, it's a nice reward in my opinion, because we get exactly what we want and need, the ability to get more agro. Beyond level 55, it means so much to keep agro.<br>
<br>
Our job as warriors are to be the &quot;Main Tanks&quot; we take damage, we are the big guys. How many times have you been in Plane of Hate and a Spite Golem is beating the crap out of a Ranger, while you are pounding on the Taunt key trying to peel it off of him? When the warriors can get and keep agro, everyone else can spend their time beating up the mob that is being fought. A dead grind group or raid party is no fun when you are the last one standing because you have the most HPs. LOL, believe me, I know it well, I've been there 100 times.<br>
<br>
Since I have a set of warrior epics, I can tell you they are excellent weapons, and if they were to upgrade them, I wouldn't complain. But as is, I am happy.<br>

But that's my opinion, i'm all about fast weapons as opposed to better weapons heh. Bloodpoint is my offhander, and i think that even it's too slow for a delay of 21. But i love the proc, seems to make up for the lost delay - plus sentimental value.<br>
<br>
As for an upgrade. I wouldn't mind seeing a 14/22 (just decrease of 2 points, 14/20 is getting too close to setting the epic to today's standard weapons and no one else really has that benefit). It doesn't sound too absurd because you can find cheap weapons for similar or better ratio. I said before about the haste that every other duel wielder has (or a plus to attack, or both - i'm sorry but Rogues having one of the EASIEST epic quests with high haste buff and 40atk) while warriors are kinda SOL in that department. Don't get me wrong, i don't think damage is THE most important thing when it comes to warrior weapons, BUT it would definetly help.<br>
<br>
And Mig, I can definetly see what you're saying, the quest is not easy for a reason, I totally agree.... but at the same time, it can be a bit too much for me personally (can't speak for everyone). I'm so close, but so far away haha. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ujaraxalle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaraxalle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cons Threateningly </span><br>  Posts: 59<br> <font color=#333333>(10/10/02 10:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> whatever</span><hr size=1> Thanks Def for being the only person to post on topic thus far.<br>

I am aware of the stats of the epic, else I never would have started this post.  Sure the weapons are nice, but they are badly outdated.  Almost everyone else's epics have an ability that no other item really has.  i.e. right click rez, dots, epic pet, right click haste, etc.  The concept for our epics is awesome, goes from 2 one handers to a 2 hander, that's pretty sweet IMO.  <br>
<br>
Let me rephrase my question so that people will stay on topic.  If VI were going to add on to the epics, everyone being able to have a regular epic, and then upgrade it and hand an upgraded epic, what would you like it to be?  From warriors I've talked to no one uses the blue blade, the red blade has insane aggro only topped by a few weapons in the game although it's delay is a little high.  Def says that 14/22 would be cool, IMO that would be fine if there were no additions to the quest and the upgrade was free.  However for killing some uber PoP mobs it would be cool to see something of a bloodfrenzy or Blade of carnage caliber.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/uheimdallazureguardian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Heimdall Azureguardian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cons Dubious </span><br>  Posts: 172<br> <font color=#333333>(10/11/02 11:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: whatever</span><hr size=1> I'd like to see them balance the quests and the reward.  If one quest is easy to do- either because people want to help for tertiery drops, or guild benefit, or because its just plain easy- then the reward should be less.<br>
<br>
To be honest, I'm not interested in seeing them add a second epic that has a prerequisite of the first epic.  Mostly because I don't want to do my first epic.<br>
<br>
Again:<br>
<br>
SoZ/FG is 175hp, and a proc for 160DD.  It doesn't have the added hate, but the weapons are much stronger/faster, and the DD is more.  I think it balances out agro-wise.  <br>
<br>
I've said it before:  It all comes down to this:<br>
<br>
The Green Scale sells for 100K+.  SoZ/FG is a better combo for agro management.  Any guild that needs to get their warrior into epics for agro generation is just shooting themselves in the foot.  They should just farm a green scale and sell it for better overall performance.  As more people figure this out though the Green Scale might drop in price. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/urexxor12.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rexxor12</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowls at you rdy to attack!</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#333333>(10/12/02 3:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: whatever</span><hr size=1> Woot! i can sell my greenscale for 100k and have instant gratification on a new set of uber weapons?

Of course with new PoP epics (if there are some) will cause the kunark epics to be easier b/c less people will want them. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=410866 Profile </a>

<br>
So why am i feeling that VI isn't going to buy my &quot;Agnostic is actually a god's name who's pacifist and likes rangers a lot&quot; bit?<br>
<br>
And I'm sorry but Agnostic diety armor is a load of crock. Coming from an Agnostic I wonder if this means something. Agnostic and diety are oxymorons. :P<br>
<br>
I knew there was a downside to being able to MQ about everything in da world :P<br>
<br>
By the way Jarax, want to apologize, very true about what you said. As far as a turn in aspect 14/22 would be lame. Personally I'd be happy with anything at this point for an upgraded turn in. Hell I'd be happy for FT1 on it :P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub59.ezboard.com/ujaraxalle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaraxalle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cons Threateningly </span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#333333>(10/16/02 7:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub59.ezboard.com/fguild75784frm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  EEP!</span><hr size=1> I know how bad it sucks to be agnostic, I made that mistake 3 years ago when I made my character.  Back then it made no difference at all what god you choose.  I picked agnostic b/c I wanted to be a &quot;friendly troll&quot;.  I hope agnostics will get thrown a bone in PoP but VI is rather random with that they think is important to fix, upgrade, and *gasp* nerf.  If there's nothing for agnostics in PoP I'm sorry to say that I'll probably re-roll and start an uber twink warrior.  Why because the theme is &quot;gods&quot; for PoP and not being able wear anything diety is really going well, suck.  I've been told by some people that there will be something.  How much of something, will be seen next week I suppose.<br>
<br>
The thing that bothers me about the epics damage delay is that a centi longsword is 14/27.  A 1k weapon is only 3 delay worse than our epic?  Sure the epics are all about the procs, but the ratio's are so badly outdated that like others have said, &quot;don't use the blue blade but use the red blade in the offhand.&quot;   At this point I see diety weapons all over this expansion.<br>

Red epics create much aggro.  Enough aggro that, that and a willsapper or that and a fleshgrinder can allow the bearer to outtaunt a BoC or SoD.  Not 100% of the time, but enough to make it noticible.  The only thing that makes the epics really iffy is the dmg/delay.  But with a good haste item (s) and enchanter speed, they are still great for grouping and tanking lower tier mobs.  By the time you get to the harder mobs that require getting more extensive aggro, you should have better.<br>

The epic is not hard to get at all. Trust me. Do I have it no, do I want it sure if the mobs are up. Sev is up we iwll gank him, one of our tanks wants epics. As for other weapons that are better and easier to get...<br>
