<p align="left">The M. Interviews.</p>
<p align="left"><i>I met my brother Jeff at the airport. He was wearing a pair 
  of Calvin Klein Ratty Ass Jeans and a Peyote Stained Pullover. We immediately 
  went to the local bar and launched an international incident when we told the 
  bartender we wanted to &quot;Live free or die.&quot; My brother then pulled 
  out his H&amp;K .40 cal USP and demanded a Lagavulin, neat. I pulled out my 
  I.D. and asked for a Bud. Over the next several days, we conducted this interview.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>[I no longer know which of this is actually true. None of it, 
  I think.]</i></p>
<p align="left">But before we start ... a glossary of terms in order to appease 
  the censors:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Cackling Klaknak - Joe</p>
  <p>Psycho Gun Wielding Klaknak - Jeff</p>
  <p>Santa Claus - an unspeakable sexual act that most women refuse to do</p>
  <p>candy caning - the act of sexual congress</p>
  <p>Power bar - fart</p>
  <p>Cheese poofs - Cheese puffs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now, the interview.</p>
<p>CK: PGWK, you have worked for several great restaurants and bars in Atlanta. 
  What will you be serving tonight.</p>
<p>PGWK: We have a interesting variety of apps. this evening. May I suggest the 
  Prime Tenderloin Boeuf en Croute. It is served with a whole grain dijon mustard 
  sauce and a toasted baguette. We also have prepared a Maryland style Crab Cake 
  with a key lime buerre blanc and chipotle pepper coulis. For the main entree, 
  we will be having Braised Georgia Rabbit served with string sweet potatoes over 
  smoked portabello and feta raviolis with a balsamic glaze. To finish off the 
  meal, we will be having a big ass bowl of Ben and Jerry's Cherries Garcia.</p>
<p>CK: As you know, I am concerned about my palate. What wine will you be serving?</p>
<p>PGWK: A 1980 Lafite Rothchild</p>
<p>CK: As you know, I am concerned about my palate. What liqueur will you be serving?</p>
<p>PGWK: Blueberry Schnapps</p>
<p>CK: As you know, I am concerned about my palate. What liquor will you be serving?</p>
<p>PGWK: Louis XIII, made by Remy Martin ... of course.</p>
<p>CK: As you know, I am concerned about my palate. What spritzers will you be 
  serving?</p>
<p>PGWK: A Boone's Farm Strawberry Field Spritzer, only the best.</p>
<p>CK: As you know, I am concerned about my palate. What cognacs will you be serving?</p>
<p>PGWK: Hennessy VS with a lot of fucking coke!</p>
<p>CK: By coke, you mean the soda coke.</p>
<p>PGWK: Of course.</p>
<p>CK: Also, we have some parents out there who are unable to parent their children 
  properly, so we must censor such offensive language. I refer you to the glossary 
  above.</p>
<p>PGWK: Right. Candy caning.</p>
<p>CK: As you know, I am concerned about my palate. What bourbons will you be 
  serving?</p>
<p>PGWK: Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon</p>
<p>CK: As you know, I am concerned about my palate. What hallucinogens will you 
  be serving?</p>
<p>PGWK: My peyote stained pullover.</p>
<p>CK: As you know, I am concerned about my palate. What chemistry lab manufactured 
  90's rave smack will you be serving?</p>
<p>PGWK: A potpourri of different drugs all combined into one pill. Otherwise 
  known as X.</p>
<p>CK: As you know, I am concerned about my palate. What horse tranquilizer will 
  you be serving?</p>
<p>PGWK: Ketamine</p>
<p>CK: I am concerned. What are the dangers of Ketamine?</p>
<p>PGWK: Ketamine stops the user from feeling pain, which could lead the user 
  to cause injury to him or herself without them knowing it. It also lowers the 
  heart rate and so with larger doses it can lead to oxygen starvation to the 
  brain and muscles. An overdose can also cause the heart to stop. Tolerance (needing 
  more and more to have the same effect) to ketamine can be quickly built up if 
  it is used regularly. It is not known whether ketamine use can lead to psychological 
  or physical dependence, although both may be likely in some individuals.. Due 
  to this drug being relatively new on the street its long term effects are not 
  really known. So some of the dangers from using Ketamine may not be known for 
  many more years. </p>
<p>CK: But certainly, the peyote will cancel any ill effects.</p>
<p>PGWK: Indeed.</p>
<p>CK: Ok. Good. Um, what will we <b>really</b> be drinking?</p>
<p>PGWK: Dos Equis, Bud and some Dimple Pinch</p>
<p>CK: Dude, ok. Now that we have wrestled the truth from you about our alcohol 
  selection, what will we really be eating?</p>
<p>PGWK: Steamed mussels in a lemon grass butter sauce and beer brats.</p>
<p>CK: And, of course, you agree that drugs are wrong.</p>
<p>PGWK: Maybe.</p>
<p><i>At this point, Jeff considers starting dinner, but Joe points out that we 
  are too busy listening to Metallica to do anything constructive. He agrees. 
  More later ...</i></p>
<p>[time elapses ... Dos Equis is betrunken (with Bud and Dimple Pinch in reserve)]</p>
<p>CK: I have to say ... that cheap ass dinner was actually pretty good. Tell 
  us how you made it.</p>
<p>PGWK: Simple. Lots of BUTTER! (like but-tah) Clam Juice, garlic, lemon grass 
  and LOTS OF BEER to help the creative juices flow from the clams to the sauce. 
  Cordon Bleu school doesn't hurt much either.</p>
<p>CK: I see. But unless I am very much mistaken, mussels played a role in our 
  evening.</p>
<p>PGWK: Mommy ... where's fluffy?</p>
<p>CK: Come again?</p>
<p>PGWK: Oh, I'm sorry. Where is the glossary? I wanted to put use my muscle to 
  have Santa Claus with a chick, but I found that candy caning and power baring 
  do not go well together. In order to Santa Claus a girl with the mussles in 
  a lemon grass butter sauce, you have to use cheese poofs and a big gun. That 
  is, of course, to achieve the right consistency you must allow the sauce to 
  reduce with the mussels intact.</p>
<p>CK: Welcome back. My brother and I are talking about Everquest. </p>
<p>PGWK: What the hell is up with those candy caning rats? I thought that a rat 
  would not be a problem. Apparently I have been snookered. </p>
<p>CK: I just realized that your excursion into EQ was fucked [candy caned] up 
  because the CAP LOCKS were on. Or we're extremely drunk.</p>
<p>PGWK: I was in an unusual world. It was dark. I couldn't adjust to it. I was 
  scared.</p>
<p>CK: Ok, so you picked the only candy caning race I have never played as a starting 
  race (ogre). I had no candy caning idea where the candy cane you were. You did, 
  however, fall into some water rather skillfully. </p>
<p>PGWK: It was not really hard to do. I was looking around trying to figure out 
  how the candy cane to get out of town when I realized that I was underwater 
  with no clue how to breathe. That was when I realized that I wasn't in candy 
  caning Kansas anymore.</p>
<p> CK: You see, PGWK, you do not understand roleplaying. In good roleplaying 
  games like EQ ... games that imitate real life ... people look for ways to leave 
  towns but end up falling off of fucking cliffs all the fucking time ... just 
  as in real life. This is the essence of roleplaying ... life building, if you 
  will. I have never understood why roleplaying games need evil warlords, satans, 
  gods, etc. Just trying to find a piece of fucking leather armor is enough to 
  turn most warriors into ... what? Shit, I need some more beer ....</p>
<p>PGWK: Power bar.</p>
<p>CK: Look, man. I am being serious here. Roleplaying games are serious. Any 
  roleplaying game that does not capture the dynamicism of life is an utter failure. 
  I want a game to talk to me ... care for me ... love me ... Let's face it .. 
  you wanted to simply leave the town ... and you ended up drowning. Where is 
  the love?</p>
<p>PGWK: Apparently this game does capture the dynamicism of life. Let's face 
  it ... I was in town and needed some love to help my soul and I got power bared 
  on. Just like in real life. Try to make it in a town and receive a major candy 
  cane in the Santa Claus.</p>
<p>CK: Ok, I feel like we have talked about EQ long enough to satisfy the assholes 
  who feel I must remain on topic at all time. Why do you think that most women 
  hate Santa Claus?</p>
<p>PGWK: Because he hurts when he is on top.</p>
<p>CK: Do you think we are unreasonable to ask for Santa Claus?</p>
<p>PGWK: Not if you have really been good this year. It doesn't hurt ... just 
  relax.</p>
<p>CK: Exactly. First, you need to relax just as if you are sitting down and taking 
  a nice long ...</p>
<p>PGWK: Hey, what are our parents doing tonight?</p>
<p>CK: Indeed, I think it is time we introduce our parents. They were both pretty 
  tough on us, but together they introduced us to a world outside that is both 
  loving and kind. Here is the precise DNA construction leading to our fortunate 
  births: </p>
<p><img src="../Images/dad.jpg" width="279" height="314"><img src="../Images/plus.jpg" width="104" height="77"> 
  <img src="../Images/yodasatan.gif" width="282" height="267"> <img src="../Images/equal.jpg" width="120" height="78"></p>
<p><img src="../Images/spawn.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oops ... correction. Our mother is not a Satanic Yoda. She is the Virgin Mary. 
  Our apologies. Here is a picture of our real mother:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../Images/mom.jpg" width="252" height="348"></p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Joe: Jeff, let us dispense with the silly names. Who would you prefer as a 
  mother? The Virgin Mary or a Satanic Yoda?</p>
<p>Jeff: Help you I can ... yes.</p>
<p>Joe: Ok, so I take after my father. Answer the question!</p>
<p>Jeff: I think attributes of both.</p>
<p>Joe: Attrite is to ibg a word.</p>
<p>Jeff: Big guns ... beer ... candy caning ... Santa Clausing ... I guess that 
  points in only one direction ... However ... if I remark ... I will burn forever.</p>
<p>Joe: Ok, so I talked with our dad. And you talked with our mom who is both 
  the Satanic Yoda and the Virgin Mary, depending on the ether intake. What did 
  you say to mom?</p>
<p><img src="../Images/jeffmom.jpg" width="219" height="163"> Jeff: Mom, I have 
  had a lot of ether tonight! I just wanted to know the deeper implifications 
  of clearer thinking concerning Power baring while Santa Clausing.</p>
<p> Joe: I think it is &quot;implications&quot; not &quot;implifications&quot;. 
  [You are drunk].</p>
<p>Jeff: Too drunk ... Too much ether! So what did you ask our forgiving father? 
  What did he used to tell us? &quot;There are some things nobody needs in this 
  world, and a bright red, hunchback, warp-speed 900cc café racer is one of them 
  -- but I want one anyway, and on some days I actually believe I need one. That 
  is why they are dangerous&quot;. That is what is wrong in this world. I understand 
  now that in order to be successful you need a warp-speed 900cc racer. Before, 
  I was satisfied with the 450cc version.</p>
<p>Joe: Indeed. Certainly, many children of parents feel the need to meet up to 
  the expectations of those who went throught the laborious process of sexual 
  intercourse in order to create us. For my brother and I ... well, we met with 
  some difficulty. On the one hand, we have a dad who actually used ether in order 
  to survive a Las Vegas convention. On the other, we have the mother of Christ. 
  How the fuck can we live up to that?</p>
<p>Jeff: I say just let me go to Las Vegas with a keg of ether and I will have 
  fun. As far as living up to the mother of Christ ... I think our gene pool has 
  been corrupted by the Satanic Yoda. He wants us to enjoy Santa Clausing many 
  women while we are power baring and enjoying brotherly love and compassion.</p>
<p>Joe: Indeed, certainly an omniscient being could have come up with a way for 
  us to excrete waste without providing, at the same time, a portal to pleasure. 
  Do you agree?</p>
<p>Jeff: I have to agree that we should know all who is looking for excretion 
  and pleasure all in one. Because excretion, pleasure and Santa Clausing are 
  all in one ... and one in all.</p>
<p>Joe: Who, after all, has not enjoyed a cigarette after a good bowel movement?</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../Images/nixon.gif" width="162" height="250"></p>
<p align="left">Joe: Jeff, have you ever considered the fact that Richard Nixon 
  ... not the Virgin Mary ... not the Satanic Yoda ... is our mother?</p>
<p align="left">Jeff: &quot;I am not a crook&quot; ... not a cookie crook ... 
  or a nookie crook</p>
<p align="left">Joe: Ok, we have now entered into the arena of fatherly advice. 
</p>
<p align="left">Jeff: Father Knows Best!!!!</p>
<p align="left">Joe: Indeed. And what did he teach us? </p>
<p align="left">Jeff: Do as many drugs, drink as much as you can and Santa Claus 
  as many women as you can. Because it is not as legal as it is now.</p>
<p align="left">Joe: No, I think he was more elegant. In fact, I think your callous 
  regard of the human sexual act is precisely why he doesn't give us money any 
  longer. After all, remember what he told us ...</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>I am not without scars on my brain and my body, but I can live with them. 
    I still feel a shudder in my spine every time I see a Vincent Black Shadow, 
    or when I walk into a public restroom and hear crippled men whispering about 
    the terrifying Kawasaki Triple.... I have visions of compound femur-fractures 
    and large black men in white hospital suits holding me down on a gurney while 
    a nurse called "Bess" sews the flaps of my scalp together with a stitching 
    drill. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joe: Ah yes, I remember that fateful evening when I came to dad and asked him 
  why my high school girlfriend had slapped me for touching her breast. He set 
  down his mescaline, looked into my eyes and said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Ho, ho. Thank God for these flashbacks. The brain is such a wonderful instrument 
    (until God sinks his teeth into it). Some people hear Tiny Tim singing when 
    they go under, and others hear the song of the Sausage Creature. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jeff: I tried to convince our father that the sausage creature was what it 
  was really about. Santa Claus, power poofing, and candy caning ALL have to do 
  with the Sausage Creature. I inquired about what Tiny Tim and MY sausage creature 
  has to do with 900cc Kawasakies, public restrooms, stitching drills, and ether 
  have to do with me. I have not found my path yet like Satanic Yoda has suggested. 
  This is when I decided that I needed help from my brother.</p>
<p>Joe: Naturally, I did not know how to react ... I blamed some of this on the 
  Ketamine ... which many of you see as figment of our little fiction here ... 
  but I blamed the rest on an unhappy childhood. Certainly, all of us have withstood 
  the unhappiness of childhood. We all grow up being told certain things and as 
  our conflicts expand beyond the arena of sharing toys and bowel movements, we 
  learn that our parents are ... perhaps, not perfect. But consider, for a moment, 
  our torment. Hunter S. Thompson really is our illegitimate father and, according 
  to him, the virgin mary (or Yoda) is our mother. How are we to react to this 
  in any kind of sensible way? I ... wait, my brother has a comment ...</p>
<p>Jeff: Joe did forget his deep conversation with our father concerning the difference 
  between Yoda and the Virgin Mary. </p>
<p><img src="../Images/Joesatan1.jpg" width="221" height="230">Joe: If I recall 
  correctly, Yoda was nothing but talk. Here is an example:</p>
<p>Dad: I love you.</p>
<p>Yoda/mom: Love leads to lust; lust leads to pain; pain leads to me having to 
  do the dishes all the goddamn time; doing the dishes all the goddamn time leads 
  to wisdom.</p>
<p>Dad: Um ...</p>
<p>Yoda/mom: Understand me you do not, mmmm?</p>
<p>Dad: I am trying to watch the fucking football game ... </p>
<p>Yoda/mom: You football game watching you must?</p>
<p>etc. Until the ether ... hey, Jeff, I want some more Brats ...</p>
<p>Jeff: Tonight we will be having a lightly simmered Bratswurst with a candy 
  caning bun. Nothing too exotic so we can focus on what mother Yoda has to teach 
  us this evening.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Good night. I hope this met your topicality needs ...</p>

<p align="left">Today I went out and bought <b>Unreal Tournament</b>. I have always 
  avoided first person shooters in the past because I have all the reflexes of 
  a <b>three legged mentally handicapped mule on jumbo ether</b>, but ... well, 
  someone told me there was a nuke in it. There is something about a nuke that 
  seems to undermine the need for dexterity.</p>
<p align="left">Speaking of <b>nukes</b>, how many of you out there are worried 
  about <b>Y2K</b>? I am, but not for the reasons you expect. I am scared by Y2K 
  because I have absolutely no plans and am terrified that for the rest of my 
  life when people ask me where I was on December 31, I will have to tell them 
  that I was at home scratching myself, drinking <b>Cream Soda</b> and watching 
  the 24 hour MASH marathon on channel 19. Y2K also frightens me because of all 
  the idiots out there.</p>
<p align="left">I am also pleased to announce that <b>Gamespot</b> gave the idiot 
  driven <b>Ultima Ascension</b> a bad review. I applaud Gamespot for having the 
  guts to deflate the overhyped balloon that is the Ultima series. I now wait 
  for the <b>whoring PC Gamer</b> to call it Game of the Year. For those of you 
  who do not know, Ultima Ascension really would have been a great game, but unfortunately, 
  hardware and software technology refused to sit still for 5 years so that the 
  genius programmers at Origin could program a game that would work.</p>
<p align="left">Speaking of pushing the envelope, I was interested to read that 
  the developers of <b>Shadowbane</b> (Wolfpack Studios) are creating an online 
  <b>RPG</b> that will return to <b>MUDDING's</b> roots by not relying so much 
  on fight, sit, fight, sit. Hmmmm ... where have we heard that before? Interestingly, 
  when asked how players will gain experience and advance, the Shadowbane guru 
  said characters will have to ... <b>fight</b>. Thank God a developer finally 
  has the balls to sit on its <b>ass</b> and let a genre stagnate.</p>
<p align="left">Finally, who out there is ready for the game <b>The Sims</b> to 
  come out? I definitely am. I am eager to replicate my life on the computer and 
  see where it is headed. If I play a game and learn that people won't come to 
  my house because a <b>pizza</b> has been left on the floor for 3 years, I will 
  consider it $49.95 well spent.</p>
