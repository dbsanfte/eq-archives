<h1>Submit your photo to the Gallery</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>
We are always looking for good pictures to add to the photo gallery. Here are some guidelines for what and how to submit your masterpiece:
<ul>
<li>Choose your subject matter carefully. (Photography 101)<br>The Photo Gallery is to bring back memories of interesting events and promote guild unity. Therefore, action shots are much better than static portraits. Choice of location, background and story are critical for a good photo. Treat the shots as if you were taking them with a real camera to put in your own scrapbook.
<li>Image dimensions must be 800 x 600 or smaller and in .JPG or .GIF format.<br>If you have no idea what that means, just send in the EverQuest screenshot file (*.BMP) and I will handle the rest.
<li>Photo must include people, preferably guild members.<br>Pictures of creatures are nice, but this is not a Bestiary. Pictures with people you know in them are much more personal and evoke an emotional response.
<li>A detailed description of what is going on is <b>required.</b><br><i>No photo is "self explanatory."</i> Remember, you will not be there to stand over the viewer's shoulder to explain what is going on. Therefore, you must include an explanation of:
        <ul>
        <li>Who is in the photo<br>List the Players and NPCs
        <li>What is going on<br>Who is doing what and why
        <li>Why it is significant<br>Answer "who cares?"
        <li>Where the action is taking place<br>Zone, dungeon, region...
        <li>When it was taken<br>Was it a guild event, an evening outing, a GM event or a random pickup group that turned memorable?
        </ul>
<li>Include who took the photo.<br>We must give credit where credit it due.
</ul>
<p>
Compile all of the information outlined above, attach the image and send it in an email to: <i><a href="mailto:khazade@zoneraiders.com">Khazade</a></i>.
