Growing up along the roots of the Butcherblock Mountains, Khazade was made aware of the imbalances between good and evil in his homeland. Foul creatures from Neriak, the Nektulos Forest, and Dagnor's Cauldron often spilled over into his people's lands. The humans of Freeport tried to keep the Ocean of Tears free from the blight, but were under too much strain from the constant bombardment they received. Being of good nature, he desired to reset the balance and thwart those who would upset it. After successfully cleansing his lands, he desired to help those in other lands as well.
<p>
It burnt him to the center of his being when he discovered that many of the beautiful places in the world were also sickened by the plague of evil and warring between the races. At that moment, he did two things. First, he pledged himself as a loyal follower of Brell Serilis, the Duke of Below and patron to all dwarf paladins. Second, in Brell Serilis' name he vowed to unite the good races, stop the foolish bickering and use their combined strength to cleanse the lands of evil. 
<p>
In his travels across the lands of Faydwer, he met an experienced and generous human druid named Aaidyn. They soon became fast friends and traveling companions. It turned out that Aaidyn was an officer in the Peacekeepers of Norrath, a guild founded on the same principles that Khazade had pledged himself. Soon, Aaidyn was showing Khazade the wondrous places of the world, the vile dens of evil and teaching him how best to use his strength to set things on the path of good.
<p>
Under the kind and helping guidance of Aaidyn, Khazade entered the ranks of the Peacekeepers of Norrath, eventually becoming an officer. Through his dedication and leadership, Khazade was chosen to replace the retiring Guild Master and co-founder, Bere Ironwood.
<p>
Khazade eventually retired himself, turning over the guild co-leadership to Bere Ironwood's son, Masoud.
<p>
He now resides in the smithing haven of Highhold Keep, where many visit him to purchase and trade for his finely crafted items.
