<b>Q: When I party, how much experience does a pet take from my group. </b><br>
A: When you group, the pet takes a minimal to zero experience share from your party. This is different from soloing - when you solo, your pet does take a percent of the experience that you would ordinarily have gotten. <br>
On average, a pet will take about a .5 to 1 (out of 100) percent party experience share. From personal summoning experience, a pet is always worth having in a group if you are in an environment that is pet friendly. 
<p>
<b>Q: Is there a different saving throw for Root and Grasping Roots? </b><br>
A: No. Root and Grasping Roots use exactly the same saving throw algorithms. The fact that Grasping Roots does a single hit of damage when it immobilizes the creature does not get figured in to the saving throw math - if the creature fails its save verses Grasping Root, damage is applied. If the creature makes the save, no damage is done. <br>
Once again, there is <b>no difference</b> between the saving throw for Root and Grasping Root (or any of their higher level versions), urban myth not-withstanding. 
<p>
<b>Q: What is the difference between Root, Enstill, Immobilize and Paralyzing Earth? </b><br>
A: The Root (and Grasping Root) series of spells are a bit confusing because they do not upgrade like most other EverQuest spells. <br>
First a bit of information on Root spells. When a Root spell is cast, the Target gets a saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, then the Target is not Rooted. If the saving throw fails, then the Target's movement is reduced to zero. Every designated time increment after that, the Target gets a reduced percent saving throw to break out of Root. <br>
The Target gets an additional reduced percent saving throw every time they are damaged - by melee or by magic. <br>
This being said: 
<ul>
<li>Root (and Grasping Roots) are the baseline from which all other Root spells are measured. 
<li>Enstill (and Ensnaring Roots) have a longer potential duration then Root. You would use this spell if you were trying to keep a creature out of combat. If you plan on damaging the creature, then use Root. If you just want the creature to stay out of the way (say you are fighting two creatures), then you would use Enstill. 
<li>Immobilize (and Enveloping Roots) have a quicker casting time then Root, and have slightly longer potential durations. This is in all ways an upgrade to Root, with the only downside being the higher mana cost. You would use this spell when you expect the creature to be within melee range of you and casting time is important. 
<li>Paralyzing Earth (and Engulfing Roots) both have four times the potential duration of Root and twice the potential duration of Enstill. It is in all ways an upgrade to Enstill. You would use this spell in the same circumstances that you would use Enstill. 
</ul>
As a note, each of the Druidic Grasping Root spells do more damage then the previous versions.

<b>Q: How do the new Monk / Necromancer / ShadowKnight changes to Feign Death work? </b><br>
A: Feign Death was recently changed by the Tuning Team to reflect evolving gameplay issues. Since two of the three classes that get Feign Death get it through spells, I thought this might be a good place to explain the changes. <br>
Previously, when you used Feign Death (and assuming you cast the spell successfully or, in the case of the Monk, made your skill roll) hostile monsters would decided that you were dead and wander off. When you later got up, they would still remember that they were angry with you. If you were within sight, they would immediately come after you. If not, they would come after you at some later point. This might happen within a few minutes, or could happen even a few hours later. The only way to be absolutely sure that a monster had forgotten about you was to zone. <br>
With our new changes, about a third of the time that you successfully Feign Death, the monster will immediately forget about you, similar to an Enchanter casting Memory Blur. If they do NOT forget about you, they will immediately come after you when you stand up. No more monsters coming back at irregular amounts of time - it should be immediate or not at all. <br>
This is a change - the old way, if you Feigned Death a single time, the monster would always remember you. This way, they remember you about two-thirds of the time. <br>
Using the old Feign Death, you could Feign Death multiple times to try to confuse the monster. After about seven or eight times doing this, most monsters would eventually forget they were mad at you. <br>
With the new Feign Death, if you Feign Death once the monster has about a 65 percent chance of remembering you. Twice and the monster has about a 50 percent chance of remembering you. Four times means about 20 percent, and six times means about 8 percent. This is very similar to the old Feign Death. <br>
Another addition to the new Feign Death involves a monster "going home." When you Feign Death, most monsters will return to where they were before the fight. If a monster returns to its initial location, it will immediately forget about you greater then 90 percent of the time. Therefore, if you Feign Death and stay down long enough for a monster to "go home," you should be safe when you stand up a majority of the time. If the monster is still mad at you, it will return immediately, rather then wandering back later at some irregular interval. <br>
<b>Late Breaking News </b><br>
After further testing and watching these changes on the Live verses the Test Server, we will be changing Feign Death again on the next patch. 
New changes will make it so that if the monster is less then level 35, the monster will always forget about you. If the monster is greater then level 35 it will use the changes detailed above.

<b>Q: Why is [X] spell worse then [Y] spell? I used [insert name of program that strips spell information here], and... </b><br>
A: OK - STOP. All of those nifty programs that supposedly strip out the information for our spell are nice for reading what class can cast the spell, or the text that the spell displays when it is cast - but then again, a good website can tell you that. I've checked out a lot of those programs, and I have yet to see one that ACCURATELY tells the effects of a spell. <br>
At this point, I would trust information from websites more then I would from one of these programs. The information from webistes usually comes from players who have gotten the data first hand.
<p>
<b>Q: When my ShadowKnight casts Lifetap, it takes more mana then when my Necromancer casts it. Is this a bug? </b><br>
A: This is not a bug. It does take more mana for your SK to cast a Lifetap spell then it would take a Necromancer of the same level. <br>
We did a lot of Internal and Test Server testing on this one, and set the mana cost to a level that we felt was appropriate to the level of power that we wanted to add to the SK. ShadowKnights gave up three fairly ineffective spells for three spells that will help to reduce their downtime. Until this point, the only healing that a ShadowKnight had access to was their 22nd level spell Vampiric Embrace. With the addition of the three Lifetap spells, the ShadowKnight now has access to limited healing abilities - they can siphon life from other creatures and add it to their own. These spells will not be mana efficient for dealing damage - SK DoT spells will be much more effective in that regard. These spells will, however, let the ShadowKnight reduce her downtime by siphoning life at the end of a fight or from a nearby light green. 
<p>
<b>Q: Changes to Cancel Magic </b><br>
A: Cancel Magic (and all of its variants) were recently made into Party Only spells - similar to Invisibility. This was done for the same reasons that we made Invisibility Party Only - to cut down on player abuse. Some players of more malicious intent were casting Cancel Magic on other players to get rid of their beneficial Buff style spells. This got around our play nice policy - effectively letting a NON PVP player adversely effect another NON PVP player. <br>
To combat this, we made Cancel Magic Party Only. This means that you can only cast the spell on Party Members. The exception to this is if the target of your spell is a Player AND is not under their own control - say from a charm or a Fear spell. In this case, all Players are allowed to cast Cancel Magic on the effected player (to help get rid of the Charm or Fear). We feel that this solution will let players have the best of all possible worlds for Cancel Magic. 
<p>
<b>Q: Why are there no Bard Songs for Bard levels 39, 45, 47 and 49? </b><br>
A: When we was finishing up the Bard class, we wanted to leave some room for expansion during the evolution of EverQuest. Because Bards get one song per level, if we had given them all fifty songs there would have been no room for expansion - aside from taking away older songs. <br>
Expect to see new songs coming soon. These songs will not be anything that radically redefines the Bard class - but they will be additions that help keep the Bard interesting at high levels. 
<h2>Non Spell Questions </h2>
<p>
<b>Q: Is it true that I get more experience when I party? </b><br>
A: Yes. If you kill a monster solo, you get X experience. If a party of two kills a monster, you get X + P (P = Party Experience Addition), divided by two (half of that experience for each of you). The bigger your party, the bigger that P is - the Party Experience Addition is larger for three people then for then for two, and larger for four people then for three, etc. <br>
As a side note, pets do NOT count towards P (2 players and 2 pets still count as a party of 2). 
<p>
<b>Q: Who made all of those wonderful spell graphics? </b><br>
A: One of our extremely talented artists Scott McDaniel designed all of the spell graphics. I was involved to the point of saying "we need some graphics for these spells - and they should look cool." Scott did the rest. 
<p>
<b>Q: In every screen shot you always have a Skull Staff. Which staff is it that you carry? </b><br>
A: Contrary to popular belief I do not carry a Staff of Writhing or a Staff of Discord. I carry the Skull Staff of Geoffrey. Sometimes its good to be the Arch Mage. 
<p>
<b>Q: Why is there no Icon for the Bard Mana Song (Cassindra's Chorus of Clarity)? </b><br>
A: There are different types of Bard Songs. Most Bard Songs leave an icon on your character because the song has a duration - usually 5 to 15 seconds. Each time the Bard sings the song she renews the duration - this means that a Bard who continues to sing the song can potentially keep the song effect going indefinitely. <br>
Some Bard songs do not have durations - you receive the effect when the Bard sings it, but will not get another "dose" until she sings it again. Cassindra's Chorus of Clarity (the mana song) is one of these songs - it does not have an actual duration, so you don't get an icon on your screen. 
<p>
<b>Q: What is the Duration of Alliance/Benevolence? </b><br>
A: Alliance and Benevolence (Enchanter) are spells that add some of an NPC's faction to your own. This means that if you cast Alliance on a Guard of Qeynos, your faction with the Guards of Qeynos goes up. <br>
Because this spell had the potential to be cast many times, and because of the limit of having 15 spell on a character at a time, we decided to code Alliance/Benevolence different from other duration based spells. Alliance and Benevolence do not count towards your 15 spell limit. When you cast the spell, it will last until you zone - there is no duration component to these spells. Because of this, we do not display a spell icon on your screen - partially because you never need to worry about the spell going away, and partially to keep your screen from filling with icons. 
<p>
<b>Q: What changed with Levitate on the last patch? </b><br>
A: Levitate was changed so that if you already have the Levitate spell on your character, no other levitate effect will take hold. This was done to prevent a certain abuses of the spell which involved chain casting levitate to reach areas which were not designed to be player accessible. <br>
To get your levitation spell renewed, you can click to dispel it (this is one of the few spells that everybody can click to remove). Once the spell has been removed, you will be able to have it renewed. <br>
Bards were unintentionally hurt with these changes - their song will not overwrite its own levitate effect. This error will be fixed with the next patch. 
<p>
<b>Q: Does fire save better then cold (or magic/poison/disease)? </b><br>
A: I get asked this one a lot. All of our saving throws use the same table. This means that a Fire based DD spell that does 100 damage has exactly the same chance of not being resisted as a Cold based DD spell that does 100 damage. The same holds true for Magic, Disease and Poison. With our system, the type of damage dealt does not modify saving throw computations. <br>
However...<br>
Some creatures are more resistant to certain types of magic then others. Fire Goblins, for example, have a bonus saving throw verses fire. Polar Bears have a better save verses cold. Most of the time, if it makes sense that a creature would be more resistant to a certain type of attack, it is. It is easier to damage a Fire Goblin with Shock of Frost then with Ignite. It is easier to damage a Polar Bear with Burst of Flame then with Numbing Cold. <br>
If you encounter a creature that is not taking as much damage as it should from a spell, you may wish to switch to a spell that deals a different type of damage. (fire to cold, cold to magic, magic to disease, etc.) <br>
You may also want to see if the creature was hanging out near an NPC Cleric, Shaman or Druid - the creature may be under the protection from a few Endure or Resist spells. In these circumstances, I recommend liberal doses of Cancel Magic. 
<p>
<b>Q: Did the Spell Resistances/Spell Durations/etc. change on (this/last/4 weeks ago) patch? </b><br>
A: Almost every time we do a patch I get asked if the Resistance Rates, Duration of Spells, etc. were modified. I have had people swear that the duration on their spells went down by 50%, or that creatures started saving 20% better after patches - sometimes even patches where we did not modify spell data. <br>
So, just to lay rumors to rest, we have not made "hundreds" of blanket changes to Spell Resistance Rates or Spell Durations since Beta. As circumstance have warranted we have adjusted specific spells - usually to make the duration longer. The only blanket change we have done post-Beta was a Spell Duration modification made a few months after release; I increased the duration of most Buff spells by about 20%. <br>
Every other rumor has been just that - a rumor. <br>
<p>
<b>Q: How do spell fizzles (and missed notes on songs) work? </b><br>
A: When you cast a spell, we call a fizzle check. There is always a 5% chance of succeeding (regardless of how low your appropriate skill is) and a 5% chance of failure (regardless of how high your appropriate skill is). What modifies a fizzle check are (a) your appropriate skill (Abjuration, Evocation, Brass, Wind, etc.) (b) your primary statistic (Intelligence for Magi, Wisdom for Priests, Dexterity and Charisma for Bards) (c) the difficulty of the spell and (d) the level of the spell. <br>
When you gain a new rank of spells, any spell that you cast of that rank has a 20% chance of fizzling. This assumes that (a) your appropriate skill (Evocation, for example) is at its maximum value (b) that you have a minimum of 75 in your appropriate statistic (Intelligence, etc.) and (c) that we did not set the difficulty of the spell to less then average (some spells we assign a lower difficulty, making them easier to cast - to date, we have not made any spells with higher difficulty). <br>
If your appropriate statistic is greater then 75 (Intelligence, Wisdom, etc.), we reduce your fizzle percent by 1% for every X points of your statistic above 75. <br>
Each spell assumes that you have a skill equal to (5 * level you go the spell). A Wizard getting Bind Affinity (Wizard gets her 4th rank spells at level 12, so 5 * 12 =60) would have that spell assuming that she had a 60 Alteration skill for purposes of casting. With a 60 skill in Alteration (the appropriate skill) and a 75 intelligence, our wizard would have an 80% chance of successfully casting Bind Affinity. For every skill point that our Wizard has above 60, the percent chance of fizzling goes down by 1%, to a minimum of a 5% chance of fizzling. Thus, three levels (15 skill points) after our Wizard gets Bind Affinity, she will be able to max out her Alteration and have a mere 5% chance of fizzling the spell. <br>
A high intelligence would help her to max out her ability to cast Bind Affinity without fizzling earlier.

<b>Q: How many HP does the Paladin ability Lay On Hands heal? </b><br>
A: Lay on Hands (Paladin ability, useable once every game day) heals 25 HP per level of the Paladin. 
<p>
<b>Q: Did you ever consider giving the Paladin a Full Heal with Lay on Hands? </b><br>
A: No. It was decided very early on (pre Alpha) that giving the Paladin a Full Heal would be too easy to abuse. We didn't want people making "throwaway" Paladin's to pop full Heals on their primaries, nor did we want people bringing hordes baby Paladins on Dragon Raids to keep other characters alive. Giving the Paladin a Full Heal would also have taken away from the primary healing class of EverQuest - the Cleric. <br>
From an RP standpoint, we decided that it made sense to have the Paladin's healing abilities increase as her power and faith grew. 
<p>
<b>Q: How do Focus Objects work? </b><br>
A: A recent addition to EverQuest are Focus Objects - objects that let you focus your powers of Conjuration and summon more powerful pets. Magicians may quest for four different Focus Objects in the Temple of Solusek Ro. Powerful Magicians and Necromancers may find more potent Focus Objects during their travels. <br>
All Focus Objects can be identified in that they have the <b>Reclaim Energy</b> spell on them. [Warning - other objects may also have Reclaim Energy] <br>
Most Focus Objects only work on a specific type of summoning. The Magician's <b>Torch of Alna</b>, for example, will only enhance the Conjuration of Fire Elementals. Other Focus Objects will only work with high levels of Conjuration - they will not enhance low level summonings. <br>
Focus Object must be held to work. <br>
Pets summoned with Focus Objects tend to have greater skills, better ability scores and more HP.<br>
