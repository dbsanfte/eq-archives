<h1>The Priest of Discord takes on all comers.</h1>

DAMN that's gotta hurt.  Picture of the Priest of Discord and Corporal Lancot duking it out in North Qeynos.  Somehow a level 1 monk figured out how to get the guards to fight eachother and the Priest of Discord.  Four Game Master's came and watched this activity.  The monk kept this up for a few hours and the Guards were undefeated in killing the Priest of Discord.  The figures you see in the chat box were constant through the fights, which lasted a few minutes.  Those four hits occurred in a few seconds, just imagine how tough taking the Priest of Discord would be...or Corporal Lancot for that matter...
