<h2>The Crusades of 1312</h2>
</center>
<p>
This is the time of the scattered and defeated Iksar empire. The great dragon, Trakanon and his allies of scale have left the empire in rubble and our people are divided yet again. The once grand city of Sebilis is claimed by the one who decimated it.
<p>
The remaining Iksar are scattered among the outlands of Kunark. Their places of refuge are now the dwellings dark denizens. In the wilds a few castes come to unite. One of these are the remnants of the Crusaders of Greenmist. They are lead by a powerful shadow knight named Rok Nilok.
<p>
<br>
<p>
The army of shadow knights numbers in the hundreds. Within their ranks are a few mystics and legionnaires. The tribe names itself after their leader, they are to be named, The Crusaders of Rok Nilok and they shall purge the lands of Kunark.
<p>
<br>
<p>
The Crusaders burn across the Dreadlands and death come quick to those who dare stand in their way. They slay many giants and many goblins. Their shall be no prisoners or slaves. The empire shall be rebuilt by the hands of the Iksar. All other shall perish.
<p>
<br>
<p>
Kamors Castle is the first major objective of the Crusaders. It has now been taken over by a goblin clan. The Goblins soon find themselves under siege. For twenty days they hold ground until the Crusaders choose to assault as a band of goblin deserters flee. A swift battle ensues and the castle is reclaimed.
<p>
The Crusaders now set their sights on the city of Cabilis. While the march is designed Rok Nilok discoveres something very evil. Nothing is known of his disocovers. No record exists of it's evil. All that is known is that Rok Nilok made a pact and soon shall suffer for it.
<p>
<br>
<p>
During the battle for Cabilis a strange rain falls which shrinks them to the size of dolls and their heads are set aflame. Nilok's head burns red. And the goblins squash the would be emporer and his minions.
