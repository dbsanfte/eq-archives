The Goblins had invaded an area to the east of the city, a move the Iksar would not tolerate.  The Legion was sent out in the night to disperse the invading force, a quite massive one at that.  It was remarked that it was the largest Goblin army anyone had seen for a few centries.
<p>
A small caravan of Iksar snuck through Warsilks Woods as quietly as possible, trying to avoid the attention of any bandits in the area.  One female in the group was moments away from child birth and she was in need of a Shaman to ease the process along.  The leader of the caravan knew that if they did not hurry, there was a good chance both the female and the broodling would perish in the elements.
<p>
Dabashire Darktank walked along the shoreline of the Field of Bone, in search of bandits to wipe out.  His unending curiosity led him to Cabalis, in search of some of the secrets of this rather new race in Norrath.  He had heard from outcast Iksar that killing bandits would improve his standing with the Legion, and allow him to explore Cabalis.  As he finished off another bandit, he heard the sound of swords clashing and battle cries off in the distance.  Curiosity got the better of him, so he went to see where the fight was.
<p>
The fighting was fierce, Goblin and Iksar forces both took heavy casulties, but both sides were relentless.  The tide was slowly shifting in the Goblin favor as they recieved fresh reserves from Warsilks Woods, but the Iksar will was still very high.  
<p>
When Dabashire reached the battle field, he realized he was in a bit of a pickle.  Neither the Iksar, nor the Goblins liked him too terribly, so if he were to join in the fight, there wasn't any guarentee the other side wouldn't kill him.  Seeing how the Iksar were a bit more intelligent and far more willing to negotiate, he joined thier side in the battle.  He figured if he joined the Goblins and they won, they would just execute him afterword for being a Troll.  The Iksar were rather shocked at the appearence of a Troll, especially one that was fighting against the Goblins.
<p>
The caravan was moving quickly now, knowing that a broodling was coming and that they were in much safer territory.  All of the sudden, a small Goblin force ambushed the travelling group.  The guards were no match for the Goblins and most of the group was killed instantly.  The birthing female was badly injured, but feigned death, as her monk masters had taught her.  The Goblins began searching the bodies for treasure when they came upon the female.  Growling to eachother, the didn't quite know what to make of it...she looked dead, but they noticed the quivering in her stomach, like something was about to happen.
<p>
An explosion ripped across the battle field knocking everyone off thier feet.  In the sky was a huge, burning symbol and a horrid laugh was heard, booming through the plains.  The Goblins immeadiately retreated, and the Iksar cheered in unison.  Dabashire, quite puzzled by the events, asked the young Iksar warrior he was fighting alongside what had just happened.
<p>
As the Iksar explained, Cazic-Thule had blessed the Iksar in the means of rebearth.  Nothing was to interfere with the process, and special powers were given to the mother as protection of her broodling.  The Iksar was a little confused as to what exactly those powers were, but the symbol that burned in the sky was of Thulian origin.
<p>
Curiosity again got the better of Dabashire, so he went to investigate.  As he rounded a bend, he came upon the corpses of a few Iksar and goblins.  He noticed a female out of the group that was still alive.  He rushed over and tried to get as much information as he could with.  She was very weak and kept mentioning a broodling, the rest of her words were jumbled, but he did understand the need of a shaman.  He rushed her back to the Gates and shouted for a shaman.  All were out in the battle field healing the wounded and blessing the souls of those who had passed on.  A monk came to aide and started chanting in a tongue Dabashire didn't understand.  The broodling was born, but the mother didn't have the strength to live on.  The monk chanted a few words, then sliped into a trance
<p>
Many moments passed when the monk popped out of his trance and grasped Dabashire's arm.  His thick, scaled hands had a firm grip on the Troll, so firm that Dabashire couldn't even move his arm to try and defend himself.  He could feel his crafted bracer heat up under the pressure of the monk's grip.  The monk uttered a few words then walked off quickly.  Another monk, probably an apprentice of some sort handed the Broodling to Dabashire.
<p>
Completely puzzled, Dabashire asked what had happened.  The apprentice explained that in the trance, the Ancestors of the Broodling were contacted and it was decided that by helping the broodling, Dabashire was given training rights to the child, after the rebirth was complete.
<p>
Dabashire stayed and explored Cabalis while the broodling was being blessed in rebirth.  A messanger got word to Dabashire that the Kingdom of Grobb had gotten word of his actions in the battle and basing on his previous actions of being allowed in Qeynos and Rivervale, the Council decided to make him Ambassidor to all races for the Trolls.  Knowing that this was a privilege only given to the finest of Trolls, Dabashire accepted whole heartedly on the condition that he would get to raise his adopted son how he saw fit.  The Council granted that wish.
<p>
The rebirth was finished the next day and Dabashire looked upon his son with a strange sort of pride.  He didn't know all of the Iksar customs, and understood fewer, but he did know that the day of rebirth was a huge privilage for an Iksar.  He decided to name his son Stonescale, after the scales on his head, which were hardened in the explosion that scorched the sky.  Knowing that Stonescale's mother was a monk, Dabashire enlisted his son with the Swifttail clan for proper training.  Once Stonescale was trained on how to defend himself, Dabashire gave his blessings to his son, and vowed to return to watch over Stonescale when he was able.  An Iksar Shaman made a gem that would allow the two to contact each other through telepathy.
<p>
As Dabashire's duties became more time consuming, he decided to pass on the one thing that meant the most of him.  Dabashire passed on the leadership of the Peacekeepers of Norrath to his son.  Though Stonescale was young and rather inexperienced, Dabashire could advise and help in the tough decisions that come with being a leader through the stone that was given to him by the Iksar Shaman.
<p>
Today, Stonescale leads the one of the finest guilds in all of Norrath.  In his spare time, he continues to search for the misteries of his ancestors and his birth while honing his skills to make his body the ultimate weapon.
