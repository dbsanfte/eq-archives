<center><b>A History of the Charcoal Knights as told by Lauke Greyice</b></center>
<p>
Eighty-eight generations before the birth of Lauke a wealthy warrior became fascinated with the powers of the dark side. It was his fascination that spawned the Charcoal Knights: a wondrous experiment to introduce dark blood into a family and then breed it out.  It became a nightmare for many.  It is believed that the mad man who arranged the union of the Dark Elf and Human was a good man. He was so committed to conquering darkness that he became consumed with finding different ways of fighting it. Impressed with the powers of the dark he entertained ideas of harnessing evil power for the side of the light. Sometimes ambition brings about madness! It is only now that the Charcoal Knights are beginning to realize their potential.
<p>
A young beautiful Dark Elf who practiced the dark arts had a son with a human warrior and they named him Lanarv Greyice. Lanarv, raised by his mother to age thirteen, grew in intelligence and strength and learned the ways of the dark arts.  His father, who is said to have been an extremely wealthy and influential man, paid an army to steal him from his dark elven home. Those humans who knew of the art of necromancy then extensively trained Lanarv in the arts of war. When Lanarv turned 50 years old, those who knew him for his exceptional skills respected him. He had become a legend, and his skills were often exaggerated to near God-like. That was the beginning of the Charcoal Knights.
<p>
Every generation thereafter was both blessed with great talent and cursed by the dark blood in them that constantly gnawed at their soul.   Many of the first dozen generations fell to the dark side or went mad fighting it. But always the Charcoal Knights prevailed and the next generation was born. After fifty generations the forces of light dominated and the knights always stayed loyal to the side of justice and truth.  To fight fire with fire and to fight evil with darkness is a torment in all of the minds of the young knights. They are taught at a very young age to talk to the dark elves as little as possible, for to due so feeds the temptation that lies asleep in each of them. Care must be taken not to tempt awakening the evil within. There is still a chance in each that they might fall to the dark side and that possibility drives them to slay the black elves when and wherever they can.
<p>
Most of you cannot understand the darkness that weighs upon my shoulders. You cannot understand how I can love the magical forces of the dark and yet hate evil. How can I use fear and darkness and disease to fight off evil? It is a torment that consumes my mind. It is a daily process to fight off the battle between good and dark that is within my soul. I have times of mental peace though. It is a peace brought on by my comrades in arms, from those that I call my friends, my brothers and my sisters. Peacekeepers. You cool the fire and calm the storm in my mind. If you could understand my pain, then you could understand my gratitude for each of you. For it is you that drives light into my eyes and makes me forget the darkness. Peacekeepers you are my life, my love, and my blood. I will protect you till my dying day.
