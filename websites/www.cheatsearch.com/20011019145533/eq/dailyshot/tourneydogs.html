Someone call the pound! The Dogs of War are on the loose!<br>
Here are some Peacekeepers lining up before the tournament in Freeport (January 29, 2000). It just so happened that as the Peacekeepers gathered in the arena to practice battle strategies that the Dark Races decided to attack Freeport. It was a good day to do battle!
