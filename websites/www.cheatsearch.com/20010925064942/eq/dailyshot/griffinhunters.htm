The Peacekeeper's first attempt at slaying the mighty Griffon of West Commonlands. After a few deaths (ours), we decided to move on to other (and easier) prey. Rastsar was always picking fights with griffons that he could not win...

Featured are (back to front) Kumora (now Punishment), Kithkanen Stormbane, Rastsar (now Bere Ironwood), Kaeldean Soulstryke, and  Quarthinos Zenuspirit (Hawkebane was taking the photo).
