<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<blockquote>
The Peacekeepers are dedicated to spreading tolerance, protecting the weak and promoting unity among all the good races of Norrath.<p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Charter</h2>
<blockquote>
The Peacekeepers Guild is determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which over the millennia have brought untold sorrow to the peoples of Norrath. The Peacekeepers Guild is created to reaffirm faith in fundamental rights of all beings, in the dignity and worth of the beings, in the equal rights of men and women of all races and of city-nations large and small, and to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of agreements can be maintained, and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.
<p>
For these ends, we practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors, and to unite our strength to maintain relational peace and security, and to ensure, by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest, and to employ political machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples.
</blockquote>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>To maintain peace and security for all of Norrath, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice, adjustment or settlement of international and racial disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace;
<li>To develop friendly relations among races and nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace; 
<li>To achieve global co-operation in solving problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, class or religion; and 
<li>To be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends.
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h2>Principles</h2>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The Guild is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members.
<li>All Members, in order to ensure to all of them the rights and benefits resulting from membership, shall fulfill in good faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance with the present Charter. 
<li>All Members shall settle their disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that peace and security, and justice, are not endangered.
<li>All Members shall refrain in their relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the Peacekeepers Guild.
<li>All Members shall give The Guild every assistance in any action it takes in accordance with the present Charter, and shall refrain from giving assistance to any state against which the Guild is taking preventive or enforcement action.
<li>The Guild shall ensure that beings which are not Members of the Guild act in accordance with these Principles so far as may be necessary for the maintenance of peace and security.
<li>Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the Guild to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter; but this principle shall not prejudice the application of enforcement measures.
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h2>Policies</h2>
<blockquote>
The Peacekeepers Guild is a strong advocate of role-playing and members want to keep the game fun for everyone involved. Therefore, we have strict rules about trash-talking and dishonorable gameplay - <em>we do not tolerate it.</em> We do not badmouth our members nor do we berate them in public. We do not insult our opponents or other non-guild players. Anyone found breaking the rules will be looking for another guild in short order. No exceptions.
<p>
Of course, challenges, arguments and duels are accepted, but only when done with good RPG taste.
<h5>General Rules</h5>
Here are some additional, basic rules of member conduct:
<ul>
<li>Treat ranking Guild Members with due respect.
<li>Offer to help other good players in need, regardless of their guild affiliation, class or alignment.
<li>Be patient with those of less experience and more restricted views.
<li>Be tolerant of those with different opinions.
<li>Defend yourself with strength.
<li>Protect the weak.
<li>Teach the uneducated.
<li>Battle with honor.
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2>Player versus Player (PvP)</h2>
<blockquote>
The PvP regulations apply exclusively to the Tallon Zek server.
<p>
The primary purpose of the Peacekeepers is to act as a peacekeeping force and protect the fair lands against incursion and ruin by the Dark Races. Our mission is to unite the good races under a single, global community that can live, grow and prosper, it goes against our doctrine to initiate unwarranted conflict. Therefore, we have strict regulations that guide our actions and reactions in the event of Player versus Player (PvP) attack.
<p>
We must recognize and accept that the high standards to which we hold ourselves may put us at a tactical disadvantage in PvP combat. Although we may suffer in the short run, the gains long term will be returned in an order of magnitudes. These ideals do not make us weak. In truth, as our reputation and respect grows, our strength grows with it.
<p>
In no way is a "war" against the Dark Races mandated. These rule simply empower individuals to make the choice whether or not to participate in hunting expeditions or ambushes. This does not reduce our goals of unity among the races or the way in which we conduct ourselves. We always conduct ourselves with honor, even to those that may not deserve it.
<p>
When hunting the Dark Races, be sensitive to body and zone camping. There is no reason to be banned for bad planning or revenge. Guilds that use such tactics will eventually be caught and removed from the game for it. Verant is very much against that behavior and they will eventually be caught and punished
<h3>General</h3>
Below are some general guidelines and definitions regarding PvP. First and foremost, protect yourself. These rules are not meant to be self defeating, but are documented to provide guidelines for actions when conflict arises.  Player versus Player attacks are condoned according to following definitions and restrictions. 
<ul>
<li><b>PvP on Dark Races Only</b><br>
Only initiate attack against Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres and Trolls.  All other races are considered "good" and therefore are not to be hunted or harmed unless in Self Defense. 
<li><b>Ambush</b><br>
An activity where the attacker(s) lay in wait for an unsuspecting foe and then attack them from hiding with surprise. 
<li><b>Enemy of Peace</b><br>
Those who have initiated attacks and wrongfully killed a Peacekeeper are added to the Enemies of Peace list. An opposing guild we may be at war with is also considered an Enemy of Peace. Anyone on this list should be killed at every opportunity, as many times as possible. All restrictions are waived for attacks against these individuals. Use any means necessary to make them pay for their crimes. 
<li><b>Hack and Loot</b><br>
This is a delicate maneuver and should not be attempted unless the attacker has 100% confidence in a quick death of the target. In this case, the attacker engages an enemy who is previously engaged and distracted with a NPC (computer controlled monster or Non-Player Character) and gets a number of free blows in before the enemy is even aware of it. If not implemented properly, it can result in an accidental Experience Kill. As outlined below, Experience Killing is strictly forbidden.
<li><b>Hunting Expeditions</b><br>
Groups formed under the pretense of hunting and killing a specified race in a particular region. Peacekeepers may participate in hunts so long as they are against the Dark Races exclusively. 
<li><b>Loot and Scoot</b><br>
After being defeated in honorable combat, the Peacekeeper must recover his/her body and vacate the zone. After an appropriate amount of time (an hour or so), the Peacekeeper may re-enter the zone. 
<li><b>Self Defense</b><br>
When an individual or group initiates an attack against a Peacekeeper. Defend yourself with all strength against any race that attacks you.
<li><b>Sniping</b><br>
The attacker waits outside an ongoing combat. Once the combat is completed and while the target is still low on health and mana, kills and then loots the target. 
<li><b>Target of Opportunity</b><br>
When the attacker happens across an opponent already injured or reduced in power. 
</ul>
<h3>Unacceptable PvP</h3>
Under NO circumstances do we initiate or participate in: 
<ul>
<li><b>Experience Killing</b><br>
"Intentionally causing experience-loss to other players in the PvP environment is illegal in all cases and will result in a warning when witnessed by an EQCSR. This includes things such as intentionally training NPCs, and purposefully allowing an NPC to get the final blow in combat. We do understand that there are cases where the experience-loss is unintentional, and will take no action unless a person earns a reputation of causing unintentional experience-loss.
<p>
"Much like how the Kill Stealing rule applies to those on the blue servers, this rule is designed to discourage and make note of those who do it habitually, thus betraying the spirit of PvP. As a note, the EQCSR will not in any case provide a resurrection for someone who was caused experience loss in PvP, intentionally or otherwise. This is one of the dangers of playing on a PvP server."
<p>
- <i>Rules of Conduct</i>, Verant Interactive
<p>
Any Peacekeeper found deliberately and repeatedly committing this crime will be removed from the guild.
<li><b>Bind-point/Corpse Camping</b><br>
"Killing someone over and over again while at his or her bind-point or while they are in the process of retrieving their corpse is illegal and will result in a warning when witnessed by an EQCSR. You are expected in all cases to give someone a reasonable amount of time to recover their corpse an leave the area prior to attacking again.
<p>
"Conversely, the person recovering their corpse is expected to do so and retreat to safety promptly. In other words, sitting next to your corpse and taunting someone while daring them to attack you so that you can /petition them is bad form, and would result in a warning if witnessed by an EQCSR.
<p>
"The EQCSR in attendance will decide what is reasonable in these cases. It is highly recommended that the people involved make equitable arrangements prior to involving the EverQuest Customer Service Staff."
<p>
- <i>Rules of Conduct</i>, Verant Interactive
</ul>
Infractions to these rule should be reported to any in-game officer listed on our <a href="/eq/members/members.htm">Membership Listing</a> page.
