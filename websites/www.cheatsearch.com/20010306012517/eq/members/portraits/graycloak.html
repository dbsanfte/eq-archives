Graycloak was raised by the druids of Karana where he spent most of his youth wandering the groves and fells of the endless plains. He knows nothing of his parents nor his heritage. His only link to the past is his faded gray cloak, a possession he guards with his life.
<p>
It was many years ago when Graycloak came across the path of another traveller, Bere Ironwood - a fellow druid. It seemed Bere needed some assistance obtaining his new circle of spells. Graycloak gladly offered to help his brethren druid with such a task. It was not long afterwards that Bere offered Graycloak a chance to be a Peacekeeper. Seeing how the guild leader was an excellent fellow, and would jump down a dragon's throat to save someone, Graycloak gladly accepted his offer.
<p>
Since those days, Graycloak has continued with his quest to learn of his heritage. He has learned some things... things that indicate his past made be shaded by evil. Only time will tell, yet such news only disturbs the slumber of the druid known as Graycloak...
