<h4>Attribute Scores for Mages</h4>
<blockquote>
Intelligence is very important ability for all classes in Norrath, but none more so than a magic user. A being's relative Intelligence determines the speed with which one can learn and develop skills, all the more important for spellcasters who rely heavily on their strength in the spell spheres. The majority of these skills affect a particular area or type of magic.
</blockquote>
<h4>Meditation Skill</h4>
<blockquote>
Meditation is a critical skill to for magic users to learn. This skill dramatically increases the rate at which mana is recovered. For comparison, a 30<sup>th</sup> level mage would take nearly an hour and a half to regenerate mana by resting, but with use of the meditation skill, it would take only 4 minutes. This skill is acquired at different levels, depending upon the spell weaver's class (4<sup>th</sup> for Necromancers, 8<sup>th</sup> for Clerics, etc).
</blockquote>
<h4>Pets and Charming Creatures</h4>
<blockquote>
Summoning or charming a creature can be the fastest way for solo characters to raise level. This extra <I>pet</I> can be a great boon at early levels, allowing low-level players to attack and kill larger monsters earlier, thus gaining more experience, faster.
<p>
Summoned creatures do come with a price. When a monster is killed with the aid of a pet, the pet takes a meager portion of the experience. However, in a party or group situation, the pet only takes a portion of the experience if it deals the killing blow.
<p>
Finally, at higher levels when the caster's Summoning skill is quite high, there is a chance of a rare event in which the caster can summon a more powerful than normal creature (faster, stronger, etc.). Conversely, there is also a chance that the caster may summon a creature that resents being called and will turn to attack the caster. Be careful what you wish for...
<p>
Please note that a charm spell may be resisted by the target and that even if successful, when the charm wears off, the former <I>pet</I> will be hostile towards its former master.
<p>
<b>Pet Commands</b>
<ul>
<li>/pet (command)<br>gives orders to a charmed or summoned pet.  Sample pet commands:
<li>/pet guard here<br>tells the pet to guard its current location.
<li>/pet guard me<br>tells the pet to attack anyone that attacks it's master, or that it's master attacks.
<li>/pet follow me<br>tells the pet to follow you, but ends when you cross a zone line.
<li>/pet attack <target><br>tells the pet to attack the designated target.
<li>/pet back off<br>tells the pet to stop its attack.
<li>/pet as you were<br>returns the pet to neutral, belaying all prior orders.
<li>/pet get lost<br>pet disappears.
</ul>
