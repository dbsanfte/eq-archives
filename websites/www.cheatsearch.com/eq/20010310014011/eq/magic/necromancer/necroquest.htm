<h2>City of Neriak</h2>
Faction modifiers: The Dead (+), Queen Cristanosthex (+), King Aythoxthex (-), Keepers of the Art (-) and Eldritch Collective (-)
<blockquote>
<h3>Beetle Eye Quest</h3>
Speak with Noxhil V'Sek on the 4th floor of the Necromancer Guild.<p>
Ask Noxhil about the <i>menial tasks</i>. Then ask about the <i>beetle eye quest</i>. He will give you a small chest with 10 slots for beetle eyes (exclusively). Fill the box with beetle eyes (fire beetles are easy to find in the newbie area) and then click the <b>Combine</b> button. Give the locked chest created by the combination to Noxhil. In return, you get some experience (not a lot), 2 copper and a small lantern. This quest is repeatable.
<h3>Courier Duties</h3>
Speak with Noxhil V'Sek on the 4th floor of the Necromancer Guild.
<p>
&quot;We require you to retrieve messages from our nearby agents. Periodically, you are required to venture to them and ask the agent if he has any <i>messages for Neriak</i>. If he does, you will return all correspondence to the designated party. Presently, we have enough runners. Here. You may see the list.&quot;<br>
<blockquote>
<h4>Current Expeditionary List</h4>
The Dead Kizdean Gix (West Commonlands)<br>
Cytodl K'Rish (Highhold Pass)<br>
Xxxxxxx is Hellish Troops on the upper ledge of South Gate (Freeport)<br>
</blockquote>
<h3>Kerra Isle Beetle and Elephant Tusks</h3>
Speak with Noxhil V'Sek on the 4th floor of the Necromancer Guild.<p>
&quot;Take this chest. This one must be filled with [Kerra Isle Beetle] eyes. Before you return the filled chest to me, be sure to also return with a [Bull Elephant] tusk. Be quick about it and I may reward you with something special.&quot;
<p>
In reality, you need to gather a Mammoth Tusks (from Everfrost) and not a Bull Elephant Tusk. Upon returning the mammoth tusk and beetle eyes, Noxhil says:
<p>
&quot;Excellent work young one. You are sure to be an asset to our faction. Let us see if we can help you on your journey to power. I believe this can be of assistance to a young Necromancer of [The Dead].&quot;
<p>
You receive a faction adjustment, a little cash and a random necromancer spell scroll.
<h3>Thex Mallet</h3>
Speak with Loveal S'Nez on the 3rd floor of the Necromancer Guild.<p>
<b>Letter to Loveal S'Nez from Cytodl K'Rish in Highhold Pass:</b> from Courier Duties Quest<br>
&quot;To Loveal S'Nez, The Dead. Neriak. I require aid in keeping adventurers from Befallen. I have reason to believe the Thex Mallet lies shattered within Befallen. I have lost too many members of the expeditionary team. Help.&quot;
<p>
<b>Loveal S'Nez:</b><br>
&quot;All you can know is that the Thex Mallet is desired by our Queen. If we are not successful in it retrieval it will be our heads which adorn her trophy room. We have learned the location and believe it to be in three separate pieces.&quot;
<p>
1 piece is held by a zombie named Windstream. The other 2 pieces are randomly on elf skeletons (head and shaft). Combine the 2 elf pieces in the piece from Windstream to create the Thex Mallet.
<h2>Or,</h2>
<b>Upon completion the Sir Lindeal quest, Loveal S'Nez states:</b><br>
&quot;So you have succeeded where others have failed. You show promise. Take this then. You shall be a valuable asset to The Dead. This will help you on your way. Are you still interested in my [appointed tasks]?&quot;<p>
The reward, other than faction adjustment, is a random item. A buckler and a Damask Robe have been reported prizes.
<p>
<i>What are your appointed tasks</i>
<p>
&quot;Very well. You have reached the appropriate power. I require you to journey to the Commonlands and seek out Kizdean Gix. He is a member of a very important force. Tell him the Utalk Adarev Otcin. Remember this password.&quot;
<p>
<b>When you speak with Kizdean Gix in West Commonlands, he says:<br></b>
&quot;You speak the words of The Dead. You must be the assitance Loveal was to send. You must work quickly. Inside Befallen are the three pieces of the [Thex Mallet] which is to be returned to Loveal. Find Hubard L'rodd. He was my assitant. Give him this note and he should have information.&quot;
<p>
<b>Note from Kizdean Gix to Hubard L'rodd:</b><br>
&quot;L'rodd, This loyal member of The Dead has been sent by Master Loveal. Please assist in any way possible. Kizdean&quot;
<p>
Hubard L'rodd is dead, but you can give the scroll to his skeleton. Giving the scroll to Hubard causes Windstream to spawn on the throne just behind the secret wall.
<p>
1 piece is held by a zombie named Windstream. The other 2 pieces are randomly on elf skeletons (head and shaft). Combine the 2 elf pieces in the piece from Windstream to create the Thex Mallet.
<p>
<font color="#000080"><b>Upon returning the Thex Mallet to Loveal S'Nez:</b></font><br>
&quot;Oh how grand it is!! Look at it!! I feel the power trembling within. Who would have thought such an item would be abandoned. You have performed supremely. Queen Cristanos shall reward me greatly and I shall reward you greatly.&quot;
<p>
The ultimate reward is a random necromancer scroll (I got an 8th level one), some exp and a faction adjustment. No cash.

<h3>Kill Sir Lindeal</h3>
Speak with Loveal S'Nez on the 3rd floor of the Necromancer Guild.<p>
&quot;What is this I see before me? A would be hero of The Dead? You reek of false bravado. I have seen others such as you meet their fate at the end of a blade. I see no reason to continue our conversation. How can one such as you assist with my [delegated duties].&quot;
<p>
<i>What are your delegated duties?</i>
<p>
&quot;Why do you ask? I know why. Glory has captured your affections. Those who seek glory find death. Still, you may be of some use. Before I appoint a task I must be assured of your power. I require you to [perform a test].
<p>
<i>I will perform the test.</i>
<p>
&quot;In the Lavastorm Mountain Range there are reports of a Paladin, a Sir Lindeal. He has compromised our routes between,... Well, that is none of your concern. All you need  know is that this Paladin of the Temple of Marr be sent to his everlasting life. Do so and prove your worth to us. I await your proof. Use no assistance. If you are truly his equal then I shall know. I know all.&quot;
<p>
<b>Upon completion, Loveal S'Nez states:</b><br>
&quot;So you have succeeded where others have failed. You show promise. Take this then. You shall be a valuable asset to The Dead. This will help you on your way. Are you still interested in my [appointed tasks]?&quot;<p>
The reward, other than faction adjustment, is a random item. A buckler and a Damask Robe have been reported prizes.
