<h1>The Battle for Qeynos</h1>
by Aamlador.
</center>
<p>
My story begins on a sunny morning. I had a hangover from my night of drinking the night before so I went to the gate to get some air and see if there were any parties going to BB.  i found a group of 2 and joined them. we had fun killing the gnolls in their own home and it was night by the time we left. deciding to celebrate are fun we head to Qeynos for some Beer. we arrive only to find 3 elves blocking the gate.  thinking they were new guards we try to pass them but they drew their swords and told us the city was under elven control now. we left to the border of the zone to think of a plan. we noticed a group of 4 barbarains being lead out of the city. we went to the gate to see what happened and find the elves had stolen the barbarians things. we bring the barbarains with us to the border and ask if they would help us liberate our town. they said they would after we got them their stuff back. so we walked up to the elven guards and asked them if they would move aside they said no so we hit them on the head with the pommels of our swords. we enter they city to find it strangley quiet. we then noticed all the townsflok were gone. hurrying we ran to the barbarians armor and weapons after a brief tussle with a elven guard that ended in his death. we then were confronted by a group of 6 elves and had to fight we took 3 of then before they retreated. needing to heal and think of a plan we went to the temple of life to rest.
<p>
We had just finished healing when a patrol found us.  Not wanting to fight in the temple we jumped into the teleporter.  And ran to SQ we made it to the arena and decided to have the final battle there.  After about two hours a patrol came and we had to fight. We killed all but one and he ran to tell the Elven leader.  We prepared as best we could for the final battle.  It was 10:00 pm when they finally came.  They numbered 20 Elves and 2 Halfing Druids.  We knew we had no chance but we had no choice now.  Shouting our battle cries we rushed the enemy prepared to die for our cause.  It was a long battle and despite our small numbers we took many elves down in our charge but were eventually stopped and were hard pressed, I was fighting two elves when I saw my friend Tackler fall to the blade of the Elven leader.  Enraged I broke from my attackers and rushed the Elven leader.  Just when I reached him we heard the blast from a horn and all stopped to see who blew it.  We saw a group of five humans rushing our battle.  My heart was glad for now I knew we would win this battle.  Just then I saw the Elven leader raise his sword and I just managed to get my weapon up in time to black it.  He swung his shield and caught me on the side of my head.  Stunned I barely rolled to the side and got cut on the arm.  Not having the time to look at the wound I lashed out with my foot and hit my foe on the inside of the knee.  Getting up quickly I slashed out at the leader and cut him across his gut.  Knowing he was dead I looked for more opponents but they were all engaged, so I went to my fallen friend and closed his eyes.  And that ended the battle of Queynos.
