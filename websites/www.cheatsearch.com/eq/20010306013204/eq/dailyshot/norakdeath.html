<h2>Your enemies lying dead at your feet.</h2>

There is little that feels more satisfying than standing over the corpse of your slain enemy. This foul troll is Norak, the first being to ever slay me. Using deception, he lured me into his trap and then struck without mercy. To add insult to injury, he and his partner Brildarmus body camped me when I returned to recover my corpse. This day, however, the victory was mine. With the aid of our allies in Finality, the revenge I had longed for eighteen levels was finally realized. Revenge is sweet.
