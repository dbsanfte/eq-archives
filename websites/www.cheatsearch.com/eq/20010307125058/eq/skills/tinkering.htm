<h1 align="center">Tinkering Guide</h1>
Welcome guild members, I am Harkinon, Gnome Enchanter, Tinkerer, and Jewel Crafter. In this lesson you will learn the basics of tinkering, locations of books and components for tinkering, and what you can expect to be able to make using this trade. First off, this trade is GNOME ONLY ! No other race can use this skill.
<p>
First you will need a toolbox, these are purchasable at the windmills in Ak 'anon for around one platinum, or you can have a smithy make you one.
<p>
The beginners source for tinkering books is in Ak 'anon, in one of the three windmills there is a merchant selling&nbsp; journals of a master tinkerer, as well as many of the components you will need to make the devices explained in the journals. Gnomes start with tinkering at Below Average, that is equal to about 30 skill points.
<p>
At first you will be making things such as compasses and collapsible fishing poles. At later levels you can start making new types of lanterns, mechanical lock picks, and even your own Clockwork Scout. This trade is very likely the most interesting, and definitely the most expensive. Start out small even though you have 30 skill points in the trade.
