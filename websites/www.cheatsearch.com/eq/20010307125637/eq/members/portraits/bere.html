Born of root, twig and branch, Bere Ironwood's feet were set firmly upon the trail of the Druid at an early age. His first memories are of swinging from the bows of the Jaggedpine in his home of Surefall Glade. His tutors were the fish in the streams and the bears of the caverns.
<p>
Eager to learn, his mind absorbed all training that was made available. From learning the languages of all speaking creatures (and some that do not) to mastering diverse crafts his quest for personal growth seemed limitless. His questing soon turned to seeking and destroying the enemies of his homeland, the gnolls of Blackburrow and their evil alliance with the vile Circle of Unseen Hands.
<p>
In the hills just outside Qeynos is where he was snared by his true love, Krystall. A strong-willed human paladin, her contest with Bere's heart was predestined; he stood no chance of escape. They were soon wed beneath the pines at the Spring Solstice and the bears of the Glade roared with glee.
<p>
Deep within the gnoll stronghold is where Bere met lifelong friend and companion Mezmer, an enchanter from distant Erudin. They found unmatched strength in their combined abilities. It was not long before they met others with similar goals and interests. With Alexi an Erudite Cleric, Avaric Paramonte an Erudite Wizard, Korvak the Reckless an Erudite Magician and Borris Dragonsoul a Barbarian Warrior, the early Death Squad was formed. Nothing could stand before these brave companions. A little later, Aani the Erudite Enchantress, Helzraized the Barbarian Shaman and Graycloak a fellow Human Druid were counted among the ranks of the Death Squad.
<p>
The Death Squad became the kernel of a much larger and more prominent organization, The Peacekeepers of Norrath. With aspirations of bringing peace to all of the light loving citizens of Norrath, the Peacekeepers set out to teach tolerance and protect the homelands. Their only foes are the Dark Races who wish nothing more than to loot the bodies of good people, living or dead.
<p>
After many long and arduous adventures, Bere decided to retire. He now spends most of his time traveling the lands, helping out guildmates and tutoring his son Masoud in languages, lore and combat.
