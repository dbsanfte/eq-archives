Here is the Death Squad recovering their bodies, post meeting. Apparently, they did not take kindly to the line of questions being asked...

Featured corpses are Korvak, Aani, Alexi, Aaidyn and Mezmer. (Bere added his corpse to the pile quickly after returning from being link-dead)

Picture submitted by Aani.
