<center><h1>Spell Research</h1>
</center>
Spell Research is a trade skill, similar in theory to tailoring and cooking.  Specific items are inserted in to a container, combining to produce a new item.
<p>
All magi begin researching spells at level 16.  To do spell research, you will need a Tome specific to your class - these can be purchased in your guild hall.
<blockquote>
Wizards use a Lexicon<br>
Mages use an Elemental Grimoire<br>
Enchanters use a Tome of Endless Enchantments<br>
Necromancers use a Book of Dark Bindings<br>
</blockquote>
Research instruction books can also be purchased in your guild hall.  All instruction books are written in languages other than common.  To learn the fundamentals of a language, you must train one point in the language with your guild master.  Once you have learned the fundamentals, you will be able to advance your linguistic skills through use - usually by listening to someone speak in that language.  
<p>
Research instruction books will list the components needed to produce a scroll.  Spell components can be found scattered throughout the world - they appear randomly on different creatures, so you will not have to 'camp' a spot to get a certain component.  Components can be stored and traded - ask around - 13 of the 14 classes out there will not be able to use the research component that you need.
<p>
Research components are usually found on intelligent creatures, or on creatures that are innately magical.
