<b>Karana Server<br>
Guild Party!</b>
<p>
When: Friday, December 1 at 10am MST<br>
Where:  Beholder Maze 
<p>
The time has come again for a guild party/guild hunt. On Friday, December 1st in Beholder Maze (Gorge of King Xorbb III). We're going after the Evil Eyes that inhabit the area to try to get some eye bunches for the warriors in the guild. These bunches are used in Crafted Gauntlets. Other prizes off these beasts are Polished Bone Bracelets (ac 2 +3 wis/int). Those sell for around 125pp and will be lotto'd off if we get any.
<p>
I plan on being there from 10am to 9pm MST...so get on when you can and come fight...considering the time most of you play...most of the action will probably take place after 6pm MST, but if you're on early, no problem. I figure for the level most of you guys are at, the exp should be pretty good. I'll be there with Daba to keep wondering mobs or other eyes that wonder by under control.

<b>Karana Server<br>
Guild Party!</b>
<p>
The time has come for our first official guild party =).  Najena dungeon will be our stomping grounds on Saturday the 30<sup>th</sup> of September at around 2pm MST.  Dabashire will there as long as he can keep my eyes open, but would perfer everyone be there around 2pm that can so we can get down to business.  If you need a bind in Freeport...or are able to bind in Neriak, he can take care of it.  If any of you need help finding the dungeon, he will help with that as well.
<p>
You younger types will probably stick close to the entrance, as there is some baddies in that zone.  Depending on how many people show up, Dabashire will pull for you guys so the whole zone doesn't follow ya until the entryway spawns are broken.  If luck is on our side, a few guild-friends and are going to camp Najena and the other creatures in the zone for the treasures that are to be held in there.  So come prepared for lots of fun, bloodshed and booze!  If there is a better time that would work for you, let Dabashire know and he will push the official time back a bit....  Also, our allies, The Silent Watch, have been invited as well...not sure how many will come, but they have been notified.  Hopefully we can get everyone some cool toys.  One last thing...those of you that qualified for becoming probationary officers, Dabashire take care of anyone remaining at the event.
<p>
Cya at Najena!

<b>Tallon Zek Server<br>
Peacekeepers Dive Kedge</b>
<p>
With cheers of support from our lower members, a Peacekeeper force of 11 members 45<sup>th</sup> level and above gathered in Kedge Keep to vanquish the evils of that sunken city. Our first target, the reviled and twisted Mermaid Estrella, fell easily to our might.
<p>
Our attempts at the King of Kedge, Phinigel Autropos, in the end we unsuccessful. After many skirmishes with his guard and much learning, we were forced to depart leaving the sea monster of Kedge Keep unvanquished. 
<p>
Everyone did a wonderful job and we now know better how to slay Phin. Victory will be ours next time!

<p>
Both attempts on Lady Vox were unsuccessful.
<p>
Saturday, March 11 at 5:00pm PST
<p>
The following is rules will be in effect.  Only 40+ are invited to the raid.  When and if the Lady dragon Vox is slain items will be rolled for by classes that can use them.  Only 45+ players may roll for those items.  The universal item none as the dragon scale will be rolled for by all 40+ so that there is purpose besides enjoyment for them to make the sacrifice.  With help from other guilds I have contacted I have a count of 20 level 50 players, & 30 level 45+ players.  Harazzer has explained that his people have been training in Permafrost on how to pull the Ice Giants and others before the Dragon.  With there help it will be easier.  It seems that the success comes from draining the dragon's mana.  We will need all help from those who can.

</ul>
Rules:
<p>
Braveheart Style - this means you die once and you are out. You will have to sit the remainder of the war out untill 11pm pacific. At 11pm pacific a truce will be in effect giving all players time to recover corpses. You may recover your corpse sooner, but you will need to drag it to the zone. But, you still have to sit out untill the war is over.
<p>
It will start at around 8pm pacific. 
<p>
DO NOT BIND IN SOUTH KARANAS. Lights should bind in High pass and Darks in the Arena. Personally, I don't care where you bind, JUST NOT IN SOUTH KARANAS.
<p>
Lights will form up at the Centaurs
<p>
Darks at the HERMIT

<b>Karana Server</b><p>
It is with a heavy heart that we are disbanding the Karana chapter of the Peacekeepers. Karana is where many of us cut our teeth in Norrath, and we will always remember all members, past and present, fondly. However, it appears that disbanding of the charter is the right thing to do.
<p>
Rastsar will meet with Jeng to transfer the Guild Leader tag back. Members who wish to retain their Peacekeeper guild tags may do so. We do ask that no Officer on Karana admit any new members.
<p>
Those that wish to follow Jeng and Rain may do so with our gratitude and thanks for all of the support they have shown the Peacekeepers.

It turns out that Halas did not have a PvP arena, so the event was moved to the Freeport arena. It just so happened that as the Peacekeepers gathered to practice battle strategies that the Dark Races decided to attack Freeport. It was a good day to do battle!

<b>Tallon Zek Server</b>
<p>
We have come to the sad conclusion that the guild known as The Infernal, lead by Reshan, are intolerable and incorrigible. Over the past few weeks they have initiated countless skirmishes against our membership without cause or provocation. Their ceaseless want for blood leaves us no choice but to declare war.

At the Guild Party with friends from the Allied Giants in attendence, members of the Peacekeepers slew their first griffon. The Griffon Slayers were Hawkebane, Reed, Gunter, Tempelton, Kartusak and Rastsar.
<p>
<b><i>PARTY</i></b><br>
We will be having a guild party this Saturday night, July 24, at 10pm PST (1:00am EST) at Big Orc camp in East Commonlands. We have invited the Allied Giants, a prospective guild ally, to join us for the bash. 
<p>
It should be good exp for younger members, good faction for others that need it in Freeport, and a chance to raise your Alcohol Tolerance skill. Be sure to bring lots of home brew for those that make it (new recipes posted on the site) and goods and equipment trades for members and friends. 
<p>
It is a great chance to meet everyone, make new friends and form hunting groups. Please try to come as it will be a lot of fun.

For all 23 languages, the lessons take about 2.5 hours (about 7 minutes per language). As are reminder, only members above 20th level are granted Dragon and Elder Dragon language training.

If you have lost your guild tags, this is the perfect opportunity to get them back. Please see an officer at the event to have your tag reinstated.
