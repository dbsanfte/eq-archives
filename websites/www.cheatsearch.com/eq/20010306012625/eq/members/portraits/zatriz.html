Zatriz is an enigma even among the Iksar of Cabilis. Even his birth was considered strange to the lizard people, who are used to broods of children. Zatriz was the only survivor in his brood. The Brood Mother knew at that moment that an omen was given to the Iksar people.
<p>
She named the lone broodling after a mighty servant of Cazic-Thule's, and began laying plans to give the broodling over to the Scaled Mystics. Surely they could decipher the omen of this child's birth....... They could not.
<p>
Zatriz's life in the Temple of Terror was much like all the other mystics. He recited mantras and performed rituals until they became second nature. He was worked physically, hauling stones and beams in an effort to rebuild the proud city of Cabilis. His mind was honed with puzzles, conundrums, paradoxes, law, history and tactics. Zatriz excelled in all of these.
<p>
The Mystics saw the potential in Zatriz, and decreed that Zatriz would be pushed to his limited, and beyond. They taught him the ways of battle. To know enemy from friend. To live off the land and how to survive. They knew that one day Zatriz would go forth into the world to spread the fear of Cazic-Thule. But Zatriz had other things in mind.
<p>
Zatriz did his tasks without complaint. He soaked up the knowledge and soon became a Prophet of the Temple. But spreading fear was contrary to what was in his heart. He had become friends with a monk in a nearby monastary, The Court of Pain. This monk, Stonescale, showed him the wonders that could be found in the world. Showed him the joys that could be had in peace. And thus began Zatriz's life as a Peacekeeper.
<p>
Zatriz now travels the world, bringing peace and understanding to those who have none.
