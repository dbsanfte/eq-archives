The adopted son of a mighty spellweaver of Erudin, Jamerson became scintillated by the raw powers of the wizard's powers. Growing up he honed his skills of destruction, as his fellow adopted brother Aaeni worked at the arts of bedazzling. The pair of brothers, each with their own areas of specialization, went their seperate ways for a large portion of their lives whereas Jamerson took residence in the wizard guild in the elven city of Felwithe hoping to uncover some meaning to his bastardization as a child. Never finding clues to his true heritage, he consumed his frustration in studies of his arts. At one brief moment he even took up fletching, an odd skill for a caster, to keep his mind off of wondering about his parents and how he came to find himself in Erudin, so far away from Felwithe and his race. As time passed he was reunited with his brother Aaeni and came to find his service most well spent in the fold of the Peacekeepers. Now the two bring the name of the Brothers Painbringer to the ears of their enemies and serve the Peacekeepers in undying loyalty. All Hail the Peacekeepers!
