O. L.</span><hr size=1> Okay...here is the deal.  The title reads L.O.L...meaning Lords of Legends.  Thats where alot of us came from.  Thats where ALL of the original members of this guild came from.  And when we formed this guild, there was one main intent at hand.  That main goal was to keep us together.  Those of us that simply enjoyed playing the game as it is meant to be....a game.  Those of us that just wanted to have fun, and stay connected.  L.O.L. disbanded for various reasons, all of which are understandable.  Those of you who were around back then know what happened, and I dont think any of us wanted to let go of the bond we had.  That is the reason we reformed under a new name.  Everyone that was here for the founding of LT understood what our intent was, and everyone was in agreement.  There was never supposed to be any pressure in this guild.  If a player wants to log on and sit at lvl 20 in Orc 3 in West Commons killing as many Orcs as physically possible, with the desire to break the record for most Death Fist Belts ever collected.....then so be it!!!  If that same person wants to grind every day and night to get to 65 as fast as possible, then that is fine too.  <br>
The guild was built around the concept of friendship and a common bond.....its even written in the guild charter.  I know that because I wrote it.  And I made certain that it stated our intent.<br>
Over time we have grown alot.  Upwards and outwards.  And all of this is GREAT!!  I couldnt be happier with our development.  However, along the way a certain amount of pressure has developed.  Where it came from is difficult to pinpoint.  But it happened regardless.  There is pressure to level, pressure to raid, pressure to group together, pressure to do alot of things that some guilds DO do.  Some guilds, like FOH  are all about raids, and insist that you play at least 6 days a week, between certain hours.  You arent allowed to go do your own thing on most occasions.  Constantly raiding and such.  This is not what we wanted.  Raids are fine, for those that want to go!  Im all for it and I know that most of you are.  However, not one single person in this guild should feel bullied, pushed, or pressured into doing anything that they dont want to do.  <br>
If you are a player who:<br>
&gt; enjoys just simply playing the game and having fun<br>
&gt; likes knowing that if you get into a fix, or have a problem,<br>
  there will be friends that come to your aid<br>
&gt; doesnt want people bossing you around or pressuring <br>
  you<br>
......then this guild is for you.<br>
<br>
If you are a player who:<br>
&gt; is raid driven<br>
&gt; tries to be the boss all of the time<br>
&gt; tends to PUT pressure on people<br>
&gt; nags other players about their level, playtime, or gimpiness<br>
&gt; complains everytime something doesnt go the way you want<br>
&gt; likes drama<br>
......then you need to meet me in game so I can /wave as you journey on.<br>
<br>
No one will hold it against you if you want to leave.  If we arent fast paced enough for ya, if you want to raid all of the time....there is nothing wrong with that.  But there are guilds made for people like that, and this isnt it.  In the words of Tupac, 'I aint mad atcha...got nothin but luv for ya'.  But I wont let anyone disrupt the happiness!<br>
<br>
We are here to have fun, enjoy the game, support each other, have alot of laughs, scarey moments, and good times.  And it WILL remain that way.<br>
<br>
The choice is yours...the fork in the road stands before you...which way will you travel???<br>
<br>
DONT BE SKURRD....I GAVE EM THE FORK!!!<br>

O. L.</span><hr size=1> For those of you that know me, skip this, you already know what I'm gonna say. For those that don't let me give you a heads up:<br>
<br>
I have been playing for almost 4 years.. EGADS I should have 400AA... I don't because I will always, at the drop of the hat stop, drop, and run to someone who needs help.. to the frustration of every group I've ever been in.  That's just me.<br>
<br>
We started with one pc, one account, two characters.  My kids didn't touch the game until i'd been in it for over a year at which point I bought them a pc and one account.  After watching me play for a year these kids showed me how to REALLY play the game, wow.  I refused to allow them on Veeshan for a VERY long time... their characters on two other servers passed mine in levels.  The research and time they spent learning the game surpassed anything I would have EVER done.<br>
<br>
Since then I've purchased more accounts and built more pc's.  We now have seven accounts, and six computers, four of which are EQ Windowed so we can bring on two char on one pc times four.  That's ten char at any given time.  We ALWAYS have a full group, from the time we log in, with char's sitting out of the group doing their thing.  Buffs, slows, etc.<br>
<br>
I have purchased so many accounts and built and or upgraded all these pcs for one reason... to play with my kids... To give Bem credit I really can't call him a kid anymore... he'll be in the Air Force within the year off doing his own thing.  But the point is my kids had to pay their dues to me and I guarantee I was one tough bitch on them.  They have paid their dues, and they have the right and the knowledge to be their own person.  I sometimes feel I need to apologize for this and I'm working on NOT doing that anymore.  They are blunt, they are to the point.  They will tell you the way it is with ZERO tact and I will no longer expect them to apologize for this.  My kids know their shit, and know how to play this game better than I don't know HOW many people.  I'm really tired of them taking flak from it just because of their age.  I made it possible for them to play, for them to have all the benefits avail etc.... why knock them for it.<br>
<br>
SO... that said.  There has never been a time someone needs help that we ignored it... (We being me, my group, my family, whatever) and we never will... we're always there to help.  But don't get mad cause we're out doing things you want to do, don't get mad cause we're mad XP grinding and doing it well... I PAID for us to be able to do this, I no longer want to feel guilty because we can.<br>
<br>
If you get mad that is cool... TELL ME... Tell whoever pisses you off.  but don't EVER, and I mean NEVER go whining to an officer, EVER.  We are not babysitters, we are not here to hold anyone's hand.  Sorry Don for not being as &quot;diplomatic&quot; as I could be.  The whining will stop NOW and it will never start again.  If you have a problem with a guildmate you best step up and talk to them.  Don't expect one of us to do it for you, don't even /TELL one of us... deal with it.  We as officers, as guildmates are here to help you when you NEED us... we're not you're sounding board, we're not your scapegoat we are NOT the cheese to go with your whine.  We are here to play a game. A game amongst friends.  If you need HELP call us.... otherwise deal with the piddly bullshit yourself cause you are on your own there.<br>

Altho I was not an origonal member of L.O.L, I have heard alot about what happend. As Don has mentioned the reasons they disbanded were understandable, but the same reason is begining to develop here in the Luclin Triads. I like many others play this game to get away from the problems of life, well... not much here... but I think you get my point.<br>
<br>
For you people who get to serious about the game... example, complain about this and that, etc. I have some news for you... GET A LIFE, ITS JUST A GAME!! It's here so that people like me, Don, Wild and the rest of us can have fun with the people we know and love. <br>
<br>
Want to say one more thing with this then I will stop talking your ear off lol... I WILL NEVER let you guys down... call on T-Bone and I'll be there! = ) Have fun, and always remember I love you all = ) your the best family anyone could ask for, I hope you all feel the same <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://64.87.48.130/Signature.bmp" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

I don't have one, single clue what has happened to cause this thread, and it's really none of my business. I would just like to say that I was around before LoL was disbanded; not a member, mind you, but wanted very much to join their ranks from the moment I created my first character in EQ.<br>

   Just to let you all know. Alot may not see me on all the time. I started about the same time Wild did. Was a member of the original LOL. I used to play consistantly everyday. Pressures to level to camp items needed , guild need help. This being said when LOL disbanded I sought other companionship through other guild. It was by far nothing that LOL was. After research getting into some guild was like a big pain in the ass., find certain people, get the right gear, camp long hours with people in the guild. Quite frankly I have kids family work and stuff like that. One day i seen dondredge and asked if he was still excepting LOL members and what the requirements were. Just ask he said. Like wild in 4 years I have one character 56 and 2 AA. I since have gained 2 accts from friends and still have no character to 60. The comradre that I recieve from people here is great. People here s lifes have changed over the years and that s the important thing here. I know more about wild s personal life than I do here game life. I accept and have always welcomed be able to just pop in play a couple hours, do rezzes for people and what not. TOO ALL I HAVE ENJOYED GROWING WITH YOU ALL IN LIFE AND GAME!!!!!!<br>

O. L.</span><hr size=1> Well said all. I to was an original member of LOL.   I started this game by watching my uncle(Maaurius) play this game for HOURS at my house. He was in LOL at the time and I would always sit there and read the guild chat. They were like family. Always laughing and messing around with each other. So one day I asked him to get me started on EQ and he did.  I worked by myself most of the time, hoping one day to join the ranks of the LOL gang. When that time came, I was ecstatic.  When I joined, there was a lot of great hospitality towards everyone and whenever I had a question or needed help, LOL members were there to help me.  I was only in the guild for about 3 months when the problems started happening, people leaving, and Whining about not getting groups.  Then about 3 months later, I logged on one day and didn't see my guild tag. I was devastated, I had no idea what had happened.  When I found out that Don was starting a new guild, I was one of the first to volunteer to help get it started.  After it was started, I didn't join Luclin Triads, instead I went to a guild of my friends called Veeshans Legacy. That guild was constantly raiding, and guilding with each other and I just didn't fit in, but I didn't want to leave because we were always raiding and that is what I wanted to do.  But again about 2 months later, that guild was having problems and disbanded, and I asked Don if I could join LT.  I forgot how much I missed the friendship and family.  When I first started this game, all I wanted was to raid raid raid and gain mass XP, but after being in LOL, I realized that that is not what this game is about for me, it is about friendships and having a good time.  THAT IS WHY I JOIN LORDS OF LEGENDS AND AM NOW A MEMEBER OF LUCLIN TRIADS.  Just my 2cents worth.<br>

O. L.</span><hr size=1> I know I am one of the baby's of LT, having only been in it for around a month now  =o)  Being Cen's girlfriend has its privileges...aside from free crack for life  =o)  He has told me a lot about everyone in the guild (such as someone who helped him with this, or this person who accomplished this, etc.) what happened in LOL, and so on.  It's helped me to better understand and appreciate you guys, before I ever even had a chance to meet you.<br>
<br>
I have been playing EQ now for a little over a year.  My original character, Ayanali, is a 30 enchanter.  Once she was able to cast clarity, I kinda stopped playing her, and started my druid, and never looked back!  In a years time, I could have easily been lvl 65 by now, with at least one of my characters.  But, there is a reason why I never achieved that.  I LOVE to help people out.  I love to go to newb zones and buff for free, offer PL's to people, help a friend out with some quest, etc.  Above all, I have always been drawn to the comraderie of EQ players, for the most part.<br>
<br>
I have been in several guilds...always searching for that special something, that &quot;oomph&quot; that I was looking for.  I never would find it, so I'd move on.  I finally found it in LT.  Whenever I have a question, I always get an answer, or a suggestion.  Whenever I have needed help with something, I'm swarmed with offers.  Everyone here is so kind and sweet, and always willing to help out.  This is my family, and I love you all very much!!!  =o)<br>
<br>
When I met Cen, I think I was only level 39.  In one month, I've gone all the way to level 51 (dinged last night, WOOT!!!).  For me, that's a big accomplishment, and I owe it, not only to Cen, but to LT, for grouping with me, letting me go on raids, and in some scary places - letting me feel like a &quot;big girl&quot;, LOL  =o)<br>
<br>
Anytime anyone needs anything...let me know.  I know I am one of the lower characters in the guild, but I will do anything and everything I can to assist any of you.  And if anyone ever needs someone to just talk to, vent to, or a shoulder to cry on, I'm here for that, as well.  <br>

LOL was, and always will be the best guild I have ever been in.  I've since moved over to DAoC due to real life and the fact that I was overly addicted to EQ.  I was constantly on myself to level, I've since learned that gaming and RL is a balancing act, I've been playing DAoC since October of last year and have only made level 40, hopefully 41 tonight.  Of course, leveling in DAoC is much faster than it is in EQ.  Mostly this is due to the fact that death isn't such a huge deal.  Sure you loose 10% xp like in eq, but you don't have to go find your bod and gear, you respawn with all your stuff.  Plus you can just go to were you died, if you so choose, where a grave stone is created, pray at your stone and get 50% of what ya lost back.  Well, if anyone ever wants to look me up over there, I play on the Percival server in Midgard.  <br>
