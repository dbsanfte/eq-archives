<br>
&quot;Sailors, <br>
Think you're a real sailor??  Here's your chance to show your metal and prove yourself and your boat, to yourself.  The 2001 SOLO CUP will be held on Saturday, May 12 in the South Basin of the Great Salt Lake.  Skipper's meeting will start at 8:30a on the GSLYC patio and racing will commence at 10a.  Get your sun screen, your foulies, a sack lunch (and maybe dinner) and see if you can single-hand your boat around a long bouy course. <br>
<br>
The SOLO CUP is a Special Off-shore Race (10 to 25 miles depending on wind and weather) and is not part of the Offshore Series.  It is hosted by the Great Salt Lake Yacht Club and is open to anyone who has filed an Informed Consent Form, has a sailboat over 19 feet, a VHF radio (handheld ok), and has paid the $10.00 fee.  (There is no cost to GSLYC members.)  All boats will be classified based on their PHRF rating with the standard offshore allowance. <br>
<br>
Consent forms, PHRF forms, and expert advice will be available prior to the Skipper's meeting. (Please come early to fillout forms and pay fees.)  Course Maps will be handed out at the meeting.   <br>
<br>
Special Note to Racers: If you have ever thought the reason your boat struggled in races or had difficulty keeping up with other boats on the lake, was due to your crew, now's the time to put your perception to the test.  Ask yourself, &quot;is it my crew, my boat, or is it me?  Come on out and give it go and you will be able to answer at least two of these questions.  You need only to look in the mirror for your crew in this race &lt;smile&gt;. <br>
<br>
Special Note to Cruisers/Daysailors: Ever wonder what you would do if your crew, (significant other, kids, friends, whoever you take sailing) became dibilitated due to sea sickness, injury, etc. and your engine wouldn't start? How would you single-hand the boat to safety and assistance in the fastest possible manner?  We don't like to think about these things, so we don't often practice them.  Well, here's your chance to see if you are ready for such a situation, and safely, in the midst of numerous other boats in case you do get in to trouble.  Come on out and see what you've got!! <br>
<br>
This is more than a race, it's an on-the-water education! <br>
See ya on the water, <br>

<br>
&quot;<br>
Sailors, <br>
After that very enticing invitation for you to take part in the 2001 SOLO CUP on Satruday, May 12, I felt it only prudent to pass on some information regarding racing requirements and safety recommendations.  Please keep in <br>
mind, the information is not anything a safety minded sailor would not consider for their boat and crew.   <br>
<br>
As you may already know, the Great Salt Lake is a thing of beauty when light breezes blow across it's emerald water, but it can be as treacherous as a hurricane tossed ocean when sudden storms seem to appear out of no where. Even on clear, sunny days, it is not unusual for winds to slowly (or suddenly) change direction, increase in intensity, and without warning, you are in the midst of 3 to 6 foot swells, waves cresting and white-caps frothing in sustained winds of 25-35 mph with gusts exceeding 45-60 mph.   <br>
Sometimes less, sometimes more, but sooner or later, if you spend much time on the GSL, it WILL happen to you.  Take heed of the Boy Scout Moto, &quot;Be Prepared&quot;.    <br>
<br>
The following can be found in the Racing Instructions on the GSLYC website at: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.glsyc.org/">www.glsyc.org/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <br>
<br>
Required by the GSLYC for all races: <br>
1.1  One USCG approved type I, II, or III Personal flotation Device (PFD) for each person on board. <br>
1.2  Each PFD must have a whistle attached. <br>
1.3  One USCG type IV throwable flotation device with at least 50 ft of line attached, readily available to the helmsman. <br>
1.4  Adequate means of draining or bailing the bilge and cockpit: i.e. hand bucket, manual bilge pump or electrical bilge pump. <br>
1.5  First Aid Kit <br>
1.6  Anchor with adequate line (scope 7:1 to 10:1 or 100 feet is recommended.) <br>
1.7  USCG approved fire extinguisher (one type B-1 for vessels up to 26 feet; two type B-1 or one type B-II for vessels over 26 feet.) <br>
1.8  USCG approved backfire arrestor on vessels with enclosed inboard gasoline engines. <br>
1.9  USCG approved ventilation of engine / fuel compartment on vessels with enclosed inboard gasoline engines. <br>
1.10 Horn or whistle capable of producing a blast of at least 2 seconds duration.  Device may be mouth activated with a range of 1/2 mile on vessels up to 26 feet.  Device must be manual or power activated with a range of over <br>
1 mile for vessels over 26 feet. <br>
1.11      Three marine flares with current dating. <br>
1.12      Emergency tiller on wheel steered boats. <br>
1.13      Navigation lights as required by law and USCG regulations, must be operable and be displayed between sunset and sunrise. <br>
1.14      Each boat must comply with state laws and USCG regulations. <br>
<br>
Although the SOLO CUP is held during daylight hours and in reality, is more coastal than offshore, you are still alone and if you get into trouble, it could take quite a while for help to arrive: e.g another sailboat only 50 to <br>
100 yards away could take 5 or more minutes to get into position to help you, if they even know you are in trouble.  Therefore, it would be in your best interest to be as prepared as you can be for any situation that may occur.   Here are some recommended safety steps which are strongly encouraged: <br>
-      Safety harness and lanyard (always recommended when solo.) <br>
-      Jack lines or safety straps for moving fore and aft on the boat (always recommended for solo) <br>
-      Handheld or fixed mount VHF within reach at all times <br>
-      Depth sounder or other means of measuring depth <br>
-      Tapered wood plugs for the boats through-hull fittings <br>
-      Auxilary power (gasoline, diesel, electric, etc.) with 3 hours minimum fuel capacity. <br>
-      At least 2 gallons of drinking water - may be needed for something other than drinking. <br>
-      A current Coast Guard Auxilary Courtesy Marine Examination or State Safety Inspection. <br>
-      Man overboard pole with attached strobe and drogue to reduce drift. <br>
-      Lifesling or man overboard recovery system <br>
-      Hand-held or fixed mount GPS or LORAN receiver <br>
-      Radar reflector <br>
-      Tools and spare parts (spark plugs, fuses, lightbulbs, batteries, etc.) <br>
-      Additional rations.  If solo, have some snacks and water within arms reach of the helm. <br>
<br>
And from those survivors of the 2001 Endurance Solo, if you are solo, have an empty container (coffee can, bucket, etc.) handy in case the wind picks up and you are unable to leave the helm when nature calls.  Keep your GPS in a <br>
water-proof container, and your VHF within reach.  If it looks like things could get nasty, put your foulies on and reef early.  As several will atest, reefing under the strain of a blow is at best, difficult, if not impossible <br>
and if you don't have on your foulies when the blow hits, it's too late, you won't be leaving the helm for a while. <br>
<br>
One final note.  The information and requirements provided above are for your use on your boat.  But when it comes to emergency situations and rescues, your preparedness is for those in trouble as well. e.g what good is a &quot;man-overboard system&quot; when you're solo and you are the one in the water?   <br>
Answer: It's your sailing comrade's system that can save you - it works two ways, so don't think you won't be needing yours, you just may need it for other sailing friends.  We all appreciate your preparedness! <br>
<br>
I hope this has been of value.  See ya on the water. <br>

<br>
&quot;Sailors, <br>
Now that I've got your mouth watering for Saturday, May 12, your plans are set for a long day, and you're already out preping your boat for single-handing, I apologize, but I must make a couple of rather important changes to the previous announcement. <br>
<br>
1) The 2001 SOLO CUP is a long bouy race, as mentioned, but is NOT a Special Offshore Race as previously stated.  It is a Special (Long Bouy) Race which is single-handed (solo).  It is long, but will probably only be around 10 - 12 miles in length, so you probably won't need to pack dinner, but unless you're sailing a 12 Meter and the wind is honking, you will probably want to pack a lunch. <br>
<br>
2) Since this is a bouy race, the Skipper's meeting will start at 09:30a. and racing will commence at 11:00a.  This will give you an extra hour to finish putting your boat together or sleep a little longer.  (we will be starting at 11a with, or without you.&lt;smile&gt;) <br>
<br>
3) (I know I only said a couple, but.....)  THERE ARE NO AUTO-PILOTS, AUTOHELMS, ETC. ALLOWED IN THE 2001 SOLO CUP.  Tiller tamers are OK. <br>
<br>
Now, I sent another email previously that provided the racing requirements for the GSLYC and some other strongly suggested recommendations.  This is still a &quot;solo&quot; sailing event, so please take the time to read those recommendations.  We want you  to have fun, learn alot about yourself and your boat, but not at the expense of safety. <br>
<br>
I think that's it.  SEE YA ON THE WATER &lt;BIG SMILE&gt; <br>
