<BR>
A good way from escaping train, which tend to form in many dungeons is to side strafe by holding the right mouse button <BR>
And pressing left and right keys on the keyboard while running. It will give a hard time for the monsters behind you to hit you.

<BR>
When in the range of the levels 1 or 2 try and stay as close as possible to the city, goint to other zones will most likly<BR>
get you killed or if your being attacked while far away from the city you may not have the assistance of the guards if needed.<BR>
<P>
<B> <FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold" SIZE=3> Tip#3</FONT></B>
<BR>
When in doubt, ask! People are very friendly in the eq community and your question should be answered quickly
<P>
<B> <FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold" SIZE=3> Tip#4</FONT></B>
<BR>
Always keep an eye on your life bar, (notice how there’s 5 bubbles) when your life meter goes to about 2 bubbles<BR>
during a battle and it was full to start with when you began fighting then this is a good indication your about to get killed
unless your opponent is low on life as well, otherwise you should run for the nearest zone.<BR>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold" SIZE=3>Tip#5</FONT></B>
<BR>
A great and easy way to get weapons is killing monsters that have them, decaying skeletons usually carry these<BR>
 around within the newbie zones, it’s little more rare to find in the newbie zone but even rusty weapons especially<BR>
  for newbies are quite expensive.
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold" SIZE=3>Tip#6</FONT></B>
<BR>
Its Very important to get a lighting source, if your in Qeynos you can get fire beetle eyes by killing fire beetles, or in any other city you should be able to find a vendor that sells them. They can be useful, since you don’t have to carry them in your hand instead just keep them in your inventory. And there cheap.
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold" SIZE=3>Tip#7</font></B>
<BR>
Remember, you cannot kill wisps with normal weapons; you need to use magic or magic weapons to kill them
. This also occurs with ghouls.
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold" SIZE=3>Tip#8</font></B>
<BR>
Don't help anyone unlesss they ask or their life is very low, people hate when you help when its<BR>
unnecessary, check the person's life and then the monster and see if he needs help, and then ask<BR>
if he needs help.
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold" SIZE=3> Tip#9</FONT></B>
<BR>
Its Always a good idea to change the hotkey (macro) of the attack button which starts off as "A" to another<BR>
button such as "1" so one day if you forget to press enter you wont accidently attack a npc and end up dead.
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold" SIZE=3> Tip#10</FONT></B>
<BR>
A magicians strength is in it's pets, so always carry a small purse full of Malachite in the beginning levels.<BR>
Don't get spells like reclaim energy or flare because they are practically useless.<BR>

<BR>
When you are first starting out, you will find that it is a nuisance to have 
to sell so very often if you do not have a bag.  Most cities have a bag 
vendor that sell a small purse.  This only costs a few silver but is imensely 
helpful in getting you to the point when you can afford actual backpacks.  
I've heard some people begin some quests because the npc will give you a 
small container of some type that you are supposed to fill with items and 
return to them.  They use these as backpacks, and hey, they are free.
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold" SIZE=3> TIP#12</FONT></B>
<BR>
When you first begin a character, stay close to the local guards when 
hunting.  Run to them when you have a monster on you that is too difficult 
for you to handle.  The guards of Kelethin seem a bit slower to protect than 
others for some reason though.
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold" SIZE=3> TIP#13</FONT></B>
<BR>
When I used to explore the Greater Faydark, I was on occasion attacked by 
something I could not handle before level 3.  Since I was unfamiliar with the 
area I panicked and ran, of course.  Had I stayed on the path I would have 
been able to find my corpse.  It's better in my opinion to die in a place 
where you can find your corpse (the path which is a landmark), rather than 
try to outrun the mob in a direction that you are unfamiliar with.
