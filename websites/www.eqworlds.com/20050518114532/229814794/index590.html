<td align="left" valign="top"><h2>Burnt Bread and Chutney</h2><span class="description">In the politics of skin color, Carmit Delman is an ambassador from a world of which few are even aware. Her mother is a direct descendant of the Bene Israel, a tiny, ancient community of Jews thriving amidst the rich cultural tableau of Western India. Her father is American, a Jewish man of Eastern European descent. They met while working the land of a nascent Israeli state. Bound by love for each other and that newborn country, they hardly took notice of the interracial aspect of their union. But their daughter, Carmit, growing up in America, was well aware of her uncommon heritage.  Burnt Bread and Chutney is a remarkable synthesis of the universal and the exotic. Carmit Delman?s memories of the sometimes painful, sometimes pleasurable, often awkward moments of her adolescence juxtapose strikingly with mythic tales of her female ancestors living in the Indian-Jewish community. As rites and traditions, smells and textures intertwine, Carmit?s unique cultural identity evolves. It is a youth spent dancing on the roofs of bomb shelters on a kibbutz in Israel--and the knowledge of a heritage marked by arranged marriages and archaic rules and roles. It is coming of age in Jewish summer camps and at KISS concerts--and the inevitable combination of old and new: ancient customs and modern attitudes, Jewish, Indian, and American.  Carmit Delman?s journey through religious traditions, family tensions, and social tribulations to a healthy sense of wholeness and self is rendered with grace and an acute sense of depth. Burnt Bread and Chutney is a rich and innovative book that opens wide a previously unseen world.<br><a href="/eq/2116634.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>

<td align="left" valign="top"><h2>Cabernet: A Photographic Journey</h2><span class="description">Many wine connoisseurs consider the complex flavors of a fine cabernet sauvignon to be unmatched by any other variety, giving it a widely held reputation as the supreme accomplishment in the art of winemaking. To create such a richly textured wine takes more than excellent grapes; it requires an incredible level of dedication and skill in every stage of the process. To produce this handsome book, photographer Charles O'Rear followed cabernet harvests across four continents, chronicling the elaborate journey from vine to bottle. O'Rear is a photojournalist who uses his camera much as a writer wields a pen--to tell a story. His choice of subjects, composition, and settings are clearly influenced by his many years contributing to National Geographic magazine. Here he presents an interesting series of subtle and imaginative full-color photos that capture the essence of the unique people and age-old methods they utilize to conceive this world-renowned wine. The accompanying text is sparse yet informative, and the famous winemaker Robert Mondavi provides a brief forward as well.<br><a href="/eq/2115964.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>
