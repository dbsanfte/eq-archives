/ooc [text]: will post your message to everyone in the zone as 'out of character'<BR> 
/shout [text]: will post your message to everyone in the zone in a nice red color. [I don't recommend this one since is the same as /ooc as for it's function and harder on the eye] <BR>
/auction [text]: will post your message to everyone in the zone and is used if you would like to sell a item or ask to purchase one. <BR>
/petition [text]: will petition a GM. Reasons for doing this would include character getting stuck somewhere, to ask if they are aware of a bug or problem the game is experiencing, etc. <BR>
/feedback: will pull up a box to fill out information in. You would use this if you would like to offer game suggestions. <BR>
/bug: will pull up a box to fill out information in. Use this if you are going to report a exploit/bug in the game. <BR></Font>

/anon or /a - Makes you Anonymous in /who and /who all, preventing other players from seeing your class, level, and current location.<BR>

/autosplit - automatically splits any loot you get with the rest of your part. Each member must do this to split all loot evenly (this feature is currently disabled, but will be reactivated prior to commercial release).<BR>
/assist - if you target a player who is engaged in combat, the /assist command will automatically target for you whoever that player is fighting at the moment -- this can be very useful in heavy combat. To be most effective, it is best to set this as a Social (see IV.F above)<BR>
