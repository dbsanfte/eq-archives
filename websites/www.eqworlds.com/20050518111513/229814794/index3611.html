Loretta Lynn was born in the coal mining country of Kentucky. She was the oldest of seven kids; raised in poverty, married at 13, and a mother of 4 by the time she was 17.

There is also the story of her husband to be, Doolittle, buying a pie from her at an auction only to discover that Loretta had mistaken salt for the sugar when she baked it.

Jesse Cool has been the proprietor of her own organic restaurant for 20 years and she brings her expansive talents as an organic gourmet chef to this book.  She has created 160 recipes that utilize organic products, but her book goes beyond recipes to embrace the entire organic philosophy.  She offers readers everything they need to create their own organic kitchens at home, as well as extensive profiles of organic companies across the country.  Cool's unique philosophy is evident in every detail of the book, down to the layout.  Since Jesse feels that produce changes during each season, the book is divided into eight seasons, instead of the typical four.  Also included are recipes from her fellow organic chefs like Rick Bayless of Frontera Grill, Alice Waters of Chez Panisse and Michael Romano of Union Square Cafe.<br><a href="/eq/2116134.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>
