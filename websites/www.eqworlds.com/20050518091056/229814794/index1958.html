The Atelier-we watch from the wings, able to observe the genesis of creation in Robuchon's own kitchens. Words and images reveal the mysteries of his gastronomic workshop. A privileged view of the gestures and glances of this contemplative world is offered, as we observe one of today's most inspired culinary teachers pass on his techniques and secrets. We are invited to participate in the excitement of a master at work with five of his most inspired pupils: Dominque Bouchet, Cristophe Cussac, Philippe Groult, BenoÃ®t Guichard, and Maurice Guillouet. The Products-we are offered an understanding of eight keystone ingredients from the palette sensibilities of the master himself. JoÃ«l Robuchon explains why potatoes, caviar, scallops, cÃ¨pe mushrooms, sweetbreads, truffles, chestnuts, and almonds are his favorite products. He talks about his research and introduces us to his suppliers, whose attention to quality is second only to Robuchon's own quest for raw perfection. The Recipes-we participate in the unique synthesis of flavors, colors, and textures conceived by the master and his five protÃ©gÃ©s. Their compositions tease exploration of the eight chosen products and lead us every time toward harmonious composition.<br><a href="/eq/2117223.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>

<td align="left" valign="top"><h2>La Terra Fortunata</h2><span class="description">Friuli-Venezia Giulia was one of Italy's best-kept secretsâ€”until now. Between Venice and Vienna, with Trieste as its capital, this region has the most varied and sophisticated food in Italy. No other regional kitchen uses more fruit or spices or a greater range of meat and seafood. In La Terra Fortunata, readers will discover gnocchi filled with plums or apricots; tagliolini tossed with poppy seeds and the region's superlative prosciutto di San Daniele; sea scallops with almond sauce; risotto flavored with a rainbow of spices, including ginger, star anise, and nutmeg; cinnamon-scented veal stew, and, of course, frico, the region's signature dish, a delectable cheese crisp that is positively addictive.  Since Friuli-Venezia Giulia produces Italy's top white wines and outstanding reds, with more varieties than any other region in Italy, Fred Plotkin has included the most detailed list of the region's wines and their makers ever compiled. With more than 160 recipes and an indispensable list for wine lovers, La Terra Fortunata will come as a revelation to those who thought there was nothing new under the Italian sun.   About the Author: When the subject is Italian food and wine, Fred Plotkin is the expert other experts turn to for definitive information. A finalist for both the James Beard and Julia Child Cookbook Awards, his previous book, Recipes from Paradise: Life and Food on the Italian Riviera, placed first in The New York Times listing of the top cookbooks of 1997. Plotkin is the author of Italy for the Gourmet Traveler and five other books. He lives in New York City.<br><a href="/eq/2116010.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>

<td align="left" valign="top"><h2>Land of Plenty</h2><span class="description">The Chinese call the province of Sichuan in southwest China the                                                      land of plenty and the place for flavor.  Although it is mostly                                                       known in the West for its hot-and-spicy dishes, the Chinese love Sichuan food for its inventive use of seasonings and its many styles of preparation.  Fuchsia Dunlop immersed herself in Sichuanese cooking and culture for two years, gathering from regional chefs and home cooks a full range of recipes from soups to desserts.  She provides glossaries of Sichuan's ingredients and cooking methods, and Chinese characters for and definitions of the                                                      twenty-three flavors at the heart of the Sichuanese culinary canon.  Equally valuable for novices and experts, Land of Plenty teaches everything from how to wield a cleaver to how to make delicious Kung Pao chicken, offering a unique user-friendly introduction to one of China's richest cuisines.<br><a href="/eq/2115871.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>
