<td align="left" valign="top"><h2>A Return to Cooking</h2><span class="description">Life holds a fundamental irony for four-star chef Eric Ripert--the more successful he becomes, the further he is taken from the love that made him a success in the first place.  As his days get consumed with business decisions and staffing issues, the question arises--But when do I get to cook?  A Return to Cooking is Ripert's personal quest for the answer: a journey in four different seasons to four different locales to cook the landscape and cook from the guts, using local seasonal ingredients in home kitchens and experiencing the joys--and occasional disappointments--of this spontaneous, creative act.  From California to Puerto Rico, Vermont to Long Island, Ripert was joined by Colombian artist Valentino Cortazar and photographers Tammar and Shimon Rothstein, who captured his journey in their artistry.  Dozens of essays on subjects such as handling raw fish, the power of vinaigrette, the virtues of Tabasco, shallots, and lemon confit enhance this eminently practical book's richly flavorful recipes.<br><a href="/eq/2116722.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>

The 200 delectable recipes she offers not only taste superb but also have specific healing properties according to the accumulated wisdom of traditional Chinese medicine.   The emphasis is on what's good for you, not bad for you. It's primarily a question of balance: eating in harmony with the seasons; countering yin, or cooling, foods (spinach, tomatoes, asparagus, lettuce, seafood) with yang, or hot, foods (ginger, garlic, hot peppers, beef) and neutralizers like rice and noodles.   The wealth of information Nina Simonds offers here derives from her extensive research into he evidence amassed over three thousand years by practitioners of Chine medicine, and from her interviews with leading experts today in food as medicine, who offer first-hand testimony.<br><a href="/eq/2116284.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>

Simple as they seem, they make possible a profusion of pastries and other sweets, from the elemental lollipop to the ethereal realms where marzipan, meringue, and puff pastry hold sway.  No one appreciates this fabulous foursome better than Fran Gage, who relied on them for her daily output during the ten years she owned and ran her acclaimed San Francisco bakery, Patisserie Francaise.  Nor could anyone do a better job of ferreting out how each found its way into the kitchen and yielded up its alchemy, influenced by technological innovation, genetic manipulation, and government intervention--not to mention human error and, of course, the weather.  She tells the story of each ingredient, from its origins to its transformation into culinary gold, drawing upon her travels, tastings, experiments, and remembrances.  Each section ends on a sweet note, with a baker's half-dozen of recipes that show off the multiple talents of the ingredient.  The book concludes with a look at the meaning of desserts, from ancient times to the present day, and --the piece de resistance--ideas for a dessert buffet.<br><a href="/eq/2116664.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>

Explains how acidification of the body contributes to disorders such as chronic fatigue syndrome, eczema, and ulcers  Categorizes food according to its acidifying or alkalizing effect on the body, rather than by chemical composition Contains food tables to help readers design the best diet for their health needs  To enjoy optimum health, our body needs balanced quantities of alkaline substances and acids. An imbalance can result in health problems ranging from minor skin irritations, chronic fatigue, back pain, and depression to arthritis, ulcers, and osteoporosis.  Most people consume an abundance of highly processed foods that acidify the body and, as a result, are afflicted with many of these ailments. Naturopath and detoxification expert Christopher Vasey shows how a simple change in diet to restore your acid-alkaline balance can result in a vast improvement in health.  Vasey provides easy test methods to determine your acid levels, how to interpret these test results, and ways to establish a proper diet to maximize your health. Rather than organizing alkaline and acid foods on the basis their chemical composition, Vasey categorizes foods based on their actual alkalizing or acidifying effect on the body so that you can design a diet best suited for your particular health needs. He goes further to explain how some foods, such as fruits, can have either an alkalizing or an acidifying effect, depending on who eats them, and how to use alkaline supplements to support your dietary needs.<br><a href="/eq/2117290.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>
