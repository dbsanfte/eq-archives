	First of all... This can be extremely dangerous, many risks are at hand when traveling alone. Especially if you don’t know what’s out there awaiting you. Bring lots of food, bring about 10 muffins and 10 milk, this will last you for a few hours allowing you to travel long distances plus its only 6 cp each. And place any valuable items you may have in the bank. If you are somewhere below level 10 and have much experience, don’t be afraid to go out naked just beside the zone leading back for a quick snoop. If you are above level 11 and will lose experience quick then don’t try this. It may be too great loss for experience. 
<P>
	I like to take notes of what type of monsters are were, or just memorize in your head. This can help in the future. Keep a good distance from any new type of monster that you have not seen before, they may be aggressive and want to bite. And stay close to the zone boundary line, so you can run if in an emergency.  
<P>
	again, do not wear anything too valuable, or just go naked, if you are traveling a long ways, you may not want to go out all the way back on a 3 hour journey to get that sword you paid 500 pp for just because you died.

	A great way to travel and make friends is pressing the /who button to see if there is anyone in your zone that is the same level, also try this in the zone were your city is located, and type /tell *friends name* and what you wish to tell him/her if they would like to travel with you, hopefully they will agree to go with you. Plus it increases your strength to have a person of a different class, this way you have more options on fighting and running. 
<P>
	Anyway...If  you are in lead make sure to look back every few seconds to make sure you partner is keeping up. And when entering a new zone make sure your partner doesn’t go wondering off, you don’t want to get tangled up with anything double your size

	This is quite simple, it just requires for you to /ooc and ask for what level is best for this zone. Or if your shy or don’t want to look like a newbie what some people might think. Type the always nifty /who command. The levels of each person in that zone will appear beside each name. Look at the levels and make about an average level in your head of when its safe to enter here...nothing to it.

This is always a fun thing, nobody knows what kind of things will happen when your traveling half way around the world. Plus this all depends on what level you are. “Sense Heading” is your best friend for doing this, have this skill at level 30-40 at least before going out. 
<BR>
I urge younger levels to be extremely cautious when traveling for the first time, when anyone looks at an EQmap they then
 assume it should only take a 20min trip going east, but there is much more to consider. Hundreds of monsters are in between
 cities ranging from levels 3 to 45. A simple trip to Qeynos will require you taking many detours because around
 monster camps and so on, and the worst possible thing is to get lost or die or both.
 <P>
 I highly recommend you have lots of spare time when traveling and to get a guide for the first time and when you 
 believe you have memorized the way to your destination then you should be ok traveling. I also recommend you have
 "Camoflauge" so you will not be seen by monsters or "Bind Affinity" so you can you can set your home point near every
 zone thus if you die you will only be set back a small amount.
