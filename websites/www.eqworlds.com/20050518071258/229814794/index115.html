And her sister Libby had no idea what she was in for when she hired Bernie to work for her catering business. But in between cutting up canapes and dishing up desserts, the two find themselves in the midst of a mystery they can really sink their teeth into‚Ä¶  It‚Äôs only been a few days since Libby hired her sister Bernie to help out at A Little Taste of Heaven, and already they‚Äôve got their hands full‚Äîbaking cookies and slicing rare beef tenderloin to serve at a high school reunion. The dinner has a ‚ÄúDracula‚Äù theme and a very strange guest of honor: Laird Wrenn, a New York Times bestselling author of vampire novels. From the minute he sweeps into the school cafeteria‚Äîdecked out in a cape, accompanied by some truly odd hangers-on‚ÄîLibby and Bernie know this will be an evening unlike any other. And they‚Äôre right. During his after dinner speech, Lionel pours a glass of water, takes a long sip‚Äîand drops stone-cold dead‚Ä¶  Talk about a recipe for disaster. Especially since the police are still combing through the dinner leftovers for clues‚Äîand have made it perfectly clear that they consider Libby a suspect. True, Libby had an argument with Lionel the day of his murder. But there are plenty of other people‚ÄîLionel‚Äôs recently spurned girlfriend and his chatty publicity agent among them‚Äîwho make much more plausible murderers. Now Libby and Bernie will have to put their heads together to figure out whodunit‚Äîin a mystery that promises to be deadly to the very last bite‚Ä¶  Includes 7 Delectable Recipes for You to Try!  Isis Crawford was born in Egypt to parents who were in the diplomatic corps. When she was five, her family returned to the States, where her mother opened a restaurant in upper Westchester and her father became a university professor. Since then, Isis has combined her parents' love of food and travel by running a catering service as well as penning numerous travel-related articles about places ranging from Omsk to Paraguay. Married, with twin boys, she presently resides in Hastings-On-Hudson, where she is working on the next Bernie and Libby culinary mystery.<br><a href="/eq/2116442.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>

<td align="left" valign="top"><h2>A Drizzle of Honey</h2><span class="description">When tens of thousands of Iberian Jews were converted to Catholicism under duress during the Inquisition, many rapidly assimilated to their new religious culture. Others, the crypto-Jews, struggled to retain their Jewish identity in private while projecting Christian conformity in the public sphere. In order to root out these heretics, the courts of the Inquisition published checklists of Jewish household habits and koshering practices and grilled the servants, neighbors, and even the children of those suspected of practicing their religion at home.  From these testimonies and other primary sources, Gitlitz and Davidson have drawn a fascinating picture of the secret culinary life of the crypto-Jews and the customs and foods that threatened their existence while securing their precarious sense of identity. From nearly a hundred specific references to Sephardic cuisine, the authors have recreated these recipes. They combine Christian and Islamic traditions in cooking lamb, beef, fish, eggplants, chickpeas, and greens and use seasonings such as saffron, mace, ginger, and cinnamon. These recipes, with accompanying text that tells the stories of their creators, promise to delight the adventurous palate and give insights into the foundations of modern Sephardic cuisine.<br><a href="/eq/2117056.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>

<td align="left" valign="top"><h2>A Lady at the Table</h2><span class="description">A user-friendly book that allows any woman to dine with confidence at any table.  A Lady at the Table will give any woman the knowledge she needs to maneuver any dining situation ‚Äì from a casual meal of fried chicken at her mom‚Äôs house to a seven-course dinner at the finest restaurant in the world. It includes...  How to set a table How to pronounce more than 100 different food names How to use obscure eating utensils How to perform the Heimlich maneuver How to eat more than 25 foods that are challenging to eat gracefully such as lobster, snails, fried chicken, and pasta.  In a society where more and more people eat with plastic forks and spoons at fast food restaurants, it is still important that a lady know proper dining etiquette. Showing she has little working knowledge of table manners at a lunch meeting or on a job interview over dinner may have an important impact on a woman‚Äôs life.  Like all the books in the GentleManners series, A Lady at the Table is easy to use, non-threatening, and an entertaining read. In addition to containing similar information as A Gentleman at the Table, A Lady at the Table deals with topics that apply uniquely to women such as how to respond when men rise as you leave or approach the table, how to react when a chair is pulled out for you and when it isn‚Äôt, what to do when a man orders for you, and how to pay the check graciously when you are hosting a man.<br><a href="/eq/2117504.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>
