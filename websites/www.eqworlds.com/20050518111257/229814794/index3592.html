<td align="left" valign="top"><h2>Workin'</h2><span class="description">In 1956, Miles Davisâ€™s legendary quintet went into the studio for a series of marathon recording sessions. The resulting albums, including Workinâ€™ with the Miles Davis Quintet, are among the most influential in the jazz canon. Just over 30 years later, chef Charlie Trotter began staging his own nightly sessions, bringing the art of improvisation into the kitchen of his Chicago restaurant.  Trotter continues to take inspiration from the jazz greats, using his mastery of tastes and textures to fashion brilliant, daring culinary compositions out of an ensemble of the finest ingredients.  Trotterâ€™s award-winning PBS cooking show, The Kitchen Sessions, first presented the chefâ€™s artistry to home cooks around the country, and now heâ€™s back with a new 26-part series. In the companion volume, Trotter presents more than 80 recipes, arranged by ingredient themes that are fundamental to his cooking. Trotter sounds off the bass notes of root vegetables and squash in such dishes as Salsify Wrapped with Serrano Ham and Phyllo with Pears and Roasted Endive, and Zucchini and Duck Confit Gratin with Hazelnut Vinaigrette.  He celebrates the summer bounty of corn and tomatoes through Halibut with Red Wineâ€“Corn Sauce and Grits, and Tomato Tarts with White Anchovies and Caper Vinaigrette. For the last course, Trotter puts the spotlight on cheese desserts such as Honey Mascarpone Cannoli with Pine Nuts and Mint, and then presents a generous selection of chocolate- and fruit-based desserts.  Workin' captures one of the world's most innovative chefs at the top of his form. Never have the results been more beautiful to behold and accessible to the avid home cook.<br><a href="/eq/2117186.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>

<td align="left" valign="top"><h2>World Encyclopedia of Champagne and Sparkling Wine</h2><span class="description">The first in-depth guide to sparkling wines of the world from Champagne to California, Italy to Australia and beyond.  A fascinating first section describes the history of sparkling wine and proves beyond any doubt that it was the English rather than the French who first produced a fizzy wine. The main body of the encyclopedia is devoted to profiles of the worldâ€™s sparkling wine producers accompanied by tasting notes, recommendations for drinking and good value for your money. Another section lists the authorâ€™s personal selection of sparkling wines to drink for the Millennium.  Beautifully illustrated and designed with over 600 full color photographs and illustrations, this is the ultimate book for those who love the good things in life and who want to discover the best ways to welcome in the new year.  Tom Stevenson is the worldâ€™s leading authority on Champagne. He is the author of 14 books and winner of 21 literary awards, including 13 for his works on Champagne. He has been voted Wine Writer of the Year three times!<br><a href="/eq/2116612.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>

Fisher, but even so, relatively little is known of the complex woman whose books and essays have so transformed the lives of generations of women.  This authorized biography recounts her journey from a privileged childhood to the gritty world of the theater, her internment in fascist Italy with her married lover on charges of espionage, and her subsequent flight to Egypt for the last four years of World War II, where her contemporaries included Lawrence Durrell and Olivia Manning.  The fascinating story of a woman whose life was as spicy and flavorful as her cooking, Writing at the Kitchen Table offers the most complete account available of this culinary legend.

Cooking with seasonal produce, says Bishop, is the best way to bring a welcome variety to dinners. In A Year in a Vegetarian Kitchen, Bishop guides cooks through the seasons with 248 simple recipes that draw from many traditions. For spring, thereâ€™s Garlicky Greens in Soft Corn Tacos; for summer, Penne with Pan-Roasted Garlic, SautÃ©ed Cherry Tomatoes, and Basil; and for fall, Pizza with Caramelized Onions and Thyme. In winter, when farmersâ€™ markets are a distant memory in most parts of the country, dinners include Pan-Glazed Tofu with Thai Red Curry Sauce and Grilled Cheese Sandwiches with Mushrooms.  In concise sidebars that accompany each recipe, Bishop gives readers the benefit of his ten years of experience at Cookâ€™s Illustrated, covering everything from choosing winter squash, preparing fennel, and making perfect fried rice to buying the best grater.<br><a href="/eq/2116472.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>

You Really Haven't Been There Until You've Eaten the Food is a spirited account of his journeys to an international array of markets and fishing piers, restaurants and home kitchens.  He visits the niftiest dive in Key West, tours the largest outdoor market in Mexico, scours for food while on safari in Africa, and interviews chefs both famous and unsung.  Illustrated with nearly 70 glorious photographs and featuring 100 recipes and a host of hilarious anecdotes (including a report on his notorious stint on CBS's Survivor II), this book demonstrates Famie's belief that food is not only the quickest way to learn about the place, it's the only way to get a true feel for a community's sensory history.<br><a href="/eq/2116545.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>
