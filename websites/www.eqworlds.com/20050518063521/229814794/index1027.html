<td align="left" valign="top"><h2>Culinaria: Italy</h2><span class="description">The land where the lemon trees bloom has always been a fascinating destination for travelers, long before Goethe so described it.  The rich culture and varied countryside of Italy has attracted and inspired artists and writers through the ages. From the era of the classical grand tour, when educational visits were made to sites of antiquity on the Apennine peninsula, ever-increasing numbers of tourists have fallen in love with this country. The  ars vivendi , or style of living, of its vivacious inhabitants has undoubtedly left just as lasting an impression as the treasures of its cultural heritage. For countless visitors the simple and yet imaginative cuisine of Italy has now come to symbolize that very Italian love of life.  We invite you to accompany us on a culinary  giro d?Italia , a tour of Italy that begins in the north-east, leads through the Alpine regions to Liguria in the west, then turns south, through Emilia-Romagna and Tuscany, crossing from Calabria to Sicily, and finally ending on the island of Sardinia.  In Friuli-Venezia Giulia, we sample ham from San Daniele and admire the largest  frico  in the world.  In Venice and the Veneto, we are invited to drink a glass of  prosecco , while in Trentino-Alto Adige we treat ourselves with a snack of home-cured bacon and the local bread specialty. Lombardy tempts us with Milanese salami and  pannettone . In Piedmont we get to know the art of making risotto, and in Val d?Aosta we find out about a local hard bread specialty and a reviving herb liqueur. Liguria presents us with  pesto  and finest olive oil, while Emilia-Romagna provides the products that are emblematic of Italy - Parma ham, Parmesan, and  mortadella . In Tuscany we sample fine wine, in Umbria we go fishing on Lake Trasimeno, and in Marche we stroll along the culinary trail laid by the composer, Rossini. In Lazio, which includes the capital city of Rome, we track down papal cuisine and savor classic pasta dishes. In Abruzzi and Molise, brightly-colored confectionery awaits us, in Campania snow-white mozzarella cheese, in Apulia blond wheat, and in Basilicata brilliant red chili peppers. After a robust breakfast in Calabria, we admire deceptively real-looking marzipan fruits in Sicily and catch langoustines off the Sardinian coast.  How does the blue mold get into Gorgonzola? Where did ice cream come from, in the days before refrigerators?  What is there to tell about the wines of Piedmont? How are tomato preserves made? How does one recognize a genuine balsamic vinegar? What are the marks of quality that help to distinguish genuine products from imitations? What food was eaten in ancient Rome, which specialties were served at court during the Middle Ages, and what culinary innovations accompanied the Renaissance?  Culinaria Italy  takes a look behind the scenes and answers these and many other questions of interest to lovers of Italian cuisine.  With 496 pages and 1294 color photographs,  Culinaria Italy  shows us not only the<br><a href="/eq/2117263.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>

In her new ground-breaking diet, Cross offers advice on using some of the same ideas that make the high-protein diets successful, but modifying them to work in the real world. The result is a book that combines recipes-low levels of complex carbohydrates, lots of protein, and some vegetables and fruit-with lifestyle guidelines, including information on exercise and vitamin supplements.  It's designed to help readers lose weight for good by breaking the process down into three parts. The first, the Fast-Track Plan, gets the process started with fast weight loss. The second, the Keep on Tracking Plan is designed to keep the pounds melting away until goal weight is achieved. Last, the No Backtracking Plan helps readers keep the weight off. Charts and tables make meal planning easier, and there are craving busters and snack allowances in addition to a wide variety of meal choices.

Dairy has been linked to a host of health problems, including IBS, PMT, eczema and other skin conditions, rhinitis (nasal drip), asthma, osteoporosis and depression.

<span class="description">For cutting meats and other foods in single, even slices for pretty presentations at the table, this knife is key. Each DBK knife is forged from high-carbon stainless steel, undergoing heat treating to allow the blade to resist distortion and hold an edge better. It's ice-hardened to toughen the blade and ensure flexibility, then the full tang is riveted to the molded, ergonomic handle, producing a professional quality knife that home chefs will treasure. Daniel Boulud, award-winning chef and author, recently launched DBK, a line of professional quality kitchenware tools that evolved from his 30 years of experience and careful testing done in his own kitchen. He is formerly the executive chef of Le Cirque in New York, and currently owns several restaurants under his own name. Boulud also writes a food column for Elle Decor, has his own line of gourmet foods and is often featured as a guest on the Food Network and other popular interview programs.<br><a href="/eq/21869.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>
