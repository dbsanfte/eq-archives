  <LI>An RPG designed from the ground up to be a massively online game. The world of EverQuest was created to support over 1,000 players simultaneously per server.
  <LI>Choose from 12 races and 14 classes, including dwarves, ogres, trolls, rangers, wizards, and rogues.
  <LI>Over 40 unique skills and innate abilities.
  <LI>Thousands of items to earn and collect, both magical and mundane, including artifacts of great power.
  <LI>Three enormous continents to explore, as well as other dimensions and planes.
  <LI>Adventuring alone is supported, and forming parties to complete quests encouraged
  <LI>Each class and race has strengths and weaknesses, and the stronger groups will be those who balance their parties and work as a team.
  <LI>Hundreds of spells to learn, with five separate magic-using classes. Also, weapons can be enchanted to cast spells themselves.
  <LI>Player killing (Pkilling) is controlled such that those who wish to engage in it may do so, however those who do not are completely immune.
  <LI>Real 3D environment, with multiple camera views. Switch from exploring in first person to any number of top down views to facilitate tactical combat.
  <LI>Beautiful SVGA (640x480) 16 bit color scenery, with adventure zones including indoor dungeons, arctic tundra, vast deserts, and even completely underwater environments.
  <LI>Truly polygonal characters, both players and NPC’s – no sprites here.
