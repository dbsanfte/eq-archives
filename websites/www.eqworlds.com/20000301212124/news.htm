I think this is a major problem.  This is unacceptable and and will not be tolerated.  This is the last straw if this GM is not punished publicly.  This game is great but we expect a personal touch in our interactions with GMs.  Below was copied from www.everlore.com.

    [2/13/2000 1:56:39 PM PST] 
    Received from Veny Tier'Gristal: 
    
    In the early hours of February the 12th, my group experienced perhaps the most disgusting and distasteful use of GM power I have ever witnessed. We were insulted and belittled by the very people that are supposed to be dedicated to helping us. As the Brotherhood of Norrath guild started their invasion into Kedge Keep, our group (consisting of myself - Veny Tier'Gristal, my husband - Apenance Tier'Gristal, and two of our good friends - Serieux and Wolfen) had been fighting and maintaining the spawn on the second level for over two hours. As BoN got closer to defeating Phingel, they realized and petitioned that there were some spawns that were stuck in the depths of Kedge. GM Lokkison, Tarskok, and Nabben came to analyze the area. When they came to a conclusion to re-pop the entire zone, neither the GM's nor BoN had taken in to consideration how this might affect the people who had been fighting there all night.
    <P>
    As we all know, a zone or server re-pop can be very devastating. Anyone fighting high level mobs has to struggle to work their way into the dungeon and secure a spot to pull to. As well as spread out the spawns so one can safely pull to their party. This can take hours. This is what our group would now have to attempt again if the whole zone was to re-spawn. As you might expect, we contested the zone re-pop. Yet we did so in a rational way despite our anger for being overlooked. We requested that, since Lokkison had fixed BoN's problem by creating one for us, perhaps he could TP us out of the zone for re-pop and help us break the spawn once again so we could continue to play. According to GM Lokkison, we were "clearly ignorant as to what was going on in the zone" and needed to keep our "uninformed opinions to ourselves". Apparently this type of request is unacceptable, and he "does not take crap from whiney little players like you who are selfish and ignorant and cry when !
they don't get their way." Yes, that was a direct quote from a GM on Xegony. GM Lokkison resorting to immature name calling of the players he has vowed to assist.
    <P>
    After being verbally abused, we made sure to log, report, and take screenshots of the incident, which we considered unfit GM conduct. We also stated to Lokkison that we would be doing so. At this point, for no apparent reason other than to perhaps show his 'power' over us, he told Apenance to "take a break, fool" and disconnected him from the server. "Anyone else wanted to play?" he sarcastically asks.
    <P>
    Shortly after Apenance returned to the server, we were summoned into a 'safe room', in which we could not move or access any of our belongings. In addition to this, Apenance was 'silenced' the entire time. Lokkison took this time to explain to us that he doesn't have to explain his actions to anyone and that we were "wasting his very valuable time" because he had to "explain this to a group of immature individuals". He told us that we, the players of Everquest who put in over 200 hours a month of time into exploring dungeons, slaying beasts, and tactically maneuvering to a camp, "have no idea how this game works and why {a GM} would need to do something." We were eventually dropped back into Dragnor's Cauldron and forced to leave Kedge Keep for the night. This entire event was completely unacceptable. After any comment we are either ridiculed or disconnected from the server. I fail to see any of the justice, which GM's are supposed to provide, in Lokkison's tactic. I think!
 all players on Xegony as well as other servers should be aware of the GM's that watch over them. I consider GM Lokkison to be unjust, short tempered, and certainly not fit to be a GM in Everquest. I also would like to see appropriate action taken against Lokkison for his actions against us. I will not tolerate paying to play a game to be harassed by the staff.
    <P>

I have posted Apenance's log from that night as well as added personal tells and such from the other players involved.
