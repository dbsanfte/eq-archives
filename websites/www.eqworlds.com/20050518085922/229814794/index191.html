<span class="description">Ask any professional chef about which cookware to choose and he or she will quickly sing the praises of All-Clad. For years, All-Clad has been the choice in 4-Star kitchens all over the world. And it's no wonder, given the cookware's triple-ply construction, impeccable balance and meticulous hand-finishing. From their Cop-R-Chef Collection, this 3-Qt. Saucier Pan features an extra-thick copper exterior, an inner core of pure aluminum on the bottom and sides, and a hand-polished 18/10 stainless steel interior that never reacts with food -- all bonded together to distribute heat evenly. Use the saucier for evenly heating and cooking sauces, melting butter or chocolate or reheating foods. The sloped sides are designed so ingredients properly reduce, resulting in flavorful blends. The pan features a long, stay-cool stainless steel handle. Maintains its appearance best when hand-washed.<br><a href="/eq/21272.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>
