<td align="left" valign="top"><h2>Napa Valley: The Land, the Wine, the People</h2><span class="description">When National Geographic sent Charles Oâ€™Rear to photograph a little-known region of Napa Valley for a book about rural America, he was immediately enthralled by the areaâ€™s natural beauty and vibrant tradition of winemaking. He soon made the valley his home and in the twenty-three years since, he has watched it grow from an obscure, secluded hollow in the California landscape to an internationally recognized food and wine destination. Oâ€™Rear has accumulated thousands of photographs of his idyllic environs, the best of which are brought together in this awe-inspiring volume. Each photo exhibits an artistry and grandeur imbued with the familiarity and immediacy that can only be gleaned by a Napa Valley local.  From the people who grow the grapes and create the wines to the variety of winery architecture and unrivaled vistas that distinguish the land, Napa Valley offers a personal and stunning look at the places, people, and events that have shaped this now-famous region. Without a doubt, Oâ€™Rearâ€™s collection is the most original and comprehensive treasury ever assembled on Napa Valley.<br><a href="/eq/2115961.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>
