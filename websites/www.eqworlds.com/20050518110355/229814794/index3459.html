Addressing many of these queries, discussing more great finds, and widening the scope of previous topics, this revised edition is better than ever.  Instead of simply updating the vintages in the previous edition, Gaiter and Brecher have scoured the wineshops for dozens of additional selections, covering rose champagnes, for example, and extending the Savignon Blanc discussion to New Zealand. As for the practical advice that has endeared the couple to so many fans, the authors explore entirely new roads with chapters such as Wine and Business, How to Impress the Boss, When Wine is a Pain, The Headache Issue, and Don't Be Embarrassed About the Blue Nun in Your Past, as well as new passages on everything from cork etiquette to great Kosher wines.<br><a href="/eq/2116635.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>

<span class="description">With a meat grinder in your kitchen, you can now be in charge of just how lean you want your meat to be before serving it to family and guests. Since store-bought ground beef, turkey or pork can sometimes fattier and less healthy for you, it's best if you control what goes in your hamburgers or meat loaves. This grinder from Waring is professional in design, made of brushed stainless steel with a die-cast metal hopper. It has a powerful, 150-watt motor with three cutting plates (Fine, Medium or Coarse) and includes two attachments for making your own breakfast sausage. A single On/Off switch makes operating it simple; a Reverse function repositions ingredients that might become trapped while grinding.<br><a href="/eq/21691.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>
