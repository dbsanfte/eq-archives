Welcome to the world of EverQuest®, a real 3-D massively multi-player fantasy role-playing game. Prepare to enter an enormous virtual environment – an entire world with its own diverse species, economic systems, alliances, and politics. Choose from a variety of races and classes, and begin your quest in any number of cities or villages throughout several continents. From there, equip yourself for adventure, seek allies and knowledge, and head out into a rich world of dungeons, towers, crypts, evil abbeys -- anything conceivable -- even planes and realities beyond your imagination. Learn skills, earn experience, acquire treasure and equipment, meet friends and encounter enemies. A multitude of quests and adventures await, but you choose your role, you define your destiny. But whether you make yourself a noble human knight, a vicious dark elf thief, a greedy dwarven merchant, or whatever suits your desire, remember one thing:
