/t [characters name] [text]: will go out to the character you specify no matter where in Norrath they are. <BR>

/ooc [text]: will post your message to everyone in the zone as 'out of character'<BR> 
/shout [text]: will post your message to everyone in the zone in a nice red color. [I don't recommend this one since is the same as /ooc as for it's function and harder on the eye] <BR>
/auction [text]: will post your message to everyone in the zone and is used if you would like to sell a item or ask to purchase one. <BR>
/petition [text]: will petition a GM. Reasons for doing this would include character getting stuck somewhere, to ask if they are aware of a bug or problem the game is experiencing, etc. <BR>
/feedback: will pull up a box to fill out information in. You would use this if you would like to offer game suggestions. <BR>
/bug: will pull up a box to fill out information in. Use this if you are going to report a exploit/bug in the game. <BR></Font>
