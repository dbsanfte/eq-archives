<P> Entering a zone for the first time </B><BR>
Its Important to be extra careful and paranoid to, you never know what kind of danger you get yourself involved in. When entering a new zone for the first time, try hitting / and then enter, you will get info on all the people in the zone. Try looking at each players current level, it should give you an idea of what level you should be to be in this zone. 
<p>
Try not to get to far from to zone line just incase you need to flee from an opponent. Or stay near guard towers or a merchant that you are positive will attack on coming monster (some merchants stand there and watch you die). In most cases merchants are stronger then guards. And one more important thing is to ALWAYS consider before attacking, you’ll never know when your attacking a low or level monster. Monsters have levels to.

<B> Why don't you stop and ask for directions?</B><BR>
If your going to a specific spot but its your first time traveling there, then don’t e afraid to ask for directions from someone you may meet with. If your desperate try typing /shout for help or someone to guide you there. Traveling alone or adventuring in this case is a bad idea it can lead to dangerous situations. You will go slower but what I like to think of is "Slowly but Surely" Your moving slow but you have a 100% chance of getting there.

<B>Teaming up </B><BR>
If your planning to leave somewhere in far distance but is in interest of many people, go to the city you are closest to, and /shout or /ooc and ask if anyone wants to travel with you. Getting about 6 people is great, for traveling yet still some risks involved such as running into a hill giant, Cyclops or griffin. Or losing somebody. Anyway... <BR>
When trying to get a group together its wise to have many different class's involved, especially a high level shaman. Shamans are usually as tough as warriors and have great magic. And the best and most famous for traveling SOW (spirit of wolf) this will make you run about 2 times faster then your regular running speed. This could save you lots of time in traveling. They also carry much defensive magic. Warriors are also useful, since most monster love to go after magic users, letting the warriors attack it first will reduce the risk and if someone is healing this can make a team fairly strong.
