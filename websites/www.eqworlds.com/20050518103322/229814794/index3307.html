<span class="description">The Swiss have a favorite dish that incorporates melted cheese over boiled potatoes, served with gherkins. It's called "raclette" and was named after the French word "racler" which means "to scrape", a process by which melted cheese is scraped off the block or stone when it was made years ago. This handy grill set lets you enjoy various versions of raclette paired with grilled favorites such as steak, seafood and poultry. The grill plus the eight cooking pans below are all nonstick so there's actually no "scraping" at all! The unit also includes eight heat-resistant spatulas for serving from the dishes. A powerful 1200 watts, it also has a variable thermostat control so you can control how hot you want to grill. It's a great way to prepare an entire meal all in one place!<br><a href="/eq/21892.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>

The double-decker design features a top level that holds a natural cooking stone (hence the Rock name), which heats evenly for searing food. The other half is a removable, nonstick grill that can be used for steaks, seafood, vegetables and more. On the lower portion are eight nonstick cooking pans with insulated handles, used for raclette or other cheese-covered favorites. It also comes with eight heat-resistant spatulas for serving. Variable thermostat control and indicator lights are additional features. Prepare an entire meal or a variety of savory appetizers on one unit - a great set for family-style meals or for entertaining.<br><a href="/eq/21891.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>

<td align="left" valign="top"><h2>True Thai</h2><span class="description">True Thai is one of those rare and important cookbooks where cuisine and culture meet. Food lovers will come away with layers of understanding, discovering the soul of a country where cuisine is a sacred art.  True Thai takes us from the jostling Bangkok streets and canals to countryside rice paddles and mango groves, from distant mountain villages to Thailand's stately Royal Palace, delivering True Thai taste in every sense of the word.  Victor Sodsook, a native Thai, chef/owner of Los Angeles's celebrated Siamese Princess restaurant, has written the authoritative Thai cookbook that American cooks have been waiting for. True Thai satisfies an increasing public interest in the seductive flavors of Thai cuisine, and a decreasing emphasis on high-fat, high-calorie red meats, eggs, and oils. The lively, easy-to-follow recipes are tailor-made for today's adventurous, aware cook.  Most of the tools and ingredients used in True Thai are probably already in your kitchen. And its wide-ranging glossary of ingredients will help you select the most flavorful spices and freshest produce, as well as the best brands of key Thai ingredients like coconut milk and fish sauce. Among True Thai's 250 recipes, you'll find the many Thai dishes that have already won over Americans, such as Crispy Sweet Rice Noodles (mee krob) and soothing, aromatic Chicken-Coconut Soup with Siamese Ginger and Lemon Grass (tom kha kai). Everything is here, from the deliciously spiced barbecued chickens found in Thai provinces to the elaborate and time honored cuisines served to Thailand's royal family, such as King Rama V's Fried Rice. Since Thailand teems with both fresh- and saltwater fish and shellfish, you'll find an abundance of healthful, provocative seafood dishes, such as Ayuthaya Haw Mok Talay, a scrumptious mousse of curried fish, shrimp, and crab, redolent with chili and coconut milk, grilled and served in fragrant banana leaves.  Surprisingly light preparations for meat include Fiery Grilled Beef Salad, a classic of Bangkok cafe cuisine, and mu kratiem phrik Thai, a simple stir-fry of pork medallions sizzling with garlic and black pepper. The Thai Vegetarian Cooking chapter is really a whole book unto itself, encompassing its own blend of curry pastes, soups, appetizers, entrees, and one-dish meals-all completely free of animal or fish products. The Thai Salads chapter showcases such recipes as Coconut, Lemon, and Ginger Salad or Grilled Lobster Salad with Green Mango that demonstrate the great variety and sensuousness of this branch of Thai cooking. Drinks and desserts include such ethereal treats as Rose-Petal Sorbet and the refreshingly herbaceous Lemon Grass Tea, wonderful either hot or cold. There's also a chapter that shows how to marry these newfound Thai tastes with classic American cooking, through such improvisations as Bangkok Burgers with Marinated, Grilled Onions and Spicy Thai Ketchup.  True Thai is more than a cookbook; it is a collection of grace notes exempl<br><a href="/eq/2117019.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>

For the festivities that follow, they make the tradition come alive, with details on everything from a simple do-it-yourself Garden of Eden party to a dinner-dance inspired by Exodus.
