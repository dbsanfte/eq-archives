<B>Strength:</B><BR>
This is the physical power of the character. It determines how much the character can carry without being encumbered and is figured into the character's ability to do damage to an opponent in melee. 
<P>
<B>Stamina:</B><BR>
This is your health and constitution. It reflects your ability to perform strenuous tasks without becoming exhausted. It is also used in calculating your hit points. 
<P>
<B>Agility</B><BR>

This is your physical dexterity and is used to determine your defensive abilities. The higher your Agility, the less likely you are to be hit by melee combat. 
<P>
<B>Dexterity:</B><BR>
This is your hand/eye coordination and is used in combat accuracy and spell casting capability. This is used in calculating your missile combat skills and aids in determining if you are interrupted when you are hit while casting a spell. 
<P>
<B>Wisdom:</B><BR>

This stat is really only important to caster classes. It determines your starting mana and partially affects how much mana you gain /lvl. Magic resistance is also slightly impacted by this stat.<P>
<B>Intelligence:</B><BR>

This is the stat that determines how fast you gain your skills. If you have a very high intelligence your skills go up fast.<P>
<B>Charisma:</B><BR>

This is the stat that directly determines the prices of things in Everquest. Thus the higher your charisma the cheaper things will be. Although things are naturally going to be cheaper in your starting city, and if your in a place that generally dislikes your race things are going to be expensive no matter what. Your charisma will also have a small impact on which npcs will like you, but wont make a signifigant difference. <P>
