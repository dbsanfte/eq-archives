<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">What a crazy week this was...Have you
ever been in a group that went to RunnyEye Citadel for a LOOT
run and wound up fighting EEs in the Gorge? It was a fun experience.
From a personal perspective, it was my first real raid since I
grew too old for Befallen.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">We first gathered at the zone entrance
and then made our way down to the guard room out side the Kings
throne room. My pet was pacing so badly just drooling for a KILL.
We start out by clearing the guards and our Druid starts pulling
the inner guards out of the throne room. All of a sudden these
two skellie walk right past us and into the throne room. What
the hell was that we thought. Out they come followed closely by
the Goblin King himself! It turned out a Shadow Knight was invis
at the Kings door and KILLed the Goblin king while we cleared
the guards. ack! Not cool! Not only that, but Borxx spawned on
top of us and wiped us up like a mother cleaning up her babys'
bottom. KILL! DESTROY! LOOT! RUN! ZONE!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">The moral of the story is: If you can't
stand the Shadow Knight go KILL the EE's in the Gorge!.....ack!</FONT></P>

have you finally gotten that last word, rune or page and settle
down to make your next level spell and, *POOF* </FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff">'You
lack the skills to fashion the items together'</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">To solve this problem, I would suggest
you create practice runes to get your skill up in your skill of
research. I have a new page on how to start your practice sessions,

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">As mentioned in an earlier rumor, there
will indeed be two new servers in the near future.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Tholuxe Paells will be a server for new
characters only (no moves) and will be brought up following the
patch this Wednesday, September 27th.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Drinal will be a split server, initially
accepting characters from Mithaniel Marr and Tunare.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">One final note (from the latest patch):
There is a potential problem with the /movelog command when issued
by hundreds of people at one time. The Everquest Team highly recommends
that you wait at least 15 minutes after registration opens prior
to using the command. If you have any concerns that your command
may not have gone through, you can zone and repeat the command
if you wish.</FONT></P>

your loot from one char to another in an empty zone and find out
that someone came into the zone while you were linkdead and took
your bags? Fortunatly the loot was only 6 empty backpacks with
only 3 pieces of banded in them..... Massive stupidity on my part.

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">We (Jezibel) have come to the conclusion
that the first HELL level is 16.... . I dont think I have ever
been stuck at any level for so long a period of time. Even my
Shaman, Gaspar, at level 16 took a while too! Are there any other
observations to this obsenity?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Enough ranting, lets get on with a rumor
I just started. There are going to be 2 more servers added to
EverQuest one will be a new server and the other will be a split
server of the Innoruk server. The new servers will be going online
about the same time as the </FONT><A HREF="http://www.everquest.com/">EverQuest:

are your thoughts on that and will you move if you have charactors
on the Innoruk server.</FONT></P>
