<td align="left" valign="top"><h2>Gunflint Lodge</h2><span class="description">From the publisher, University of Minnesota:  Tantalizing cuisine from the renowned restaurant. The Gunflint Lodge is Minnesota's premier resort because of its pristine wilderness location, warm hospitality, and access to some of the finest fishing in the world. Visitors come from across the country not just for the outdoor activities, but for the food served in its rustic lodge.  Whether it's Opening Day Walleye Fillets with Morel Mushroom Cream Sauce, or Roast Breast of Chicken Pistache with Blackberry Sauce, the Gunflint's elegant menu, featured recently in Bon AppÃ©tit, Men's Journal, and Midwest Living, has won acclaim for inventiveness and sense of northwoods style.  The Gunflint Lodge Cookbook is a reader's cookbook, organized by season with introductory essays by chef Ron Berg. Berg delights in adding fresh Minnesota ingredients to his Gunflint Blueberry Pie and his Wild Rice and Smoked Chicken Soup. There is an extensive section on fish cookery, including tips on frying, sautÃ©ing, and grilling, and recipes for a selection of breads, batters, and sauces for fish.  The Gunflint Lodge Cookbook is more than just recipes, however. Resort owner Sue Kerfoot writes about life at the lodge, feeding hungry visitors, and running a gourmet kitchen far from civilization. Justine Kerfoot1s (Woman of the Boundary Waters) introduction looks at lodge history stretching back to 1927, including filling the icehouse, securing ingredients, and pinch-hitting when the chef quits mid-season.  The Gunflint Lodge Cookbook will delight readers with tasty offerings and favorite anecdotes of life on the Gunflint Trail.  Ron Berg is the chef at the Gunflint Lodge north of Grand Marais, Minnesota. He taught English to junior high students for twenty-three years and worked as a fishing guide before becoming chef at the lodge in 1990. Sue Kerfoot runs the Gunflint Lodge restaurant, a skill she developed in twenty-eight years of on-the-job training that included every cooking position in the kitchen. She provides the hospitality that complements the lodge's menu.<br><a href="/eq/2117376.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>
