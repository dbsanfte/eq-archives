<td align="left" valign="top"><h2>Authentic Mexican</h2><span class="description">Americans have at last discovered Mexico's passion for exciting food. We've fallen in love with the great Mexican combination of rich, earthy flavors and casual, festive dining. But we don't begin to imagine how sumptuous and varied the cooking of Mexico really is.  After ten years of loving exploration, Rick Bayless, together with his wife, Deann, gives us Authentic Mexican, the only complete and easy-to-use compendium of our southern neighbor's cooking.  This all-embracing cookbook offers the full range of dishes, from poultry meat, fish, rice, beans, and vegetables to eggs, snacks made of corn masa, tacos, turnovers, enchiladas and their relatives, tamales, and moles, ending with desserts, sweets, and beverages. There are irresistible finger foods such as Yucatecan marinated shrimp tacos and crispy cheese-filled masa turnovers; spicy corn chowder and chorizo sausage with melted cheese will start off a special dinner; you will find mole poblano, charcoal-grilled pork in red-chile adobo, and marinated fish steamed in banana leaves for those times when you want to celebrate; and exotic ice creams, caramel custards, and pies top off any meal. There's even a section devoted to refreshing coolers, rich chocolate drinks, and a variety of tequila-laced cocktails.  The master recipes feature all the pointers you'll need for re-creating genuine Mexican textures and flavors in a North American kitchen. Menu suggestions and timing and advance-preparation tips make these dishes perfectly convenient for today's working families. And traditional and contemporary variations accompany each recipe, allowing the cook to substitute and be creative.  Rick and Deann Bayless traveled over thirty-five thousand miles investigating the six distinct regions of Mexico and learning to prepare what they found. From town to town, recipe by recipe, they personally introduce you to Mexico's cooks, their kitchens, their markets, and their feasts.  More than one hundred illustrations carefully detail special cooking techniques as well as bring Mexico and its food to life. An introductory chapter shares Mexican culinary history and modern regional tastes and customs. And an illustrated glossary contains all that hard-to-find information about locating and working with authentic Mexican ingredients and cooking equipment.  If, like the rest of us, you have a growing love for Mexican food, the reliable recipes in this book and the caring, personal presentation by Rick and Deann Bayless will provide meal after meal of pure pleasure for your family and friends.<br><a href="/eq/2116975.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>

<td align="left" valign="top"><h2>Automatic Y'all</h2><span class="description">Raised in Athens, Georgia and Baltimore, Dexter Weaver took his illustrious name?Weaver D?when his teacher asked for his last name first, first name last. The quintessential teacher's pet, his family was poor but full of love and his first memories were of food and cooking, which he loves to this day. Always watching, listening, and learning. He learned about the heartbreak of otherwise good men who lost everything gambling and had to face their families; saw his neighborhood burn during the ?60s race riots as soul music pumped from nearby juke joints. He instinctively became an entrepreneur (first selling seeds and lightbulbs, then giving 35 cent shoe shines). He also discovered the power of positive thinking (There's no room for 'can't' in this world and Always be the victor, not the victim, he says). Foremost, however, he learned the power of music from gospel deejays, disco divas, and southern indie rock bands.  Automatic for the People joins Come Out of that Coma as Weaver D's signature phrases known around the world, not only inspiring hometown, indie rock legends R.E.M., but also with computer advertising campaigns, on bagged peanuts, and preached from revival tent pulpits. The wisdom of Weaver D is a medley of inspirational lyrics with the power to keep you going: How I got over: some times up, sometimes down; It's my turn to reach and touch the sky . . . no one's going to say I didn't try; I'm coming out; and, of course, the old school classic, I will survive. Once a Holiness evangelist, today Weaver D ministers to the people through his food.  In Automatic Y'all we have Weaver D's guide to the soul, his advice about working hard, his love for his mama, his guide to small business success, and his rollicking memories of the Athens southern college rock music scene, as well as a melt-in-your-mouth collection of his long sought-after and never-before-published soul food recipes.
