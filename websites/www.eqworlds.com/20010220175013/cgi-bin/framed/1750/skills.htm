<p></a><b>Research </b><br>
Permits the magic using classes to assemble spells from component
pieces. Spell Research is a trade skill, similar in theory to tailoring and cooking.  Specific items are inserted in to a 
container, combining to produce a new item.
<p>
All magi begin researching spells at level 16.  To do spell research, you will need a Tome specific to your 
class – these can be purchased in your guild hall.
<p>
Research instruction books can also be purchased in your guild hall.  All instruction books are written in 
languages other than common.  To learn the fundamentals of a language, you must train one point in the 
language with your guild master.  Once you have learned the fundamentals, you will be able to advance 
your linguistic skills through use – usually by listening to someone speak in that language.  
<p>
Research instruction books will list the components needed to produce a scroll.  Spell components can be 
found scattered throughout the world – they appear randomly on different creatures, so you will not have to 
‘camp’ a spot to get a certain component.  Components can be stored and traded – ask around – 13 of the 
14 classes out there will not be able to use the research component that you need.
<p>
Research components are usually found on intelligent creatures, or on creatures that are innately magical.
