<td align="left" valign="top"><h2>Duck Cookbook</h2><span class="description">Few ingredients are as intimidating to the home cook as duck. But with the guidance of award-winning author James Peterson, any home chef can learn to prepare this incredibly versatile, flavorful bird.  The Duck Cookbook is the only complete guide to duck. With his signature style, Peterson explains the different varieties available and the best cooking methods for each part of the duck. Chapters begin with lessons on a single cooking technique-from sautÃ©ing to smoking-then move on to specific dishes such as soups, salads, and confit.  Peterson's detailed instructions ensure that readers will have the proper skills to handle any kind of duck preparation. The book's 65 recipes range from straightforward, delicious whole roasted duck and sautÃ©ed duck breasts (with a variety of sauces) to sophisticated terrines and mousses. Braised Duck Legs with Red Cabbage and Juniper Berries and Duck Confit Spring Rolls are among the many tempting highlights. Sidebars feature detailed instructions for cutting up a whole duck, making duck stocks, and more.   James Peterson has written seven award-winning cookbooks. He taught cooking for 17 years-at the French Culinary Institute and Peter Kump's Cooking School in New York-and is now a frequent guest teacher at schools around the country. He lives in Brooklyn, New York.<br><a href="/eq/2116374.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>

<td align="left" valign="top"><h2>Durgin-Park Cookbook</h2><span class="description">No restaurant defines Yankee cooking as well as Boston's Durgin-Park. In an atmosphere of clattering dishes, conversation, and sharp-tongued waitresses, it serves its time-hallowed specialties: roast beef that may be the best anywhere, incredible quantities of Boston baked beans, New England boiled dinners, chowder, apple pie, apple pan dowdy, and hot cornbread.  Few restaurants can claim a tradition as long and entrenched as Durgin-Park. Founded in 1827, it has had only four owners. Chef Tom Ryan has worked there for 40 years and leaned how to cook the Durgin-Park way. Many of the legendary waitresses who display an attitude towards the customers have worked at Durgin-Park for their entire careers. Franklin Roosevelt ate there when he went to Harvard, Calvin Coolidge was a regular, and Teddy Roosevelt satisfied his hearty appetite there, as did his sons.  The Durgin-Park Cookbook contains not only Tom Ryan's recipes for his classic New England dishes, but the stories and photos make reading the book like a visit to the Boston landmark. Its history, its traditions, its atmosphere, and its commitment to quality are all described and illustrated. This important addition to the Roadfoodâ„¢ Cookbook series is sure to be a favorite with people in New England and throughout the country.<br><a href="/eq/2117286.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>

Unlike other nutrition books on the market, this is not a weight-loss diet--nor is it targeted toward a specific sport.  Rather, it is aimed at active people of all levels of ability, from occasional athletes to serious competitors.  Dr. Applegate debunks several widely held myths.  Readers will learn, among other things, that: eating before a workout burns more calories than fasting; chocolate contains the same heart-helping antioxidants as red wine; and taboo' foods like red meat, milk, and fat contain nutrients that are essential to maintaining an active lifestyle.  Eating programs are offered for different fitness goals, from pre- and post-workout meals to eating for maximum strength, to boost energy, to lose weight--even weekend warriors have specific needs.  Nutritional charts help readers choose among the myriad of new sports nutrition products, including drinks, energy bars, and energy gels that have flooded today's marketplace.  Complete with recipes, Eat Smart, Play Hard will help readers easily adopt the best eating habits to keep them in top shape.<br><a href="/eq/2116007.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>
