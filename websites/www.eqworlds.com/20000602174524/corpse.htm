<CENTER><B>The following are tips and methods of getting your corpse with out dying</center></B>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="3">TIP #1</font></B>
<BR>
When your life sinks below 25% and you are being hit by a train, a tough monster or etc... type in /loc to record your location, later on if you die scroll up on the chat menu find were the location was recorded before you died. Write it down and when you feel
your near to were you had just died keep typing /loc and walk a direction and see if your location is getting closer to the coordinates
you died at.

<BR>
If you died in a dangerous spot that is surrounded by monsters and you don’t want to get attacked here’s what to do. Go to the Socials button on the right, right click on any of the commands that you do not care for (Time, afk) then you’ll get a special window that pops up on top of the chat menu. now deleted were it says "/......" and put "/corpse" to make a hot key. Now click and hold and put it on one of the box’s on the bottom left, (in this case the First Box) now that its in the first box, go to your corpse or several paces away from it, hit corpse button, and begin to walk, rapidly hit the corpse button and keep running until in a safe area. When you turn around your corpse is right there. 
But do not cross zone lines like this, it will result by leaving your corpse in the other zone.

Magic is pretty much the best way to find someone’s or your own corpse. If you know the exact location of were your corpse lies then try and get someone to cast SOW on you (spirit of the wolf) or cast it on your self if you have it. Only shamans,druids,and rangers have this spell and it can make you run 2 times faster then your original running speed. This is great for escaping monsters. 
Another spell is "Lyssa's Locating Lyric" which only bards have, they can help find the location of your corpse <BR>
And yet some other magic classes can locate corpses, that may be helpful to you.

Another thing to keep in mind when your corpse is being protected by dangerous monster is you can always get a druid or wizard to cast camouflage on you (invisibility) which will make you invisible for about 8 minutes. This may give you enough time to drag your corpse to a safe spot. But remember once you loot your corpse you become unhidden.

Another nice point for Rogue's: It is possible to hide and sneak at the same time. This way you can move hidden to your corpse and drag it to safety. I dont know whether the Hide is also broken when you loot. It might be that it remains.
