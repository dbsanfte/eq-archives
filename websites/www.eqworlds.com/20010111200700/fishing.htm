Fishing isn’t really the Best trading skill but it's easy to learn so you don't make much money. A fishing pole will sell at any woodworks shop or a fishing store usually located near city docks, they sell for around 1-2 gold. Next you must buy bait witch goes for about 4 copper. Now equip the fishing pole like you would with a weapon. 
<P>
If you haven’t already, go to abilities on the left side and kick on one of the skill numbers you will see fishing come up as one of them, click fishing and the best thing to do is click and drag to one of the box's on the right. 
<P>
Now all you do is go near some water, it does not matter how far down the water is, just how far away. Click on "fishing" you will cast the pole and you will see a small drop of water splash on the water beneath you. Unless you have good fishing skill you are most likely NOT to get any fish for a while. there are a 3 possible outcomes. 
<P>
"You caught a fish!"<BR>
"You spilled your bear while reeling in"<BR>
"You failed to catch any fish"<BR>
<P>
Also you may find yourself losing bait and the most dreadful of all, breaking your fishing pole. 
<P>
Also keep in mind that when you are fishing to keep pressing "Sense Heading". It usually takes long periods of time to cast and reel in, so during this time you might as well get your sense heading up. 
<P>
After you think you have collected enough fish go to the fishing docks or any person you will buy them and sell. they will sell for 2-3 silver per fish. Or if you have good baking skills you may make fish filets witch sell for much more. <P>
