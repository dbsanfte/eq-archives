<td align="left" valign="top"><h2>Sweet Serendipity</h2><span class="description">Marilyn Monroe's favorite was Miss Milton's Lovely Fudge Pie, and she'd eat it wearing nothing but Chanel No. 5 and a raincoat. Andy Warhol always savored the Lemon Icebox Pie, stealing bites while he watched and sketched other diners through cutout holes in a newspaper he held upside-down in front of his face. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis came for the frozen hot chocolate and brought John-John and Caroline, who now brings her own children.  Where did all these luminaries and many more devour these sinful treats? At Serendipity 3, New York's legendary dessert restaurant and boutique.  The restaurant's history is as rich as its desserts, and this book, commemorating its fiftieth anniversary, lets you indulge in both.  Founded in 1953, before the concept of theme restaurants even existed, Serendipity was one of the first restaurants in the country to turn dining into a theatrical experience, to create an ambiance as fun as the food that was served.  Located near Bloomingdale's in one of New York's toniest East Side neighborhoods, Serendipity fills two floors of a historic townhouse.  Decked out with original Tiffany lamps, black and white floors, fabulous Victorian oversized posters, and idiosyncratic adornments such as a huge clock and metal horse, the restaurant takes you down the rabbit hole into a fairy-tale world.  The desserts, represented by seventy-five recipes in this book, make everyone feel like a kid again.  Many evoke the comfort of grandmother's kitchen, but many also have a creative, irreverent kick to them.  Since many are based on heirloom recipes from one of the founder's families, all the recipes are easily achieved at home and can make fun projects for the whole family.  Recipes include: Cheesecake Vesuvius; Strawberry Fields Sundae; Chocolate Chip Pizza; Chocolate Blackout Cake; Lemon Rain Drops; Frozen Tutti Frutti; and many more.<br><a href="/eq/2116479.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>

<td align="left" valign="top"><h2>Sweet Stuff</h2><span class="description">Like many people, I believe that one should always save room for dessert, says Karen Barker. Inspired by this sumptuous collection of more than 160 easy-to-follow dessert recipes, you may decide to skip dinner altogether and head straight for the sweet stuff.   Drawing on years of professional experience as well as memories of cooking and baking from her Brooklyn childhood, Barker gives us the benefit of cooking alongside an experienced mentor. Starting with the fundamentals, she offers advice on selecting key ingredients, suggestions for essential kitchen equipment, and even tips on ways to fit dessert-making into the busiest of schedules.   Her recipes begin with pastry doughs, sauces, and special toppings that serve as building blocks for other desserts and provide a foundation for home cooks eager to improve their skills. Chapters on pies, fruit desserts, custards, cakes, ice creams, cookies, and breakfast-like desserts feature familiar favorites with a twist, such as key lime coconut pie with rum cream, deep-dish brown sugar plum cobbler, dark chocolate Peppermint Pattie cake, and cornmeal vanilla bean shortbreads. Sweet Stuff offers something irresistible for everyone.  Karen Barker is the 2003 winner of the Best Pastry Chef Award from the James Beard Foundation and 1999 winner of Bon AppÃƒÂ©tit's American Food and Entertaining Award for Best Pastry Chef. She and husband Ben Barker own and operate Magnolia Grill in Durham, North Carolina, and are coauthors of Not Afraid of Flavor: Recipes from Magnolia Grill.<br><a href="/eq/2116475.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>

In plainspoken prose, the author explains the physiology and biochemistry of weight gain and loss.  He outlines: causes of overweight; health concerns in dieting; how metabolism and genetics factor into weight control; what you can do to work with, rather than against, your body's processes; and critiques popular diet programs, medications, supplements, and home tests.

It links the solemnity of the Japanese tea ceremony and the sustaining high tea of British schoolchildren; it can be green or black, fragrant or smoky.  Tea is drunk around the world and around the clock, but the traditional afternoon tea is an inestimable pleasure.  To take tea at The Savoy is to combine that tradition with all the elegance and sophistication that befits one of London's greatest hotels.    Anton Edelman, The Savoy's Maitre Chef des Cuisines, offers exquisite recipes with tales that conjure up leisure time in a bygone era, set against the romantic story of tea and its journey to the West.  Here is afternoon tea at its most stylish--aromatic brews, delicate porcelain, impeccably presented dainties.  Indulge in feather-light palmiers or cinnamon madeleines.  Enjoy delicate cucumber sandwiches or fragrant honey and ham biscuits for an al fresco summer tea, or luscious cakes to chase away winter doldrums.  This is a book to inspire endless afternoons of delight.<br><a href="/eq/2117284.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>
