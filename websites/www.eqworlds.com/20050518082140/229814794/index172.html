<span class="description">The All-Clad LTD Omelette Pan turns out beautiful, full-sized omelettes, sauteed vegetables and much more. Food cooks evenly on the bottom as well as along the edge since the triple layer aluminum core coats the bottom and sides of the pan. Food slides out easily thanks to the sloping pan sides. Interior is polished stainless that won't react to food and cleans up easily. Hard-anodized exterior won't scratch or peel and adds a brushed, commercial-look.All-Clad LTD cookware is the undisputed choice in four-star kitchens. It's crafted from three permanently bonded layers of metal; a layer of pure aluminum rests between a charcoal black anodized aluminum exterior with an 18/10 stainless steel cooking surface.

To maintain it's appearance, it's best to hand wash your All-Clad LTD cookware.<br><a href="/eq/215.dhtml">Click here for more info</a></span></td></tr></table></td>
