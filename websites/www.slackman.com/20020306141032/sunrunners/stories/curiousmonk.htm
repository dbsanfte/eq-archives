          <font face="arial" size="2">Once upon a time there was a Monk named
          Mindert. Mindert had been initiated into the 30th circle for some time
          now. In fact he was quite close to being promoted. Mindert had been
          Traveling with Talcey for some time. Talcey was a beautiful buxom
          barbarian lady with a heart of gold and a flirtatious bent that would
          make a madam blush. Talcey and Mindert had seen most of the world
          together and had decided to see the sights in Kunark.</font><br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          <font face="arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For some time now
          Mindert had been hearing stories of some fantastic Monk weapons and
          armor that could be found in a mystical place called Dalnir. This is
          where the fabled Monk Fighting Batons DA8 DE20 were rumored to be
          found. So Mindert prevailed upon Talcey to visit this wondrous place.
          Now Talcey was slightly older than Mindert but mindert was beginning
          to equal her in power, so together they made a frightening force, but
          when the got to Dalnir they were daunted.</font><br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          <font face="arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You see, while they
          could defeat the crypts denizens singly or in twos. There were
          literally hundreds of nasty critters in this place. It was at this
          time that the ever wise Talcey advised caution and proposed a plan to
          reside near the entrance to this terrible place for a time to learn
          their habits and patterns. All the while gathering their power for the
          inevitable strike into the heart of the crypt and the wondrous monk
          treasure therein.</font><br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          <font face="arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This satisfied Mindert
          for a time but as with all younglings this monk soon became impatient
          for his reward. So one day when Talcey was asleep in her Camp, Mindert
          struck out on his own. Now remember while Mindert is well known for
          his fighting prowess, he is not well known for his intelligence, and
          rightly so. You see for the next two hours mindert snuck his way ever
          deeper into the Crypt of Dalnir, at one point falling nearly 200 feet
          through a hole, as it was the only way to continue. Now he was
          committed to his course. He continued deeper and deeper, every time
          something threatened him he would pretend he was dead (Which he was
          getting quite good at) and they would go away. Finally Mindert reached
          his goal, The Lumpy Goo !!!!</font><br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          <font face="arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was this point that
          Mindert looked around and realized what he had done! He was in the
          middle of an unfriendly Crypt surrounded By hundreds of creatures that
          were nearly as powerful as he was, with no way out, pretending to be
          dead. It was at this point that Mindert got scared! Mindert spent the
          next 30 min pretending to be dead, reflecting on what he had done,
          trying to figure out a way to get home and cleaning out his shorts.
          Now remember when I told you that Mindert wasn't particularly bright?
          Well he got impatient again. He could have waited for his friend
          Talcey to come down, make him invisible and the two of them could just
          walk out. But he didn't!</font><br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          <font face="arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mindert decided to work
          his way out just as he had gotten in. After all he was a powerful
          Monk! So Mindert stood up and started running........He made 5 steps.</font><br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          <font face="arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later that day when
          Talcey woke........... Well this has gone on long enough..... you
          understand the moral. Please don't be a curious monk.</font>
