<h1 align="center">Kael Drakal</h1>

<hr>

<p align="left">Kael Drakal Is filled with Giants on the Kromzek, Kromriff, or Tormax
faction. If you have ever killed a Giant in Velious you are likely KOS here. If you have
not killed any Giants on Velious, there is still a really good chance you are KOS here.</p>

<p align="left">Kael is a fully Functioning town, with a Bank and Vendors, if you can use
them.</p>

<p align="left">There are 2 ways to get into Kael. Port to GD, or Iceclad, then Zone to
EW, and enter on the EW side, or port to WL, and enter from that side. If you need to pass
through Kael, there are NO Giants that see invis on the blue line from S1 to S2 (If
something sees you and kills you, 95% of the time its because you left the blue line. 5%
of the time its because someone Trained a Giant out to the line from somewhere else.)</p>

<p align="left">S3 Is called the Plaza, and is a good XP spot for a single group.</p>

<p align="left">The Road to S4 is Dangerous. Everything here will See invis, and will kill
you Quickly. Dont wander off or you will Die.</p>

<p align="left">S4 are the Arena camp spots. You need 1 really good group, or 2 or 3 good
groups.</p>
