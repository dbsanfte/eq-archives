<p align="left">The Sunrunners made a bold return to the <b>Sarnak</b> city of
<b>Chardok</b> last night. Thwarted on their previous attempts to remove the <b>
Royals</b> from their thrones, <b>The Sunrunners</b> returned in force, intent 
on acquiring the piece for Kvala's epic! The journey to the heart of <b>Chardok</b> 
was quick and painless. Once <b>The Sunrunners </b>set up camp in the Library 
room outside the Kings quarters, all was going well, until an errant pet 
prematurely pulled <b>Balthezid </b>&nbsp;and all his courtly patrons. <b>The 
Sunrunners </b>lost a few people to the ensuing melee, but in the end we were 
victorious and <b>Lanaren</b> looted the Singed Scroll for later chaining for <b>
Kvala</b>!</p>
<p align="left">Once the rezzes were completed, we again marched forward to take 
on the Queen. <b>Strebor </b>showed up in zone, and was Call of the Hero'd in 
just in time for the ensuing massacre... When asked if he felt like a little 
school girl, <b>Strebor</b> blurted something cryptic about needing an o-ring 
cushion, and that &quot;She could have at least taken me out to dinner and a movie first&quot; .</p>

<p align="left">It was a dreary Wednesday afternoon, and <b>Krrak D'Bonz </b>had 
yet to decide on a destination for <b>The Sunrunners </b>Thursday night <b>
Spankfest</b>. <b>Lanaren </b>asked <b>Grecoriam </b>for a suggestion. &quot;The 
Tunnels in <b>The Umbral Plains</b>&quot;, he said. And we are <b>ALL</b> glad he 
did! I think we can safely say <b>The Sunrunners </b>will be coming back her a 
few more times! We kicked some serious tail, handing eveything we could find in 
the north tunnels their collective asses. We also took down a pile of level <b>
59-60 </b>named mobs as well! </p>

<p>Another successful raid, led this time by Strebor. </p>

<p>Notable drops ;<br>
Silk Turban - Cilani<br>
Vellium War Mask - Tsurwolf<br>
Runed Frost Blade - Spraticus </p>

<p>But By far the luckiest Dawg was Komodo who got a Scepter of Mastery and a Silver Belt
of Contention which adds Haste =) WOOT!!! </p>

<p>Some things to remember when considering the success of a raid. </p>

<p>Did it start on time - Yes (amazing=)<br>
Did anyone die - No<br>
Did everyone do their jobs properly? Yes<br>
Did people listen when needed? Yes </p>

<p>Not only did we do all of the above, we cleared the way in record time, got set up in
the Arena and was pulling the entire arena when the left side got taken by another guild -
who promptly wiped out. </p>

<p>It was a fustrating day at Kael for the Plate wearers as Silk after Silk dropped from
the reluctant clutches of the residant Giants. Perhaps they were still sleeping? </p>

<p>The following drops occured and were awarded to... </p>

<p>Silk Turban - Naliel<br>
Silk Turban - Fistandantilus<br>
Silk Gloves - Cilani<br>
Leather Gloves - Exzandra<br>
Chain Gloves - Lanaren </p>

<p>Lanaren traded her gloves to the bank for the chain coif. She is now looking quite
Valkyrian on her dashing new horse and shiny title. But enough about her =) </p>

<p>Exzandra is our latest Up and Coming Druidess who's radiant glow shows that even the
Gods smile down on her slight form. We expect many wonderful things from her =) </p>

<p>Our Silk wearing Casters are looking very fashionable this new year sporting various
peices of Thurgandin Armour. Rumor has it that the Plate and Leather wearing Ones are
quietly waiting...sharpening their swords...for their next chance at the Arena. </p>

<p>Sunrunners group home for wayward Giant Slayers suffers its second setback in as many
weeks.</p>

<p>&quot;It was horrible&quot; one eyewitness exclaimed. &quot;There were Giant parts
flying everywhere&quot; &quot;Bodies were piled 3 and 4 layers deep around every one of
them&quot; &quot;I have never seen such a Giant Slaughter&quot; When asked, the group home
administrator, known only as &quot;Krrak&quot; gave this statement. &quot;We were doing so
well. We set up a Meet and Greet, for the patients to get to know the Giants, and become
better friends because of the exposure. Then in troops this line of Giants with their
fancy armour and shiny things, acting all high and mighty, and flashing them under the
noses of our recovering friends. Well as you can imagine all HECK broke loose&quot;</p>

<p>Congratulations to:<br>
Naliel, on her new Silk Robe and Boots<br>
Fist on his new Silk Bracer<br>
Sprat on his new Plate Bracer<br>
Gladiator Chain Leggings - ???<br>
The Guild Bank on the Chain Coif, and Silk Robe (To be chained to worthy Sunrunners)</p>

<p>Thank you to Elpida, Eckol, Togam, and Window of Crimson Eternity for the assistance.
(and Heelers friend, I forget his name)</p>

not like wearwolves. The guard made the mistake of touching a Sunrunner! We proceded to
hand him his backside on a silver platter. Wen the new guard showed up, he steared clear

<p>They went searching for a Lute, and came across a GOLD MINE !</p>

<p>Actually it was a GEM mine, but whos counting.</p>

<p>The Pit in Velks was invaded last night, by a number of Sunrunners searching for
Cdiddys lost Lute. We know who Stole it, (<a
href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=6861">Khelkar Icepaw</a> ) &nbsp;
but&nbsp; he was obviously warned that we were gunning for him, because he didnt show his
face! Thats ok, because we will not give up. We will find him, and we will retrieve
Cdiddys Lute.</p>

<p>While we were there however we collected a WAD of Plat and Silver from his friends who
were eager to make up for Khelkar's transgressions. Add to that the pile of Gems that
Lanaren stumbeled across, and the night was not a total loss.</p>

<p>Group home suffers its first setback.</p>

<p>A moving Van pulled up to the city of Kael Drakal on Saturday morning, and the
Sunrunners piled out. Within 30 Mins the new &quot;Sunrunners group home for wayward Giant
Slayers&quot; was set up and open for business. There were some lapses in controll on the
first day, but we are working dilligently to help them break their Giant Slaying
addiction. A spokes person commented.</p>

<p>A Few lapses?!?!!</p>

<p>In the slightly more than 3 hours they were there, more than 100 Giants were put to the
sword.</p>

<p>Congrats to:<br>
Fistandantilis on his NEW ROBE<br>
Nalliel on her NEW PANTS</p>

<p>We will overcome our addictions, one of the patients was heard to say .........
eventually.</p>
