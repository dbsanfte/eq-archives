<h2>1.0 Recruiting</h2>

<p><br>
In this Policy, the Applicant will be referred to as &#145;Apprentice&#146;, or
&#145;App&#148;. Fully Guilded Members will be referred to as &#147;FGM&#146;s&#148; . </p>

<p>Minimum Level Requirements are currently level 40 for all classes. The Sunrunners reserve the right to change this requirement at any time.</p>

<p>Once the App
has become a Fully Guilded Member (FGM) - all alts will be accepted regardless of level. </p>

<p>Procedure for application for entry to the Guild:<br>
1. Go to the website <a href="http://www.slackman.com/sunrunners" target="_blank">www.slackman.com/sunrunners</a>
and put your name in for admittance.<br>
2. Read the Charter of the Guild (as yet to be written) and Guild Policies. It is assumed if you are accepted for membership trial period that you have read
and understood these charter and policies.<br>
3. Once the Application has been received, an Officer  will invite you to
the guild which will begin the &#147;Trail Period&#148;.<br>
4. Trial period is one calendar month during which the following must be done:<br>
-group with regular members and at least one officer to ensure that both the applicant and
the guild will be able to work together. <br>
-participate in Guild Planned raids.<br>
5. Duties of the FGM&#146;s &#150; in the Member section please post your thoughts and
experiences about the App as all FGM will be taking any opportunity to group with all Apps
&#150; please list both good and bad impressions. If there is nothing to say about this
App it is likely this App is not on nearly enough to warrant FGM Status or they are
unwilling to group with us. Either situation will result in the App being declined FGM
status. <br>
6. Officers will be required to take time to group with each App at least once in the
trial month to determine your vote as to whether this applicant is accepted into the guild
as a full member. If an Officer offers to group with this App and the App declines for any
reason other than RL, this is also not a good thing as noted in #4. <br>
7. Officers will need to make it known whether or not they approve of the App becoming a
FGM&#146;s &#150; basically casting a vote &#150; this will be a thread on the Officers
board only. </p>

<p>When you are an App you will be expected to:<br>
1. Group as much as you can with fellow guild members and wow us with your experience and
willingness to be in this guild. We want lifers &#150; that means showing loyalty. We do
not want to take a moment away from your RL obligations &#150; RL always comes first. <br>
2. Be available to go on a raid at a moments notice, and be present (and early) for all
preplanned Guild raids.<br>
*** Please note that if you are still in your &#147;Trial Month&#148; you will not be
eligible for drops that occur on the Guild Raids unless the following exception occurs; If
the loot is NO DROP and is for your Class/Race combo and no other FGM can use and or equip
it (basically if the item would rot on the corpse) then an App may have that item.
Otherwise the Loot Policy will be adhered to. The reason for this addendum is so we can
ensure that App&#146;s are sincere in their reasons for wanting to be in a guild and not
for &#145;quick loot&#146; or to use the guild for their benefit alone for a short while
and then leave (ie getting parts of their epics completed)</p>

<h1></font><font size="5">2.0 Planning Raids</font><font
face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"></h1>

<p><br>
1. Anyone can ask for or plan a raid, in fact it is encouraged that all members try
planning at least one raid. However only raids that require a raid force (more than one
group) will be Official Raids.<br>
2. Use the Raid Suggestion forum. This
is where all the suggestions and comments about the suggested raids will be posted.<br>
3. Watch the Official Raid Forum &#150; for official raids to be posted by either of the Raid officers or the Guild Leader.<br>
4. Once a raid has been proposed, either the Raid officers or the Guild leader will
work out what kind of a force will be required (at minimum) to handle said raid, then once it is confirmed that we have
the required forces the raid it will be
posted in the Raid forum. Once it is
posted the raid will occur unless RL interferes. <br>
5. Priority for the implementation of raids will be given to those who come to 
raids for others, especially those raids where it is known that loot will NOT be 
received. Helping make the guild stronger will be rewarded.</p>
<p><font size="2">*</font><font face="Arial" size="2">Please Note* all Plat 
looted during planned raids will go to Guild Bank for Dots and Corpse recovery 
or other raids gems:</font></p>
