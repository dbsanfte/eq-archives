          overcast and very dark, a chill brisk wind was blowing from the
          northeast, and the ground russled with the fallen aspen and elm
          leaves.&nbsp; The near utter darkness did nothing to deter the 3 sets
          of wide eyes peering from a sheltered valley to the north.&nbsp; Three
          rather small, glowing sets of eyes that framed three small elven

          glimpse of these wonderfull creatures of myth, &quot;wild
          humans.&quot;&nbsp; What meets his eyes astounds his senses, two
          beautifull human maids, dressed in long flowing gowns walk down a
          small dirt path towards his position in the bushes.&nbsp; What an
          adventure he was having.&nbsp; He, his best friend Xavek, and his
          older sister, Ssin'rai, had sucessfully escaped their house in lower
          neriak, stole through the town, entered the forest of Nektulas, and
          found their way to East Commons.&nbsp; And now he was actually seeing
          wild humans with his own eyes... and beautifull ones at that.</font>

          lurkers had returned and would surely make off with more of his grain
          this night. &quot;No! By Karana's might, I will not let them rob me
          again.&quot;&nbsp; He quickly took down the runed blades of his youth
          off the mantlepiece and felt their weight.&nbsp; It had many a year
          since he had used these, and they felt odd and ungainly in his hands.</font>

          Jake knew enough of their language to recognize the strange accents
          and slurs of the dark speech.&nbsp; They would pay for their thievery

          would have to act quickly before the murderous bastards could molest

          through the window and into the night.&nbsp; Tracking by sound and
          instinct, Jake rapidly moves in on his enemies slashing into their
          prone forms.</font>
