          <font size="2">
          <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The froglok moved through the swamp, it
          powerful hind legs propelling it with short hops. It zigzagged through
          the dense vegetation in search of food. It stopped by an old tree, and
          started to dig. Its small webbed hands efficiently scooped out muck to
          uncover a dull, waxy root, which was quickly put into a netted bag.
          Layers of fungus, scraped from a tree went into another bag. It began
          to hop away in search of more food for its brethren, when something
          caught its eye. Paleness, white really, was standing out strongly
          against the browns and greens of the swamp. The pale form had the
          color of metal in the middle. Quietly, the froglok crept closer. What
          it saw was not a Troll and thus it relaxed a bit. Still, the paleness
          was too large to put in a bag. Losing interest, the froglok turned its
          bulbous eyes away from the pale figure, completely unaware that
          someone else was sharing those same eyes.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yar!&quot; Grammaw thought to herself,
          &quot;Nudder stinkee whitey commin tu da swamp. Gud, meeze needin tu
          git sumfin frum dat fing.&quot; Dipping her hands into the algae-laden
          water, she soon had a squirming fish. In three quick bites there was
          nothing left of the fish but the head. Grammaw found it strange that
          so many Trolls actually cooked their food nowadays. She seemed to be
          the only one who remembered the old ways. Eating something fresh let
          you consume part of its essence, its spirit. Eating the fish made
          Grammaw a better swimmer. The body housed the soul. Fire cleansed
          things, took the power away. What had happened in Grobb while she has
          away? She remembered different faces, different ideas. But that was
          Before. Grammaw’s Other Self remembered the Before. There was Carver
          Gnask, who was much shorter than the Carver in Grobb today. Nobody
          else recalled Carver Gnask. The Other Self did, though.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shaking her thoughts aside, Grammaw called out
          to one of the spirits of Rage that hovered about. With a few sharp
          commands, she forced the spirit into her body, consuming it entirely.
          For a short time, before it was utterly consumed and absorbed, the
          spirit would add its strength to her own. She then took the fish head,
          and with well-practiced motions, chewed the gills off and spat them
          into her hand. Small animals had weak spirits, and parts of the body
          were needed for the magic. The body housed the soul. Pressing the
          gills to the sides of her neck, she called the spirit of the fish. The
          gills, still holding some of the essence of the fish, blended into her
          neck. Soon, Grammaw had gill slits in her neck. Sliding her bulk into
          the swamp, she opened her mouth and let the water wash over her new
          gills. Grammaw began to swim.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peering from beneath the water, Grammaw could
          see the pale elf sharpening his blade. Even in the middle of the
          swamp, the elf had the vanity to keep himself clean and shiny. With a
          push off the bottom of the swamp, Grammaw leapt onto shore. Her moss
          and algae covered form exploding from the swamp must have startled the
          High Elf. Grammaw called out to the trees next to him. The elf
          recovered from his surprise just as the nearby vegetation twined
          around his legs, holding him fast. Grammaw quickly found and harnessed
          a large snake-spirit, and sent it into the elf. The toxic spirit
          entered the elf’s nose and mouth, and released its venom into the
          organs of the elf. While she could simply wait and let the elf succumb
          to the toxins in his body, Grammaw needed to be close when he died.
          There were some things that required a more…personal touch.
          Unlimbering her Gatorsmash Maul, Grammaw charged the immobile elf. She
          brought the maul down onto the shoulder of the elf. The magic in the
          weapon caused a large chunk of the elf’s flesh to split apart. The
          Moment was coming. The elf turned away from his attacker and began to
          flee. She had seen it in his face though. The expression of doom. This
          was the expression that most beings had when they knew for certain
          that they were going to die. Grammaw again brought the Maul down upon
          the elf. He spun around and sank his blade deep into Grammaw’s left
          biceps. With a grunt, she dropped the Gatorsmash and trapped the
          elf’s blade in her elbow. Her right hand then shot out, and she
          grabbed the elf’s throat and began to squeeze. The elf frantically
          tried to pummel his attacker, his pale skin showing dark black and
          purple where the veins drew the poison to the skin.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Moment had come. The elf’s eyes started to
          widen in terror of his final seconds. It always was the same. The eyes
          always were wide open at the moment of death, as if the victims…saw
          something.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;J’ariel li, n’qua?&quot; Grammaw
          growled at him in his native speech. What do you see? She repeated it
          again, &quot;J’ariel li, n’qua?&quot; What do you see? She debated
          relaxing her grip so that the elf could speak. One last breath was too
          many, she decided. The elf stopped moving, all but for a leg. This was
          due to a small alligator that had fastened its jaw around the foot of
          the corpse and was tugging at it, trying to wrest it from Grammaw.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Puuk tak, bah bok!&quot; This is my kill.
          When a Troll utters those words, there will soon be another death. The
          alligator was grabbed by the tail and smashed into a stout tree. Its
          spine was broken by the impact, and it lay in the muck, writhing,
          slowly dying.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having fended off all rivals to her kill,
          Grammaw skinned the elf, and turned the carcass into nice gobbets.
          These would feed her for a time. Then she took the carefully prepared
          scalp back into her cave in Grobb. She knew she had to work quickly,
          Juzu would wake soon.</font></p>
