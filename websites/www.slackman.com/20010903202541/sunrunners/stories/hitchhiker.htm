          beautiful half-elf Ranger named Lgashu Mannadrain decided one day to
          explore new challenges in the mystical land of Kunark.&nbsp; Now,
          Lgashu, having been a Ranger of Tunare for only 23 seasons, she had to
          be wise in her adventuring choices.&nbsp; Unfortunately in this case,
          her adventurous spirit almost got the best of her.</font></font>

          had ventured to Kunark a few years earlier, but quickly returned after
          being overpowered in battle numerous times.&nbsp; She was still quite
          wary of this wondrous land.&nbsp; Most of her discomfort comes from
          the necessity of finding a city to call home while adventuring.&nbsp;
          Even though she is a Ranger, for some reason she can never seem to
          find an affinity with the great outdoors.</font></font>

          <font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The
          closest thing to a city other than the horrible evil land of Cabilis,
          is the main port of Kunark called Firona Vie.&nbsp; Firona Vie is
          crowded with many hideous creatures that Lgashu can tell just by
          looking at them would have no greater pleasure then to feast on her
          remains on a moments notice.</font></font>

          <font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Lgashu
          however had heard rumors of a place called &quot;Overthere&quot;,
          which contains a small stronghold called &quot;The Outpost&quot; that
          she might be able to find some comfort and short term residence in.&nbsp;
          The stories of the &quot;Overthere&quot; spoke of fierce creatures
          that traveled alone and would be easy prey for Lgashu as she sought
          her 24th season adventuring in Norrath.</font></font>

          <font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">After
          asking some fellow adventurers about the Overthere and it's Outpost,
          Lgashu learned about traveling to the area via an old, broken down
          raft that starts it's journey from the Oasis of Marr.&nbsp; This Oasis
          was a familiar hunting ground for her and she was quite familiar with
          the raft, so Lgashu decided it was time to explore this new hunting
          ground.</font></font>
        </div>
        <div align="left">
          &nbsp;

        <div align="left">
          <font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">So
          just hours after realizing her 23rd Season, Lgashu journeyed to Oasis,
          eager to begin her new adventure.&nbsp; She boarded the raft and soon
          found herself on a small island in the mysterious&nbsp;ocean called
          Timorous Deep.&nbsp; She noticed the island was inhabited by a small
          band of Ogres who had set up a small merchant camp.&nbsp; To her
          surprise, the Ogres scowled at Lgashu, ready to attack if she
          presented them with an opportunity.&nbsp; This troubled Lgashu as
          Ogres had always been friendly and amiable in her dealings with them.&nbsp;
          This should have been her first clue that she had exhibited bad
          judgment on beginning this journey.&nbsp; However, her pioneering
          spirit persuaded her to continue.</font></font>

        <div align="left">

        <div align="left">
          <font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Lgashu
          decided not to provoke a confrontation with the obviously misled Ogres
          and used her powers of camouflage to hide from them as she boarded
          another raft for the balance of her journey to the Overthere.&nbsp;
          Soon after departing this island, the raft entered an area of calm
          seas in Timourous Deep and just sat there, rocking silently.&nbsp;
          Being eager to catch a glimpse of Kunark, Lgashu ventured to the
          starboard side of the raft and FELL OFF!&nbsp; However, rather than
          panicking, she used her superior swimming skills to quickly make her
          way back to the raft and get back on board.&nbsp; This should have
          been Lgashu's second clue.&nbsp; But alas, she continued her journey.</font></font>

        <div align="left">

        <div align="left">
          <font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">After
          sailing a bit further on the raft, the mysterious land of Kunark
          finally came in view and for the first time Lgashu saw the &quot;Overthere&quot;
          and marveled at it's wide open plains.&nbsp; Lgashu knew full well she
          would enjoy this place.&nbsp; Being eager to track down her first
          prey, Lgashu dove into the water and swam to shore.&nbsp; Upon
          reaching the beach, she was about to seek out someone who could help
          her set up her camp in the Outpost when received a message from
          Brother Mindert, a fellow traveler loyal to the brotherhood of the
          Sunrnners, as is Lgashu.</font></font>

          Mindert inquired incredulously of Lgashu &quot;The Outpost??&nbsp;
          Followers of Tunare are killed on sight in that area!&nbsp; What are
          you thinking?&nbsp; Get out of there quickly and DON'T INTERACT WITH
          ANYONE!&quot;&nbsp; For the first time Lgashu realized the gravity of
          her situation.&nbsp; She looked around and saw many creatures scowling
          at her, ready to attack at a moments notice.&nbsp; She could tell by
          looking that she would be no match in battle for these fierce
          creatures.&nbsp; For the first time in many seasons, Lgashu felt fear
          creep into her soul.</font></font>

          <font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Lgashu
          quickly found cover and made her shape again blend into the
          surroundings.&nbsp; She then opened her pack and dug out the roughly
          scrawled maps of Kunark she had acquired from fellow adventurers.&nbsp;
          Her heart raced and she trembled a bit as she studied the maps,
          looking for a way out of this dangerous place, all the while silently
          praying to Tunare that she allow her to survive this mental blunder.&nbsp;
          She glanced up just in time to notice the raft she had arrived on
          disappearing over the horizon.&nbsp; She had no way out but to travel
          across Kunark to find a safe haven.&nbsp; After studying the maps for
          a few minutes, it was apparent that Lgashu's only safety lied in the
          dangerous port of Firona Vie.&nbsp;</font></font>

          <font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">After
          weighing her options and discovering they were a slim few, Lgashu
          decided to regain her wits about her and begin to make her way to
          Firona Vie.&nbsp; Lgashu checked to make sure her camouflage was
          adequate and began to run north along the shoreline as the maps had
          indicated, looking for a small wooded enclave that would lead to an
          area called Warsilks Woods.</font></font>

          <font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Lgashu
          ran for what seemed like days till she finally noticed the tracks
          leading into the woods.&nbsp; This must be the way to Warsilks Woods
          she thought, and she followed the tracks.&nbsp; Sure enough, she soon
          found herself in an area that seemed more like a jungle than mere
          woods.&nbsp; The area was overgrown with trees that swayed quietly in
          the wind.&nbsp; That breeze was the only sound to be heard for miles,
          and it was disquieting.</font></font>
        </div>
        <div align="left">
          &nbsp;
        </div>
        <div align="left">
          <font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">After
          running for a while, Lgashu came upon a bumpy dirt trail of sorts that
          resembled one of the trails scrawled on the map of Warsilks Woods that
          she had.&nbsp; She began following the trail northeast and soon found
          herself in the middle of some sort of stronghold that was overrun with
          goblins.&nbsp; As she peered at the goblins from a distance, she
          decided that they were no threat to her and continued her journey, but
          all the while making sure she adjusted her camouflage to match the
          surroundings.&nbsp; After safely winding through the goblin fort,
          Lgashu soon began noticing the terrain beginning to change and she
          knew she was approaching an area that the native Iskars called the
          &quot;Field of Bone&quot;.</font></font>

        <div align="left">

          <font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Field
          of Bone was a barren wasteland that resembled part beach, and part
          desert.&nbsp; But the area was also littered with bones from creatures
          that had died.&nbsp; This was obviously where the name came from.&nbsp;
          Soon, the huge monolith known as Kurns tower came into view and Lgashu
          had a good idea of just where she was as this was an area she had
          fought in a few seasons ago.&nbsp; She made her way around Kurns tower
          and continued east, all the while adjusting her camouflage so she
          would blend into the barren land.</font></font>

          <font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Lgashu
          soon noticed an area ahead that she knew to be a swamp known as
          &quot;Swamp of no hope&quot;.&nbsp; Lgashu made her way through the
          dismal, dark swamp while only encountering one creature along her
          path.&nbsp; It was one of those strange frog like creatures, and
          although she didn't feel this as a threat to her, Lgashu still
          maintained her camouflage and quietly slipped past the frog.</font></font>

        <div align="left">
          &nbsp;
        </div>
        <div align="left">
          <font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Lgashu's
          heart began to pound again as the sounds of Firona Vie began to eerily
          seep into the swamp.&nbsp; Lgashu again adjusted her camouflage and
          began to sprint through the area, running as fast as she could in her
          efforts to reach the safety of the docks.</font></font>
        </div>
        <div align="left">
          &nbsp;

        <div align="left">
          <font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">All
          was going well when a pair of strange creatures came into view.&nbsp;
          Travelers through Firona referred to these creatures as Drolvargs.&nbsp;
          Lgashu froze in her tracks as she realized that she could be seen by
          these creatures, despite her efforts to blend into the surroundings.&nbsp;
          As she examined them from afar, it was quite clear that she would be
          no match for one of these creatures, much less 2 of them.&nbsp; Lgashu
          again began to fear for her life and thought about jumping off the
          steep sheer cliffs into the Timorous deep.&nbsp; She pondered the
          possibility that she would survive the fall and actually be able to
          swim to the docks.&nbsp; She quickly glanced over the edge of the
          cliffs and decided that the fall would probably kill her.&nbsp;</font></font>
        </div>
        <div align="left">
          &nbsp;
        </div>
        <div align="left">
          <font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Just
          about the time that Lgashu decided to turn around and head back to the
          relative safety of the swamp, she noticed that the Drolvargs had
          disappeared and she slowly began making her way south towards the
          docks, keeping a wary eye for the various creatures of Firona Vie that
          would sure bring death with them.</font></font>

        <div align="left">

        <div align="left">
          <font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Soon
          the unmistakable shape of the docks shimmered into view and Lgashu
          sprinted for their safety.&nbsp; She soon came up to the bridge that
          led to the docks and made her way across.&nbsp; Once she had crossed
          the bridge, Lgashu stopped and breathed a deep sigh of relief!&nbsp;
          Somehow, with her skill in camouflage, her keen sense of direction,
          and her wits always about her, Lgashu had made it all the way from the
          shores of the Overthere to the docks of Firona Vie without once having
          to raise her swords in anger!&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font>

          prayed, thanking Tunare for choosing to spare her and forgive her for
          her err in judgment.&nbsp; Lgashu then meditated on the fact that it
          just goes to show how important it was for her to continue to hone the
          many skills she had learned&nbsp;and to strive to learn new ones.</font><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
