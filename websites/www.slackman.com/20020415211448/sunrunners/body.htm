  In the early days of September 1999 the original 10 members formed the 
  Sunrunners on the Erollissi Marr server.</font></div>

<div align="left">
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial Narrow" size="2" color="#800000"> Our guild is a tight family, whose 
  main interest in Everquest is to have fun.  We currently have a minimum level restriction of 40 to be considered for new membership in our guild.  We are a tight group of people and want to keep it that way, 
  therefore we are picky as to whom we allow in the guild. <br><br>
<b>Currently we are looking for the following classes:</b><br><br>

  -Enchanter<br>
  -Cleric<br>
  -Warrior<br>
  -Shadow Knight<br> 
  -Monk<br><br>

To register for consideration in the Sunrunners please post your name, level, and usual play times here: <a href="http://www.slackman.com/sunrunners/uboard/cgi/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=forum&f=14">Prospective
  member forum</a>.  New member registration is not limited to those classes.  They are just the classes we are the most
  interested in.<br>
If you are just passing through please feel free to browse.  Welcome to the Sunrunners web-site! </font></div>

<p>&nbsp;<div align="left">
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial Narrow" size="2" color="#800000">The
  guild has had many accomplishments and a few failures. We have had heroes and
  traitors.&nbsp; We shall learn from all our experiences and grow to match the
  future. We are the Sunrunners.</font>
