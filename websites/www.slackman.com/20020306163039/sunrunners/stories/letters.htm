  <p><em>Thanul’s War Letter Day 3</em></p>
  <p>Sire,</p>
  <p>Seeing our Amy march out of Freeport, pennants flying tall, the ranks
  perfect, and the armor polished, made my heart grow glad. Our force of 300
  fighting men has been traveling and is now camped in the common area beyond
  our smallest villas, that no one has rights to. We look like a different Army
  now. I had not realized just how quickly mud can cover everything, nor how
  badly my feet would feel after marching this much. But I shall persevere.
  Within the next few days, we shall be entering Nektulos Forest, or however it
  is spelled. I have never been out of Freeport, as you know, so the skill of
  Cartography was never one of my concerns. But the scouts you provided in this
  Army are more than adequate for this task.</p>
  <p>You have never mentioned what these Ezra lass had done to make you so
  irate, and I can respect that. Yet I can only speculate as to why you wish to
  send 300 fighting men and 200 support personnel, when an expert assassin might
  be a better course of action. Despite my questions, I must say that to be put
  in charge of such a magnificent Army, especially as young and untrained, as I
  am shows great faith. I shall not let you down, Brother.</p>
  <p>Your Brother and Field Commander,</p>
  <p>Thanul</p>
  <p>&nbsp;-------------------</p>

  <p>Sire,</p>
  <p>Finally, we have reached the cursed forest that the Dark Ones live in. It
  is far…darker than I had anticipated. Although I was warned that the forest
  hangs under a perpetual cloud of ash and debris from the nearby volcano, I was
  unprepared for how dark it truly is. We have not seen the sun since we entered
  this accursed land. Our scouts have reported difficulty seeing, and many lose
  their way without using the sun as a guide.</p>
  <p>We have also sustained our first casualties on this day. Some foul undead
  beings waylaid some of our men as they rested. Shortly after we recovered from
  this, we were beset upon by a patrol of the hideous Dark Elves. I forget what
  they call themselves, is it Koada’Dal? Perhaps I should have paid more
  attention with my tutors. But I digress. We lost 9 men, and have a few
  wounded. We shall continue onwards.</p>
  <p>Your Brother and Field Commander,</p>
  <p>Thanul</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------------</p>
  <i>
  <p>Thanul’s War Letter Day 11</p>
  </i>
  <p>Sire,</p>
  <p>I regret to inform you that your spies have left out some important
  details. This Ezra girl seems to have companions. They refer to themselves as
  the &quot;Children of Darkness&quot;, as if darkness has reproductive organs.
  This shows how truly inferior and primitive these Dark Elves are in comparison
  to we Humans. I am surprised that Antonius Bayle has not seen fit to eradicate
  these barbarian neighbors of ours. But I digress. Let me tell you of our
  meeting with these so-called Children of Darkness.</p>
  <p>We had been traveling for hours, and it was approaching suppertime, not
  that the gloom of the forest was any indication of the fading of day. One of
  our lookouts saw movement in the forest and, perhaps hastily, gave chase. He
  did not return. I put together a search party of 20 men to find him, while the
  rest of the men ate their gruel.</p>
  <p>Only one man returned, crawling on the stumps of his elbows and knees,
  which had been severed, then cauterized. He was in great pain, and frightened,
  but he had a message for us. That seem why he was allowed to live, however
  gruesomely. He mentioned the name &quot;Cindal&quot;, some sort of bodyguard
  to this Ezra. This Cindal apparently is a woman, and so the search party
  believed her to be no threat. When they attacked, more women joined her! The
  wounded survivor mentioned the name &quot;Caprice&quot; and something about
  breeding during war, or being bred for war. Some of the healers believe that
  this refers to yet another woman, but I know not what to make of it.</p>
  <p>Needless to say, I could not let these deeds go unanswered, especially not
  by women! The shame of that deserves no thought. So I called out a challenge,
  asking if there were any MEN amongst them whom would meet me in personal
  combat. Much to my surprise, a low voice answered me, and accepted the duel.
  My fighting skills are good, as you know, but I appointed Gregor as my
  champion. Gregor as you know, is the large Northerner who spent most of his
  life in the underground pits, fighting for other’s entertainment. They shall
  meet at dawn.</p>
  <p>Your Brother and Field Commander,</p>
  <p>Thanul</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------------</p>
  <i>
  <p>Thanul’s War Letter Day 12</p>
  <p></i>Sire,</p>
  <p>Things have not gone well. The wretch who was to die by Gregor’s blade
  goes by the name Memdaynar. He had as his seconds, a man named Shadowlyth,
  some sort of heathen priest, and Razaro, who is, I believe some sort of squire
  to this Memdaynar. The duel progressed, and was brutal. But this Memdaynar
  apparently did not realize he was supposed to be the one dying. Instead,
  Gregor met a most untimely death. Upon seeing this, I knew that somehow, the
  Dark Elves must have cheated. They are a weak and cowardly race, and could not
  have bested Gregor in a fair fight. I know not how it was done, but Gregor’s
  defeat is not possible. Anyway, I digress.</p>
  <p>After seeing Gregor fall, I sounded the call for our men to attack these
  dishonorable beings. Again, Sire, I believe your spies have not done their
  jobs well. From around us burst savage warriors, mostly women. There were also
  some of the despicable Ogres and Trolls helping out these Dark Elves. How
  these horrid things got past our patrols in the Common Lands is beyond me.
  Perhaps you could speak with Sergeant Slate about upping the numbers of
  patrols. Anyway, I digress.</p>
  <p>The Army under my command struck hard and fought well. Yet we were under
  assult from many sides, and by many strange magics. Fire rained down from the
  skies, and many men got poisoned, and horrid rock creatures chewed through our
  midst.</p>
  <p>But the worst part was that even as our men died, they got up again. Only
  this time they fought against us. Foul Necromantic arts were at work here.</p>
  <p>Sire, I had to retreat. I was wounded in battle. The healers saw that I
  will live, but alas, I will not have any heirs to my estate. I recognized my
  assailant, Sire. I believe she is the same one that was burnt, but not killed
  in Qeynos a while back. She was Human too, and that is the worst of it. How
  could a Human work with these horrid beings? Any Human that would stoop that
  low has no soul. I thank you for putting me in charge of their eradication.</p>
  <p>I must go now and meet up with the other survivors. Any reinforcements that
  you could send would be appreciated.</p>
  <p>Your Brother and Field Commander,</p>
  <p>Thanul</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------------</p>
  <p><i>Thanul’s War Letter Day 19</i></p>
  <p>Sire,</p>
  <p>We have been lost for a long time now, and harried at every step. I have
  less than 100 total men, and this number is dropping daily. My wound has
  become infected with something the healers seem unable to cure. The fever
  grows daily within me. We are out of supplies. Please send more men and
  supplies. We cannot go much longer.</p>
  <p>Your Brother and Field Commander,</p>
  <p>Thanul</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------------</p>
  <i>
  <p>Thanul’s War Letter Day 27</p>
  </i>
  <p>Where are my damn supplies? You are Councilman Duross, are you not? You can
  get 100 more men and supplies I KNOW YOU CAN. GET ME MORE DAMN MEN! Blessed
  Marr, we are out of fishing grubs. How can we wage war with no fishing grubs?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------------</p>
  <i>
  <p>Thanul’s War Letter Day 27</p>
  </i>
  <p>Councilman Duross,</p>
  <p>I am Lanlyn, a healer with the army that was sent to slay Ezra. I regret to
  inform you that your brother Thanul has succumbed to the infection within him.
  This will be the last entry here, as we are now being over run by the Children
  of Darkness. Tunare guide our souls.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Councilman Duross,</p>
  <p>Heddo luv. I thank you for your gifts to our Festival of Souls. 500 living
  people, most generous, I do say. I hope the loss of your army will not hurt
  your political career too much. I need you in the council so you can vote how
  I tell you. Perhaps you can play up the loss of your brother for sympathy.
  Regarding your brother: this gift was far and above what was required of you.
  I shall remember this next time we meet. I shall teach you more things. I will
  make you forget everything else in the world. Perhaps I will even let you
  touch me, and not one of my slaves. I know that is what you want. To have even
  a simple caress from me, or to be able to caress my naked skin. Maybe this
  time I will give you what you want. Perhaps not though.</p>
  <p>Aluve</p>
