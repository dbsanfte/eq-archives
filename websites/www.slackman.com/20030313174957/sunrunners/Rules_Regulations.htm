<h2>1.0 Recruiting</h2>

<p><br>
In this Policy, the Applicant will be referred to as &#145;Apprentice&#146;, or
&#145;App&#148;. Fully Guilded Members will be referred to as &#147;FGM&#146;s&#148; . </p>

<p>Minimum level to consider entry into the Sunrunners &#150; 40 for Main. Once the App
has become a FGM&#146;s - all alts will be accepted regardless of level. </p>

<p>Procedure for application for entry to the Guild:<br>
1. Go to the website <a href="http://www.slackman.com/sunrunners" target="_blank">www.slackman.com/sunrunners</a>
and put your name in for admittance.<br>
2. Read the Charter of the Guild (as yet to be written) and Guild Policies (as yet to be
written). It is assumed if you are accepted for membership trial period that you have read
and understood these charter and policies.<br>
3. Once the Application has been received, an Officer (or even Krrak=) will invite you to
the guild which will begin the &#147;Trail Period&#148;.<br>
4. Trial period is one calender month during which the following must be done:<br>
-group with regular members and at least one officer to ensure that both the applicant and
the guild will be able to work together. <br>
-participate in Guild Planned raids.<br>
5. Duties of the FGM&#146;s &#150; in the Member section please post your thoughts and
experiences about the App as all FGM will be taking any opportunity to group with all Apps
&#150; please list both good and bad impressions. If there is nothing to say about this
App it is likely this App is not on nearly enough to warrant FGM Status or they are
unwilling to group with us. Either situation will result in the App being declined FGM
status. <br>
6. Officers will be required to take time to group with each App at least once in the
trial month to determine your vote as to whether this applicant is accepted into the guild
as a full member. If an Officer offers to group with this App and the App declines for any
reason other than RL, this is also not a good thing as noted in #4. <br>
7. Officers will need to make it known whether or not they approve of the App becoming a
FGM&#146;s &#150; basically casting a vote &#150; this will be a thread on the Officers
board only. </p>

<p>When you are an App you will be expected to:<br>
1. Group as much as you can with fellow guildies and wow us with your experience and
willingness to be in this guild. We want lifers &#150; that means showing loyalty. We do
not want to take a moment away from your RL obligations &#150; RL always comes first. <br>
2. Be available to go on a raid at a moments notice, and be present (and early) for all
preplanned Guild raids.<br>
*** Please note that if you are still in your &#147;Trial Month&#148; you will not be
eligible for drops that occur on the Guild Raids unless the following exception occurs; If
the loot is NO DROP and is for your Class/Race combo and no other FGM can use and or equip
it (basically if the item would rot on the corpse) then an App may have that item.
Otherwise the Loot Policy will be adhered to. The reason for this addendum is so we can
ensure that App&#146;s are sincere in their reasons for wanting to be in a guild and not
for &#145;quick loot&#146; or to use the guild for their benefit alone for a short while
and then leave (ie getting parts of their epics completed)</p>

<h1></font><font size="5">2.0 Planning Raids</font><font
face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"></h1>

<p><br>
1. Anyone can ask for or plan a raid, in fact it is encouraged that all members try
planning at least one raid. However only raids that require a raid force (more than one
group) will be Official Raids.<br>
2. There is going to be a new forum made for the web-site: A Raid Suggestion forum. This
is where all the suggestions and comments about the suggested raids will be posted.<br>
3. The old Raid Forum &#150; will become a place for official raids to be posted and will
only be posted by either of the Raid officers or the Guild Leader.<br>
4. Once a raid has been proposed, either of the Raid officers or the Guild leader will
work out what kind of a force will be required (at minimum) to handle said raid, then once
the required forces have been contacted and confirmed for the raid &#150; it will be
posted in the Raid forum &#150; where the sign-ups for the raid will happen. Once it is
posted and signed up for the raid will occur unless RL interferes. <br>
5. Priority for the implementation of raids will be given to those who come to raids for
others, especially those raids where it is known that loot will NOT be received. Helping
make the guild stronger will be rewarded, those who feel that the guild should help them
first &#150; might do better looking for another guild. </p>

<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

<h1></font><font size="5">3.0 Loot Rules<strong> </strong></font><font
face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"></h1>

<p>These rules are based on the Need Before Greed (NBG) concept. </p>

<p>Please note the following Acronyms.<br>
Fully Guilded Members will be referred to as &#147;FGM&#146;s. </p>

<p>Master Looter will be referred to as ML.<br>
When on a Pre-Planned Raid that is for Sunrunners ONLY, the following Loot Rules apply: </p>

<p>1. If the GOAL of the Raid is a specific Item or Items, the Player that is organizing
the raid for these item(s) will have first rights to loot them. IF there is more than one
FGM planning/leading the raid b/c there is more than one Item in that zone/area then it is
necessary to determine which Item is going to be obtained first. This must be clearly
stated in the Raid Thread on the Board. </p>

<p>2. If there is not a specific GOAL of the Raid then all who joined the raid ON TIME
(please see the Raid Policy regarding PUNCUALITY) are eligible to qualify for Items and
other Loot that drops. Also please note that App&#146;s, and those who are an App for
disciplinary reasons, are not eligible for loot on these raids, as this is still a Trial
Period for full membership. </p>

<p>3. If an Item drops that is an UPGRADE to an item that a PC is qualified to wear (i.e.
right class/race) for the char on the raid (NOT AN ALT) then you may request to have that
item. <br>
-if there are more than two FGM&#146;s that fit the qualification outlined above, then a
random will be done by the ML of the raid. Please see how the random&#146;s will be done
below. </p>

<p>Randoms<br>
This can be confusing in the middle of a raid situation, so make sure you understand these
rules completely. You need to pay attention when the Master Looter calls out that he/she
is prepared to random an item that you need. </p>

<p>**Please note** There are different CATEGORIES of loot at this time. If you win an item
from one of the categories, then you are no longer eligible to random for an item from
that same category until everyone has one of that type. You would be eligible for loot
from the other two categories. If you are lucky enough to be eligible for a random from
one of the other 2 categories and win that item then you are only eligible for the 3rd
category unless everyone has won something from Category #2. This is highly unlikely but
with randoms you never know&#133;right?<br>
The 3 categories for randomable items are - EQUIPABLE ITEMS - QUEST ITEMS - GENERAL ITEMS <br>
Special Category - GEMS AND CASH LOOT &#150; to be outline separately. </p>

<p>Equipable Items<br>
This is the process for Items that can be EQUIPPED. These items are ONLY for the character
you are using on THIS RAID ONLY. Not for alts. <br>
Ask yourself these questions&#133;<br>
1. Do you have Full Guild Member Status?<br>
2. Are they equipable? Is the item usable by your class/race/deity? <br>
3. Is it an upgrade to what you currently have? If in doubt, ask yourself if you would be
willing to give up what you currently have. If what you currently have is a NO DROP item
then we obviously won&#146;t disallow you a chance at the item. </p>

<p>***Please be aware that the item that you may be replacing is then the property of the
Guild - which means then it is offered to those on the raid, randomed if necessary and
banked if not. (That usually answers it for me. =)*** </p>

<p>4. Have you won anything in a previous random for this raid that is of the SAME
CATEGORY (please see below for descriptions of categories)?<br>
If you can answer &#147;Yes&#148; to the first 3 questions, and &#145;No&#146; to the
fourth then you qualify to roll for this item. </p>

<p>General Loot Randoms<br>
If something drops that is equipable and not &#145;No Drop&#146; that is not wanted by
anyone who can wear it (class/race/deity) it then becomes open to whomever wants it. This
is a different category than the others in so far as if you win something in this
category, you do not forfeit the right to random in another category. </p>

<p>The Quest Item Drop<br>
These are items that are used in Quests. These items are ONLY for the character you are
using on THIS RAID ONLY. Not for alts. Preference will be given to those who are actively
working on that particular Quest over those who maybe, one day, if they have the time
might give it a go. </p>

<p>Here is a suggestion that will help everyone. If there is a specific Quest Item that
may drop in the zone or from a mob, you may request ahead of time that you receive it IF
it drops. This should not distract from the GOAL of the raid, unless the Raid
Leader/Organizer agrees to make a join raid effort to get both items. However if it is
known that you need &#145;X&#146; item for the quest you are trying to complete, it will
be an easy thing to decide who has first dibs on item &#145;X&#148; when it drops. </p>

<p>Gems and Cash Loot<br>
This will be included in the &#145;Raid Policy&#146; but reinforced here as well. If you
use any components in this raid, please give the Raid Leader a list of total components
used and a cash equivalent. The Raid Leader may choose to reimburse by paying the amount
or replacing the items. This will occur at the end of the raid, or when the person has to
leave the raid. </p>

<p>***Please note that the person who is running the LOOT aspect of the raid will NOT be
responsible for keeping track of how many components that you use. YOU are responsible for
keeping track of what is used during the raid and will only be compensated if you /tell
the person in charge of the loot. Do not assume that they will hand you any amount UNTIL
you request it and ONLY at the time you leave and/or end of raid. Another consideration is
that if you leave before the end of the raid and there are not sufficient funds to pay you
for the components you have used, it is your responsibility to tell us how much, and we
will get it to you in the next few days or reasonable time period. I will make every
effort to ensure that you will be paid. </p>

<p>Special considerations can be made for those who don't have the plat upfront to pay for
reagents. If that is the case, please post to the raid thread aproximately how much you
will require of a particular item and it will be bought by the Banking Officer. Any
reagents left over will be returned to the Banking Officer and stored in the Bank for
future Raids. </p>

<p>Gems<br>
Cash Gems &#150; will be used to pay the Clerics (Peridots), Mages (Pearls), Wizards
(Fragments) and Enchanters (Runes) for their components. The balance will be given to the
Guild bank to pay for future raids. <br>
Quest Gems &#150; given to the bank and handed out as needed on an individual basis. </p>

<p>Cash Loot<br>
-Lowbie Armour, cash loot (items that have no other purpose other than to sell to vendors
i.e. Silver Earrings), etc will be then sold and put into the Sunrunner Bank for future
raids or to pay for Components of the raid it dropped in. </p>

<p>The Roll<br>
The ML will call out that he/she will random the Item. After determining that you qualify
for the item, submit your name ONCE to the ML. Spamming the ML with your name is frowned
upon. The ML&#146;s responsibility is to take the names as they are received and post a
message to the Raid Channel. It should read something like this; </p>

<p>Raid chat: Lanaren says &#147;Random for &#147;Linked Uber Item&#148; &#150; please
send tells if you qualify for this item. </p>

<p>ONE MINUTE PASSES<br>
Raid chat: Lanaren says &#147;Random for &#147;Linked Uber Item&#148;: Kegulik &#150;1,
Damurtil &#150; 2, Lanaren &#150; 3, GOING ONCE! </p>

<p>ONE MINUTE PASSES<br>
Raid chat: Lanaren says &#147;Random for &#147;Linked Uber Item&#148;: Kegulik &#150;1,
Damurtil &#150; 2, Lanaren &#150; 3 Quinanne - 4, GOING TWICE!!<br>
ONE MINUTE PASSES </p>

<p>Raid chat: Lanaren says &#147;Random for &#147;Linked Uber Item&#148;: Kegulik &#150;1,
Damurtil &#150; 2, Lanaren &#150; 3 Quinanne - 4, RANDOMING!!! </p>

<p>Lanaren picks a random number between 1 and 4, and the number is 3! </p>

<p>Lanaren keeps the Uber Item for herself =) </p>

<p>Punctuality<br>
We want to reward those who are punctual (i.e. early) for the raid &#150; however if you
are late for any reason and it was not specified on the raid thread before the raid
started &#150; you will NOT be eligible for loot rolls for 30 minutes after you arrived,
are in a group and actively participating in the raid. <br>
If you post on the Board prior to the Raid start time that you will be late due to , this
rule does not apply to you. </p>

<p>Point System for &#147;NO DROP&#148; items in BANK. </p>

<p>Each &#147;Official&#148; Sunrunner raid will be worth &#147;X&#148; amount of points,
varying on difficulty and length of raid. The point value of the raid will be determined
ahead of time by Krrak and the 2 Raid Officers. If you are able to stay a minimum amount
of time (again, will be posted ahead of time on the raid board) you will be given these
Raid Points for later use. You can save them for as long as you want, and they never
expire. They can be taken away in the case of severe disciplinary actions &#150; but that
is described in the &#147;Disciplinary Policy&#148;. These points will be tracked by the
Guild Secretary and posted on the Guild Bank forum as well. </p>

<p>The purpose of these points is to be able to &#145;buy&#146; the rights to chain quest
an item that is being held by the Bank that dropped from a previous raid that you might
not have been on. The points are to show that you have put in time on other raids that has
benefited the guild. Each item in the bank that is NO DROP that can be chain quested will
have a point value assigned to it and will be posted on the Guild Bank Forum on the board.
The point value will be determine by the Officer Cadre and Krrak. </p>

<p>If a NO DROP Item comes up in a raid that you are on AND you qualify for it, just enter
the random &#150; no points are needed to be spent at this time. </p>

<p>Miscellaneous Rules and Clarifications<br>
1. If you won an item from a specific category, and another item drops that is an even
better upgrade, then you can opt to hand that item in and be eligible for the
&#145;better&#146; item. Obviously this only works on items that are not &#145;No
Drop&#146;. If you win that second item (you lucky devil you) the first item you won will
be then immediately randomed off following the above rules. If you lose the second random,
you get to keep the first item that you won. </p>

<p>2. If a NO DROP item drops, and no one can use it at that time, one of the officers
will loot the item to be chain quested at another time. </p>

<p>3. If a NO DROP items drops that no one will use (highly unlikely) and will be left to
rot, it will be left to the zone and called out in OOC. (i.e. An Shadow Knight only Sword
that is NO DROP and we have no SK&#146;s with us on the raid. </p>

<p>These Loot Rules are subject to change, and can be superceded by the Leader of the
Guild at his/her discretion. It is the responsibility of each Full Status Guild Member to
know these rules before participating in an OFFICAL Sunrunner Raid. Ignorance is not an
excuse. </p>

<hr>

<p></font><strong><font size="5">4.0 Raid Points</font></strong><font
face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font></p>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

<p>&#149; The points are awarded to the *Player*, not the individual character. <br>
i.e. Many of us have alts &#150; if Lanaren has gone to 6 raids, and has accrued 7 raid
points, if she wishes to spend those points buying weapons for her level 27 Dark Elf
Warrior Ringtayl Racoon, she may request those weapons that are in the bank and have it
logged in the Bank Forum. </p>

<p>&#149; Players will get a Raid Point(s) when they are at an Official Raid, and have
been ON SITE OF RAID for 3 hours or ¾ of the total duration. The Guild Secretary or
designated Looter of the raid will keep track of this and forward to the Guild Secretary
via Bank Forum within 24 hours of the end of the raid. </p>

<p>&#149; If a person has an alt in another guild, as well as a character in the
Sunrunners, and that non-guilded character has been requested to be at an Official Raid to
aid us in achieving our goal, they may acquire Raid Points to be used and spent on the
character that is guilded only.<br>
I.e. Mindert/Rayel &#150; Mindert (level 53 monk) is Sunrunner, and Rayel is CE. We
request that Rayel be present to Coth our groups into the Arena and provide her services
as a 63 mage to help ensure the safety of the raid and the people involved. Rayel will
then garner Raid Points that can be used on Mindert *only*. Rayel may also partake in the
randoms on drops that occur on the raid because she was specifically requested to be there
(i.e. invited) by a Raid Officer or Leader of the Guild. If Rayel did NOT have any
Characters in the guild, she would only have random rights at that particular raid
provided she was invited by a Guild Officer. </p>

<p>&#149; Characters that do not have a Sunrunner Guild tag, yet volunteer to go on the
raid will not have loot rights unless all FGM&#146;s and invited guests have declined
their need for that item. The only non-Guilded characters that will get looting/randoming
rights on an Official Raid must have the explicit permission/invitation by the Guild
Leader, Raid Officers, and or Raid Leader. </p>

<p>&#149; Raid Points will be updated within 48 hours of the end of the Raid. </p>

<p>&#149; To redeem Raid Points, please post to the Bank Forum the item that you need.
First come first served. If you are not aware of what is available on the Bank Forum then
you have not visited the board in the last week. The Bank will be updated weekly. Online
requests cannot be taken &#150; in the interest of fairness, please post your need on the
bank forum. <br>
Here is an example&#133;<br>
Kvala wins a piece of Thurg armur and needs the quest gems in the bank. Kvala and Lanaren
are both online. </p>

<p>Kvala /tells Lanaren: Hey! I need 3 Crushed Nephrites &#150; do we have them?<br>
Lanaren /replies : Yup we do! Let&#146;s log and go to the Bank Forum and make it
official. When I see your post, I will grant it providing no other FGM has requested it. </p>

<p>Kvala and Lanaren both log, make the appropriate request and confirm, log back on, run
to the Bazaar and Lanaren hands over the gems. DONE. </font></p>
