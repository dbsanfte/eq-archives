        <br>
        <br>
        Having just passed my 31st winter and at the urging of my constant companion Mindert Ong, the fearless Monk, I decided to explore
        the twisted hallways of the Evil Sarnak Fortress. Now being a little wiser than my headstrong companion of many seasons I enlisted the aid<br>
        of that ferocious warrior Spraticus Hurtya, a fellow barbarian of 31 winters as well.<br>
        <br>
        Entering the Lake of Ill Omen from the Frontier Mountains we made a quick turn to the south and quickly came upon the evil edifice.
        I could see now why this land was know as the Lake of Ill Omen. An uneasy feeling came over me as we crouched beneath the bridge to make<br>
        our plans, the oppressive air and twisted plants weighed heavily upon me. It was decided that until we knew how the denizens of this fortress
        would react to our presence that we would entice the large reptilian Sarnaks to come out to us.<br>
        <br>
        Now having been a Shaman for 31 winters I had grown used to Mindert's constant requests to prepare him fully for conflict. Let us
        just say that it quickly becomes taxing when you have two "Pets" to prepare. So since the two beasts guarding the entrance to this vile
        fortress appeared to be rather insignificant I let Mindert coerce them into range and promptly bound one to the earth and then sat down to
        allow my mystical energy to replenish itself. Well that first battle<br>
        was hardly worthy of being called that, Spraticus nearly destroyed the first beast before Mindert could turn to help him and the two of them
        together quickly made short work of the second.<br>
        <br>
        After pulling a few Sarnaks from the fortress Spraticus quickly became eager for more since these beasts had an annoying habit of dying
        all to quickly (I failed to see the problem here). Mindert mentioned that there were rooms within the fortress that we could easily set up<br>
        in to continue our purging of these beasts from. So upon entering the fortress we quickly turned right and headed down a long corridor to a
        large room with nothing of note in it. It was perfect. There were no beasts within it and it had only one entrance. Spraticus and I quickly
        took our places and Mindert proceeded to begin pulling Sarnaks to their demise.<br>
        <br>
        Things were proceeding quite well, and in retrospect I should have realized, too well. It happened while Mindert was out pulling a
        beast and I was meditating to regain my lost mana. I was struck from behind by one of those foul Sarnaks. It appeared as if we had set up
        camp in one of thier spawning rooms. Spraticus quickly came to my rescue shouting for Mindert to return just as Mindert shouted those
        soon to become ominous words: "Incomming". Well we've had more difficult
        problems to deal with in the past, we could handle this one as well. I quickly began casting a spell that would put quicksilver into
        Spraticus's blood when what should happen but that I am struck from behind again. Well fortunately my ability was such that I could continue<br>
        my spell and Spraticus began to move like a whirlwind. I quickly turned to face the beast that would dare to strike me from behind and
        proceeded to bind him to the earth. Just in time as Mindert returned with his Sarnak in tow. I quickly cast a spell to poison the beast and<br>
        draw it out of the combat that Mindert joined with Spraticus. As soon as the beast had left their range I bound it's feet to earth as well
        and positioned myself away from both of them. Quickly casting my spell to add even more speed to Mindert's already naturally hastened attack I<br>
        stepped back to watch the battle unfold. Now it appears that these Sarnaks were not like the previous ones we had fought. These were
        stronger and tougher. Although the damage it was dealing out was not to great I chose to cast my spell of regeneration upon both Spraticus and<br>
        Mindert so that they would be fresh for the remaining two beasts. After doing this and healing both men I realized that I was quickly running
        out of mana, so I proceeded to begin converting my health into mana so that I may better aid my companions. Of course never taking my eyes off
        the two remaining beasts who whimpered in frustration at being unable to join battle with their doomed brother. After a few harried moments
        when one managed to break free of it's bonds my two heroes effectively and efficiently destroyed the two remaining beasts.<br>
        <br>
        Sitting down to meditate while my two companions regenerated their health we resolved to be a little more careful a a lot more
        aware. As soon as I had recovered my mana Mindert set out once again to pull another hapless Sarnak to its doom. Suddenly I felt mystical
        energies being focused upon me, something was trying to bind me to the earth. I quickly stood up and searched for the offending caster and
        upon seeing nothing I turned to Spraticus to inform him what was<br>
        happening. Before I could utter a word Spraticus lept to his feet with a roar. Swinging his massive executioners axe he lept passed me to
        clash with the Sarnak that had jumped through the wall to attack me from behind. Shouting for Mindert to return just as another appeared<br>
        through the wall on the opposite side of the room and just as Mindert shouted, yes you guessed it, INCOMMING. Again I quickly bound the beast
        within the room to the floor and waited for Mindert to bring his. With the ferocity of Spraticus's attack the first beast was nearly dead<br>
        before Mindert's return which allowed us to make short work of the remaining two.
        <br>
        <br>
        Once again we rested, when what should happen but that a Sarnak comes wandering in to it's doom. I almost felt sorry for the beast,
        almost. When again my mana was replenished Mindert set out again to find a Sarnak to destroy. We heard the cry of INCOMMING and prepared<br>
        ourselves for battle. Imagine our surprise when the first thing through the doorway was not Mindert but a Sarnak. Making short work of this one
        as Mindert was returning with his in tow Spraticus and I decided to have words with Mindert about his pulling strategy. Quickly dispatching
        this last beast we turned to Mindert to have 'words' with him when we observed a most amazing thing. Appearing out of nowhere in the middle
        of the long hallway leading to our room was a Sarnak. It quickly turned and ran straight down the hallway right at me. It was then that we
        began to realize that these beasts had some inbred racial hatred of healers. Mindert turned to me and said "You know. I really don't have to
        pull at all. Just cast a healing spell on me and we should be able to empty the fortress." Realizing that this was not feasible we decided to
        call this battle a draw and retreat to camp and return another day.<br>
