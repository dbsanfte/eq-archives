        </b>
        <p><font size="3">This is a short little anecdote for all you monks out
        there who wondered at the reason you cannot fight all that well wearing
        your Warrior friends suit of Plate. This is also a warning for anyone
        who would be a Smith.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Remember our intelligent little friend Mindert? Well
        one day while practicing the manly art of sewing he realized that the
        raw silk he was working on had become too easy. (But still quite
        comfortable, and cool). Mindert deduced that he must find new challenges
        to his Tailoring abilities so he asked around. He was told that he
        should try working leather again, but in order to improve his skills he
        must concentrate on not Tattering his pieces like he used to. Now
        Mindert, being a bright sort deduced that if he started off with a
        higher quality pelt then he would get a better looking result, but why
        would someone pay for something that did not function better, something
        that only looked better.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Again Mindert asked around and this time he found out
        that if he added metal studs to his pieces, then people would start to
        pay the higher fees that he would have to charge. Problem solved right?
        ….Yea right!…. Mindert being a rather impatient fellow went looking
        for someplace to purchase these metal studs and found quickly that the
        price for the studs was about the same as the price for the finished
        pieces. &quot;No problem&quot; he said, &quot;I will make them
        myself&quot; he said, &quot;It cant be that hard. There only little
        pieces of metal&quot; he said. ….Yea Right!…..</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">So after some research Mindert found the Ore shop in
        North Freeport and started making metal bits….. and metal bits…..
        and metal bits….. and metal bits….. and metal bits….. Now you must
        understand this is the most attention he had ever paid to anything in
        his life. This was progress. Remember when I told a long time ago that
        Mindert is a little impatient? Well guess what? Mindert had been told a
        number of ways to get better at smithing really fast. One of the ways
        was to make metal sheets. No problem! Metal sheets are made using 2
        blocks of ore. No problem!</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Mindert went to his ore shop in North Freeport and
        filled 3 backpacks with blocks of ore. At great expense I might add. He
        then set out to forge metal sheets. …. He then set out to forge ……
        He then set ……. &quot;HEY ?!? Why am I not moving ?!?!?&quot; The
        cry was heard across the zone. It took mindert a good 5 min to realize
        that he couldn’t pick up any of his packs! He looked at his total
        weight. 327 ?!?!? &quot;How do I fix this one?&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">For those of you who have ever sold anything BACK to a
        merchant, you know that they are the most ruthless business people alive
        ! When Mindert finally left the shop he had one pack full of ore and
        considerably less money than when he went in! He then proceeded to the
        forge, failed all 4 attempts to make a metal sheet and promptly went
        back to making metal bits………….</font></p>
