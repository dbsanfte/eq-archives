<p align="center"><b>Lord of the Periodicals:</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>The Return of the News</b></p>
</font>

<font face="Times New Roman">

<p align="left"><b>The Sunrunner News </b>&nbsp;took a long sabbatical from reporting 
due to the <b>SRN's </b>chief reporter being otherwise occupied.</p>

<p align="left">But, without further ado, we bring you today's story.</p>

<p align="left">Last night <b>The Sunrunners </b>&nbsp;launched an all out 
assault on the <b>Named Giants</b> in <b>The Plane of Storms</b>, in search of 
Medallions, Beards, and Sashes so that <b>The Sunrunners </b>&nbsp;could begin 
fashioning their <b>Bastion of Thunder </b>keys.</p>

<p align="left">The troops gathered by the wrecked ships in the harbor, then 
proceeded west, and setup camp near the <b>Ocean Giants </b>fortress. Straws 
were drawn to see who would be the fitting sacrif... err... brave soul to 
venture into the fortress, annoy the named Giant, and then haul ass outside with 
Giants in tow. <b>Cynari</b> got the short straw.</p>

<p align="left">&quot;It was basically down to <b>Krrak, </b>and myself for the 
pulling job,&quot; she stated. &quot;I tell you, I have to remember to not let <b>Krrak</b> 
hold the straws next time. I tried pulling one, and he wouldn't let go. I 
pulled, and pulled, to no avail,&quot; the exasperated Ranger said, &quot;so I switched to 
the other one, and it slid out quite easily. Now, I am not saying there was foul 
play involved here, *cough*<font size="1">bullshit</font>*cough* but I 
definitely ended up with the shortest straw.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><b>The Sunrunner News </b>approached <b>Krrak </b>for his take 
on the events of the draw.</p>

<p align="left">&quot;I have no idea what your talking about,&quot; hissed the Iksar. 
&quot;That draw was fair and square. She pulled the short straw, and that's that,&quot; he 
said with finality.</p>

<p align="left">&quot;But what about the un-released first straw?&quot; we asked.</p>

<p align="left">&quot;Hey, it's not my fault if the straw got caught on one of my 
scales, and the <b>Rangah</b> could not get it out&quot; he snapped. </p>

<p align="left">Deftly changing the subject, he then said, &quot;Besides, I am pretty 
sure <b>Cynari </b>used to be a man yo. Look at those hands. Come to think of 
it, we used to have a <b>Rangah </b>
</font>

in the guild by the name of <b>Trevalyn, </b>that I haven't seen in a while... 
Hmmm very intriguing indeed,&quot; he pondered, rubbing a claw along his scaled chin.</p>

<p align="left">But back to the event at hand. <b>Cynari </b>successfully ran 
into the fort and pulled out the <b>Giants</b>. Visiting members of <b>Drowned 
Legion</b> were in attendance to lend a helping hand for the event, and the 
mighty Barbarian <b>Arzul </b>tagged the named <b>Giant </b>as <b>Cynari</b> ran 
it past the raid party.</p>

<p align="left">The beat down ensued.</p>

<p align="left">After the dust settled, and numerous <b>Rezzes</b> provided by
<b>Kvala</b>, <b>Two </b>named <b>Giants </b>were down, and there was much loot 
for all. </p>

<p align="left"><b>Spectral, and Ethereal Parchments, </b>a <b>Waning Light 
Katar, </b>not to mention the 6 <b>Medallions.</b></p>

<p align="left">Of the eight members in need of pieces, only <b>Naliel, </b>and
<b>Kvala</b> were left without a <b>Medallion.</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>&quot;</b>I got screwed by the man!&quot; yelled the irate Wizard <b>
Naliel. &quot;</b>I get the killshot on both <b>Giants</b> and I get nada for the 
effort?&nbsp; We'll see what happens at the Forest <b>Giants</b> then...we'll 
see.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><b>Naliel</b> then wandered off to find some small woodland 
creatures, on a nice grassy knoll looking all calm, peaceful, and serene, so she 
could tactically <b>Sunstrike </b>the hilltop and it's furry denizens to 
oblivion.</p>

<p align="left">Twice.</p>

<p align="left">The intrepid band of adventurers proceeded to the Forest <b>
Giant </b>area and proceeded to buff up for the next encounters. The visiting <b>
Drowned Legion</b> members had to depart for a previous engagement, but 
thankfully for <b>The Sunrunners, </b>the newly crowned <b>Lord Bor, </b>made 
his arrival on the scene.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Kvala </b>continued buffing those that fell during the 
previous encounters, and once completed, the first <b>Named Giant </b>appeared.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Lord Bor </b>rushed into battle, spittle flying everywhere, 
and took it to the <b>Giant.</b></p>

<p align="left">And since <b>Kvala </b>had just finished buffing, and had no 
mana, <b>Lord Bor </b>was quickly ground under the <b>Giant's </b>heal. </p>

<p align="left">You could hear <b>The Bor's </b>maniacal laughter all the way 
from <b>The Plane of Knowledge.</b></p>

<p align="left">The rest of the group managed to drop the overbearing <b>Giant,
</b>thanks in no small part to the <b>chain-casting </b>Wizard <b>Naliel, </b>
who hit the <b>Giant </b>no less than <b>nine </b>times with a well 
practiced, <b>Sunstrike.</b></p>

<p align="left">Rezzes were completed, and a second attempt was made, with much 
better results.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Two </b>more Named <b>Giants </b>went down, with <b>
Medallions </b>and <b>Parchment </b>for many...</p>

<p align="left">Just not <b>Naliel </b>and <b>Kvala.</b></p>

<p align="left">&quot;It's a conspiracy I tell you!&quot; she ranted. &quot;What are the odds? 
1 in 10? Aaaagh!&quot; </p>

<p align="left">She then stomped off once again, this time in search of strong 
drink.</p>

<p align="left">...And small woodland creatures.</p>

<p align="left">...On a grassy knoll.</p>

<p align="left">...Sitting all calm.</p>

<p align="left">...Serene.</p>

<p align="left">...Innocent</p>

<p align="left">...Furry</p>

<p align="left">...Cuddly</p>

<p align="left">...Bar-b-qued.</p>

<p align="left">Mmmm bar-b-que...</p>

</font>

<p align="left"><b>The Sunrunners </b>made their promised return to <b>Kael</b> 
to call out the mighty <b>Derakor the Vindicator.</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>The Sunrunner News </b>ventured into the Arena to track down 
any survivors in the Giant camp to se ehow they were getting about with the <b>
Vindicator. </b></p>
<p align="left">As <i><b>TSrN</b></i> strode up past the Guardians of Zek, we 
found what we were looking for. However Derakor was unusually active for a 
corpse.</p>
<p align="left"><b><i>TSrN </i></b>asked the visibly intoxicated <b>Derakor</b> 
what was up with his verticality. </p>
<p align="left">&quot;Welp. Lemme tell you a shtory 'bout a Giant and thish group of 
guys called <b>Sunrunners,&quot; </b>the giant slurred.</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Ya shee *hic*. This lizard thing, was all like 'we're gonna 
kick yer assh,' and I was like 'Nyuhuh', and he was *hic* all like' Uhuh', and 
the GoZs were all ' Nyuhuh'. Ya know? So me an' the boys here and came up with a 
good stratergy and we showed them who's bossh. Wanna shee?&quot;</p>
<p align="left">The immense Giant then belched, caught the whole lot, chunks and 
all, in his cheeks, and blew me a little sample.</p>
<p align="left">Let me say this before we continue. After being found downwind 
from that belch, I can see why <b>The Sunrunners </b>apparently failed in their 
attempts to defeat <b>The Vindicator.</b> Biological weapons were outlawed years 
ago by the Council of the Rathe. Luckily for me, he only gave me a sample of his 
eruption.</p>
<p align="left">With the pile of enormous kegs growing behind them, the Giants 
all joined in for a chorus of 'Who let the GoZs out' before promptly passing 
out.</p>
<p align="left">&quot;So ya shee, them <b>Runners </b>can com back anytime, as long 
as they bring lotsa hootch for me and the boysh here, so we can celebrate after 
we wipe the floors with em again.&quot; said <b>Vindi.</b> He then tossed back the 
remainder of his Whisky keg, and with beer goggles intact, wandered off to find 
a suitable companion for the evening.</p>
<p align="left">The sad thing is, I have never seen a female Giant in Kael...</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Sunrunner News </b>leaves this bit of advice to the 
Giants of Kael Drakkal. </p>
<p align="left">Invest in some soap on a rope boys. </p>
<p align="left">There's a party in the shower room, and <b>The Vindicator's </b>
coming.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Sunrunners Invade</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>Halls of Testing</b></p>
</font>

<p align="left"><b>The Sunrunners </b>conducted another <b>Dragonkin </b>hunt in 
the Temple of Veeshan last week. The intrepid group, lead once again by 
Grandmaster <b>Krrak D'Bonzz, </b>entered the <b>Halls of Testing </b>intent on 
clearing out some <b>Dragonkin </b>criminals, making room in the overly crowded 
prison area.</p>

<p align="left">&quot;Like any prison, there is over crowding problems,&quot; quoted <b>
General V'Deers. &quot;The Sunrunners </b><i>seemed</i> to be doing a service to the
<b>Claws of Veeshan, </b>although they were seen carrying out some pretty hefty 
bags of <i>phat lewts</i><b><i>, </i></b>so we are not ruling out robbery,<b><i>&quot;</i>
</b>the <b>General </b>said, &quot;we are also&nbsp; still looking into their 
apparent connection to a recent sex-crime slaying in the <b>Skyfire Mountains,
</b>and then the assassination of the entire<b> Royal Family</b> in the city of
<b>Chardok.&quot;</b></p>

<p align="left">When asked whether or not any charges were going to be laid in 
the cases of these recent crimes, <b>V'Deers </b>only replied that &quot;we are 
watching <b>The Sunrunners,</b> and once enough irrefutable evidence has been 
gathered, we will indeed see that those guilty are punished. No crimal group is 
going to wreck havoc on the peace loving peo... Hey! What in Innoruuk's name do 
you think you're doing? Jobober! Back off! I said BACK OFF!&quot;</p>

<p align="left">It seems the <b>General's</b> pet has gone 'mini-me' on one of 
the <b>Overthere Outpost Golems, &quot;</b>Stop it this instant! Where's my garden 
hose? Jobober! Back the hell off! Don't make me come over there!&quot;</p>

<p align="left">Very odd behavior for a Shadow Knights pet for certain. </p>

<p align="left"><b>V'Deers </b>stomped off in the direction of his randy pet, 
only turning back long enough to say,<b> &quot;</b>you will have to please excuse me, 
as my pet is doing something irretrievably stupid and needs some re-education.&quot;</p>

<p align="left">It seems the interview with Norath's chief investigator has been 
cut short. It does indeed seem that the Norathian police are watching out for <b>
The Sunrunners, </b>and are waiting for the right moment, and the right 
evidence, to put a close on these cases.</p>

<p align="left">&quot;Last chance you obtuse waste of bone chips! I swear it! Oh you 
didn't just flip me off! You did NOT just flip me... Oh! Again! Is that how it 
is going to be bitch!&quot; </p>

<p align="left"><b>General V'Deers </b>then <b>Harm Touched</b> his pet for an 
obscene amount of damage.</p>

<p align="left">It would appear that one does not mouth off to the <b>General.</b></p>

<p align="left">In other news, several <b>Sunrunners </b>were seen with some 
oddly unadorned armor bits recently.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Talci</b> was spotted trying to work the grime out of her <b>
Plate Leggings</b>, <b>Vidomina </b>was doing the same to <b>Plate Bracer, </b>
while <b>Kvala</b>, looking highly suspicious, was stuffing a pair of what 
looked like <b>Plate Boots, </b>hurriedly into a bag before scampering off to do 
something evil.</p>

<p align="left">The mighty Battle Wizard <b>Thran</b> was proudly displaying his 
new <b>Silk Panties. The Sunrunner News </b>questioned <b>Thran </b>about his 
rather, revealing garment. </p>

<p align="left">&quot;They get turned into a pair of Pantaloons! I swear! They are 
for, umm... my girlfriend... yeah... girlfriend. That's the ticket. All man 
here. Yup. Nothing effeminate about <b>Thran! </b>No siree bob!&quot; He then quickly 
stuffed the nearly thread-bare undies into his pocket, and wandered off in a 
most disheveled state, nervously whistling the opening number from 'A Chorus 
Line'.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Gahris </b>&nbsp;seemd most pleased with his haul. Having 
netted not only a pair of <b>Plate Leggings, </b>a<b> Plate Bracer, </b>not to 
mention the <b>Hand of the Maestro!</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>The Sunrunners </b>organized a raid to <b>The City of Mist</b> 
with intent on instructing <b>Lord Rak'Ashiir </b>in the ways of humility, <b>
Sunrunner </b>style!</p>
<p align="left">The band of hearty adventurers quickly amassed in the <b>Emerald 
Jungle</b> and divided up into groups. Once inside the city, they quickly made 
short work of the living challenged denizens of this haunted city.</p>
<p align="left">Upon arriving at the doors to the throne room, the <b>Runners
</b>decided that pulling one critter at a time was a waste of time and energy, 
and proceeded to lay waste to horde after horde of undead beasty heiney. Special 
thanks go to <b>Mystah </b>for providing the lock pickin abilities! With out <b>
Mystah's</b> skills, <b>The Sunrunners </b>would not have been able to 
accomplish the evenings activities!</p>
<p align="left">After clearing the throne room, <b>Krrak </b>&nbsp;zipped off to 
find <b>Lord Rak'Ashiir </b>himself, and bring his floating translucent self to 
school. <b>Lanaren </b>issued the first lesson, which seemed to enrage the 
spectral Lord. He attacked, and suddenly, the battle was joined by all those in 
attendance. The battle was long and hard, with several <b>Sunrunners </b>falling 
to the searing area of effect flame blasts issued by<b> Rak'Ashiir.</b> </p>
<p align="left">Unfortunately for their quarry,<b> The Sunrunners</b>&nbsp; put 
down the floating giant, and proceeded to frisk him for phat lewts. <b>Lanaren
</b>picked up <b>The Scale of Rak'Ashiir's Father</b>, and then proceeded out to 
the spirit in <b>The Emerald Jungle</b>, who in turn, after a lengthy 
conversation,&nbsp; handed her back <b>
<a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=748">The Spear of 
Fate</a>!</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Congratulations go out to Lanaren!</b></p>
<p align="left">Several other items were acquired for other<b> Sunrunner Epic 
Quests.</b> <b>Neh'Ashiir </b>dropped a piece for the Enchanter Epic, and a Jade 
Reaver was looted for a lucky Druid or Ranger. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Sunrunner News </b>approached the ecstatic Barbarian, to 
see if we could get some comments.</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Wow. It's so pretty. And glowy. With feathers and stuff.&quot; she 
mumbled. Her speech trailing off, while she became apparently transfixed by the 
glow from the spear. </p>
<p align="left">While this blind cave fish stare&nbsp; is intriguing and all, a 
quick snapping of the fingers seemed to bring her back. That's right <b>Lana...</b> 
stay with us... Look <u>away</u> from the shiney. <u>Awaaaay</u>. Focus. Focus. 
No, higher. That's my cleavage... There you go, eye contact. No, no, no... Put 
the shiney thing away... Don't look at ... Bah...</p>
<p align="left">...Apparently, <b>Lanaren </b>is a little preoccupied with her 
new toy to comment further.</p>
<p align="left">In other news, the printing presses at <b>The Sunrunner News</b></font>

were down for several days. Sources inside <b>The Sunrunner News</b> seem to 
indicate the presence of a pale figure seen hanging from the rafters may have 
been throwing shoes into the presses. </p>
<p align="left">&quot;We keep seeing the pale bald head of some oddly shaped kid 
zipping around the rafters and throwing things&quot; the distraught worker claimed. 
&quot;[As] soon as we turn to get a better look, it darts back amongst the

<p align="left"><b>The Sunrunners </b>made a most triumphant return to <b>The 
Arena </b>in <b>Kael Drakkal </b>this week. They were all like &quot;<b>Whoa&quot;, </b>
then they were like <b>&quot;WHOA&quot;</b>, and then they were like &quot;<b>whoa&quot;. </b></p>
<p align="left">It was <b>Sweet, Dude. </b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Totally.</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>The Sunrunners</b> broke into <b>The Arena</b> with little 
difficulty.  Rawrr.</p>
<p align="left">When the <b>Giants</b> decided that they were less than 
thrilled with this invasion of their home city, they took matters into their own 
hands to extradite this <b>Mötley Crüe </b>from their halls. It was the<b> <i>
Same Ol' Situation</i></b> as always, with the melee crew led by<b> Krrak</b> 
and the boys, laughing at <b><i>Danger</i>, </b>while doing the <i><b>
Rattlesnake Shake</b></i> all over a the Giants.<b> </b>They were <b><i>Droppin' 
Like Flies</i>. The Sunrunners </b>were <i><b>Hotter Than Hell... Red Hot</b></i>, 
one could say. <b><i>Dr. Feelgood</i>, </b>wouldn't have had a better time.</p>
<p align="left">The melees and casters were doing such a <i><b>Sticky Sweet</b></i> 
job of being <b><i>So Good, So Bad</i>, </b>that the <b><i>Monstrous</i> </b>ass 
whooping they supplied, made the <b><i>Mood Ring</i> </b>worn by one giants turn 
way blue. Serious depression going on in Giant land. The Clerics had so little 
to do, that <b>Tieannie,&nbsp; </b>&nbsp;Successfully healed the <b>Entire</b> 
raid, whilst <b>Kvala, </b>sat in her <b><a href="http://www.kvalas-corner.ca">
Corner</a> </b>and drooled on herself.</p>
<p align="left"><b>&quot;The Sunrunners </b>were treating us like a bunch of <b>
<i>Girls, Girls, Girls</i>,&quot; </b>reported a <b>Guardian of Zek. &quot;</b>We were 
mounting a defense like we were <b><i>Five Years Dead</i>. </b>It was like they 
were getting <b><i>Sumthin' for Nothin'</i>. </b>The <b>Guardian of Zek</b> did 
have some promises for <b>The Sunrunners. &quot;</b>I was just speaking with <b>
Derakor the Vindicator. </b>And with his guidance and <i><b>Friends</b></i>, we 
are gonna make this last victory of theirs <b><i>Bittersuite</i>.</b> It will be 
the last one they get!&quot; </p>
<p align="left">&quot;Strong words from a group that had members yelling out for a 
medic to <b><i>Kickstart my Heart</i>.&quot;</b> hissed <b>Krrak</b>, as he bellied 
up to the <b>GoZ.</b></p>
<p align="left">&quot;Hey! Send this message to <b>Vindi! </b>Nice threat! <b>The

baby... Oh yeah. She does!&quot; <b>Krrak</b> was positively shaking with rage, 
stomping his feet, and swinging his tail, knocking just about everything in the 
room over.</p>
<p align="left">With that, the <b>GoZ </b>gave a loud chuckle, and turned to 
leave. &quot;We shall see, puny Iksar.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Thats right!<i><b> Don't go Away Mad (Just go Away)</b></i><b>&quot;
</b>seethed <b>Krrak</b> at the Giant's back. &quot;There is gonna be <b><i>Terror 'n 
Tinseltown</i> </b>come next week! </p>
<p align="left">&quot;See all this ph4t l3wts? That's right! We got that from you 
and your boys!&quot; hissed Krrak.</p>
<p align="left">And ph4t l3wts there was. So much in fact, that there is nary 
space to include all the pieces that dropped, and who won them. Let's just say 
to <b>The Sunrunners, </b>&quot;there are guilds out there that would have killed for 
a <b><i>Slice of Your Pie</i>.&quot;</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>The Sunrunner News </b>followed <b>Krrak </b>and the <b>
Runners </b>out of <b>Kael, </b>and stayed with them as they prepared to head to 
the <b>Plane of Fear.</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>The Sunrunners </b>gathered in <b>The Feerott </b>just 
outside the gateway to <b>Fear. </b>&nbsp;Having easily dispatched the wandering 
Dry Bones, and Specters that roam the area, they set about making groups, and 
giving out break-in instructions.</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Make sure you head straight <b>north</b>&quot;, bellowed 
Grecoriam, &quot;all we need is for at least <b><i>one</i></b> Cleric to make it to 
the <b>North Camp </b>by the fire wall, set a fire, pitch a tent, make dinner, 
roll out a sleeping bag, and camp out and wait for us to wake them. <b>However,
</b>should any of you other non-Clerics so much as sniff a fart dropped by one 
of the mobs in this zone, stay put, make note of your location, and fall on your 
swords.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">The ensuing grumbling and groaning from the non-Clerics were 
quickly silenced with a glance from the still twitchy <b>Krrak</b>, &quot;Should any 
of you ladies even consider bringing a mob to the camp, I will tie a pink ribbon 
on your head and drag you personally to Cazic-Thule himself!&quot;, the Iksar Guild 
leader then proceeded to find a warm rock to sun himself on and relax.</p>
<p align="left">The time for the break-in came, and it went just as expected.
<b>Everyone </b>died except for the Monks, and <b>Annetoinette</b>, who 
thankfully made it to the <b>North Camp, </b>before camping out.</p>
<p align="left">Whilst<b> Krrak </b>commenced pulling bodies to the camp, he 
was unceremoniously <b>Death Touched</b> by <b>Fright, </b>who by the way lives 
on the <b><i>other side of the zone</i></b>.</p>
<p align="left">On his <b>second</b> run for corpses, having deftly avoided 
all the other mobs in the zone, <b>Krrak </b>managed to grab a few more bodies, 
and drag them to the camp. And then <b>Fright</b> struck again. <b>Death Touch
</b>number two.</p>
<p align="left">Run number three ended with, you guessed it, <b>Death Touch
</b>number three. </p>
<p align="left">Outside <b>Fear</b> in the <b>Feerott</b>, <b>Krrak</b> began 
complaining of a sharp pain, and began walking funny. &quot;It's not like I have 
broken my foot off in anything in there yet. I just feel... <b>violated</b> 
somehow,&quot; he murmured with a wince.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Monorail </b>made several forays into <b>Fear</b> aswell, 
all ending futily. &quot;It is hell in there.&quot; the exasperated, and now naked 
Barbarian exclaimed, &quot;They just tore us apart like animals.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">Attempt number four and five were about as successful. <b>
Death Touch </b>after <b>Death Touch, </b>it became apparent the <b>Fright </b>
just did not care for <b>Krrak.</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Krrak, </b>was then seen changing into a girls sailor 
outfit, &quot;I am sick of it! If I am going to star in a <b>Hentai Tenticle&nbsp;
</b>movie, I might as well look the part,&quot; he snarled on his way back into <b>
Fear. </b></p>
<p align="left"><b>The Sunrunner News, </b>at immense personal risk, 
proceeded over to <b>Cazic-Thule </b>and his minions, <b>Fright</b>,&nbsp; <b>
Terror</b>,&nbsp; and <b>Dread. </b>We asked the God's associates what was up 
with the <b>Death Touches.</b></p>
<p align="left">&quot;It gets kind of&nbsp; lonely up here you know. The boys here 
and I need to feel loved once in a while. And besides, that sneaky Monk, flopped 
past us a while back to go and speak with the boss about an Epic something or 
other. <b>The Faceless </b>here berated us for weeks after that one. We just 
figured it was our time for payback, so we made <b>Krrak </b>our bitch,&quot; stated
<b>Fright.</b></p>
<p align="left">Four hours after they started, <b>The Sunrunners </b>
retreated from <b>The Plane of Fear</b>, vowing to one day soon, return and 
successfully break-in to <b>Fear!</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>The Plane of Sky</b></p>
</font>

<font face="Times New Roman">
<p align="left"><b>The Sunrunners</b> planned a trip to the <b>Plane of Sky</b> 
Wednesday night to locate and challenge <b>Gwan </b>&nbsp;to a fight for <b>
Komodo's</b> <b>Epic</b> piece. Upon arrival, the band of unsung heroes 
immediately lost all of their buffs. Since much mana and time was spent 
pre-buffing, not to mention at least 2 <b>MGB </b>castings, the group was 
understandably downtrodden. Although they quickly regrouped to get fully 
prepared for the coming <b>Faery</b> assault! </p>
<p align="left">Since the <b>Plane of Sky</b> requires complete silence lest one 
angers the planes denizens, several members had wagers concerning who was going 
to speak and have hell rained down on them. Luckily, Aside from the Monks 
feigning death and speaking, no one broke the cardinal rule. Although public 
floggings and ridicule will surely follow if on the next trip to the <b>Plane of 
Sky, </b>there is any of that dead monk talking silliness. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Sunrunners </b>also learned another valuable lesson that 
evening. <b>No illusions. </b>The Necromancer <b>Mozilla</b> was considerately 
twitching our resident <b>Chiropteraphobic </b>Barbarian, <b>Lanaren, </b>when <b>
The Sunrunner </b>learned the lesson of illusions. <b>Mozilla</b> quickly died, 
and since <b>Lanaren </b>had just received a twitch, she was immediately macked 
as well. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Kvala</b> provided the rezzes...</p>
<p align="left">Then the band of adventurers 
set out to locate the <b>Faery</b> look-alikes. This was easily accomplished 
since they were quite happily flitting along, whistling show tunes, and 
discussing drapery. </p>
<p align="left">A few mobs later and everyone was keyed and ready to go. On <b>
Noble Dojorn's</b> island, the group quickly dispatched <b>Gwan </b>&nbsp;and 
retreaved the <b>Epic </b>piece. All could have ended happily, until a voice 
from the back yelled out, &quot;Lets kill the noble. Will be easy.&quot; ...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Kvala</b> provided the rezzes... </p>
<p align="left"> <b>The Sunrunners </b>tried a 
different tactic and successfully defeated the <b>Thunder Spirit Princess, </b>
and <b>Noble Dojorn...</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Kvala</b> provided the rezzes...</p>
<p align="left">(I sense a pattern 
here...) <b>The Sunrunners </b>all proceeded to the edge and took the <b>Nestea 
Plunge </b>into the Ocean of Tears near Freeport.</p>
<p align="left">A big <b>thanks</b> goes out to <b>Tieannie </b>&nbsp;for 
staying alive to rez <b>Kvala!</b></p>

encountered <b>The Swarmlord</b> and several of his minions. The ensuing melee 
was brutal to say the least. Hordes of <b>Netherbians, </b>as well as several <b>

to hop around between the enemies, all while kicking some serious bulbous-headed

<p align="center"><b>The Torgiran Mines</b></p>
</font>

<p align="left"><b>The Sunrunner </b>made a valiant return to <b>The Torgiran 
Mines </b>Thursday evening. Once again, the gallant troop headed off to the 
mines in search of <b>The Overlord. </b>Only this time, they came armed for Bat! 
Most members where either spotted carrying large butterfly nets, or straw 
brooms. Not surprisingly, The Barbarian lass Lanaren, was sporting a sturdy 
looking, odd shaped, black helmet.</p>

<p align="left">&quot;It's a stealth helmet,&quot; she stated, &quot;the material composition 
and odd angles are designed to either absorb, or deflect bat radar signals away 
so the little bastard can't get me again.&quot; </p>

<p align="left">When questioned about her noticable lack of broom or net, she 
simply patted a large, brightly colored club she had strapped to her back. &quot;Oh, 
ya see, I have no intention of catching the little freak. Someone else can do 
that. Once the others have him caught, I am going to introduce him to the Nerf 
Bat, while Krrak and Komodo lay a Kung-Fu style ass-whoopin on him.&quot; </p>

<p align="left">According to reports, the band of adventurers were a little too 
busy searching for the bald headed juvenile, that when they arrived at <b>The 
Overlord's</b> room, they were once again trounced by the Mighty Troll. Although 
he declined to comment, <b>The Overlord</b> did neatly pile up the corpses in 
the entry hall, and wedged a sign in between some Dwarf buttocks, that read <i>
PWNED.</i> Some of the miners later reported hearing <b>The Overlord </b>&nbsp;announce 
a bellowed &quot;<b>DING!&quot; </b>to the entire zone.</p>

pirates, when this little freak fell from the ceiling onto my back, and got all 
tangled in my hair,&quot; the distraught Barbarian reported. &quot;I was yelling for 
someone to <b>'<i>Get it off me! Get it off me!'</i></b> before <b>Krrak</b>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Iksar leader of the <b>

scurrying off. A most disturbing scene to say the least&quot;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unfortunately the group did not 
take this as a warning to not continue, and once they reached the <b>Overlord's</b>

<p align="left">Kunark police were called to the scene of what can only be 
described as a malicious act of violence. Police received a call shortly after 
9pm EST that there was some sort of domestic dispute going on in the <b>Skyfire 
Mountains</b>. Upon arrival, police found the mutilated bodies of a single 
human, as well as a dragon. The human. later identified as <b>Zordak</b> of the
<b>Plasmatic Priesthood</b>, was found stripped of all his clothing and 
equipment, his body left propped in a most indignified position. <b>General 
V'Deers,</b> the senior officer on the scene, reported that &quot;without proper 
forensic testing, and judging from his position, it is apparent that the cause 
of death was a broken neck inflicted during an act of... self-gratification.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">As for the condition of the dragon <b>Zordakalicus Ragefire, 
V'Deers</b> would not give any details of the crime, saying only that the killer 
or killers took a trophy of at least one bodily organ, and that &quot;any further information 
would only hamper our investigation.&quot; <b>V'Deers</b> did indicate that this 
crime scene may be related to a similar incident the week before in <b>Chardok</b>, 
where <b>Overking Bathezid</b> was found murdered in his room by his now 
grieving widow. The Queen managed to chase off the intruders before any more 
harm could be done. The General then stomped off after his pet which was busy 
doing something irretrievably stupid.</p>
<p align="left">In other news, the <b>Norathian Department of Health and 
Sanitation</b> was called to a local tavern in the T<b>imorous Deep Oasis</b> 
when a surly Tier'Dal walked in and slapped a huge heart on the table in front 
of <b>Omat Vastsea</b>. The blood covered Cleric then demanded he &quot;make with t3h 
ph4t l3wts before I air out your skull.&quot; The visibly frightened and intimidated
<b>Vastsea</b>, quickly handed over a small orb to the dark skinned elf, before 
she stomped out of the tavern and headed for the beach. There, witnesses say she 
summoned the <b>Avatar of Water</b>, handed over a pile of orbs, and received a 
flail like item in return, before gating out to an unknown location.</p>
<p align="left">On a lighter note, <b>The Sunrunners</b> have another Cleric 
equipped with <b>The Water Sprinkler of Nem'Ankh</b>! The Cleric<b> Kvala T'Chal</b> is the 
second <b>Sunrunner</b> Priest to receive this item in the last month. The 
details of how this feat is accomplished are very sketchy at best. Rumour has it 
the quest involves bunnies and random acts of kindness, charity, and healing. <b>

<p>Another successful raid, led this time by Strebor. </p>

<p>Notable drops ;<br>
Silk Turban - Cilani<br>
Vellium War Mask - Tsurwolf<br>
Runed Frost Blade - Spraticus </p>

<p>But By far the luckiest Dawg was Komodo who got a Scepter of Mastery and a Silver Belt
of Contention which adds Haste =) WOOT!!! </p>

<p>Some things to remember when considering the success of a raid. </p>

<p>Did it start on time - Yes (amazing=)<br>
Did anyone die - No<br>
Did everyone do their jobs properly? Yes<br>
Did people listen when needed? Yes </p>

<p>Not only did we do all of the above, we cleared the way in record time, got set up in
the Arena and was pulling the entire arena when the left side got taken by another guild -
who promptly wiped out. </p>

<p>It was a fustrating day at Kael for the Plate wearers as Silk after Silk dropped from
the reluctant clutches of the residant Giants. Perhaps they were still sleeping? </p>

<p>The following drops occured and were awarded to... </p>

<p>Silk Turban - Naliel<br>
Silk Turban - Fistandantilus<br>
Silk Gloves - Cilani<br>
Leather Gloves - Exzandra<br>
Chain Gloves - Lanaren </p>

<p>Lanaren traded her gloves to the bank for the chain coif. She is now looking quite
Valkyrian on her dashing new horse and shiny title. But enough about her =) </p>

<p>Exzandra is our latest Up and Coming Druidess who's radiant glow shows that even the
Gods smile down on her slight form. We expect many wonderful things from her =) </p>

<p>Our Silk wearing Casters are looking very fashionable this new year sporting various
peices of Thurgandin Armour. Rumor has it that the Plate and Leather wearing Ones are
quietly waiting...sharpening their swords...for their next chance at the Arena. </p>

<p>Sunrunners group home for wayward Giant Slayers suffers its second setback in as many
weeks.</p>

<p>&quot;It was horrible&quot; one eyewitness exclaimed. &quot;There were Giant parts
flying everywhere&quot; &quot;Bodies were piled 3 and 4 layers deep around every one of
them&quot; &quot;I have never seen such a Giant Slaughter&quot; When asked, the group home
administrator, known only as &quot;Krrak&quot; gave this statement. &quot;We were doing so
well. We set up a Meet and Greet, for the patients to get to know the Giants, and become
better friends because of the exposure. Then in troops this line of Giants with their
fancy armour and shiny things, acting all high and mighty, and flashing them under the
noses of our recovering friends. Well as you can imagine all HECK broke loose&quot;</p>

<p>Congratulations to:<br>
Naliel, on her new Silk Robe and Boots<br>
Fist on his new Silk Bracer<br>
Sprat on his new Plate Bracer<br>
Gladiator Chain Leggings - ???<br>
The Guild Bank on the Chain Coif, and Silk Robe (To be chained to worthy Sunrunners)</p>

<p>Thank you to Elpida, Eckol, Togam, and Window of Crimson Eternity for the assistance.
(and Heelers friend, I forget his name)</p>

<p align="left">8 Sunrunners at various times held the camp, and we ROCKED THE HOUSE! The
first time we cleared the 12 spawn (13 min respawn) we decided to go in and get our Flags
from Mauvin. Well our Tank forgot he looked like a Wearwolf, and the level 60 guard does
not like wearwolves. The guard made the mistake of touching a Sunrunner! We proceded to
hand him his backside on a silver platter. Wen the new guard showed up, he steared clear
of the Sunrunners.</p>

<p>They went searching for a Lute, and came across a GOLD MINE !</p>

<p>Actually it was a GEM mine, but whos counting.</p>

<p>The Pit in Velks was invaded last night, by a number of Sunrunners searching for
Cdiddys lost Lute. We know who Stole it, (<a
href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=6861">Khelkar Icepaw</a> ) &nbsp;
but&nbsp; he was obviously warned that we were gunning for him, because he didnt show his
face! Thats ok, because we will not give up. We will find him, and we will retrieve
Cdiddys Lute.</p>

<p>While we were there however we collected a WAD of Plat and Silver from his friends who
were eager to make up for Khelkar's transgressions. Add to that the pile of Gems that
Lanaren stumbeled across, and the night was not a total loss.</p>

<p>Grats to Quinanne on her new Spell!</p>

<p>Well done Sunrunners!</p>

<p>Group home suffers its first setback.</p>

<p>A moving Van pulled up to the city of Kael Drakal on Saturday morning, and the
Sunrunners piled out. Within 30 Mins the new &quot;Sunrunners group home for wayward Giant
Slayers&quot; was set up and open for business. There were some lapses in controll on the
first day, but we are working dilligently to help them break their Giant Slaying
addiction. A spokes person commented.</p>

<p>A Few lapses?!?!!</p>

<p>In the slightly more than 3 hours they were there, more than 100 Giants were put to the
sword.</p>

<p>Congrats to:<br>
Fistandantilis on his NEW ROBE<br>
Nalliel on her NEW PANTS</p>

<p>We will overcome our addictions, one of the patients was heard to say .........
eventually.</p>
