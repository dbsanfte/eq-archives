<h2>1.0 Recruiting</h2>

<p><br>
In this Policy, the Applicant will be referred to as &#145;Apprentice&#146;, or
&#145;App&#148;. Fully Guilded Members will be referred to as &#147;FGM&#146;s&#148; . </p>

<p>Minimum Level Requirements are currently level 55 for all classes. The 
Sunrunners reserve the right to change this requirement at any time.</p>

<p>Once the App
has become a Fully Guilded Member (FGM) - all alts will be accepted regardless of level. </p>

<p>Procedure for application for entry to the Guild:<br>
1. Go to the website <a href="http://www.slackman.com/sunrunners" target="_blank">www.slackman.com/sunrunners</a>
and put your name in for admittance.<br>
2. Read the Charter of the Guild (as yet to be written) and Guild Policies (as yet to be
written). It is assumed if you are accepted for membership trial period that you have read
and understood these charter and policies.<br>
3. Once the Application has been received, an Officer (or even Krrak=) will invite you to
the guild which will begin the &#147;Trail Period&#148;.<br>
4. Trial period is one calender month during which the following must be done:<br>
-group with regular members and at least one officer to ensure that both the applicant and
the guild will be able to work together. <br>
-participate in Guild Planned raids.<br>
5. Duties of the FGM&#146;s &#150; in the Member section please post your thoughts and
experiences about the App as all FGM will be taking any opportunity to group with all Apps
&#150; please list both good and bad impressions. If there is nothing to say about this
App it is likely this App is not on nearly enough to warrant FGM Status or they are
unwilling to group with us. Either situation will result in the App being declined FGM
status. <br>
6. Officers will be required to take time to group with each App at least once in the
trial month to determine your vote as to whether this applicant is accepted into the guild
as a full member. If an Officer offers to group with this App and the App declines for any
reason other than RL, this is also not a good thing as noted in #4. <br>
7. Officers will need to make it known whether or not they approve of the App becoming a
FGM&#146;s &#150; basically casting a vote &#150; this will be a thread on the Officers
board only. </p>

<p>When you are an App you will be expected to:<br>
1. Group as much as you can with fellow guildies and wow us with your experience and
willingness to be in this guild. We want lifers &#150; that means showing loyalty. We do
not want to take a moment away from your RL obligations &#150; RL always comes first. <br>
2. Be available to go on a raid at a moments notice, and be present (and early) for all
preplanned Guild raids.<br>
*** Please note that if you are still in your &#147;Trial Month&#148; you will not be
eligible for drops that occur on the Guild Raids unless the following exception occurs; If
the loot is NO DROP and is for your Class/Race combo and no other FGM can use and or equip
it (basically if the item would rot on the corpse) then an App may have that item.
Otherwise the Loot Policy will be adhered to. The reason for this addendum is so we can
ensure that App&#146;s are sincere in their reasons for wanting to be in a guild and not
for &#145;quick loot&#146; or to use the guild for their benefit alone for a short while
and then leave (ie getting parts of their epics completed)</p>

<h1></font><font size="5">2.0 Planning Raids</font><font
face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"></h1>

<p><br>
1. Anyone can ask for or plan a raid, in fact it is encouraged that all members try
planning at least one raid. However only raids that require a raid force (more than one
group) will be Official Raids.<br>
2. There is going to be a new forum made for the web-site: A Raid Suggestion forum. This
is where all the suggestions and comments about the suggested raids will be posted.<br>
3. The old Raid Forum &#150; will become a place for official raids to be posted and will
only be posted by either of the Raid officers or the Guild Leader.<br>
4. Once a raid has been proposed, either of the Raid officers or the Guild leader will
work out what kind of a force will be required (at minimum) to handle said raid, then once
the required forces have been contacted and confirmed for the raid &#150; it will be
posted in the Raid forum &#150; where the sign-ups for the raid will happen. Once it is
posted and signed up for the raid will occur unless RL interferes. <br>
5. Priority for the implementation of raids will be given to those who come to raids for
others, especially those raids where it is known that loot will NOT be received. Helping
make the guild stronger will be rewarded, those who feel that the guild should help them
first &#150; might do better looking for another guild. </p>

<h1></font><font size="5">3.0 Loot Rules<strong> </strong></font><font
face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"></h1>

<p>These rules are based on the Need Before Greed (NBG) concept. </p>

<p>Loot Policy – The Bare Bones<br>
<br>
Definitions<br>
FGM – Full Guild Member<br>
PM – Probationary Member<br>
GL – Guild Leader<br>
GpL – Group Leader<br>
ML – Master Looter<br>
GMT – Guild Management Tool<br>
RP's - Raid Points<br>
<br>
The officers have recently convened and after much deliberation and discussion 
have decided to go ahead with the following changes. Thanks to all FGM for their 
feedback and please be assured that all angles were scrutinized...exhaustively.
<br>
<br>
1. Any Item that drops on an Official Raid is no longer to be randomed to the 
members of the raid force. Instead we are now going to use a bidding system. <br>
<br>
2. If one is playing an alternate character (to be hereafter referred to as 
‘Alt’) on the Official Raid you may also participate in the bidding under very 
specific terms. Please see Section 4. This does mean that you must declare which 
is your Main Character. It will be this PC that will have the total Raid Point 
total assigned to it in the Guild Management Tool.<br>
<br>
3. A specific channel will be created and <b>only</b>&nbsp; used to bid on any 
item that drops. The purpose of this extra channel is to clarify communications 
and not to clutter up other official raid channels. It is suggested that you 
either make it a different color/font or place the channel in another Chat 
Window in order to not miss the action. For our following examples, the channel 
will be named Bid.<br>
<br>
4. Tiered Bidding System – If an Item drops on an Official Raid, the following 
order will be adhered to…<br>
a) Present Main FGM<br>
b) Present Alt FGM<br>
c) All Alts<br>
d) PM (only No Drop)<br>
For clarification, when an item drops, only a Main FGM that is present at the 
raid will be allowed to bid on it first. If there is not a Main FGM who is 
interested in that item, then all FGM Alts that are present on the raid will be 
allowed to bid on the item, and so on down until PM’s are allowed to request and 
random for the No Drop Item. If the item is droppable, then it will go to the 
Guild Bank for redistribution or to sell.<br>
<br>
5. Once an Item drops please observe the following – the ML <b>must open the 
bidding on that item first</b> in the Bid Channel before anyone can start 
throwing out numbers. If you prebid before the ML is ready to open you are <b>no 
longer eligible for that item, regardless of how many points you have, or your 
Guild Status</b>. I can only see this happening once, perhaps twice before the 
lesson is learned. <br>
<br>
As an example, check out the following...<br>
<br>
On a WTOV raid, a Plate BP drops. The ML waits until an appropriate time (which 
may or may not be during the next pull) and then announces in the Bidding 
Channel;<br>
<br>
ML says in BID: A <b>Plate Breastplate</b> is now OPEN for bids. Please cast 
your bids now. <br>
Axeramm says in BID: 5<br>
Spraticus says in BID: 6<br>
Garten says in BID: 7<br>
Axeramm says in BID: 8<br>
Kvala says in BID: 50<br>
<br>
*looooong pause*<br>
<br>
ML says in BID: Kvala 50 points going once.<br>
<br>
*pause*<br>
<br>
ML says in BID: Kvala 50 points going twice.<br>
<br>
*pause*<br>
<br>
ML says in BID: Kvala 50 points GONE! Bidding is now CLOSED for <b>Plate 
Breastplate</b>.<br>
<br>
ML deducts 50 raid points from Kvala's raid point total on the GMT immediately 
and Kvala loots the piece. <br>
<br>
6) Tie Bids. <br>
The only case that would create a Tie Bid is if there were 2 or more people that 
have the exact same amount of raid points as their personal total, and they 
wanted the same item. However if someone bids one more point above the tie, that 
person would win that item. <br>
<br>
Here is an example;<br>
<br>
Cazic Thule's Brain drops on a Fear Raid. <br>
<br>
Cilani, Lanaren and Kvala square off for an<br>
old-fashioned-get-down-and-dirty cat scrap. <br>
<br>
Total Raid Points prior to Bid Start.<br>
Cilani has 55 points<br>
Lanaren has 55 points<br>
Kvala has 56 points<br>
<br>
The bidding starts off low but quickly gets up into the 50's. Kvala bids 54 
RP's, followed by Lanaren bidding 55 RP's, which is her whole wad. Cilani 
matches the 55 RP's bid which could mean a random. Kvala must bid 56 if she 
wants the brain or it forfeits to random to Lanaren and Cil. <br>
<br>
<b>FAQ</b></p>

<p><br>
<b>Q</b>. Will I be able to bid all my points right up front?<br>
<b>A</b>. <i>If you want to blow your whole wad on one item from the very 
beginning of the bid-war then go right ahead. It’s your ‘money’ honey and you 
spend it however you see fit</i>. <br>
<br>
<b>Q</b>. How do I let the ML know that I want in on a bid?<br>
<b>A</b>. <i>You do not have to send a tell to anyone. Watch the Bid Channel 
carefully. After announcing that the Item is open for bidding by the ML, you may 
start tossing out your bid on the Bid Channel. The Bid Channel will not be 
moderated but the ML is the final judge as to who wins the item and that all the 
rules were followed. Obviously you will not be allowed to bid more points than 
you have allotted to you in the Guild Tool. <br>
</i><br>
<b>Q</b>. I want to change my Alt to be my Main. How do I go about doing this?<br>
<b>A</b>. <i>This is a big change, not to be undertaken lightly. It would be 
easy to save a substantial amount of raid points and then switch Mains so that 
you can have bidding rights and outfit what was previously your alt. In order to 
prevent such a thing from happening often, you can only switch characters to be 
your Main once a ‘real life’ year. Of course any Raid Points do immediately 
transfer over and the date of the transfer will be noted after the Raid Point 
Total in the GMT. The actual process is easy. Ask an Officer and they will 
ensure that a transfer hasn’t been made in one ‘real life’ year they will simply 
switch the info in the GMT and add the date and from that moment on the change 
is in effect. </i><br>
<br>
<b>Q</b>. But what if I wanted to play my Main but you asked me to bring my alt 
instead! How is that fair?<br>
<b>A</b>. <i>We will always *only* ask. You can say ‘no’. Now before you roll 
your eyes and say ‘riiiiight’… I know how hard it is to say ‘No’ when a guildie 
asks you for for a favor. That is why that you will get to choose which 
character you will be ‘bidding’ for as if it was a Main FGM at the beginning of 
the raid and you will make that known to the ML so he or she doesn’t get 
hopelessly confused. </i><br>
<br>
<b>Here is an example of how this works</b><br>
<br>
Krrak has a rogue alt named Laka. We are doing a Chardok raid and in order to 
get to the Royals we need a rogue to unlock doors etc. We ask Krrak to bring 
Laka instead and he agrees to do so, but chooses to go into any Bids for items 
that drop on the Chardok Raid for Krrak only. So even if an amazing drop for a 
rogue happens ‘Laka’ is not eligible until it is opened to ‘All Alts’. The ML is 
informed and it is noted for the entire raid that while Laka is being played, 
Krrak is still the Main FGM that he is Bidding for.<br>
<br>
Or…conversely, Krrak knows that Chardok has very little loot to offer a monk of 
his level and gear, so he gladly agrees to run Laka in the Chardok raid and his 
rogue will be treated as a Main FGM when Bidding is concerned. He tells the ML 
and the ML notes it down for the remainder of the raid. This choice cannot be 
changed midway through a raid. If SOE secretly changes loot tables and the uber 
Monk item drops, Krrak will not be able to bid on it until it gets to ‘All Aps’, 
if it gets that far.<br>
<br>
<b>Punctuality</b><br>
We want to reward those who are punctual (i.e. early) for the raid &#150; however if you
are late for any reason and it was not specified on the raid thread before the raid
started &#150; you will NOT be eligible for loot rolls for 30 minutes after you arrived,
are in a group and actively participating in the raid. <br>
If you post on the Board prior to the Raid start time that you will be late due to , this
rule does not apply to you. </p>

<p>Each &#147;Official&#148; Sunrunner raid will be worth &#147;X&#148; amount of points,
varying on difficulty and length of raid. The point value of the raid will be determined
ahead of time by Krrak and the 2 Raid Officers. If you are able to stay a minimum amount
of time (again, will be posted ahead of time on the raid board) you will be given these
Raid Points for later use. You can save them for as long as you want, and they never
expire. They can be taken away in the case of severe disciplinary actions &#150; but that
is described in the &#147;Disciplinary Policy&#148;. These points will be tracked and posted on the GMT. </p>

<hr>

<p></font><strong><font size="5">4.0 Raid Points</font></strong><font
face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font></p>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

<p>&#149; The points are awarded to the *Player*, not the individual character. <br>
i.e. Many of us have alts &#150; if Lanaren has gone to 6 raids, and has accrued 7 raid
points, if she wishes to spend those points buying weapons for her level 27 Dark Elf
Warrior Ringtayl Racoon, she may request those weapons that are in the bank and have it
logged in the Bank Forum. </p>

<p>&#149; Players will get a Raid Point(s) when they are at an Official Raid, and have
been ON SITE OF RAID for 3 hours or ¾ of the total duration. The Guild Secretary or
designated Looter of the raid will keep track of this and forward to the Guild Secretary
via Bank Forum within 24 hours of the end of the raid. </p>

<p>&#149; If a person has an alt in another guild, as well as a character in the
Sunrunners, and that non-guilded character has been requested to be at an Official Raid to
aid us in achieving our goal, they may acquire Raid Points to be used and spent on the
character that is guilded only.<br>
I.e. Mindert/Rayel &#150; Mindert (level 53 monk) is Sunrunner, and Rayel is CE. We
request that Rayel be present to Coth our groups into the Arena and provide her services
as a 63 mage to help ensure the safety of the raid and the people involved. Rayel will
then garner Raid Points that can be used on Mindert *only*. Rayel may also partake in the
randoms on drops that occur on the raid because she was specifically requested to be there
(i.e. invited) by a Raid Officer or Leader of the Guild. If Rayel did NOT have any
Characters in the guild, she would only have random rights at that particular raid
provided she was invited by a Guild Officer. </p>

<p>&#149; Characters that do not have a Sunrunner Guild tag, yet volunteer to go on the
raid will not have loot rights unless all FGM&#146;s and invited guests have declined
their need for that item. The only non-Guilded characters that will get looting/randoming
rights on an Official Raid must have the explicit permission/invitation by the Guild
Leader, Raid Officers, and or Raid Leader. </p>

<p>&#149; Raid Points will be updated within 48 hours of the end of the Raid. </p>

<p>&#149; To redeem Raid Points, please post to the Bank Forum the item that you need.
First come first served. If you are not aware of what is available on the Bank Forum then
you have not visited the board in the last week. The Bank will be updated weekly. Online
requests cannot be taken &#150; in the interest of fairness, please post your need on the
bank forum. <br>
Here is an example&#133;<br>
Kvala wins a piece of Thurg armur and needs the quest gems in the bank. Kvala and Lanaren
are both online. </p>

<p>Kvala /tells Lanaren: Hey! I need 3 Crushed Nephrites &#150; do we have them?<br>
Lanaren /replies : Yup we do! Let&#146;s log and go to the Bank Forum and make it
official. When I see your post, I will grant it providing no other FGM has requested it. </p>

<p>Kvala and Lanaren both log, make the appropriate request and confirm, log back on, run
to the Bazaar and Lanaren hands over the gems. DONE. </font></p>

<p><b><font size="5">5.0 Deguilding and Official Warnings</font></b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
<p>The following are Offences that would warrant an Official Warning, or being 
placed on Probation depending on the severity. Proof is Required. </p>
<p>1. <i><b>Sexual and/or Verbal Harassment</b>. </i><br>
<i>Details</i>: This includes deliberate rudeness, name calling, excessive 
swearing and continuing a conversation when a PC asks for you to cease and 
desist. This includes public and private conversations online and/or the 
Sunrunner Board. </p>
<p><i>Note #1</i>: The Rant’s Section of the Sunrunner board allows for 
excessive swearing as long as it is not targetted at a person or persons, 
directly or indirectly. If you have a problem that deals with another 
individual, settle it through tells or use one of the Officers as an mediator or 
a go between. </p>
<p>2. <i><b>Disobeying a direct order from an Officer or Guild Leader.</b> </i>
<br>
<i>Details</i>: This is a willful contradiction that are words or actions that 
are in direct conflict with a request or order from an Officer or Leader of the 
Sunrunners. </p>
<p><i>Note #1</i>: If obeying an order means that your PC dies, please 
understand that we will make restitution by ensuring that every effort will be 
made to retrieve your corpse and provide a 96% or better resurrection. </p>
<p><i>Note #2</i>: In a Raid Situation, other individuals who are not Officers 
but are leading the raid, may be given the same consideration. This will be 
announced at the beginning of the raid so that all will know to treat that 
individual with the utmost respect as they do their difficult job of leading a 
raid. This person may not even be a Sunrunner, but if we are agreeing to be in 
their raid, even Krrak will ‘hop’ when the Raid Leader says ‘toad’. </p>
<p><i>Note #3</i>: Any and all orders can be appealed to a higher level, up to 
the Leader of the Guild. However the Leader’s decision is final. All decisions 
should be discussed at the next appropriate time. This means that during the 
thick of a raid, or in the middle of the CR is not a good time to discuss 
whether or not the order issued is fair. Do as you are told, then consult with 
the GL afterwards. Or don’t do as you are told, face the consequences and then 
appeal to the GL for a final judgment. </p>
<p><br>
<b>Deguilding</b> due to Offences that would warrant being removed from Guild. 
Proof Required and No Official Warnings are given. This means that the First 
Offence is your Last Offence and you will be forcibly removed from the Guild.
</p>
<p>1. Any type of scam, to anyone, guilded or not. </p>
<p>2. Spamming the Guild Chat Channel, without provocation, without 
identification and not responding to personal tells from an Officer or GL. </p>
<p>4. A deliberate act of ‘Training’ and getting other people killed.. </p>
<p>5. Repeated Disciplinary Actions – 3 ‘Warnings’. (Probationary Members/New 
Applicants only get 2 ‘Warnings’) </p>
<p>7. Ninja looters on raids. (POP does remove this possibility, but we are 
covering all basis) </p>
<p>8. Three separate Probation’s due to disciplinary actions. </p>
<p><b>FAQ </b></p>
<p>Q. <i>What constitutes Proof? </i></p>
<p>A. One of the following: Screenshots, log files and/or a Witness. If the 
proof offered is not satisfactory, more Proof could be requested. </p>
<p>Q. <i>How is an investigation handled? </i></p>
<p>A. The following 5 steps will be followed: </p>
<p>1. An Officer must be notified of the offence, and must be supplied with as 
much information as possible. This includes the names of all the parties 
involved and guild names if the issue goes beyond our guild. </p>
<p>2. The Officer will now select another Officer to assist them in the 
investigation. This information will be passed on to the original Plaintiff. </p>
<p>3. The two Officers will now begin to investigate the issue, by contacting 
the parties involved to get statements. All will be logged for later review if 
necessary. </p>
<p>4. If there is sufficient proof to make a decision, the decision will be made 
by the two Officers and if applicable, the consequences will be meted out. The 
Plaintiff will receive the decision and the reasoning for the decision. If there 
wasn’t enough proof for a decision, a request for additional information will be 
made. If more information is not available or isn’t presented to the Officers in 
a timely fashion, then the issue is dropped. </p>
<p>5. If the Plaintiff is not satisfied with the decision, they can appeal to 
the Guild Leader and the GL will make his/her decision based on the available 
information provided by the Officers log files, and by contacting the parties 
involved if necessary. The GL will make his/her decision and that decision is 
final. </p>
