        looked around to make sure no one had followed him to the secret
        entrance to his private place, often he came here as a child when the
        others would make fun of him because he was not as strong as them, even
        his brothers would taunt and tease him on occasion when the other ogre
        children were watching. Dkunblu was one of the few ogre children blessed
        by magic's of nature called shamans by the tribes in Feerrott. His
        magic's and studies kept him apart from the other children most of the
        time, they who practiced the ways of the Greenblood’s and Crakneks and
        would later go into the world to fight, raid and die for their
        chieftains.<br>
        <br>
        His secret spot had always been there for him, a small cove from the
        great Greenblood River that ran through Feerrott out to the Gulf of
        Gunthak. Trees and undergrowth surrounded the small place so it was not
        noticeable from the he river that was patrolled regularly by the
        bouncers or the lizard men who frequently can to the river to find fish.
        He had found this spot while hiding from some Craknek bully, drunk on
        ogre swill, one day and was surprised that after 26 summers no one had
        ever come to defile it. The small grotto was his place to hide his
        favorite things, trinkets, special herbs, some expensive wines, and a
        rare Lilly, which only grew in the mud of swamps. It was this Lilly that
        he would come to see daily when he visited Oggok because it reminded him
        of his hearts love Katallia the Wood Elf druid. She had given him this
        Lilly to remember her by when he was not with her. He often wondered why
        she had shown him affection in the past, always being there for him when
        he was in trouble and always knowing when his heart was burdened.
        Dkunblu had a problem not many ogres had, a strife that worked up in him
        often like a fire that was not easily extinguished. He found goodness
        and beauty in life.<br>
        <br>
        To his teachers, family and friends he played evil, which was not hard
        when dealing with his lesser-learned kindred, but he knew the truth of
        things the way his friend had taught him. Katallia had met him in the
        Desert of Northern Ro when he was younger and shown him the goodness
        that lay in the land and all around him, after 14 seasons it had become
        easy to see things the way the wood elf druid did and he loved her for
        it. She had given him the Lilly, magic's she had said, to plant in the
        muddy place, to show that while it lived so did their friendship and
        love. Through this year the flower bloomed more with ever passing
        season.<br>
        <br>
        The fateful day came when Dkunblu's younger brother Kraeven fell in
        battle in some far away land and though his body was not recovered, his
        possessions would by burned in a pyre to show that he had died honorably
        a good member of the Crakneks. It was this day that Dkunblu's other
        brother Nastur came back to Oggok and was present at the burning pyre.
        Nastur was a Greenblood and had seen much in life traveling, killing;
        adventuring and many a night had Dkunblu heard stories over and over
        around the cook fires of Nastur's exploits. A true Ogre they had said
        &quot;evil to the core&quot; the Greenblood chieftain had laughed, but
        Dkunblu knew his brother and knew how drunken stories get grander with
        each telling.<br>
        <br>
        During the pyre ceremony Nastur showed no emotion, this thought Dkunblu
        must be to show the Greenbloods that he was tough and Nastur after all
        had a reputation, surely afterward he would get together with his
        brother and they would talk more and mourn in their own way for their
        fallen brother.<br>
        <br>
        Dkunblu caught up with his brother and his Greenblood friends in Clurgs
        bar; Nastur had a weakness for Flaming Clurgs a house special in Clurgs
        with a mighty kick. Upon looking at Nastur more closely Dkunblu could
        see the many battle scares Nastur carried that even his healing powers
        could never had repaired. Dkunblu welcomed his brother in the standard
        Ogre fashion as was surprised by the cool welcome he received from his
        brother. Nastur turned to him and stated flatly &quot;I sees you
        tomorrow my bruddr for tonights I drinks wit me worthys brudders of the
        greenbuds &quot; again Dkunblu thought it must be hard for Nastur to
        keep up appearances with his reputation for greatness and went to his
        room to wait the morning for his brother.<br>
        <br>
        The next morning brought the rain, Dkunblu snacked on a platter of dwarf
        fingers his mother had made and waited for his brother but he never
        showed. Looking for Nastur was no hard task, the Flaming Clurg casks and
        smashed pottery which lay around the court yard of the city ended at the
        Crakneks guild were evidently the Greenbloods had once again raided the
        fighters guild and counted victory over them by taking their weapons and
        throwing the warriors into the moat that surrounded their guild hall.
        Relieving himself in<br>
        the center fountain was Nastur, with a half drunken grin. &quot;Hail my
        brother 'said Dkunblu to which Nastur replied by turning and relieving
        himself on Dkunblu and the dozen Crakneks laying on the floor. &quot; I
        have heard talk my brudder&quot; said Nastur &quot;dat yous disgraces
        you family and blood by taking up wit some wood elf druid bitch wen you
        travels is dat trues?&quot; Dkunblu stood shocked he had hoped this
        wouldn't ever happen but Katallia and him had traveled widely in the
        past. &quot; Ahh I don no were you gets that froms my<br>
        brudder, &quot; said Dkunblu thinking quickly &quot;I might eats em but
        I never beds them.&quot; Nastur looked his brother over with dark red
        eyes &quot;Heals me brudder of dis achy head so me can go about me
        busness.&quot; Dkunblu quickly cast on Nastur to heal the bruises that
        Nastur received knowing he could do nothing for his brother’s hung
        over state. &quot; Dat betters, &quot; said Nastur and grabbing Dkunblu
        threw him out the window to join the half drown Crakneks members
        floating in the moat. &quot; Neber wud I hav believd dat u wud turn to
        gud my brudder but I will see dat you wil agan know your blud and
        kin.&quot; Swimming to the ladder and moving the drunken fighters
        Dkunblu thought that surely he could continue this story and make Nastur
        believe it. He tried for 2 more days to see Nastur but was never able to
        get close let alone be alone with his brother. On the 3rd night Dkunblu
        was awaken with a kick, he felt the cold steel of a sword slightly cut
        his neck.&quot; Kno dis &quot; came an evil whisper &quot; I seen yous
        wit dat druid bitch on a night in Karanas&quot; &quot;Your story is
        okees for da family for now u would break moma’s heart&quot; &quot;I
        have lost one brudder in an honorable ways his death will be rewarded in
        da afterlife, but you have dishonored dis house and will pay.&quot; A
        crack on the head and a flash of light brought sleep again till morning.
        Dkunblu awoke with a terrible headache, which spoke that it was not a
        dream he had had. He cursed that thought that in the entire world he and
        Nastur would have every been in the same place at the same time and by
        chance he had been caught with his love in his arms. A spell quickly
        healed the damage to his skull and the long cut on his neck and after
        asking the bouncers he was told that Nastur had left with the dawn.
        Could the stories of Nastur been true; could he possibly have become as
        evil as the Greenblood guild had bragged? Dkunblu could only wonder.<br>
        <br>
        The following morning brought Dkunblu with a wanderlust of his own, he
        longed for Katallia again, it had been to long. After a short stop at
        the secret place, he left to meet his love at the place they both knew a
        small glade south of the druid circle in South Karanas he would send a
        runner to the druid ring with a message only they two knew and they
        would meet. South he ran, the spirit of the wolf entering him to give
        him speed Nastur’s words came back to him over and over as he crossed
        the Rathe Mountains &quot; You will pay &quot; could Nastur do anything
        to make him really pay? In Dkunblu's eyes he had done nothing wrong,
        following your heart was a virtue that all free men had, Nastur would
        never tell anyone in Oggok because of mother, he thought. What did he
        mean?<br>
        <br>
        The second day found Dkunblu outside the Ogre Inn in Rathe Lake, he
        liked it here the fishing was good and he could hear stories from
        travelers who would pay a shaman even an ogre for the wolf spirit or
        healing. On this particular day Dkunblu heard of a wedding in the Arena
        in Lake Rathe, which was rather close and could hold a large amount of
        people. Though the lower races, especially the humans, bred like
        rabbits, Katallia had said that they hold beautiful ceremonies and the
        fare was plentiful if guests would bring something to the party. Dkunblu
        had never seen a hummie wedding before and decided to bring a gift for
        the couple. He purchased some elven wine (a personnel favorite) for the
        couple but as he was walking out he overheard the Innkeeper say under
        his breathe &quot;Stupid ogre probably gonna use that for perfume!&quot;
        &quot;Perfume indeed, &quot; thought Dkunblu &quot;Stupid hummie thinks
        all Ogres the same HUH! I'll show them&quot; and walking over the next
        hill and watching that no one was looking, opened each bottle and
        relieved himself to fill them to the top. A minor flame spell took care
        of the wax seal and it was done,&quot; Let them taste some ogre perfume
        now!&quot; Dkunblu chuckled to himself as he cast the float magics and
        walked over the water to the arena area.<br>
        <br>
        The arena was busy with all different races, stunties, hummies, dark
        elves with their beautiful ebony skin, elves both high and wood. Dkunblu
        had seen all the races at one time or another even tasted most of them
        back home. He had always been taught that lower races were cattle for
        the higher races, which is why they were allowed to breed so
        plentifully. Katallia had tried to show him that all races were equal
        but Dkunblu knew that if Katallia would have ever tasted moma’s
        cooking that it would have been hard to believe!<br>
        <br>
        Dkunblu ask around to find the male of the couple to give his gift to so
        that he could sit and enjoy the fair, which was spread at one end of the
        arena. Breads, puddings, roast hog and casks of ale were all laid out,
        since he had not eaten yet today Dkunblu was very hungry but Katallia
        had once said &quot; Give the gift first then you can eat &quot; or
        something like that he had forgotten exactly. The groom, so they called
        him, was leery as he accepted the wine gift, &quot; For you and your
        lady &quot; said Dkunblu &quot; I was told to bring gifts to these
        things. &quot; The groom examined the bottles and thanked Dkunblu for
        the gift. Heading to the food table Dkunblu caught a glimpse of
        something familiar, a helmed head standing above the rest, he knew that
        crest well, it was his brother Nastur. As he watched his brother move
        around he had hoped to avoid talking to him, but Nastur seemed to be
        part of the ceremony and was having fun beating the other guests down
        with his axe, they in turn ran or fought back.”Hum&quot; thought
        Dkunblu&quot; Katallia never told me that the hummie weddings were this
        much fun&quot; &quot;They really play hard!” Just as he turned to pull
        the other leg from the roast hog, Dkunblu heard a voice cry out &quot;My
        bride! My bride! The Children of Darkness have taken my bride!&quot;
        What a great party these lower races put on!&quot; thought Dkunblu
        &quot;First a fight then the male must find his hidden mate. If this
        keeps up he'll have no strength left for the night activities!&quot; He
        laughed as he finished the second roast leg.<br>
        <br>
        Nastur had been hunting Eltherion, the leader of the Knights of the Holy
        Storms for weeks. Word of this wedding made its way to Duke Shadowlyth,
        who had also attended the wedding, and provided this ‘entertainment,
        by whisking away the bride. By doing this, the Duke insured that
        Eltherion, who was conducting the wedding, would end up in Arena to be
        attacked. This Nastur did gladly for the honor of the great house he
        served and the honor of Cazic-Thule. Nastur had joined the evil house
        because it suited his nature; he had found a home among the darkness and
        enjoyed the feeling. The rise to the Dark Executioner position in this
        evil house was quick for Nastur and the power to kill on command suited
        him. He would have had more words with his brother Dkunblu over this
        disgrace to his family blood but he had not the time. He had to get to
        this wedding knowing that his target would be there. His brother’s
        demise would have to wait. He tried to blend in the crowd for the
        wedding, but his battle lust got the better of him once again and he
        attacked his target with a fury known only by the gods, back and forth
        the battle rang unlike the targets in the past, this was a worthy target
        full of magic's and surprises. This Paladin was not going down easily
        perhaps because of the Soulfire Sword which afforded him heals often but
        Nastur gave no ground and though severely bloodied finally defeated his
        enemy. Nastur wiped the blood from his eyes and cleaned his ax on the
        corpse of his fallen target, when he felt the icy fingers of the healing
        touch course through him, after the second and third wave of relief
        poured through him he turned to see his brother Dkunblu standing behind
        him. &quot; Hail brudder &quot; said Dkunblu &quot;Nice events these
        hummies have at their weddings, gud food to!&quot; he held up a meat pie
        and ate it in one bite for emphasis. &quot; What did you bring the groom
        for a gift?&quot; questioned Dkunblu, &quot; My ax!&quot; replied Nastur
        &quot;and you?&quot; &quot; Some very special Elven wine!&quot; laughed
        Dkunblu.<br>
        <br>
        Nastur could easily have killed his brother then and there, he had the
        right but his mother had just lost a son, it was to soon to loose
        another so he had to think of some thing else. Reaching in his pack for
        a Flaming Clurg flask he wondered how he could turn his brother from the
        light. As he watched Dkunblu head back to what was left of the food
        tables (he had obviously devoured the entire table) Nastur saw the dark
        elf Caprice from his guild, then as if the great god Cazic' Thule had
        had hit him he saw the perfect plan. &quot;Lady Caprice&quot; called
        Nastur &quot; May I speak with you a minute?&quot; &quot; Certainly dark
        one &quot; said Caprice as she slowly made her way to him with her cat
        like walk and ebony skin.&quot; What is it I may do for you Dark
        Executioner?&quot; she ask &quot; I wish yous to meets me brudder from
        home Dkunblu &quot; said Nastur with a smile. &quot; He come to the
        wedding and I was wondering if you could maybes talks him into joinin us
        under the Dark Queen. Caprice wondered why Nastur had given this task to
        her, she had seen ogres in her home in Neriak even spoken and dealt with
        them on occasion but to be asked to act, as a liaison to one for the
        guild would be hard.<br>
        <br>
        Dkunblu had just finished the last of the meat pies remaining and looked
        for some thing to wash it down with, he avoided the elven wine the
        others were drinking as they looked for any remaining crumbs to eat,
        when he saw his brother coming toward him with a small ebony goddess
        gliding next to him. &quot; My brudder Dkunblu may I interdict da Lady
        Caprice of da house of Children of Darkness, I wanted her to meet my
        brudder.&quot; &quot; Good evening to you&quot; ' Dkunblu announced in
        his best dark elf &quot;I am glad to meet one of my brothers guild
        sisters dark one please join me for some ahhh ale &quot;&quot; Do not
        touch the Elven wine here I understand its stale &quot;Dkunblu whispered
        to her. &quot; I was wondering about you, &quot;said Caprice &quot; What
        guild do you profess?&quot; &quot; Well I have a loose association with
        the Nomads of Destiny's Fate but they have lost many of my friends of
        late &quot;Dkunblu wondered what this was about, surely his brother did
        not expect to trick him into joining with him merely by introducing him
        to a dark elf female no matter how beautiful, no woman<br>
        could come between him and his love Katallia.<br>
        <br>
        They spoke for many hours, Caprice telling of the deeds of their guild,
        and of the things she had seen For the most part Dkunblu was polite
        talking of things and even going so far as to mention his secret love.
        Caprice seemed to have much patience and spoke with Dkunblu at length
        about the good and evil in the world, both of which she had seen. &quot;
        Mayhaps my friend were you to join us you could show me this thing
        called good for I may have seen it but do not understand?&quot;
        &quot;Perhaps &quot; thought Dkunblu &quot; Could I fit in here? Could I
        maybe do some good in a house of evil I must think and talk to Katallia,
        she is wise and will know what to do.&quot; As the sun set Nastur
        approached Dkunblu &quot; Join us brudder give it some thoughts Caprice
        here will be arounds if yous needs her. &quot;<br>
        <br>
        Dkunblu had stayed to long in this place, Katallia would be mad for
        waiting, he cast the wolfs spirit and the floating magics on himself and
        ran like the wind to make up time. Katallia had started a small fire in
        the glade and waited for Dkunblu, his kindness and companionship kept
        her coming back to him, if the other druids knew that Dkunblu met
        together she would have some major explaining to do. Up until now when
        she met others she would act like any other in a hunting group and had
        taught Dkunblu not the show her and affection during these times. She
        had taught him much in these long years and he had learned well for an
        ogre his healing power and earth magics were very close to hers and they
        had much fun together. The flower she had given him she had been
        enchanted slightly were it would grow even in the mud of the Feerrott
        swamps in Oggok, the lessons of her teachers had taught her to love all
        things wild and natural so it was fitting that the Lilly she had given
        to Dkunblu those long years ago carried some of her feelings with it.<br>
        <br>
        Dkunblu came late that night and though she was cross at first, you must
        be firm with ogres, she could not be mad at him for long. He told her of
        the wedding and the things that went on there, how fun it was and she
        laughed telling him that those things are not supposed to happen at
        weddings that it was a guild raid, when he told her of Nastur and the
        secret they shared had gotten out she was worried. A Shadow Knight with
        a secret was a dangerous thing and she explained that evil is complete
        darkness and a void from which there is no return. Dkunblu pondered on
        her words for 2 more days, as a message arrived from Caprice asking
        Dkunblu and his love to meet her in the arena, &quot; A trap &quot; said
        Katallia &quot; but she is nice and wishes to learn good &quot; said
        Dkunblu &quot; we should go to see what she wishes between us we can
        come to no harm!&quot; begrudgingly Katallia agreed to accompany her
        companion and friend they had protected each other many times in the
        past, they would be safe.<br>
        <br>
        The next day brought the two to the arena zone, darkness filled the sky
        and silence was everywhere. Dkunblu thought it strange that not even the
        aviaks which roosted outside the arena were noisy as usual. Katallia
        bespelled herself, as normal, when entering into a strange situation. A
        soothing coo came from the arena, &quot; Dkunblu join me and bring your
        love we have much to discuss! &quot; Dkunblu knew the sultry voice as
        that of Caprice and wondered why she was not at the gate to meet them.<br>
        <br>
        The two companions entered the arena and walked hand in hand up the
        stairs to the throne. Lounging in the throne like a cat was Caprice her
        ebony skinned face and bright eyes flashed a brief smile and an emotion
        that Dkunblu did not catch. &quot; Welcome Dkunblu&quot; said Caprice
        &quot;I have heard much of you my lady&quot; &quot;As have I of you dark
        one&quot; said Katallia. &quot;Dark one I have come to tell you
        something that you may not find comforting &quot;said Dkunblu &quot;I
        cannot join you in you evil house I care for my love to deeply&quot;
        &quot; ahhh&quot; Caprice said slyly &quot;I see, what do you think of
        that Dark Executioner?&quot; From the magics inside him Nastur stepped
        from the shadows, his eyes flashing red with hate for the druid female
        before him. Drawing his ax he tested its blade and exclaimed, &quot;Join
        us brother or you love will die!&quot; Dkunblu was shocked, why was
        Nastur here? Surely his brother could not be totally evil, he would not
        slay the one thing that Dkunblu loved and risk loosing him to hatred,
        &quot;Please &quot; Dkunblu exclaimed &quot;You can not hope to win me
        this way you would not dare brother, you who would not cry at you
        brothers funeral can not be so far gone as to think that this will bring
        us closer and me to evil!!!&quot; Nastur laughed evilly as he struck the
        druid for the first time &quot;Join me brother&quot; he cried &quot;No&quot;
        cried Dkunblu in horror, the blood of his evil race coursed through him
        as he grabbed up his weapon to help his love. Stay your attack my
        brudder for though I beat her down know that I have but to touch her
        with my magiks and send her soul to Cazic' Thule. Her hair in Nastur’s
        grip, Katallia cried softly, to be used in this fashion against her
        friend was more that she could stand, &quot; Do not do it my love
        &quot;She cried, &quot;Quite bitch, &quot;cackled Nastur and struck her
        the final blow into<br>
        unconsciousness. From behind a dark hollow voice spoke &quot;do not kill
        her now executioner &quot;, Dkunblu turned wildly to see yet another
        figure step from the shadows, it was Memdaynar &quot;I think that your
        brudder will join us now, give your oath to us and kneel and you loves
        life will be spared Dkunblu&quot; Katallia awoke, her battered body
        bleeding from a dozen open wounds, though blood stained eyes she could
        make out the group around her, she had caught the last part of the
        speech form the shadows and now cried softly, she knew that to save her,
        Dkunblu would give in to the darkness, she had seen him sacrifice
        himself before. As the words &quot;I will join you' left Dkunblu's lips
        Katallia screamed &quot;NOOOOO&quot; and with the last of her power used
        the last of her magics that would teleport her to safety.<br>
        <br>
        Days later Dkunblu, wandered back to Feerrott forest, the evil nature of
        his race beginning to build inside him and course through his blood. His
        brother had won this time. He made his way slowly to his secret spot and
        found there the Lilly from his love now wilted and brown. Striking a
        flame with magic took no effort, as did the magic to protect him from
        the flames. He stood in the middle of what was once his secret place and
        watched it burn, wondering what was next. The past three days had
        changed his life much and though his willingness to do well was lost, the thoughts of the things
        he had learned in the past were still with him. Late that night as the
        last flames of the fires died, a final tear ran off Dkunblu's face, and
        then there was darkness.<br>
