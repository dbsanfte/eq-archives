Silk Turban - Cilani<br>
Vellium War Mask - Tsurwolf<br>
Runed Frost Blade - Spraticus </p>

Did anyone die - No<br>
Did everyone do their jobs properly? Yes<br>
Did people listen when needed? Yes </p>

<p>Not only did we do all of the above, we cleared the way in record time, got set up in
the Arena and was pulling the entire arena when the left side got taken by another guild -
who promptly wiped out. </p>

<p>It was a fustrating day at Kael for the Plate wearers as Silk after Silk dropped from
the reluctant clutches of the residant Giants. Perhaps they were still sleeping? </p>

<p>The following drops occured and were awarded to... </p>

<p>Silk Turban - Naliel<br>
Silk Turban - Fistandantilus<br>
Silk Gloves - Cilani<br>
Leather Gloves - Exzandra<br>
Chain Gloves - Lanaren </p>

<p>Lanaren traded her gloves to the bank for the chain coif. She is now looking quite
Valkyrian on her dashing new horse and shiny title. But enough about her =) </p>

<p>Exzandra is our latest Up and Coming Druidess who's radiant glow shows that even the
Gods smile down on her slight form. We expect many wonderful things from her =) </p>

<p>Our Silk wearing Casters are looking very fashionable this new year sporting various
peices of Thurgandin Armour. Rumor has it that the Plate and Leather wearing Ones are
quietly waiting...sharpening their swords...for their next chance at the Arena. </p>

<p>Sunrunners group home for wayward Giant Slayers suffers its second setback in as many
weeks.</p>

<p>&quot;It was horrible&quot; one eyewitness exclaimed. &quot;There were Giant parts
flying everywhere&quot; &quot;Bodies were piled 3 and 4 layers deep around every one of
them&quot; &quot;I have never seen such a Giant Slaughter&quot; When asked, the group home
administrator, known only as &quot;Krrak&quot; gave this statement. &quot;We were doing so
well. We set up a Meet and Greet, for the patients to get to know the Giants, and become
better friends because of the exposure. Then in troops this line of Giants with their
fancy armour and shiny things, acting all high and mighty, and flashing them under the
noses of our recovering friends. Well as you can imagine all HECK broke loose&quot;</p>

<p>Congratulations to:<br>
Naliel, on her new Silk Robe and Boots<br>
Fist on his new Silk Bracer<br>
Sprat on his new Plate Bracer<br>
Gladiator Chain Leggings - ???<br>
The Guild Bank on the Chain Coif, and Silk Robe (To be chained to worthy Sunrunners)</p>

<p>Thank you to Elpida, Eckol, Togam, and Window of Crimson Eternity for the assistance.
(and Heelers friend, I forget his name)</p>

not like wearwolves. The guard made the mistake of touching a Sunrunner! We proceded to

<p>They went searching for a Lute, and came across a GOLD MINE !</p>

<p>Actually it was a GEM mine, but whos counting.</p>

<p>The Pit in Velks was invaded last night, by a number of Sunrunners searching for
Cdiddys lost Lute. We know who Stole it, (<a
href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=6861">Khelkar Icepaw</a> ) &nbsp;
but&nbsp; he was obviously warned that we were gunning for him, because he didnt show his
face! Thats ok, because we will not give up. We will find him, and we will retrieve
Cdiddys Lute.</p>

<p>While we were there however we collected a WAD of Plat and Silver from his friends who
were eager to make up for Khelkar's transgressions. Add to that the pile of Gems that
Lanaren stumbeled across, and the night was not a total loss.</p>

<p>Grats to Quinanne on her new Spell!</p>

<p>Group home suffers its first setback.</p>

<p>A moving Van pulled up to the city of Kael Drakal on Saturday morning, and the
Sunrunners piled out. Within 30 Mins the new &quot;Sunrunners group home for wayward Giant
Slayers&quot; was set up and open for business. There were some lapses in controll on the
first day, but we are working dilligently to help them break their Giant Slaying
addiction. A spokes person commented.</p>

<p>A Few lapses?!?!!</p>

<p>In the slightly more than 3 hours they were there, more than 100 Giants were put to the
sword.</p>

<p>Congrats to:<br>
Fistandantilis on his NEW ROBE<br>
Nalliel on her NEW PANTS</p>

<p>We will overcome our addictions, one of the patients was heard to say .........
eventually.</p>

<p align="left">In what can only be described as an amazingly simple SPANKING, the
Sunrunners decended on Skyfire like Locusts, destroying everything in there path. Wurms,
Wyverns, Drakes and Chromadracs all fell to there might. I have it on good athourity that
at least 1 or 2 simply lay down and let themselves be looted rather than face the Might of
the Sunrunners. All named mobs (And there were a bunch) died just as fast if not faster.</p>

<p align="left">What was the reward for the slaughter?</p>

<p>2 Perlescent Shards (YAY - only 2 to do for Damurtil) </p>

<p>Book of Immortal (YAY - epic piece for Krrak) </p>

<p>Dragon Guts (YAY/ICK - goey epic piece for Cdiddy that I have on me to chain-quest) </p>

<p>25 + SPELLS <br>
-Too numerous to mention but those that received some were Fistandantilus, Tsurwolfs and
Quinnane. For a full list of what is available to you Caster types, please visit the Bank

great learning at the hands of defeat also. Our friends and Guildmates are what get us
through the hard times, and take us into the future. We will continue to do more together
in the coming weeks and months, and we will need the support of everyone to continue
expanding and growing. Look to this site to keep you posted on every success that we have,

<p><font face="arial" size="2">-On sunday, Suzail, Monorail, and Artukus, Ransacked the
Aviak Isle in the Ocean of Tears, in search of the Elusive Soarin Brightfeather and his
wonderous spear.<br>
<br>
After an hour of searching, and a lot of Aviak deaths. Soarin decided to show his face.
With this Suzail won his Ebon War Spear. After a further hour of death and destruction (on
the Aviaks part), we managed to coax Soarin out another 2 times, winning a further 2 Ebon
War Spears, 1 for Monorail and 1 for Artukus. With this victory we have decided to rename
this Isle Sunrunner Island.</font></p>
