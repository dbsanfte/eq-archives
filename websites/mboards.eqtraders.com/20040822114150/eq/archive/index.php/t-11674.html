<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arrica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okies, my first question:  I want to start working on some of the items that require steel casing with my Tinker Bot, however, I'm not sure of the best way to get to Anizok; for that matter, not even sure where he is.  I've looked at several maps of PoI, and nothing seems to point where he is (hope he's not in the factory, that'd suck, having to get flagged for that just to shop).  I'd like to be able to take a group of my guildies sometime, and just load up on the casings, to make future trips less of a necessity.  According to the DB, the casing is ~42pp each, so I'll have to bring a load of coin, possibly distributing among my group for weight concerns, as well as having them lug some out, as it doesn't appear that they stack. :( <br />
<br />
Second question:  Is there any particular reason gnomes aren't able to train in one extra level of New Tanaan Crafting Mastery?  Was looking at AA's on my Tinkerer (31 wizzy), mainly out of curiosity, but shouldn't a gnome have the ability to be the only ones in Club 2k?  OR am I just missing something blatantly obvious, and maybe for whatever reason Sony doesn't lump tinkering in with the others, and a gnome could actually achieve 2k...?<br />
<br />
<br />
Eww, got longer than I wanted it to, but got my questions out there, thanks for bearing with. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gumble Tinkertumble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just take the right path in PoI and you'll find Anizok. Also, gnomes can get 250 in tinkering and 250 in a normal tradeskill, without using any AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gnome rogues can hit 2250. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xiang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you have a rogue friend with SoS, they can scoot down and grab steel casings from the gnome in POI, making the whole trip without being seen =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's true, but keep in mind that there is one wanderer in the area where he stands (an erratic model, I think) which might wandering into agro range while the rogue is buying supplies, so the rogue needs to scout things out and wait until that mob moves away before shopping.<br />
<br />
Then the rogue needs to shop quickly and pop back into sneak hide mode as quickly as possible to avoid an embarrassing dash for the zone out.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Or he can just hit escape if he gets agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ulaxmi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Decently geared monks and bards can also make the run there for you. A bard can run in DA'd, and fading memories once at Anizok. A monk just run and FD's when necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In my upper 50s (on my ranger main), I finally got a group interested in working up the right side of PoI, it was good XP and then I loaded up on items.  Don't forget the vial of gases, which stack, mercifully.<br />
<br />
Apparently at Fan Faire there was some head nodding with respect to the idea of separating Anizok as a quest NPC from the merchant portion, in response to Lilosh's request.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, I tried to death run it once with an SK leading the way (in hopes of gathering them all and then FD'ing off somewheres)...but it didn't work.<br />
<br />
Now I just beg and /cyber guild rogues to go shopping for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't mind him being all the way back there, but being behind see invis mobs is uncool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ive got a mediocrely geared 59 monk i dont play much any more and i use her to get Steel Casings. Only got close to dying once out of dozens of trips. <br />
<br />
If theres a group XPing at the zonein, please let them know what you are up to before going in so they know what may be coming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Apparently at Fan Faire there was some head nodding with respect to the idea of separating Anizok as a quest NPC from the merchant portion, in response to Lilosh's request.<br />
<br />
<br />
Or making his unique items stack, i forget which they discussed.<br />
<br />
<br />
But I feel loved for having gotten this &quot;On the ballot&quot; so to speak.<br />

<br />
Oh to be a guild rogue!<br />
 :faint:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aryse Andenter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Necros can also just run in and FD... if you use invis mobs will only agro behind you and that should give you the time to FD once you get there. He is found in the building in the first clearing along the path to the right after zone in. Alternatively, necros can HS run in and HS should be wearing off just about when you get to him so you can hit FD. Also, any well-balanced group should be able to fight in to where he is relatively easily... just note that the path to the right of zone-in is a lot harder to single pull than those on the left for those who are used to xping there.<br />

Having these stack would be ever so helpful, but at least they are not No Drop like the LoY ingredients :irked:</div></div><hr />

<br />
They made the LoY stuff no-drop so they would sell more expansions.<br />
<br />
SoE doesnt make EQ and release expansions and do all this stuff they way they do it to make the world a better place.<br />
<br />
They do it to make money.</div></div><hr />
