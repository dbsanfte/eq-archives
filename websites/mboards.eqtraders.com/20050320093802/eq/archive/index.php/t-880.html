<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Psychosis</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From the Everques site directly.<br />
<br />
Here is where I found it (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?id=47888)<br />
For every minute that passes in the real world, 20 minutes passes in the game world.<br />
<br />
That means for every day in RL that 20 Days in EQ pass.<br />
<br />
Here is the math.<br />
<br />
First how many Minuites are there in a day<br />
<br />
60 Minuites = 1 Hour<br />
24 Hours = 1 Day<br />
7 Days = 1 Week<br />
52 Weeks = 1 Year.<br />
&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot;&gt;In all actuality there are 365.25 Days in 1 year but this is just a rough one vs more rounded numbers.&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
That stated.<br />
<br />
Ok Now for the number crunching.........<br />
<br />
60 x 24 = 1440 (This is how many minuites there are in a Day.)<br />
1440 x 7 = 10080 (This is how many minuites there are in a Week.)<br />
10080 x 2 = 20160 (This is how many minuites there are in most peoples pay weeks. Sorry couldnt resist! :P )<br />
10080 x 52 = 524160 (This is how many minuites there are in a year.)<br />
<br />
Ok now thats Real life calculations for Minuites and how many their are so you have a grasp of what I am using to base calculations on.<br />
&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot;&gt;The actual ammount of days in a year based on the minuites vs days with leap year added is 1440 x 365.25 = 525960&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
20 x 60 = 1200 (This is how many minuites there are in EQ over 1 Real Life Hour.)<br />
1200 x 24 = 28800 (This is how many minuites there are in EQ in 1 Real Life Day.)<br />
28800 x 7 = 201600 (This is how many minuites there are in EQ in 1 Real Life Week.)<br />
201600 x 52 = 10483200 (This is how many minuites there are in EQ in 1 Real Life Year.)<br />
 :shock:  :roll:  <br />
<br />
Now for the conversion  :x <br />
<br />
28800 / 1440 = 20 (This is how many EQ Days there are in 1 RL Day.)<br />
So With out booring you with all the rest of the math the end result is in Real Life. Every year that you play Everquest (Assuming that you never logged off and never quit playing for 1 year straight. 20 Years in EQ would have passed.)<br />
<br />
1 Real Life year = 20 EQ Years.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

In game if you Type that it will return how many Days Hours Minuits you have played.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maddenus</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cough Kiz Cough  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Carmaris</div><div class="date">12-14-2002, 02:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gotta agree with Kiz, I was kinda disappointed at the end result of all that math.  I mean, it seems pretty basic that if 1 RL min = 20 EQ min, then 1 RL hour = 20 EQ hour, 1 RL week = 20 EQ week, so on and so forth.</div></div><hr />
