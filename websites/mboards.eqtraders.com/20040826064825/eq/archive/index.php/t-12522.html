<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kothall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Embedded in the message threads are some threads dealing with 'paths' to skilling up.  Some of these include break points -- when to switch items, cost and sell back, etc...<br />
<br />
Such discussions fade with time but...  If they were held on a thread area then folks could use them as references and new/updated 'learn a trade skill' topics could be created from them.<br />
<br />
Comming here I can find recipies and trivial info -- very helpful but assembling costs and marketability (even if an item has a sell back value) is tough to figure out often.<br />
<br />
The 'learn a tradeskill' area is about worthless for someone with a bit of plat and wanting to learn some skills quickly (example:  learning tailoring to 76 I did woven mandrake then picnic baskets.  took less than 45 minutes including sub combines to get there but, cost wise, it wasn't all that cheap, if I'm pp pinching, but it was fast and cheap for just getting skills up to that point).<br />
<br />
To collect various guides would be a difficult process unless some of the info scattered through the threads can be collected.  Those could provide a lot of raw info for constructing guides and then, just ask some folks to assemble the guides and submit them to each of the forum moderators who can then help filter and finalize the layout for publication.<br />
<br />
Side Note: <br />
I know that when I'm skilling up I look at a couple different things.  What I'm making, what else I can do while collecting stuff, what other 'complimentary' skills I can work on while doing a collection run, etc...  Like doing needles for smithing -- I hit Erud's Crossing with my Ranger, foraging and Fishing...  I now have some 2 and a half stacks of spare Essence I brewed up and a batch of needles left over plus I have almost a full stack of dye for when I do ribbons for my tailoring...  I hunted up recipies and items -- how common they are, demand for them, etc...  Then I decided on where to go to get the stuff I needed to do the needles.  Fishing was easy in Erud's because of the fishing supply vendor right there and foraging plus fishing there got him stuff that wasn't all that common and will have a decent resell value.<br />
<br />
I read mass threads here showing different info but it's tough to find all the various data to even help figure out costs to gain skills, if something can be resold to vendors, etc...<br />
<br />
Anyway, just an idea...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tudani's got it.  That's what the Tradeskill Guide (etc) forum is for.  We try to keep the number of stickies to a minimum, to improve the chance that people will see and read them.  That forum was created as a place where such guides could be concentrated to improve visibility without cluttering up all the other forums.</div></div><hr />
