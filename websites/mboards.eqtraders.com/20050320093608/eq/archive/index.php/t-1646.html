I read more than I post anyway. This site has helped me amazingly and I give thanks to Denmom =) Thank you for helping me on the road to 250 in so many tradeskills. Now the message, which was cross posted to a few forums.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
Just in case anyone cares...<br />
<br />
I have completely lost confidence in Verant's ability to provide a fun game for my spare time. EQ is no longer fun for me or my husband. We cancelled all three of our accounts today.<br />
<br />
I have become increasingly cynical/skeptical that anything can make this game enjoyable for me again, however if anyone is listening, here is what would help:<br />
<br />
1) Expansions are supposed to expand the world, not shrink it. For the love of god, please make more exp zones for high level players.<br />
<br />
2) Everyone should have an incentive to level, casters and melee alike. The parchment drop nerfs are unacceptable, as well as other issues that I know nothing about due to the fact that I do not play melees. Fixing parchment drops in tier 3 zones does not help, as most players cannot access those zones.<br />
<br />
3) Fix the flag issues. Whether you are a member of an uber guild, or a casual player, each caste dislikes the way flags are done in this expansion.<br />
<br />
I used to enjoy EverQuest, but it seems more like work when I log on anymore rather than fun. If many of the issues I feel are limiting my fun are not fixed within the next couple of patches I am leaving for good, and no, I am not selling my account. By doing so only gives Sony more money and to them it would be as if I had never left.<br />
<br />
I would appreciate it if nobody flamed this post for whatever reason they feel they need to. This is just a tiny good bye. I still plan on reading the boards though. Who knows what may happen in the future?<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Again I have loved this community and will still read here from time to time. Good luck to all who seek the elusive 1750 and grats to those who discover new combinations. I am headed off to DAOC, where it seems to support the casual player more than EverQuest does. You can find me on Bedevere, Kinarie, level 30 scout.<br />

Though I do not believe you will find what you seek in DAoC either.  I and my husband left EQ when DAoC came out.  We decided that it just was missing something.  To easy to lvl there and its more of a game for those that enjoy pvp really.  We just finally closed our 2 DAoC accounts.  But we came back to EQ after only 3 months of being gone.  I have played EQ since 1999 and still do not have a character over 56.  In DAoC I maxed out 4 characters in 3 months.  <br />
<br />
Anyhow, Once again I hope you find what you are looking for.  An if you dont.  Then you can always come back to EQ.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilosh</div><div class="date">12-30-2002, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I may be joining you.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am beginning to wonder if EQ is really as fun as I pretend it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Baking to 250 was an AWESOME goal, and I have now attained it.<br />
Got my spoon.<br />
Now, I am looking at getting Tailoring to 200.<br />
<br />
Which is tough, I know.  But the thing is , I cant take it to 250.   Verant, in their infinate wisdom, has decided that I must level to 51, and then some, before I can do that.<br />
<br />
I just recently hit 34. (Yay Quad Kiting).   And maybe this is the 4-5 deaths my characters have had over the past few days, but levelling seems slow and painful.   A game should NOT require you to take 5-6 hours to obtain a level that is considered mid-level.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe Diablo 2 spoiled me, but If you had good items, and knew what part of the Act to hunt in, the levels werent too tough up until 60-70. (Out of 99).  In EQ, I have twinked myself with nice items, and researched where I should be, and it still seems to take forever.<br />
<br />
<br />
And more and more of the game is behind the big fence of 51+, and it seems as though that isnt going to change. The only thing PoP had for Lower level people was Ports. (Which was great, but its a feature.... Not real meat and potatoes content).<br />
<br />
I dont know, I suppose seeing people say goodbye might be making think about saying goodbye myself.<br />
<br />
We shall see.<br />
<br />
Regardless, I wish good luck and happiness to Kinare wherever she may happen to be.<br />
<br />

Here's to proving there's life outside EQ,<br />

<br />
Very well put, for those who don't play hours and hours each day EQ has lost a lot of its' appeal. <br />
<br />
I see it as the game has matured, with the majority of players 'main' charactures being level 50+. The inevitable problem with that is a shortage of appropriate (and good!) high-level playing grounds such as the planes.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think it is clear that Verant has completely lost the RPG aspect and is now throwing in new armor, items and land that is really in essence complete junk content. <br />
<br />
This is a vain effort to keep players from getting bored; what gets me is that they charge the players to do this, while already sweeping in a tidy profit. <br />
<br />
EQ was a most enjoyable game for the first couple of years it was out, when the majority of the players were still mid-level and had a lot to play for and there was plenty of QUALITY playing grounds with a fair share of RPGing going on.  <br />
<br />
I won't ever cut on Verant for what they created, for it was a fine game and I look forward to trying out EQ2. <br />

Verant / Sony provide the quests, land, items.<br />
Players do the rest.<br />

Personally, I go to alts and experience those things I didn't with my first and main paladin.<br />

A necro is sure an opposite of what I am used to playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cigarskunk</div><div class="date">12-30-2002, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Expansions are supposed to expand the world, not shrink it. For the love of god, please make more exp zones for high level players. <br />
<br />
This quote confuses me - PoP was 110% high level zones for XP - except for the port system, a new spell or two and about two tradeskill recipes that lower level character might be able to dumpster dive off of the merchants because the final product is worth zilche, there's is NOTHING for the under 50 crowd in PoP.<br />
<br />
Heck, thanks to PoP, on many servers, Velks is as empty as Befallen, planes such as Hate and Fear are now free for the lower teir guilds to raid, entire areas that used to be teaming with folks fighting over the one spawn that could generate 1 AA point in 8-10 hours are empty due to entire groups being able to score an AA point an hour in PoP.<br />
<br />
The only thing PoP did to shrink EQ was to make it so that folks who couldn't find or afford a port didn't have to spend half an hour going from point A to B.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaysha Soulsinger</div><div class="date">12-31-2002, 06:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cigarskunk, I understand what the top poster wrote about the world getting smaller.<br />
<br />
In Planes, there really are few zones to exp. Plane of Valor and Plane of Storms are good, Plane of Nightmare, Innovation and Disease are ok ... there's a problem with leveling though. Once you get to level 61 or 62, the entire upper floor of Sebilis turns green. Yes, no more exp there. The same applies for a lot of other zones, mobs turn green.<br />
<br />
While the expansion yields about half a dozen decent to good exp zones, by getting higher level you easily lose about two dozen zones that used to give exp. The world gets smaller.<br />
<br />
Yes, you could say this is good, because it gives the players reaching the 50-ish levels places to hunt, but at the same time all people that are 60+ will get crammed into but a few zones. I've already heard people call the Plane of Valor like Velks2 or KC2.<br />
<br />
Take care out there, whoever is leaving the game. Hope you enjoyed the ride up to now, so it wasn't all in vain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are after xp the world have been getting smaller from the day EQ was original was launched. At lvl 1 all zones in the game all zones had the ability to give xp. You might not have the ability to hunt there but xp was there. As we all got levels some zones became non xp zones, because the mobs in there became for lack of a better name Green mobs.<br />
<br />
PoP has not changed this. If you want to stay in old world(s) zones and xp just stay at lvl 60. If not and want to level past 60 and get the benifits this gives, learn to accept that old hunting grounds are a way of the past. just as we did when Sol B, GuK, North wall of karnors and other good hunting grounds became a thing of the past. What we as players needs to acceept is that VI provides the framework of a game. What we as players choose to do with it can not be blamed as them. They do not force us to level past lvl 1 unless we choose to do so.</div></div><hr />

I find a tremendous amount of irony, especially on these boards, that people are finding fewer and fewer zones to hunt in as they level. Tradeskilling opens up all kinds of zone options that the traditional high-level player would not even consider!  At 58, I  find myself hunting in EK all the time...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verdandi</div><div class="date">01-01-2003, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/hug Kinare.  I've only barely tasted PoP but that's due to many of the same things you mention.  I think of PoP Tiers 2+ as EQ 1.5.  It's technically the same game, but you cannot play it and the rest of the world at the same time.  I have several friends that I used to see on a regular basis and have not seen ONCE since they got flagged for higher tiers, in spite of frequent conversations with those friends about how much they wish they could leave PoP once in a while.  As far as I'm concerned, EQ 1.5 zones don't even exist and friends there are gone from my world forever.  So far I'm still enjoying EQ 1.0 with my wonderful guild, but if things continue in the unsettling direction they took with PoP and the world available to me continues to empty and grow more antiquated, I'm not sure that'll remain the case.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I hope you find what you're looking for, Kinare!</div></div><hr />

I only chatted with you once or twice briefly in serverwide, but I always thought of you as a great represenative of the EQtraders playerbase.  Sorry to see you go, and keep posting on the boards :)</div></div><hr />
