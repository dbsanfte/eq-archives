<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, after some discussion last night, my wife agreed to give EQ a try.  Now, her main gripe was that she did not like the fact you ran around and just killed stuff.  So, I proposed to her that she play a cleric, and that she would be resposible for buffing(will be explaining that more as she is playing) and healing people, and would not have to worry about going around killing things.  She thought that that would be good.  I also said she could do tradeskills, which was making things that she could sell to other people.<br />
So, today she is doing some &quot;homework&quot;, checking out the main EQTraders web site to see what she wants to GM, I explained that she could get all of her skills to 200 and one to 250, she would just have to see which one.<br />
I also have her checking out Casters Realm, so she can learn more about being a cleric and which race to start.  I think she is leaning towards being a gnome (after telling her about all of the races in the game), but we will see.<br />
And I told her that if she liked it, we would get a second account (Evolutions) and set that up on her laptop, and we would be able to play together.  I am crossing my fingers and hoping for the best.<br />
<br />
<br />
p.s. for those of you who know, she is now 33 weeks along and will be going back to her regular doctor next week, instead of the high risk group.  And if things go well, sometime between 36 and 38 weeks, they will take out the stitch(circlage).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good luck to you both. I hope it works out well.</div></div><hr />

i think a druid would have been a better choice myself.  get heals, buffs, and other stuff like foraging and imbueing your own emeralds.  hope she has fun though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, druids still have to kill things.  As a cleric, she can if necessary, but does not have to.  I can do enough foraging for the both of us.  And don't clerics get other imbues?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Serenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Clerics get the imbue for their god.  So, High Elves get emeralds, dwarves get rubies and so forth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for tradeskills... I have only this to warn her with....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lyron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Unless you have a LOT of stuff to twink her with, try to discourage the gnome cleric.  Just so much harder to get your wis up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Decent Gear for lowbies can be had for virtually nothing these days, choose race and class that YOU like. Too many folks choose their race and/or class for someone's idea of &quot;Most Efficient&quot; or &quot;Best&quot; and then play the Min/max game, burning them out by level 50 (when leveling slows down for the first time, really). Or sooner =(<br />
<br />
I get folks hooked by having them try various class/race combinations til they find one they like. In fact that's how I got hooked, myself! Just kept trying new stuff til something stuck.<br />
<br />
Also my druid never killed anything (other than noobie garden) until she hit 49 and learned to quad. She was a porting cleric the entire time, so it's really more about how you choose to play your class. Enchanter and shaman are also less on the actual killing end, and high on the buffages, if she shows affinity for either of those. <br />
<br />
And one last thing, I HATED the killing part of EQ when I started playing more than 4 years ago. I'm glad, cuz i met a LOT of people and tried all sorts of things (including getting hooked on Tradeskills &gt;&lt;). However now i'm known for my warcry, &quot;KILL EVERYTHING!&quot; None of this pansy crap of invising to our &quot;camp spot&quot;, let's start when we zone in and KILL EVERYTHING!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Clearly you must have her start a cleric of a god you need the imbues for.   *evil grin*<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and for a &quot;I don't like to kill things&quot; person,   I'd highly recommend baking, or brewing.   I'm not sure why, but the thought of &quot;Why must we go through all this killing, here, have some COOKIES!&quot; makes me giggle.<br />
<br />
<br />
-Lilosh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The other thing to keep at the back of your head is how you two will intereact as a group.  Cleric is nice, but they tend to overlap a lot with druids and don't bring much to the mix in a duo.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, cleric seems to be a motherly role.  I know on my old server our raiding clerics were 2 grandmothers and a new mother.<br />
<br />
Since a druid will have heals covered, consider... an enchanter.  ENC/DRU is a good combo - both to duo and to build a group around.<br />
<br />
Mage is a good choice, or BST if the idea of having a faithful pet appeals to her.  A woman in our guild who likes the American Indian lifepath is a barbarian Beastlord and has lots of good emotes to support her roleplaying.  Then again our MT is a woman (and **** good tank, and I'm sure Sanna will verify she's a cutie too :D), as is one of our AM3 rangers, so gender stereotypes aren't all that.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I'd ask you to consider a shaman.  While it's not the most powerful combination duoing, a shaman/druid pair is a SOLID backbone to form a group around.  And once the druid gets over 58 and the shaman gets canni 5 it's a pretty powerful combination.  Plus you have the advantage that you don't have to find a cleric, or an enchanter, but you can pick up all the melees LFG.  I know shaman say they are underpowered, and they are correct.  If you are endgame and the tanks have all their physical stats capped and worn ATK capped as well.  At levels of the game below that, shaman are very solid - though a BST can stand in as a shaman in a pinch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Cerpicio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Gnome Cleric?  Yay!  Be sure to pick Brell as your diety so you can imbue rubies.  They are used in the tinkered cultural armor.  I don't think you can use the imbues from the evil gnome clerics, which is a real shame.<br />
<br />
If you are on Lanys, look for the guild Ak'anon's Destiny.  It's a great, but small, group of people, and the guild only allows gnomes to join.  They have a &quot;raid&quot; every Tuesday (raid is in quotes because most members are still only in their 40s).  That was my favorite guild and I was sad when I left.  I out-grew them and wanted in a big, PoP-raiding guild.  But I still keep in contact and help them out when I can.  I still have in alt in AD, too.<br />
<br />
Anyway, yeah, be a gnome!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, she did her &quot;homework&quot; that I asked her to.  She has decided that she is going to be a High Elf cleric, based on everything that she read.  Remember, this is just to start her out in the game.  If she likes it, she will be getting her own account for her puter, and will wind up starting her char over (unless she gets to a decent level and we just move it).<br />
I will be supplying her with a full set of sandblasted armour, polished gold quartz rings, and polished velium quartz necklace.  Will give her 2 BD earrings, a charred guardian shiled, and a cermonial smudging stick, which I picked up off of a vendor(I think for about 1pp and change) which I have not been able to sell off of my mule.  For her primary, I will give her Dark Ember, in case she actually has to hit something.  That should give her a good start. <br />
<br />
My GL 2 Boxes a shaman and druid, and they do quite well together.  I do have a warrior, and a low BST that she will be able to group with once she gets to their levels.  But, I look at Shaman as a kind of hybrid melee/caster.  Last night was the first time that I grouped with a shaman that did not get into the fray of things.<br />
<br />
We will see how things go.  This is just to get her feet wet.  If she likes playing, and we do get her her own account, she will be able to experiment with race class combos as she sees fit.<br />
<br />
I am just hoping that she does like it, and does not get turned off by it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">go for velium black saphire necklace instead of polished quartz one.  more mana and so much hp at level one.  i have one that make the rounds on all my alts.<br />
<br />
yep i meant black saphire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm pretty sure you mean the black sapphire velium one.<br />
<br />
Velium Polished Quartz Necklace<br />
MAGIC ITEM <br />

Sapphire Velium Necklace<br />

STR: +8   INT: +8   <br />

Black Sapphire Velium Necklace<br />

HP: +65   MANA: +65   <br />
WT: 0.1   Size: TINY<br />
Class: ALL<br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
My preference, though is still going to be the polished quartz one, as the only cost to me will be the velium, same with the rings.<br />
With the armour I am providing for her, I think she will be doing pretty good on HP and AC.  Not sure what the HP will be at lvl 1, but the AC just from the armor is going to be 172.  Her Wis will be 184.  I'm thinking, she will be doing good to start out.  Especially as she is going to be getting into tradeskills.<br />
<br />
But, she is sick right now, so we won't be putting her toon together until next week.  I am getting excited.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, but not twinked and dying is frustrating, and that's even more likely to make her quit than it being too easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Maybe strike a balance between twinking a little so she doesn't die every two minutes, and helping her through some of the Newbie armour quests to give her a little flavor of the different aspects to the game.</div></div><hr />

noob gear = good. teaches the player how to work the game while providing them with xp and gear. and a chance to goof off and 'storm the goblin tents!'<br />
<br />
rewde = lucky. I cannot convince Quartic that EQ is anything containing a positive adjective. I definately hope Mrs Rewde likes the game and sticks with it. ^_^. I think it's exceedingly cute when couples share the same playtime interests. <br />

Especially when you can talk someone into...say... going to a city where you're KOS and fetching you some nice trade supplies...<br />

Thanks again to Garamond Courier (and Phabos, who sent him there) for the help with the last 2 points of brewing.  But then, I think Gara's pretty exceedingly cute all on his own.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well, as stated previously, she is totally against going around and killing/attacking things, hence the cleric.  At level 1, it will be an interesting time trying to find some other low level people for her to group with to get exp.  And for the twinking, well, she will be doing trade skills, so, I thought the edge from the higher wis to start would be good.  This is just an experiment to see if she will like it(quite a compromise to even get her to try it).<br />
<br />
IF she does, she will get her own account, and I will transfer all the gear to her new toon.  At which point, I believe I will make a paladin to run around with her, so we can play together at the really low levels, until she gets to Rewde's level(which is going to continue to go up as I will play her when I am not playing with the wife)</div></div><hr />
