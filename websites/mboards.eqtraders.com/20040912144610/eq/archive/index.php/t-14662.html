Waterlogged Rigging<br />
http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20071<br />
<br />
As to drop rate? Don't know but it can't be that rare as I often see gluts in the bazaar when the rest of the tinkers take a break. If you wait the glut out and hold your nerve until there are at least 7 or 8 traders with stock competing you can often see prices drop as low as 1pp each. However if there are several tinkers skilling up then prices can raise to 30pp each or more due to demand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Quills drop from some of the skeletons on that beach.  Moreover, c the merchants in Gunthak usually have them: as I was working my tinkering, I ended up finding all the quills I needed on the vendors, though once that trivialed, I did farm some riggings myself.<br />
<br />
If you frequent Gunthak, you can often make offers to the people XPing on the beach and get instantly outsourced farming.</div></div><hr />
