<br />
I was so despondent (certain I was going to succeed at 226 w/ GM Hammer) that I ran out and attempted a BAH.  I'm 3 for 3 now on Black Acrylia (in my last 3 attempts, went 0 for 7 before that) and hit 227 on my third weapon.</div></div><hr />

I lost 3 in the Brew Barrel, but did a total of 6 attempts so far. Today at 206 skill (with Geerlok) I succeeded on making Erollisi bracers :) - it feels soooo good to finally succeed at making your own!  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I approached him, he let me know his policy has been not to do combines of BD cultural.<br />
<br />
I understand why, so I sat there staring at these sheets, the stacks of components for old HIE cultural I had and said &quot;What the heck?!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
With a skill of 196, and the geerlock hammer...<br />
<br />
Failed imbued bracers, twice, failed imbued vambrances, greaves, BP twice...<br />
<br />
Then on my last combine I made a Full Mithril BP (I forgot the emerald in the last combine - I was shaking watching all that PP disappear).<br />
<br />
I actually like the color more than the Blessed Full Mithril... but that could just be pride talking...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did the same thing at the same skill, except I had 20 sheets and there was no GM smith on my server at the time.  <br />
<br />
<br />
The idea was to save the sheets untill I became of the appropreate skill.  Well I had a good day in the bazaar and those sheets were calling my name.  Long story short  I think I used all 20 sheets to yield 1 BP, 1 Boots, 1 Bracer and a very happy Shadowknight.  <br />
<br />
Made the BP on the very last 3 sheets as well  ;)</div></div><hr />
