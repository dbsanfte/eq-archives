<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RedStar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think this guide iss off .. i dont know exactly why maybe guy started at 21 from buyin skill from Guild Master. But i made 60 medium jars and even  fired the ones i succed on and it only brought it to 17. Just though i let you know maybe find out if it was started at a skill of 21.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, higher int or wis will greatly help.  Also, that guide was written eons ago before pottery skill ups were nerfed/slowed down.  Still, it is very cheap to get to pottery master level, even 199.  :)</div></div><hr />
