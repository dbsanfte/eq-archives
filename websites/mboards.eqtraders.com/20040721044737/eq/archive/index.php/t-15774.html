While I'm curious what will happen to the quote block when it gets too big, I will tell a tale.<br />
<br />
A short one.  I've always found the enthusiasism that Sanna attacks life with amusing.  She managed to catch me on Saturday morning about, oh, 30 seconds before I was going to wander off and do RL stuff, and having just hit 46 wanted to see something planar.  So I logged in the crew and I thought about where I would want to take a newly 46 enchanter.  Somewhere where they don't die.  Where could I take a newly level 46 gnome enchanter.<br />
<br />
The answer, of course, was obvious.<br />
<br />
PoI is partially light blue at 65, but it was well worth experience penalty to take Tinkbang out to the planes for the first time and watch her jump around for joy as she nuked various clockwork models.  Heck mez even stuck.  Well, it would've if I hadn't dotted the add.  That's hardly important. Hey, I don't usually group with enchanters and clerics, give me a break. I'd never make the cleric tank if I did actually group with one.  Honest. Any reports you hear about me FDing in the middle of a fight and making Nhinx tanking Underbulks in Disease are untrue. She even did fine.  I mean she would've if I had actually done that. I mean, I have crit heals and she doesn't, so I *ought* to make her tank. Right?<br />
<br />
Tinkbang looted a bunch of neat-o gnomish stuff and went off to have a rather enjoyable weekend otherwise.  And we're still friends, even though she dragged me off to Velk's.</div></div><hr />

I only saw one person I actually know (*wave Niko*) but none of the folks I was so looking forward to screaming at (whether in joy or frustration  :rolleyes: ).

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grimina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You know I actually considered coming back parttime.  Until my husband decided to renew our accounts when we were bored one evening (figured $25 spent was less than it would have cost us to go to the movies and we'd get more laughs out of this *snicker*)  We spent an hour buying new gear to replace what we'd given away.  And discovered that 350k wasn't NEARLY enough to come even remotely close to the gear we had given away (though all but one of my FT stuff was nodrop so in that we were still fine and dandy).  But we got what we could and headed over to grimling forest (intending to go to AC but never made it) to try and get back in the swing of things.  We stumbled around a bit getting used to the UI again but soon were zooming through the mobs.  After about the 20th kill I actually remembered to loot  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Anyway boredom set in soon after and we headed back to the outpost and logged out hehe.  Oh well, have a little less than a month left in which I can log in now and then just to chat with my friends if/when I see em.<br />
<br />
Besides...tradeskilling is INFINITELY more enjoyable in FFXI and that's why I play it hehe.  Just miss the inane chatter from EQ.  Just gotta decide if chat is worth $13 a month for me =)</div></div><hr />

Like I said, I'm friggin insane when it comes to zones. I like Velks. I love Nadox. I like raiding Sky (when it's done with people who know what they're doing). I like PoI. I can't wait to start raiding again. *shivers excitedly* Sanctus Lumen of course started raiding decent things right when I left... so now I'm getting up there again, and excited at the prospects. ^_^ <br />
<br />
I don't know what you consider 'xp penalty' : P but a percent-and-half per kill is dang nice to me ^_^. And that was just entrance mobs. And yeah, mez actually landing (as opposed to not landing and drawing red-con unslowed aggro to me) surprised me too. <br />
<br />
And now you can not complain at me for dotting everything when I play da drood : P : P : P<br />

<br />
And yes, the entire weekend was very enjoyable. Despite the fact that I forgot about my Japanese essay till 8:50pm Sunday night. /sigh. (I ended up trying to describe part of my trip to Chicago over Spring Break in my highly limited Japanese... we'll see tomorrow how much green ink I get back : P )<br />

And yes, Grimina, keep poking around, we're there... somewhere.... And if you hurry, you can catch Quartic on his leveling-up spree, and Bohm too. Quartic = my BF who yet again is giving EQ a shot; made a DE Wizzy and has fun nuking things : P : P (and baking! /squee). And Bohm made a necro whom I occassionally try to gear and PL some. <br />
<br />
I need to sell more mana vials, all this 'gearing the noobs' is two steps from draining me ^_^. <br />

<br />
Tatoo is the name of the guy from Fantasy Island who said &quot;the plane, boss, the plane.&quot;  Unless my early 80s lore is slipping.<br />

It's not (though I lost a 't'). Hervé Villechaize played Tattoo on the TV show.<br />

Light blue mobs yield one half or one quarter normal exp per kill.  That's the penalty I was talking about.<br />

Well, yes, but the 2 blue in AA my shaman got wasn't really a good return on the time.  And you ninja looted everything so I'll never see any of that velium :p<br />
<br />
(actually I lie, I did manage to grab 3 bricks/blocks and 1 small piece and a few quest gems - and I don't hate velks as much any more).<br />

I should hunt down some Paradise Island this summer, if I can... I'll presumably have something resembling free time... maybe... <br />
<br />
<br />
I would councel against splitting efforts, IE, trying to play on Trib and Tarew at the same time, but if you came, I'd do what I could to get you a foothold. We have a lot of fun, but we've spent a good two months trying to get myself and Piffy to where we can group with the higher ones (phab, nhinx, noish), and now I'm turning around again and PLing Quartic, so, we'll see how it goes : P Just have fun with it, whatever you do. It's not worth the otherwise. <br />

Of course I pulled 20ish small bricks off a vendor last week sometime, and have 3 or 4 stacks of folded velium sheets banked if I ever feel motivated to make the BD cultural again.  So I guess I don't need it *that* badly.<br />

And the marr.eqtraders convo was in serverwide.eqtraders laaaate one night recently when Noishpa was around... channel was talking about some new implimented thing, maybe the new graphics engine, and it just so happened that all the people talking for a minute-and-half time frame were on Tarew. So I said, &quot;welcome to marr.eqtraders, where two-thirds of the people here are on Tarew Marr!&quot; And Noishpa made some comment that was humorous except I can't remember it because it was late. But anyway, I've been meaning to add marr.eqtraders to my autojoin, just for kicks and giggles... which would give me 8 channels.... meep. <br />
<br />
Going through my screenshots, I found I snagged the entire conversation from the day Denmother-sama popped into channel and found there were a bunch of us and asked, &quot;that mean I should expect a Marr mobbing at the Fan Faire?&quot; <br />
Which I still think we should do this next time around if we could. Ironically the only one of the group that went was Xynn, who has returned to his home server of Vazaelle. <br />

But in all seriousness, we have a lot fun on Tarew. There are many great tradeskillers and friends, all willing to help out in finding drops and forages for recipes and other matters. Anyone who stops in the channel at the right time will see a large contingent of us people from Tarew, discussing Brell knows what, and some of it even involving tradeskills. :) <br />

If it's going to be, it already is.  I've been running logging since late 2002.  Current logs are in the area of 1.5GB.  There's a few gems buried in there.  And they can stay that way for the right price.</div></div><hr />

There's a backflagging channel for Tarew, most of the time people just ask, 'anything going on?' to which people reply things ranging from 'no' to 'we're raiding your mom'. Twen spent all of Monday afternoon going, &quot;MB's up, anyone raiding him?&quot; Finally at like 9pm Black Company hosted an open raid; 115 people in zone, MB died in 29 seconds. My jaw was on the floor the whole time, it was one of the coolest things I've seen yet.  <br />
<br />
So now I just have to get lvl 51 so I can get my free AA that's waiting for me. : P And I imagine I'll spend it in Tactics. : P : P<br />

Sanna could never cackle evilly. She is sweet and innocent.<br />

Must... resist... urge....<br />

Ok, it passed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Ok, here's the plan...<br />
<br />
We go to Tactics and start sending noisey tells: &quot;hey we need a druid for our group, you free.&quot;<br />
<br />
We then cackle evilly.  You on board Sanna?<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll just train you with some Diaku Scouts, and giggle while I zone back out.<br />
I'm backdoor-flagged for tactics,  Kiz.   :-)<br />
<br />
<br />
You won't get away so easy!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">look! you admitted to training (in the future). That's the bannable part. <br />
<br />
: P <br />
<br />
and yes, I am very good at maniacal laughter. And I am very sweet, too. <br />
*smiles a smile so full of sugar you think your teeth will fall out of your head*<br />
^__^!!! <br />

-- Sanna<br />
only three more Fire Jolly Ranchers, then I'll be done with em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I tell you what, Noishpa. <br />
<br />
I'll give you your Spell: Mask of the Forest, if you agree not to train us in Tactics, but rather politely (as polite as you ever are : P ) xp with us, if you so wish. <br />
<br />
And pay me the 10k. <br />
And maybe throw in a stack of hero sandwiches/parts? : P : P  Nah, I shan't push my luck there. <br />
<br />
Altho, i'm sorry, sleep &gt; EQ, and I'm not going to be up at 2 am. So... hm. I'm semi reluctant to set it on my trader for the 10k, for fear someone else will buy it (the only copy up right now is 23k). So you may not get it super-immediately, but we'll get around to it one of these days? <br />

is willing to help her friends where it is needed, even unto draining her bank down to &lt;200p. : P <br />
this Quick Reply box might get me reprimanded one of these days &gt;__&lt;</div></div><hr />
