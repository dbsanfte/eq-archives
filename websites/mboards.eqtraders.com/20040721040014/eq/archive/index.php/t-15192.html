<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've managed to sell sandblasted and gothic plate in the bazaar - it seems popular, although the other kinds of plate are generally shunned!<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any experience with selling the ldon chain? I'm skilling up a second smith and wondering if the chain is worth making for selling... and which kinds might be popular. It doesn't sit well with me to just blow all my tempers on collars and sell them to vendors :) I'd rather make something worth equipping and claw back some of the money I've spent :D<br />
<br />
Grateful for any feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mind you, I've not made LDoN chain, but my guess would be that only the sandblasted would be saleworthy.  Large for the shamans and maybe even smaller for the rangers.  Rogues might like the dex one as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">WIS chain for Shamans definately.<br />
<br />
And hmmm... What for Berserkers? Probably Gothic Chain. I imagine that would sell fairly well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nex Alacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gothic chains are pretty good sellers, or were when LDoN first came out.  I haven't made it much since then because the market has been flooded, and I'd rather use my tempers to make the higher skill plate stuff.  <br />
<br />
I originally made quite a bit of the sandblasted chain thinking shamans would like it, but it didn't really work that way.  I sat on a lotta pieces for a long time.  Maybe I could have done more research to find the hardest pieces for a shaman to add wis, but I didn't really care enough.<br />
<br />
Never made and Calcified, but it seems to be teh suck.  Never made Deep Cavern either, as I have never hunted/foraged in Guk.  Some pieces MAY sell, but I highly doubt it.  The frosted chain is simply worthless.  Only people ever interested are the SKs and they would rather have plate :bookworm: .  I guess that goes without saying, but you'd be suprised at how many people I've seen in the bazaar just sitting on frosted chain for a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jasmyn Spirittapper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Have had several requests to make the Gothic Chain for people making new beserkers since the expansion came out, I don't charge for it, for it has only been guildies, however, I could see it going pretty good, lots of people making the new class,,,want some armor to cover them that has no lvl requirement.<br />
<br />
Just a thought</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shaman need are similar to necros in that they tend to need hp/STA as much or more than they need their supposed primary stat (WIS &amp; INT, respectively).<br />
<br />
I know my lowbie shaman has a few pieces of gothic ringmail as part of her everyday outfit, and only uses sandblasted for a tradeskill suit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ZealSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd sell it the same way I sell acrylia chain and plate, making the pieces with stats that are hard to get in other ways. gothic has about the same stats in any slot, really useful if you have a target +mr or +sta goal. sandblasted could also be useful in some situations for hitting a target.  ldon armors can also hold more augments than other smithed armors can if your clients are going for customization. finally, remember to make armor in different sizes, even taking custom orders if necessary so it fits your clients.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The problem with LDON armor, is that if you sell it to a vendor, they will sell it back for LESS then it costs to make.<br />
<br />
Its nearly impossible to make a profit off of it, because if you want the armor, anyone can just vendor dive near forges and buy some for less then anyone would put it up in the bazaar for.<br />
<br />
Best you can probably do is sell it for more then a vendor will give you for it, but less then what a vendor offers for it.<br />
<br />
Which aint much.<br />
I just put a set it on a twink and vendored the rest. Meh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't tend to skill up by doing masses of combines.. first time around I made a few of each of the pieces that seemed to be popular and replaced it as it sold. I buy gothic and sandblasted pieces from merchants quite often to sell.<br />
<br />
I'm in no hurry :) I like to make money, I've got no deadline for maxing smithing ;)<br />
<br />
I only go the make-collars-and-vendor route with the really unpopular tempers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I sold a bunch of Large &amp; Small Gothic &amp; Deep Cavern Ringmail while getting my Paladin's smithing up.<br />
<br />
Why?  Because my Paladin had a bunch of supplies to make Humming Orbs... but not the skill to make them. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>AKUSHA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Don't forget some people aren't buying to wear but to donate for tribute favor points.  Check the tribute value of what you plan to make...it could influence your choice one way or the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ZealSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I almost never see the ldon components up for sale, I only saw mm granite once at 190pp each and I bought all 4 the trader had to fill some holes in resist gear on my paladin. when I went on ldons nobody seemed to know or care about the foraged components, and maybe 1 piece of granite dropped during a 90 minute mission.  everyone always wants to do either mistmoore or miragul anyway since they are easy, full of undead, and have good armor and ft augs you can buy.<br />
<br />
if I could find the components then I could probably sell certain pieces for 1000-2000pp each guessing from acrylia sales which is respectable enough. perhaps I will have to vendor farm pok (which always manages to eat up all my smithing profits) and the vendors near the camps.<br />
<br />
some people on my server seem to have forgotten how much acrylia is worth, bought like 100 small pieces off the vendors today as well as about 10 of every size of brick and maybe 40 windstones. this blew through several thousand kpp but I am already making this back from my trader in bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>StPatrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Both gothic ringmail and plate armor sells pretty good on Stromm - actually this is the way I make profit, though it is already trivial (221 smithing skill). Actually ringmail returns much more money than plate armor, as I can go and farm Fine Steel weapon (I do it from lizzards in Feerott new CT entrance).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zeralenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I sold a TON of LDoN armor, mostly chain tops, leggings, and sleeves, in sizes large and small only, in gothic, deep cavern, and calcified, right after berserkers came live. It sold like crazy. I ended up making over 40k profit on it.<br />
<br />
However, that was the berserker twink craze when anything berserker wearable was selling as fast as it could be sold. <br />
<br />
I made about 2/3 size large, 1/3 size small and as it turned out I wished I'd made them half and half. I figured dwarf berserkers would be popular, but not so popular they would outweigh all the other large races, particularly cats and barbarians. I was wrong.<br />
<br />
...Zera</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>FeroceFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you make this stuff to-order, you'll find some nice prices.  People like being able to tailor their twink's stats.  LDoN armor is THE base-line twink armor to get in the game.  Some particular items might get swapped in, but it forms the basis for all the armor you'll need for about 35 levels.</div></div><hr />
