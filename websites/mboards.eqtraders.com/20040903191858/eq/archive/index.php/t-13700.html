<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am fairly sure that folks have already done this but has anyone tried to make elemental arrow shafts lately? <br />
<br />
One would have to guess at the recipe but with GoD and the new tradeskill ui comming this just started me thinking about the &quot;missing&quot; arrow recipe.  Not the PoJ one. The one that was reportedly hinted at by a dev at a fair fair a while back but post pop. Was reported on the ranger boards started folks looking at the PoJ thing all over again. The possible existance of the arrow has been bugging me so wanted to get confirmation that there are no elemental arrow shafts make with something like temper + metal + mold, or some such variation. <br />
<br />
Did some hunting using search but could not find anything if someone knows a back thread I should look please point me at it. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Osprey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I haven't heard of any reason to even suspect anything like this exists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karloss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Devs posted on rangerglade and (supposedly) mentioned at fan fair that there is an unfound arrow recipe thats better then all current arrows...<br />
<br />
Lots of rangers waiting in anticipation of the new tradeskill UI uncovering it.<br />
<br />
From the old traders forum<br />
Centaur in PoJ talks about an arrow he made:<br />
<br />
Shaldyn Thunderhoof smiles. 'The arrow of course. Mundane materials would not have been sufficient to hold the enchantments necessary to get this bow to perform as he requested. I had Rhionn gather the materials I needed, the claw of a black drake, feathers from the Spiroc Lord, and a dracolich bone for the shaft. I had no idea what he would [use it for].</div></div><hr />
