<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Monual</div><div class="date">12-31-2002, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, almost a GM Smith.  Current adjusted skill is 250.  This will get updated as I get more skill-ups.<br />
<br />
Currently I am only taking orders on Heraldic armor.  The armor I can make is listed here:<br />
<br />
http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/smithing_stats_human_qeynos.htm<br />
<br />
Please carefully note the race and deity restrictions.  If I make it for you and you find you can't equip it, it's your loss, I'm afraid.  On the upside, in that situation you will probably be able to resell it.<br />
<br />
Currently, my prices are:<br />
<br />
30K for Breastplates, Greaves, and Cloaks<br />
20K for Belts, Helms, Gauntlets, Pauldrons, and Vambraces<br />
10K for Bracers, Visors, Gorget, and Boots<br />
<br />
Payment is due in advance.  It may take a day or two to do the combines, depending on my availability.  On a good day, you'll get the piece you ordered in a couple of hours.<br />
<br />
I invite feedback in this thread about my services.  Feel free to ask around about my reputation - I think it's pretty good.  I definitely will not rip you off.<br />
<br />
If you've collected all the ingredients for Heraldic Armor (there are *lots* of ingredients you need, you'd be surprised) and simply want me to hit &quot;combine&quot; a few times, I'm perfectly willing to do so - for a price.  Talk to me, we can negotiate.  Currently, I'm thinking along the lines of 5K, 10K, and 15K depending on how many enchanted rings the item needs.  No charge if the combine fails.<br />
<br />
At this point, I am not taking orders on anything else - including Acrylia armor - unless you can collect all the pieces yourself, including whatever temper is needed.  We can discuss price then - I imagine it would be fairly low.  This would be highly dependent on my availability and inclination.  If you've got all the stuff and you can catch me in the bazaar or the PoK, I'd likely have no problems hitting &quot;combine&quot; for you.<br />
<br />
Send me a tell in-game if interested.</div></div><hr />

As a Barb smith my market isnt big enough to make lots of money, however 11k on one ring items (bracer etc) sounds too high to me. I sell the Tundra Helanic bracers at 9k per ring especially since BD prices dropped. However you might do ok since there is much more demand for your stuff. On the other hand there is at least one other human smith so you might have competition.<br />
The big problem I see on Drinal is noone has any platinum. I have people expressing interest in the Artificer's ringmail stuff but they just don't have the cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anothersmith</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is by no means a flame. I do wish to let you know since you asked if anything you did was possibly overpriced. =) Asking 5k for a combine for a anon person(s) is overpriced and beyond. I would love to say this is a single instance from yourself but friends and aquantances as well have mentioned it. This is where you lose the cash, /shrug we go elsewhere. Now this is not to say you do this for ordered items. I didn't bother checking into it following my asking you your prices. I went elsewhere paid 500 per successful combine and started smithing myself wherein i am now 200+ and climbing. I understand if you may have done this to discourage random combines for anon people but... in my case it just created future competition. <br />
<br />
Best future endeavors,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wold2</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">These days I charge around 20% of market value for combines if I feel like doing them. <br />
Go ahead and level up to 250, do some cheap combines on high priced items and see the person turn around and sell it for 20k when you got paid 500....then you'll see why. People love to exploit other people, charging a stiff combine fee discourages that .<br />
This topic has com eup many many times, lol opinions do differ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anothersmith</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe i already hit upon the high amount due to discouragement. Which is my opinion at a ridiculous amount is just silly..all you do is cause people to do it themselves and undercut you later. The fact that you do 20% isn't so bad. The fact that he did not bother to ask what i needed made and it was 5k period is a different story. FYI my skill will be used for my guild and friends which is plentiful. That is where the competition lies not in what i charge for combines. In any case...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reflan</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Smithing is one of the skills where when someone says, heck for that price I'll just skill up and make it myself, you can generally sit back and laugh and say, go ahead.<br />
<br />
I notice the same thing in elemental pottery.  People want you to charge trivial prices to make them multiple 30k items.  If they're friends, it's one thing to enable them to have uncommon or rare items to equip or make a huge profit from while getting virtually nothing in return.  For strangers...it might be asking too much.<br />
<br />
By the way, his prices have dropped a lot, just like everyone else's in the cultural market.</div></div><hr />
