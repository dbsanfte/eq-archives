<br />
 any tips?  yes 1 hide  3 stone bola weights ( not stack) 1 pattern</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if drop rate isn't horrid that isn't too bad at all.  depending on price of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eidolon Faer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've made these.<br />
<br />
Forget the Ta'Ruk Hides.<br />
<br />
2 MQ Cat or 2 MQ Wolf Pelts<br />
Bola Pattern<br />
3 Stone or Steel Bola Weights<br />
<br />
The Bola weights cost around 1 gold<br />
The pattern costs 1 plat and change.<br />
<br />
They're superb throwing weapons, trivial around 95-ish.  I just wish they stacked, they'd be marketable to Rogues.<br />
<br />
If you use Steel Bola Weights the range is 200 on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eidolon Faer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Knowing those boneheads at SOE, it takes two hides.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sabamiki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well i already have the High Quality Ra'Tuk Brute Hide so that is why i ask.<br />
<br />
<br />
 i guess i don't understand the weapon also.  does it act like a bow or it a bola=star  make 1 toss 1  make another toss another?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">think of them as thowing javelins.  these aren't stacking so prolly good for the people who are pulling and don't have an ele bow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>HallwinHaaryfeets</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would try 2 HQ hides and see if you get the combine.  The recipe on the boards only list 1 MQ wolf hide but you actually need two.<br />

Hallwin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Niellya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i guess i don't understand the weapon also Here's a RL description on what a Bola is (http://www.sportingcollection.com/misc/bolas/bolas.html).<br />
<br />
Not sure how the game handles them on whether one item gets used up per throw or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tibis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They don't stack?  Then they're worthless in my opinion except as a method for a tailor to increase their skill.<br />
<br />
If you're pulling, then range is the primary consideration.  If you want to do damage ... then use something other than thrown weapons.  And stacking is pretty much mandatory in both cases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They don't stack and they don't autofeed, so my friends who wanted them already said &quot;no thanks&quot;. And while the ones using the Ratok (?) hides can take special alchemyed potions (like a short-duration snare potion), they take not only the two rare hides to make, but a rare clay for the ceramic weight. So I'm afraid these won't turn out to be a useful item :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Suva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I made some last night that are supposed to use the shaman stun potions.  So being able to throw a potion to stun a mob isn't all that bad.  Experiemnted trying to get one to work for snare, but not successful as of yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Heh. Lets see. They dont stack. Are expendable. The stun ones require another non stack component, produced by a different class than most pullers. Yeah... nice job SoE. This recipe will get a lot of use. Has anyone asked if these things were supposed to create like a stack at a time? The safehouse has reported them changing around throwing ammo when equipped in the range slot, and hypothesized that they are supposed ot be some kind of bow for throwing weapons, adding procs to them. Not that it makes a lot of sense to throw a dagger with a bola, but hey, aligators riposte whip attacks, so anything goes in Norrath.  At least they would ahve some kind of purpose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Initial reports indicate that the stunning potions, of which there are 4 levels, are often resisted. <br />
<br />
Does anyone know if the stun effect is less resisted when the potions are combined with a bola?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Uinan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I may be wrong..<br />
<br />
I play a Ranger main, and i have Endless Quiver, only requiring one arrow for an endless amount...<br />
<br />
I was told that Berserkers get a similar AA for throwing?<br />
<br />
Perhaps that is what these are for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tasher Povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">no chance these are for zerkers, they arleady have stuns and snares through combat abilities at early lvls.  also their summoned throwing axes surpass these at lvl 35 or 40.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rombus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">They are for Berserkers, and they work like bows.  You put a throwing Axe in Ammo, and one of these in Range, and get added range / damage / proc (for the ones that have it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">When I put one on my rogue it didn't seem to add the range. Believe me, the difference between bola range and shuriken range is quite noticable. So either it's a bug and they're supposed to work like bows, or they're nonstackable highly lame throwing weapons (for what they take to make in addition to the non-stacking issues they're not all that). It would be nice to know for sure which they intend them to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Heartsong_Steelsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I don't think putting something else in range will help - Bolas aren't things to help throw other items, they are things to throw.<br />
<br />
Now, if it were - argh, can't remember the name.  It's a curved piece of wood used for throwing spears with great force.  I don't remember the name, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Atlatl? And I agree, when I first saw people saying bolas were supposed to be the bows of throwing I thought it didn't make much sense since an atlatl or sling would make more sense in that way. Plus they do love to brag about new features, they'd probably put it in a patch message if throwers got bow-type implements.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you sure this is true?<br />
<br />
Has anyone actually tested these out to see if they act like a bow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Aparently the one with the stun proc at least lets you throw the shaman throwable potions 200 range instead of the shorter normal range that they throw at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Eidolon Faer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I looked up the Shaman-Made Stunning Concoctions on Lucy.  (For you nonspellcasters, Lucy is the site that parses data on spells in great detail.)<br />
<br />
The Stunning Concoctions are 0-second stuns.<br />
<br />
That means they will interrupt spellcasting and generate lots of hate but not actually DO anything to the critter.<br />
<br />
The Fire DD procs from the other type of bolas / potions is like 65 points of damage for the highest level effect.<br />
<br />
Executive Summary:  Don't bother.  It's not even a good skillup path.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ok I tested the idea that Bolas worked like a bow for my shaman using the shaman potions.  I equipped a bola in my range slot, but found that potions could not be equipped in the ammo slot.  When I equipped a potion in the range slot and a bola in the ammo slot I was able to throw the potion, but not with any distance.<br />
<br />
Also, if I had a bola equipped in both the range slot and ammo slot, I threw the bola in the range slot, but there was no autofeed from the ammo slot.<br />
<br />
I did not test the bola with some other throwing item in the range slot (like a throwing hammer).  Bottom line is, I doubt that bolas are used like a bow to throw anything.  Rather, they are throwing items themselves.<br />
<br />
I don't have the tailoring skill to combine a potion with a bola.  I'm wondering if there are more bola recipes than those currently listed on the EQTC data base.  When I made my bolas, I used medium quality cat skins, and the recipe showed up as &quot;Bola(cat)&quot; in my trader window.  I didn't have medium quality wolf skins or high quality ra'tuk brute hides available to try the others.<br />
<br />
I'm also wondering if there are recipes that allow you to combine  shaman throwing potions other than stun with bolas (e.g., snare concoctions).  Additionally, are there recipes that would use cat skins instead of high quality ra'tuk brute hides to make a bola with a shaman potion effect?  Has anyone tried this?<br />
<br />
My final comment is that the bola-shaman potion recipes appear to me to be a work in progress rather than a finished product.  The lack of stackability and autofeed are something that presumably should have been completed before these were released.  Furthermore, one would think that a bola made with a common item such as a medium cat hide would have less of an effect than one that was made with a hard to get item like a high quality ra'tuk brute hide (these drop in GoD zones, first one I saw was in Vxed, but I haven't spent much time there).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use mine exactly how he says it on my berseker. I put the bola in the range slot and the summoned axes in the ammo slot. When you click range it throws the axes. I havent tried making any of the special ones yet. I am hoping that somewhere in GoD they actually have them with stats. It does seem to increase the range but since axes have 150 range it's not much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Eidolon Faer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Okay...<br />
<br />
I've made them with both 2 MQ cat pelts and 2 MQ wolf pelts.<br />
<br />
You get two separate recipies listed in the new UI window, one is something like  Bola (MQ Cat) and the other is Bola (MQ wolf).  Both recipies had the same trivial level.<br />
<br />
Now, as for the bolas with special effects:<br />
<br />
I've seen the clay drop in Tipt off from mobs that hit for well over 1k.  If the hides also have to be farmed in high-level zones, then there is simply no way in heck anyone would ever waste the time to make a one-shot throwing weapon that is heavy, doesn't stack, doesn't autofeed, requires absurd farming, only makes one item per combine, and doesn't proc a 4000 point DD.<br />
<br />
The regular bolas are just-barely-plausible as pulling weapons, since at least all of the raw materials stack and they have a good range.  Sure, you have to carry a sewing kit, but so what?<br />
<br />
The magic bolas might be cool if there was a class that has the Throwing equivalent of Endless Quiver AA available.  But as far as I know, there isn't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This seems to me to be a bug.  What you're describing is a sling, not a bola.<br />
<br />
Are you sure that the distance is greater for an axe thrown with a bola equipped in the range slot?  Or is this just an impression?<br />
<br />
I'll see if I can test this out to see if there really is a difference.<br />
<br />
Also, do bolas work like this using other kinds of throwing items?</div></div><hr />
