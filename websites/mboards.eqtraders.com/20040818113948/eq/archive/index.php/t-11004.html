<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aruzdail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So there will be no new recipes for pottery in LDoN?  I haven't seen much discussion on this and was wondering.  I see recipes in most of the other tradeskills.  I'm just wondering if we were missed accidently or on purpose. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, there's no pottery or tailoring in this expansion.  As a 250 potter, I am grateful, as the new recipes only add more 250s to the pot.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Durgle Fogstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, there's atleast 1 tailoring recipe so maybe there are some hidden pottery recipes as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thicket Tundrabog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are significant numbers of tradeskill forages and drops in LDoN with no known recipe. Maybe some are used for pottery.<br />
<br />
Also Geodes and Amethysts may have a pottery recipes. These have jewelcraft recipes but also have a 'pottery' smell to them... Lol.<br />
<br />
Do some combine experimenting. Maybe you'll be the first to discover a cool new tradeskill recipe.<br />
