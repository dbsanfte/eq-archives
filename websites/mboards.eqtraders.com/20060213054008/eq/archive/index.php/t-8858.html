<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khaarq</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am in the market for the following (stacks or singles, doesn't matter):<br />
Permafrost Crystals<br />
High Quality Metal Rings<br />
Small Brick of Acrylia Ore (other sizes as well. I can convert them)<br />
<br />
I'm also looking for 2 quest gems (non-tradeskill):<br />
Greenscale Emerald and Hope Diamond.<br />
<br />
If you have any, or find any while merchant mining, please give me a holler here or in game so we can work out the details.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you using EB Maces for smithing or do you use the Blood Tempers? I think I have some of both laying around collecting dust.<br />
<br />
I also need to get off my lazy duff and list all the PoP trade supplies I have amassed.<br />
<br />
Oh, and an update on the quest gems:<br />
After a 4.5 hour camp of wiping out the goblin fort in WW, I now have the Greenscale Emerald. I am still looking for the Hope Diamond.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mileron</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 07:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hope Diamond, as I mentioned, is a Twilight Sea armor quest component.<br />
<br />
It drops in DSP:<br />
Hope Diamond  	Enchanter  	Cloak  	Dawnshroud Peaks, optimistic stonegrabber<br />
It's for the enchanter cloak, and drops from the optimistic stonegrabber.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khaarq</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hope Diamond is also for a PoK quest: Drelynn's Gem Collection (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2191) which results in a Fine Antique Veil (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16650). :) <br />
<br />
The gem is not flagged as no drop, so it could be sold or traded, which is what I meant by &quot;I am still looking for the Hope Diamond.&quot; I've done the homework on how to obtain the HD as a drop, and so far have had no success with getting the named Stonegrabbers to start spawning. If anyone sees this item on a merchant or in the Bazaar for a reasonable price, please pick it up for me. I'm willing to pay up to 200pp for it. I have seen some of the other gems for this quest on merchants for between 2 and 5 gold, so I'm hoping that they follow the same price scale with the HD.</div></div><hr />

I am, however, looking for Permafrost Crystals, High Quality Metal Rings, and Acrylia Ore still.</div></div><hr />
