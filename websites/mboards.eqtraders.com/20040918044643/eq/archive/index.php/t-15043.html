<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ChaseFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know. It's no longer the end of the tradeskill road, thanks to New Tanaan AA. But Chase has existed, and been tradeskilling since 10/8/01, the day the FV server opened. I'll avoid reminiscing about all the changes I've seen, and how different things are in the day of the ultra-rich who can buy their way to the top. I was a stubborn ass who did things the hard way. And I'm finally done. For now. I just needed to share with some people who'd understand.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Congratulations!  You made 1450 before I did.  And remember, trophies sell for 20k, so don't overlook those gems!  At 1450, you've got everything you need except making the vial of purified mana.<br />
<br />
Again, well done.  I'm jealous.  See you at 1750.  Probably also before me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BienaFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Congrats Chase<br />
<br />
Still remember when you showed me the way from halas to Freeport.<br />
Still remeber the days you spent hunting for supplies.</div></div><hr />
