<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I decided to try the new tradeskill interface by skilling up my halfling from 195 to 200.<br />
<br />
He collected 5 empty deluxe toolboxes and bought:<br />
<br />
 15 stacks of malt<br />
 10 stacks of short beer<br />
 10 stacks of water<br />
   5 stacks of yeast<br />
   5 stacks of casks<br />
<br />
for 100 combinations of Minotaur Hero's Brew.<br />
<br />
First, he had to use the &quot;Experiment&quot; button to bring up the old brew barrel interface to successfully make Minotaur Hero's Brew.  When he succeeded, he got a message telling him that the recipe had been added.<br />
<br />
After that, he opened the new interface and whipped out Brews in three clicks (one click for the Combine button and two clicks to autoinventory the results).<br />
<br />
He needed 155 combinations to reach 200 with a Wisdom of 229 (D'oh!  I forgot to exchange his charisma gear for wisdom gear!)  I may take a little time to skill up one of my mules to 250 since he's stuck at 200 until he levels above 50 and can earn some AA points.<br />
<br />
I like the new interface, but I'm sad about how much more easy it has made grandmastering brewing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kenamena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Took me 90 mins to go from 200 to 248 with MHB. INT at 280. Did it in Nariak FQ - all within a few steps and all the containers were perma-camped in PoK yesterday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bennan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I like the fact that I can zoom through brewing baking etc much quicker now, as in being 250 and making stuff for sale.<br />
<br />
For that I am happy to trade off the fact its so much easier to get to 250 now.  Well at least until the bazaar has about 100 traders selling the stuff I make at least ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fystz O'Malley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sadly I haven't had a chance to use the new UI yet, but my thoughts on it?.....NICE.  My main is a Human Monk, and he is also my primary TS'er, as such it is VERY hard to get his wisdom up as high as most of the people I see posting their skill up runs.  So while it may take you 200 combines to get a skill up with 255 WIS, it would take me MANY MANY more combines to skill up with my almost 200 WIS (thats with my TS gear on as well, lol)  So the less clicks it takes me on those MHB's all the better for me:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">after spending a while in pok (had grabbed a lot of short beer in erudin) i started minos at 186.  then i went back to erudin and when i came back the barrel was taken.  decide to head to halas to see if its open.  OMG it was.  nobody was at it and i barely had to move to restock.  its everything i was told it would be.  :) woot.  200 brewing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">don't forget you can set a hotkey to say<br />
<br />
/autoinventory<br />
<br />
and just push that button on your hotkey bank. so it becomes 1 click to combine, push a button to drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>scarbrowed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I guess I'm missing something here. The Autoinventory button is right below the Combine button on the new UI. Is this a problem with custom UI's? I've been afraid to try anything but the default one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i am so sick of clicking =p mapping /autoinventory to a button to push in my hotkey bank is much nicer for me than clicking. takes it from 2 clicks to just one click on combine, and a button push to drop the item. <br />
<br />
the autoinventory button works exactly the same way, but it's another click. hoping this mouse i just bought will last longer than a carton of milk, thanks to fewer clicks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>MistrOrnge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I took my cleric from 188 to 248 in a few hours sitting in a single room in Abyssmal Sea.  Water, casks, brew barrel, and the various brewing items are all within about 20 feet of each other.<br />
Later I came back and skilled up my shaman's alchemy from 1 to 200 in a few hours as well.   Very cheaply at that.   One of the new recipes costs less then 8pp a failure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I skilled up my brewing, the old fashioned way... before casks stacked! LOL And my baking was 250 before the new UI as well...<br />
<br />
However, I gotta say, the new UI RAWKS for subcombines!!! OMG!<br />
<br />
I also used the new UI to help with my smithing skill ups. I've done some acrylia chain, and a TON of LDoN armors in the last 2 weeks. Not that there's THAT many sub-combines there, but it sure was nice to only have to click 2-4 times per attempt, as opposed to about 20 times per attempt.<br />
<br />
Yes, this makes it easier for people to skill up in general... <br />
<br />
Yes, I expect a few more GM's, or at least more 220+ AG people...<br />
<br />
However, for the convenience of it, and the reduction of pain to SO many peoples wrists... I find I can accept that. :)<br />
<br />
/hugs SOE developers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ZealSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">it still took me about 5 hours to go from 134 to 200 with 150 or so int.  it would have been really painful to do that the old way, but now all the temper combines are trivial. why not 250? smithing will go over 200 first, then others when I get more aaxp for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">New UI ROCKS!!!<br />
<br />
Working up my brewing, although with a 127 wis AFTER KEI and what wis gear I can afford, it is taking me a LONG time.  Still stuck in the 180s and can't seem to get it to go anywhere even with like hundreds of combines.  I guess if there's any suggestions on tradeskill gear I'd be more than grateful.</div></div><hr />
