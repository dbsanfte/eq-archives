Does anyone know if this is true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">doedel</div><div class="date">12-07-2002, 02:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some months ago the recipe was bugged, and yes you could smith the thread easily instead of using tailoring.<br />
But this bug only lasted a few days was fixed very fast, so no more thread smithing. But with Verants inablity of proper sourcecode management i wouldt be surprised if that bug would show up again after a patch....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaman Arriana</div><div class="date">12-07-2002, 03:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This &quot;bug&quot; came out when the Cabbage Earring quest was put in. The thread was used on the fishing pole. Someone at VI was looking through the database to see if there was a &quot;thread&quot; he could use, so he could score points with the bosses for database conservation, and he picked the spool of coldain thread, and then put in a trivial recipe for it, not realizing that it had another use already.<br />
<br />
I banked 5 spools on a just-in-case basis, being heavily-pro giant at the time. Now I have shoulders that might just be better than the 8th shawl, so I might end up destroying them for bank space soon. Buggered things don't stack.</div></div><hr />

I got my 7th as well, but I still haven't destroyed the three remaining spools. I am just too ****ed paranoid. he he</div></div><hr />
