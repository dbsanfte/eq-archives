<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aquila Swiftspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello Tailoring Gurus,<br />
<br />
I'm at a point in tailoring where doing some acrylia studded seems like a good idea (I already have some hides; skill 181 in tailoring).<br />
<br />
But, I've never gotten to know Luclin especially well (when it opened, my old computer had such lag that I could barely move there, so I never willingly went; I got a new computer about the time PoP opened, so...)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'd appreciate suggestions for hunting acrylia.  I'm a 65 druid.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mendan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The alien type guys that wander in TM also have a decent acrylia drop rate, are very easy at 65, and drop some decent vendor loot as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">there are a couple long threads already done up here on where to find acrylia... you might want to do a search for &quot;acrylia&quot; and get all the hints for aquiring it.</div></div><hr />

I suggest root/doting all the miners in the tunnel to Acrylia Caverns  <br />
<br />
This used to be a great spot for the people not big enough to handle things in Acrylia Caverns...right up until they &quot;revamped&quot; the zone and took the miners out.  Now it's a bunch of melee types - still drop the runes, and on occassion a windstone, but I haven't seen acrylia drop there since that revamp.  Or am I just looking in the wrong place?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>filobeto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I still get the bricks and the like from there, but it's not very common.  BUT, spend enough time there and your bags will be full of vendor stuff, sell it, then step into the bazaar and buy all the acrylia you can now afford.<br />
<br />
Easy enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aquila Swiftspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks all!<br />
<br />
I SHOULD have thought to do a search before I asked, of course!<br />
<br />
I've done that now; thank you for the suggestion for that, and the more direct suggestions of hunting places.<br />
<br />
Remember when tailoring because you could make yourself some studded leather armor was AMAZING!??!!?!<br />
<br />
It doesn't seem as ummmm hopeful as it did then.</div></div><hr />

Welcome to tailoring :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aquila Swiftspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's been two years+... it just really used to be amazingly cool that I could get a ruined cat pelt (usually after a near epic battle with a puma or something) and actually have a chance to make a piece of armor that was either an upgrade to some dropped cloth, OR covering a previously bare place.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I got 6 skill ups in 29 combines of platinum ribbons today!<br />
<br />
I think the good karma from a kind friend giving me 32 dyes she had AND helping me AE tons more Drolvargs made the rng love me.   Now she gets her dyes back with extras :)</div></div><hr />
