<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seksi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a lvl 57 cleric, and after reading these boards searching trivial lists, I still cant figure out how the best way for me to get to 209 ( I eventually would like 250 but want to wait until I finish the shawl quest and my epic)  My cleric is my only character above 25 and I only have one account.  I can solo things but it can take forever.  I was really wondering what other clerics found the best for 120's to 200.  I dont mind the  farming, but its difficult competeing with people who have track for silks and pelts.  Any suggestions from any other clerics?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As a cleric you can AE fairly easily.  I'm not sure about spiders in CC but definately you can AE in ek, just remember to pull everything and not just spiders or your respawn rate will die off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seksi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow .. thanks.  I have never actually thought of using my AoE.  I dont think I have ever even bothered to mem the spell.  No wonder it takes me forever.  Thanks again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm also a cleric, and at 165 tailoring now.    The suggestion above is wonderful for farming, and I strongly suggest you dust off Strike for pulls and Upheaval for finishing kills in Eastern Karana.  However, don't forget your Word spells for use in the Commonlands as well, since you'll get piles of pelts and silks.  You can even wind up the low-end stuff and head to Everfrost, but that takes a bit more time.<br />
<br />
Why would you want to kill greens in EC and Everfrost, you ask?  Well, one skillup that I used, that a lot of folks skipped, are the folded medicine bag and the folded bearskin potion bags.  They trivial at 136 and 162 respectively, and make for a skill path that doesn't rely on dye components.<br />
<br />
Speaking of dye components, there's another use for low end AE: kobolds in Steamfont.  They drop Steamfont Spring Water, which (when converted to steam dye) will get you to 162 using gold ribbons and 182 with platinum.  Expensive, but doable if you have the bankroll.<br />
<br />
After that, it's off to Dawnshroud with you to pacify pull and pet-fight rockhoppers.  At least you can use your Upheaval on the Sambatas for acrylia while you're there.  Good luck hunting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seksi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the ideas, I have been increasingly frustrated the past couple weeks.   Was beginning to think I just needed to make druid.  I am really thankful for your advise, because I really like playing my cleric alot .. she is the only character i have ever gotten above 25 :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can also go do Upper Guk spiders (slower drop rate), but if you are a Tunare cleric and plan on doing solstice robes, bring your emeralds with you to imbue between spawns and celestial essence stuffs to combine...farm a little, imbue a little, combine a little. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>munwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just tough it out. save componants till you get enough to do 100 combines. (eg. 100 Supurb hopper hides) For quiet easy farming root/nuke the Tigeraptors in WL for a couple days. But my best advise is wait till you got 100 attempts of something before going and trying to skill up instead of running to your local tailoring merchant to get patterns every time you get a stack.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Leewei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you intend to do the 8th shawl, skill of around 170ish is fine.  With a Geerlok, you'll probably be at 95% success trying any combine you need to make.  Repeating a step once or twice is certainly less work than raising skill past the point where Wu's is trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Meirril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If all your skilling up for is the shawl combines stop at the end of Wu's. Most everybody can brute force the 6th shawl in 3 combines or less and its alot less farming trying to come up with siren's hair than the materials to get you to 200. (your talking the diffrence between 1 hour of farming for hair, and hundreds of hours farming combines from 154-200. Also the farming from 154-200 is much, much, much harder that getting 154)<br />
Also, at 154 you have a very high chance of succeeding at the 187 combine of soft fur padding (or is it 178? just doing this from memeory). Again, its faster to farm more fur (get 1 for every 3 kills generaly. Depending on what people are after you can find anywhere from 3 to 12 wolves in the zone at any time. Brontos, mamoths, and ice burrowers are on the same spawn) than skilling up. If nothing else, you could drop 8k in the Bazaar on Fennin Ro and get 16 furs. Your guarenteed to get the 8 successes you'll need (and probably a skill up).<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you plan on GMing the skill just stick with AE farming EK. Collect pelts from wolves and cats, selling them can make you some plat for emeralds and chains so you can do solstice robes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Seksi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I tend to agree with you, however I intend to GM tailoring anyways, just going to wait til later.  I want to work all my skills up.  I think it adds a new dimension to the game.  Not sure how soon I want to do that though.  I may go ahead and try for the combine soon.  Especially since I already have everything for the next combine.  Was hoping to get to 200+ before I did it though.<br />
<br />
Thanks for everyones advice.  It has been really helpful.<br />
