<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dmuerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yesterday i started out with a rank of 200 in pottery with enough tainted essence for 372 combines.  After 2 hours of clicking i was only able to get to 206.  At the time i had 355 int (more like 455 with items) and kei on.  <br />
<br />
IS there somethign funky going on with the new ui or was i just having one very bad run with the RNG?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mitsune Foxfire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">~80 combines for each skill up is not so bad. You are doing good :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think kind of a bad run - I am averaging around 40 or so with wis at 265.  Granted I had a run of about 140 for skill point.   So it sounds kind of typical from what other folks see.  <br />
<br />
Not sure if others had the same experience but the range from about 185 to 210 always seemed particularly slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lanalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Once you get out of the pottery hell levels, it'll get better.<br />
<br />
I had, on average, 50 combines per skillup from about 180-220. From 221-243, I've had about one skillup every 20 combines with 355 wisdom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daeanor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bad run. I did the identical skill up range - from 201 to 206 with about 150 combines, and an int of 280. 130 combines later (tainted essence is getting scarce, everyone seems to have the smae idea), not one increase...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dmuerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Does having over max int hurt your chances of skilling up? Im at 355 int atm, more like 455 if the max allowed it.  Aka does it flip?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Clauyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A dumb question it must be. How to get int above 255?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litetta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You need to be 61+ to start. Int/Wis cap goes up by 5 per level starting at 61. So at 65 caps would be 280 without any AA. Beyond that you get to spend AA's. All classes get planar power, which will raise all stat caps by another 5 points, 5 levels available. Int/Wis casters also get Innate Enlightenment which raises the int/wis cap by 10 per rank, 5 ranks. So after spending lots of AA's, you can raise cap by another 75 with those AA's maxxed out, bringing total cap to 355.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zolina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I had a run of 100 white ceramic bands yesterday with no skill-ups.  305 Wis too.</div></div><hr />

Wow, its getting full...</div></div><hr />
