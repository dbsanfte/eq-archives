<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lushissx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, we have the formula and all is great. Was anything else discussed at FF? How about the list of questions? Was there any other news?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sylphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Many things were discussed, including just about everything on the list in the FF questions thread.  KyrosKrane took notes throughout and I promised to let him post his report before adding mine.  He probably emailed his information to the Sony tradeskill folks to let them proofread it before posting here... and now he's on another trip; maybe he'll post when he returns.<br />
<br />
BTW, the folks on the panel read our list of questions both on these boards and in email.  At times they seemed even more familiar with the list than we were.  They had time to respond both before and after the FF.  Yet they still made us stand in line a dozen times and use up much of the two hours of the panel to ask those questions.  Makes you wonder.  But it's hard to complain -- even that's more responsive than what we're used to by now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaysha Soulsinger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Any idea when KyrosKrane will be back? I am kinda anticipating the report as well :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Angahran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Been trying to find any information about what happened at the fan faire.... and failing.<br />
<br />
As far as I can find, nothing happened apart from a lot of people got drunk, and SoE were showing off EQ2.<br />
<br />
Maybe people are still getting over hangovers and will post something soon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mewkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Has the Fan Faire NDA been lifted yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just got back home (it's 2:30am here) and checked my email; I have the response from the devs.  I should have some info posted within an hour.<br />
<br />
I can say that Sylphan's formula is correct according to my notes; in fact, it applies to ANYTHING that can get a skillup, not just tradeskills.  Different skills have different difficulty modifiers, of course, some has high as the 50's.<br />
<br />
More than this ... wait for my post in about an hour or so. &lt; evil grin &gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">OK, write up part 1 is here:<br />

Part two will have to wait until I can get some sleep. =)</div></div><hr />
