Stability Issues Update<br />
Greetings Norrath,<br />
<br />
Our Operations and Development teams are aware of the current stability issues and they are working, as you read this, to resolve them.  In an effort to resolve this issue, the servers will be coming down at 3AM PST for an update on December 23rd.  We extend our apologies for this ongoing issue and thank you for your patience while we resolve these problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Turns out there was an emergency patch at 2pm as well.  (That patch is over now.)  Can't help but wonder why things have gotten so funky as of late, but it's good to see that they're on top of things.<br />
<br />
Besides, I'm having a field day with the vendor mining opportunities. :D  Got me a couple of stacks of blue diamonds off various vendors, and those have been uncommonly rare of late, too. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, that's probably what it was! LOL<br />

Regardless, I sure hope they get it straightened out. :(</div></div><hr />
