I'm planning on making a few more in exec form so you could just download them and use them at anytime instead of haveing to be on the web. This *should* be very accurate still in its trial stages hehe..  This Calculator is for Sacred Tunare Silk  (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1464). I am looking for feedback on how you like these and which people would feel would be best used if i were to make more go here (http://addicted.to.everquest.la/sacredtunaresilk.aspx) to check it out!<br />
<br />

I would expect that in a reasonable time (within 6 months) there would be some sort of calculator like this available via the database.  So given that, I'd focus my efforts on reporting the buy/sell pricing.  Just my copper speaking tho.</div></div><hr />
