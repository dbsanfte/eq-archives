So far I've gotten pleanty of stormriders blood, enough sandstone pearls to do at least a few combines but still only 2 drops of pure rain. Off hand I think the one i looted dropped in the water wing but I wasn't really paying attention at the time. Haven't seen any drop since then even tho I've finished my tower key and even killed the tower named rescently. Anyone got any tricks they wanna share?</div></div><hr />

Mind you, we were not pulling ocean giants exclusively.  The drop rate is no horrible.</div></div><hr />

I have spent 5 hours straight doing nothing but ocean and seen 1 drop. I se an average of 1 drop every 3 hours of pulling ocean it seems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cantatus</div><div class="date">01-04-2003, 05:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">3 in 3 hours is really, really good.  I've camped the water wing exclusively a few nights and seen no drops of pure rain.  We've killed in the water tower to get to the boss like 5 times.  I have a total of 4 drops of pure rain and 2 I found on a vender.   :cry: <br />
<br />
I haven't camped them recently though, so hopefully the drop rate has increased slightly or I've been having horrible luck.</div></div><hr />
