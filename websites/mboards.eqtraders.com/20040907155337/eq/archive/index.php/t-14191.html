<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Halbarad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings all :)<br />
<br />
I am working on the shawl quests for my barbarian shaman bot and was wondering whether you would have some comments on a less painful skill path.<br />
<br />
So far, I intend to do:<br />
<br />
- Hooked Arrowheads (44)<br />
- Silver Tipped Arrowheads (79)<br />
- Condensed Shadow Arrowheads (116)<br />
<br />
(The arrowheads will be used for the fletching I need for 7th shawl)<br />
<br />
After that I am a bit lost, but was thinking about:<br />
<br />
- Ornate Chain Gorget (119)<br />
- Ornate Chain Bracelet (122)<br />
- Ornate Electrum Chain Gorget (126)<br />
- Ornate Electrum Chain Braclet (128)<br />
- Ornate Gold Chain Gorget (132)<br />
- Ornate Gold Chain Bracelet (135)<br />
- Ornate Chain Mail (142)<br />
- Electrum Ornate Chain Mail (148)<br />
- Gold Ornate Chain Mail (155)<br />
- Fine Plate Bracer (166)<br />
- Fine Plate Helmet (179)<br />
- Fine Plate Breastplate (188)<br />
<br />
After that would be the LDoN Plate?<br />
<br />
There should be some easier (less expensive) skilling paths now with the LDoN Recipes?<br />
<br />
I have a geerlok and try to keep my aimed trivial close to my skill to minimize costs.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
I have a 50 Ranger who could do farming-tracking and foraging for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">wow.  i reccomend you do not do that.  silver arrowheads and hooked cost more to make than to buy.  plus they are a lot more expensive than what is suggested in the guide so it will cost you more money.  <br />
<br />
go to the master guides forum.  master guide list.  look for zurren's guide to penny pinching.  its cheap and normally very quick.  <br />
shawl fletching trivial is 168 i beleive.  get a geerlock and 162 an you can skip silver arrowheads all together and save time and money.  <br />
royal velium armor for the shawl is about the same triv as fine plate.  grab a geerlock and triv fine plate and you should be good.  <br />
baking is fish fillets pok, fish rolls pok, and patty melts thurg and jaggedpine.  <br />
tailor its probably easiest and definetly quickest to make woven mandrake to 66.  farm greyhopper to 95 and then do crystalline silk then wu's.  wu's trivs at 158.  most people get 158 and geerlock.  its easier farming shawl stuff than raising tailoring more.  <br />
jc just look at quick triv list.  remember that gold and platinum might be easier to switch to cheap gems instead of gold ruby stuff go forr platinum malachite.  i recommend the guides for more info.<br />
<br />
please don't &quot;waste&quot; condensed substance arrow heads unless your are going above 202 fletching.  i have made a faq on fletching.  another guy made one on fletching just to get the shawl.  lots of good guides here.  normally not always but normally you are better off following the guides than trying to &quot;save&quot; money doing precombines for other things for skillups.  it might not seem that way until you really look though.<br />
<br />
edit. for your smithing needs. zerra's guide (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5968&amp;perpage=25&amp;pagenumber=1)</div></div><hr />
