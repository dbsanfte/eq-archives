<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turlo Lomon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I remember reading somewhere that all characters have a tinkering skill of 50, and that gnomes are the only ones available to raise it past it.  This was needed to allow people to combine batteries and such in toolkits to recharge items.<br />
<br />
So, a few questions..<br />
<br />
First, am I crazy?  <br />
<br />
Second, since the trivial for tinkering in GoD quests is relatively low, could a non-Gnome do the tinkering tradeskill quest and gain the ability to process dark matter?<br />
<br />
Ok.  Enough craziness for one day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1. No<br />
2. Yes<br />
<br />
3. Since you rae likely not to process lots of matter in the field, U might consider handing in the raw material to the guy instead at times u need it processsed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gnomes start with a base of 50 (and cannot raise until they hit 16th level).  I think non-gnomes start with a base of zero.  So you can try the combines, but you will be quite innefficient, even compared to simply starting a level 1 gnome whenever you need a combine done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rainingdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I like fireworks, and most of my toons carry the makings of at most times. We are looking at 2 combines, one at 15 and one at 50 and both seem to have an OK succes rate, maybe 25 - 50 % of the time, but I have never got a skillup and I don't think non-gnomes can skill up (it does not appear in the list of skills for non-gnomes so you can't even put points into it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sylphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm a high elf and I finished the quest in Abysmal Sea (I used illusion:gnome).  It took a very long time because with zero skill I failed the combines quite a bit.<br />
<br />
Then I found some raw dark matter and refined it.  I got 'You have learned the recipe Dark Matter(refine)!'<br />
<br />
But since I'm not a gnome I can't open the newfangled combine window on a toolbox.  So I'll never be able to actually use the recipe or add it to my favorites.  I'll just have to settle for experiment mode.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ROFL - 10 out of 10 for persistence.<br />
<br />
That quest takes a while when you do have skill I can only imagine how long it took you with a skill of 0.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>xanrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sylphan, When did you do this? I also am a High Elf and bought some gnome potions to try this. I am given the materials but when I go to do the combine, nothing happens. I click all I want on the combine button and nothing, no message, no error, no eating it no nothing. I can see a horrible failure rate but I get nothing at all. Even in gnome form it won't let me do the combine. Is there a difference in the responce to potion-gnome form vs spell-gnome form? I realy would like to do this but am at my wit's end about how to go about it.<br />
<br />
HELP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sylphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It worked for me because I finished it during the first week.  I've tried the alchemy and poisonmaking versions since that patch and, like you, been unable to even attempt the combines, with no message given at all.<br />
<br />
Even after today's patch which specifically states non-gnomes can't tinker, I can still refine dark matter and I did get the message about learning the recipe again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cerpicio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Originally posted by Sylphan <br />

<br />
The patch message I read stated non-gnomes can't use the deluxe toolkit, not that non-gnomes can't tinker.  I don't know why they would have specified that, but they did.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Axterix EnObelix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Probably to discourage people from using a deluxe toolbox as a bag.  With the new UI, once you have learned a recipe, you no longer need to have tradeskill containers empty to make items.  Which would mean very little penalty for using 1 toolbox to recharge tinkered items.<br />
<br />
Dumb change, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, I never really considered that as a benefit of the new UI.  Cool.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah, that feature is great as if your bag space is tight you can dump all the goods into toolbox stacked, change to the new UI and proceed as if it was empty. This even works if you grab a full toolbox out of the bank as the contents of the box have no effect on the new UI once you have learned that recipe.</div></div><hr />
