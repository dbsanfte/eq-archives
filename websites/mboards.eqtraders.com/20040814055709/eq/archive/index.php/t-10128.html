<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bralven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I went to that gnome in The Bazaar and hailed him to see what i needed to do to upgrade my JC trophy.  He said i needed to combine a glass shard, a silver bar, and my JC trophy in a jeweler's kit and it will be upgraded.  When i tried it it said that those items can not be combined. Anyone know if the gnome is telling me the wrong things to combine? or are the upgraded trophies not working?</div></div><hr />
