<br />
I'm trying to get my skill up and probably will be doing Acrylia Reinforced next as my skill is 193 now.<br />
<br />
Was wondering what pieces sell the best usually?<br />
I'm in a raiding guild and dont have too much time to spend on skilling as we raid every day. I try to get back as much PP as possible from skilling up. I dont have 100+kpp to spend :O.<br />
<br />
Do the flawless hopperhides drop from any other place than DSP cave btw?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vital</div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The hides also drop in mons letalis. On my server (TT) the sale of acrylia armor has gone steadily down, as the prices on components has risen beyond what is practical. Although it remains a feasible way to skill up, it is diffficult to sell at this time. Best bet would be search the bazaar and try to make the pieces which fewer people are making/selling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Liwsa</div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best selling pieces I have found are reinforced legs, boots, shoulders, and arms.  Most of the othe stuff sits forever until it sells.  I don't make it very often any more. I will probably start burning my stuff for skillups since it sells so poorly(200 for bracers, 500-750 other pieces).<br />
<br />
Rockhopper hides can also be gotten in scarlet desert.</div></div><hr />

I don't farm there because of the numbers of adds you can get while trying to farm in those areas.  This is probably the main reason why you see so many people in DSP at the Rockhopper/Sambata cave.  There are no other mobs to worry about for adds, except those darned irritating wolves or the trained mushrooms *grrr* *snicker* So farming is relatively easy.  And if the caves are anything like they are on my server, it's a Free For All, so no camp can be called by anyone.  Some people get irritated by that, but everyone seems to agree with it.<br />

There happened to be a 60+ character back there but I paid him no mind and pulled a Rockhopper out to my group.  A few minutes later I ran back in again and pulled another from the back.  This guy sent me a tell saying he had the camp in the back.  I replied that the Rockhoppers were considered FFA and that I could pull if I wanted to as anyone else could.  He then decided to leave the caves and go elsewhere because people were pulling mobs he thought was his hehehe<br />

I would sit next to The Grey zone line and rarely had problems.  The bugs are nonKOS (except the hatchlings) and the area is big enough that you can see the rocks.  The Rockhoppers there are also nonKOS.  The only problem is an occasional train from the tower.</div></div><hr />

I do not get to play a lot (why I'm trying to do tailoring I don't know.) I have been hunting the rockhoppers in SD for the last couple of weeks off-and-on. The con light blue and blue to level 50. As far as I can tell they spawn on the south side of the plateau and there are 4 or 5. I do not know the spawn time but it isn't that long. <br />
<br />
After killing between 150 and 200 of these beasts, I have:<br />
<br />
3 Flawless<br />
7 Superb<br />
9 HQ<br />
13 MQ<br />
11 LQ<br />
Countless damaged<br />
<br />
That would indicate that the drop percentage is around 5 percent. Not that great. But the good news is that I still get good experience off them.<br />
<br />
Regarding the difficulty of the zone - This character is a CT Erudite SK and is not KOS to the Revenants. This helps tremendously as I can wander all over looking for MOBs. The only thing that aggro's me are sunflowers, rockhoppers, and lightcrawlers...all of whom are usually spaced out and easily handled if aggro'd.</div></div><hr />

More than 20 of a single item on multiple traders indicate it is not moving that well, as a rule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BuzWeaver</div><div class="date">02-11-2003, 08:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I suppose there isn't a &quot;best&quot; place to hunt for Rockhopper Hides? I was in Mons and got two HQ in 20mins. I've not tried DP or SD. I don't suppose you guys have any suggestions on a &quot;best&quot; over all place?<br />
<br />
DP looks crowded, Mons can be a lot of agro, I've not tried SD yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Liwsa</div><div class="date">02-12-2003, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even with the overcrowding DSP is still the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pockets FullOfGold</div><div class="date">02-12-2003, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DSP is your best choice if Oldin's example of what drops in SD holds true.  The Rockhopper/Sambata caves in DSP may be crowded, but you can be guaranteed a hide almost every single kill.  I'd also say that, on average, you get an LQ, MQ, or HQ almost as much as you will get a Damaged.  Meaning that, if you get 10 Damaged Hides, more than likely you will have almost as many LQ, MQ and HQ hides.  Unless you run into a string of bad luck.<br />

I’m sure that the next time I go it will actually be crowded with people, I hope not.<br />
<br />
I checked it out last night during prime time play and no one was in the cave. I didn’t kill the named to get the rockhoppers because I wanted to stop here and see how it was done. Thanks again!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paldor</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since you are a druid I would suggest Mons Letalis.<br />
<br />
Killing rockhoppers will eventually make the &quot;Ancient Rockhopper&quot; spawn.<br />
<br />
This beast is an animal, level 52-53.. Hits for 146 and has 10,000 hp with a crazy high regeneration rate.<br />
<br />
He makes a perfect pet with Call of Karana, and has very low Magic resist.<br />
<br />
With this Pet I can kill any Adult/Mature Rockhopper in about 20 seconds or less..as well as clear out any annoying Rockfiend that aggros on me as well.<br />
<br />
Mons Letalis is also very un-camped, and the times I have been there I have been either solo.. or 3-4 others in zone.<br />
<br />
In 2 hours with a good pet I can get 10 flawless, and 10 superb on average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tsbaity</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found that all pieces sold eventually. I was lucky in that I was doing a big set of acrylia during the &quot;Froglok Twink Rush&quot;,  and they sold well. I tried keeping at least 2 full sets on my trader, and any extra hides I had made 1 boning recipes. Of those I find that the bracers sell the best on Lanys.<br />

I took my 65 warrior and my 65 cleric (had a shammy friend with me, but only to buff haste and such, since he was 52.  I would run deep into the caves and bring 5 or more hoppers slaughtered them... in the end it was quite the fun experience.  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PinyonTreedotter</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back to the original question:  What pieces should I make?<br />
<br />
The answer, of course, is all of them.<br />
<br />
When I was skilling through the lower 200s, I would keep 3 of all the pieces on my trader.  The only exception was the &quot;skillup&quot; combines (bracers, masks, etc).  I felt that many people come to the Bazaar with a list of several items to buy.  If I have all of them, they are more likely to buy from me, even if my prices are not the absolute lowest.<br />
<br />
Replace the ones that sell, and after a month, you will have made more of the ones that sell on your server than the ones that don't sell.  Keep the others on your trader after you are done with Acrylia, and you will eventually sell them.  Even if you don't, it will be a small fraction of the ones you have sold.<br />
<br />
This doesn't work, however, for items that are expensive to make -- unless you are rich enough to keep a full inventory.</div></div><hr />
