<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Angahran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Maybe I've got this wrong (I havn't got LDoN yet) but it seems that needing foraged items for these new potions is going to be a real PAIN.<br />
<br />
I've heard that the dungeons are timed, and you basically have to go full speed through to complete them.<br />
<br />
This dosen't seem to leave a lot of time to hang around foraging stuff. <br />
Add to that as an Iksar shaman my forage is capped at 50 the chances of foraging anything are slim.<br />
<br />
Add to this the fact you need a group, and the dungeons are leveled to the level of the group (so its not even as if you could go in and sit at the entrance forraging)<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that these new potions are going to be VERY rare (and I was looking forward to being able to make 10 shot invis potions for my wife who plays a cleric, and usually has a ten slot bag full of invis potions)<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll be proved wrong and these components will start appearing in other places ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm guessing that so many people have asked for alchemy components to be foraged that they finally got their wish....Now they'll see why the rest of us thought it was a stupid idea.  I am a barb, I can't forage.  Most of the people I group with don't bother foraging, I can't go forage there with my forage bot unless I actually exp with her, so for the moment I'm not planning on being able to make these potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jessikah Moonfyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am highly disappointed that our alchemy items are foraged.  Being a vahshir, I don't have that ability so I constantly have to beg group members to forage for me.  I've heard tales that the components drop - but after runs through 3 mistmoore dungeons I have yet to see any tradeskill items drop at all.  They're either a very very rare drop or forage only, sadly.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Edit by the DenMom:  This turned into a serious SOE-bash, and was likely to turn the entire post flammable.<br />
<br />
If you want to re-post your objections WITHOUT the confrontational SOE-bashing, you can do so, but please, make sure you're familiar with, and following, the posting rules clearly listed in the Visitor's Corner.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>drahcirior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Here's a little way around to get some more components (which I did NOT try yet, only speculating, but Im pretty sure it would work)<br />
<br />
Get your foraging mule (druid or ranger) to 20th level so he can start LDoN adventures;<br />
<br />
Get 3 other players to log mules between levels 20 to 28 (or 27, whatever the level limit in LDoN for groups is), so you get a party of 4 members (the minimum number of players in a group for adventures).<br />
<br />
Request an adventure at &quot;Adventure Recruiter&quot;, then move in the dungeon. At this point, your friends can log out their mules. Since they did not enter the dungeon, they are not getting a failure - only your foraging mule will get a fail, after spending 1h30 minutes at entrance foraging, PLUS the 30minutes for semi-success. After 2hours of foraging with a skill of ~105, you should have at least enough components for a 10-dose invis.<br />
<br />
If you are lucky enough to be an iksar, just let your group know at the end of any adventure, that you will stay in the dungeon during the extra 30min for gathering alchemy components.<br />
<br />
Also, at the beginning of your mission, ask rangers/druids/bards to save you the components they might get. By offering to pay them for these, you should get some stacks rather quickly if they maxed out their skills; after all, even if you offer 100pp a stack, it is still in range with our cheapest herbs.<br />
<br />
On a side note, there is no reason why we should be whining about a new option for getting our herbs. It would be bad if they changed ALL of the older recipes to require foraged items, but being allowed to get free components via mules/foraging groupmates seems to me like a great thing for us, and should help to regulate the market a bit... unlike those SoW potions that every twink/alt/mule/vendorizer/etc. are selling, taking the price down so much that its barely even worth making them.<br />
<br />
SOE did a great job on LDoN for once... AT LEAST, give em some credit on that one. (just for the hell of it, compare LoY to LDoN...ugh.)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aethn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Invis potion costs about 26pp to make, no one in there right mind would buy a 10 second cast 30-35pp (so you can get a profit) invis potion when they can go to at least 40 vendors and buy a 10pp5gp instant cast (while you are running) invis potion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All the items are selable, so check all the vendors at each camp and the usual places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hamner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aethn, you must have the ability to cast the spell invis, or you enjoy carrying bags of SINGLE shot invis potions. Take it from someone that has had as many as 4 of those fail as soon as they were cast, I'd MUCH rather have a bag full of 10 shots, cost be ****ed......</div></div><hr />
