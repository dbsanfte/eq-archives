But.....he was Human. I deleted him at lvl 20, and that was several months ago (September, I think).<br />
<br />
I've been considering recreating him, but as a DE (would go Iksar, but I hate having Kunark and Luclin as my only hunting options and don't like the fact that Iksar have lower Intelligence). Either deleting my Froggie Cleric (only lvl 4) to make room, or making him on the Stromm server. (I have the max 8 characters on The Rathe, but some are just used as storage toons. I only play my Magician regularly, and my Ranger, Monk and Druid sparingly)<br />
<br />
Do names recycle after a period of time so I'd be able to use the same name, or will I have to throw in two z's or r's in the middle of his name to use it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
My brother in law made a character on my computer when he stayed with us for a weekend once.<br />
<br />
By the time he went home he had a lvl 10 slightly twinked (at the time I thought very twinked with 200pp worth of gear) ranger.<br />
<br />
He bought the game himself and wanted the name, so he made a toon that was lvl 1, I gave all the stuff he had on the one from my computer to the lvl 1 toon.  <br />
<br />
Then I deleted the character.<br />
<br />
The next day he made a lvl 1 ranger with the same name on his account.  <br />
<br />
I just helped him with a quick item transfer and he was g2g.<br />
<br />
It probably could have been done in minutes, but we didn't try ;).</div></div><hr />

<br />
One of my friends petitioned to change his name.  It had been used at one time by someone else but was deleted, and once the name change was approved, he had to email server GM to have the name wiped from the server database.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: unless you're paying for it, once the name is lost, it's lost for good.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mystnife</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i like to play around with race / class combinations every now and then to see which ones i like, the name i usually use for this is Jotei, i find that i can keep a set of UI settings for that name and it makes everything easier 'cos all my windows are where i want them<br />
<br />
in the past three days, Jotei has been:<br />
<br />
Iksar Shadowknight<br />
Iksar Monk<br />
Iksar Beastlord<br />
Iksar Warrior<br />
Hafling Paladin<br />
Gnome Necro<br />
Darkelf Shadowknight<br />
<br />
and is currently a Gnome Warrior<br />
<br />
sometimes changing within minutes..<br />
<br />
however, one of my rl friends had a cleric that they deleted and they still cannot use the name after nearly a year now</div></div><hr />

However I have also created characters, deleted them, and then  EQ wouldn't allow me to use that name again.  <br />
<br />
I do know that guides that are online used to be able to reject names.  I guess once a guide or GM has rejected a name, it is no longer able to be used.  /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
A friendly GM and I are discussing it in email now, so I'm pretty happy with SoE's handling of situation.</div></div><hr />

Beware, Norrath! EZRAD IS BACK! (Sort of)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OberonMiM</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can also nab a persons name if they transfer to legends<br />
<br />
I know some people did that to some of the low life random pk's that were on Rallos that fled to stormhammer to level up in obscurity to bypass their reputation (cough stupid move on verants part making legends because it doesn't allow us to blacklist the low lives if they pay more money)<br />
<br />
But anyways people would take their names then act like totally idiots in chat channels etc and everyone would have a huge laugh at it. Whats funnier is when they pretend to be their namesake and talk to another pk and the other guy actually beleives it</div></div><hr />

;)<br />
<br />
Nope. Because I didn't want to delete an alt to create Ezrad unless I was fairly sure that there was a chance of being able to re-use the name.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, I would have just deleted the alt and tried. <br />
<br />
(I deleted a lvl 4 Froglok Cleric)<br />
<br />
The original Ezrad's last name was Gravecreeper. I'm not sure if I'll re-use that, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Idara</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a beastlord named Koneko and when I got my second account, I wanted to have her on the second account instead of the first. Since she was still pretty low level, I didn't see any reason to pay 50 bucks to transfer her, I just moved all her stuff and deleted her, then created a beastlord on the new account. But it wouldn't let me have the name Koneko so I had to make it Koneki. However, when I got back on my original account, I was able to make a bard named Koneko right away. I asked a GM and was told that the name stays attached to the account even if the character is deleted, although the amount of time was unknown.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanna</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">vallon is particularly cruel to me, when trying to re-use names. <br />
<br />
I got it in my head to be an iksar necro, because i had never been either of those things before. I very happily made her 'Necrochick'. Don't ask why, seemed like a good idea at the time. My floormate (who plays on vallon) said we couldn't group if i were a Darkie, so I deleted her and tried to make an Eru Necro... and proceeded to go through 10 or more names before getting Lyftapp. <br />
<br />
<br />
However, when i first started on EQ and had a 9 monk on my roomie's account, I could delete that Arike and remake Arike on my own account, no prob. /shrug. <br />
<br />
and then there's the utter crap that Stromm has gone through... I have no attachment to those three names, and those weren't even on the original list of names. grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. <br />
<br />
so apparently, as long as you stay away from vallon or stromm ( ^_^!!! ) you should be fine in dealing with names. They appear to recycle quite quickly.</div></div><hr />
