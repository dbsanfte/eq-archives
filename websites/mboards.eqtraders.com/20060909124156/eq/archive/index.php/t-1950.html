<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stouthearts</div><div class="date">01-06-2003, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have heard that heraldic armor can be converted to no drop, or some type of smithed armor similar to that. Can anyone shed some light in this subject. As I play on a PVP server, and want to be able to make one for myself without worrying about it being stolen from. If you know any website that provides the info, a link to them would greatly be appreciated. Thank you in advance  :D</div></div><hr />

The only armor that I'm aware of that is no drop that you smith is the unengraved Royal Velium Armor, used in the 8th Coldain Shawl quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heartsong_Steelsoul</div><div class="date">01-07-2003, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In fact, the armor Tenasi is referring to is probably what you heard about - it starts as no drop, which is what is turned in for the quest, but can be made droppable for people to actually use as armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mardark</div><div class="date">01-07-2003, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats still what I am hoping for.  I wish that they would do something to make the armor NO DROP and add stats.  So much of the smithed armor pales in comparison to quested and NO DROP armor.</div></div><hr />

There are some PoP quest armors out there that used tradeskill components and high level drop molds &amp; patterns to make some nice quested no-drop armors (if you have the proper PoP flags).</div></div><hr />

<br />
That'd be a fair thing to push for I'd think.. I see though that heraldic seems to not have the magic tag. You'd think it'd be appropriate, considering you're using enchanted metal along the way and such things..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stouthearts</div><div class="date">01-07-2003, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">on pvp, anything can be looted except for items mark no drop. I just heard in game from some one a while back who told me one can smith a certain type armor, then do quest to turn it into no drop status. Since I obtained this info around the time bardic armor info was coming out, I naturally assume it was that. But judging from the reply, I guess I'm out of luck  :cry: Although that person did say he saw it on some druid website but did not know the specific webaddress. Perhaps someone on this board who is also a druid might have come across this website, if so please let me know the web address Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I wanted to make armour to wear for myself - I in fact chose my race and class to optimize my ability to smith for myself.  Any salability I get from smithing is incidental. Making better armour smithed no drop would benefit anyone that smiths for themself.<br />
<br />
As for looting items, it's only on Rallos, one item that isn't no drop or bagged can be looted. On Tallon, Vallon and Sullon, you can only loot coin.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Liakim</div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 09:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Never have I dreamt of one day becoming rich doing blacksmithing.  The single reason I took it up is because the idea of being a paladin able to create his own 'holy armor' sounded so cool.  On my server, very rarely do I see cultural armor being worn, as Thurg/Kael/Skyshrine capable guilds are......just about all of them.  I see it for sale quite often in the bazaar, a few pieces here and there, but it doesn't seem like it moves very fast.  I personally don't want to pay the 125k for the full set when I can just slowly work my smithing up to the point where I can make it myself.<br />
<br />
That being said.....I DO wish there was a 'step beyond' cultural, if you will.  That is, a GM smith taking his own set of cultural armor (meaning the imbued BD stuff) and somehow 'enhancing' it for his or her own use, with a distinctive stat modifier/look to it, and as such also making it NODROP.  Maybe it's just me and the grand roleplaying schemes I like to think of........but think about it - in the Middle Ages, wasn't each knight's armor custom made to fit?  Oh well, enough of my ranting/raving.  I am sure many of you GM smiths out there will disagree strongly with my opinion, but difference of opinion is what makes humanity the marvel that it is.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mark</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 07:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would be so very cool to have NO DROP armor for smiths.  I would turn my Crimson Darkscale into NO DROP if I could specialize it somehow.  Maybe combine it with a Bor Warhammer type symbol so it could be specialized for a Warrior )  I would love to change that useless mana in to HPs.  Game balance would not be bad eather because there are so few smiths that could make the stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OberonMiM</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 07:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Being on Rallos i would very much like a way to tag armor i can make no drop (by the person buying it)<br />
<br />
Even at 65 most of the armor i make is now raid armor only worn during raids.<br />
<br />
Having a hard time selling my de cultural bracers for even 5k :(<br />
<br />
Would be nice if items made had a tradeskill flag making them unlootable on Rallos but chances of it happening (like balancing pvp) is slim to nil.<br />
<br />
As for playing PVP. You might hate the combat but we have a system that ensures guilds respect eachother. Kill steal/badmouth/train. Better be wary or you may end up kos to half the server. Much more realistic in that sense</div></div><hr />
