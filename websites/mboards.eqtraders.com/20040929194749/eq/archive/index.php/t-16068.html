<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Amotd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a warning for folks making the new god bags.  Caerlyna in bazaar does not have tokens for at least 2 of the bags.  The Steel-Reinforced Cragbeast Pack and the Bolstered Hynid-Hide Backpack.  Hopefully they will update her soon with the new items from GoD.</div></div><hr />

Many people have suggested quest containers should get tokens as well; for now, I'm not including them in this list unless they have a secondary or tradeskill-related use. No-drop containers should yield no-drop tokens, of course; same with lore containers and tokens.<br />
  <br />
  Also note that it may be more thematically appropriate to make some of these items collapsible containers, rather than tokens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Inien of Vazaelle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Is there really a point to making a token for the erudite tailoring kit since it's sold on a vendor in Erudin and Paineel?  (and for some reason Cabilis)  Unless someone just wants to give it to get a token for easy storage.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arfyak Reflux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I thought that the only thing she gave tokens for were weight reducing bags. Any thing that has a combine button on it she will not take (ie the sewing kits et al).  If the Devs are thinking of changing this we may want to add the Bear Skin Potion Bag to the list, as far as I know they are only player made.<br />
<br />
The other issue I have is that the tokens need to have a discription tagged to them saying what the stats of the bag are.  Would be really helpful to both buyers and sellers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ranjaadown</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You are correct, it is only weight reduction bags, so any tradeskill containers will not be able to be turned into her.<br />

&quot;Is there a cleric in the zone?? help&quot;  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aryse Andenter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I sure second the need for descriptions on the tokens... I had begun adding descriptions to my afk message, which helped a little bit, and hotkeyed a response for people asking and a description to call out in trade channel... but once you are selling 5 or 6 different types or more, it becomes ridiculous. Having people able to tell on a right click inspection of the token what they are getting would be hugely helpful - and it would also increase sales on GoD bags since many people are still unfamiliar on the names of those too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Pointee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bolstered Cragbeast Backpack does not have a token either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The other issue I have is that the tokens need to have a discription tagged to them saying what the stats of the bag are.<br />
 At the Fan Faire, we asked whether additional bags could get tokens, and the devs responded positively.  Maddoc asked us to compile a list of bags we think would be good candidates for this.<br />
<br />
On a related note, they also said they would be looking into somehow making tokens show the stats of the bag they repreresent.  I suspect they've gotten a little side-tracked due to the numerous DirectX9 bugs, pathing errors, and so on, but hopefully they'll have those sorted out soon.<br />
<br />
Edit: I've updated my first post (near the top of the thread) with all the bags so far.  I'll try and keep an eye on the thread and update the list as new bags are listed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Has anyone tested whether Caerlyna will give you a token for an Odylic Vial (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9426)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">OK, folks, it's about time to submit this list.  Last chance if anyone has bags they want to be made into tokens.<br />
<br />
Tomorrow about this time I'll finalize the list and send it to the devs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ALL the God bags should be on the list, they are all weight reduction, aren't they?  I'll go check teh database &amp; edit my post with the list...<br />

That should be the rest of the GoD bags.  If it's not...let me know which ones I missed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">On the subject of tinkering with bags, are the foldable potion bags/medicine bags still lore? It would be lovely if they weren't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Tweedledea, consider that all the collapsible items are lore -- mixing bowls, spits, tailoring kits, etc. (At least, I can't think of any that aren't lore and I'm too lazy to go look them all up. ;) )<br />
 <br />
 Updated the list to include GoD bags.  Last chance if you want to suggest any more bags for tokens; in about six hours, I'm sending this off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">OK, finalized the list of bags now.<br />
<br />
If anyone thinks of more bags, post them here and I'll start a new list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">On the subject of tinkering with bags, are the foldable potion bags/medicine bags still lore? It would be lovely if they weren't.<br />
<br />
They are all still lore, I stock all the folded and collapsed containers on my bazaar mule. The trick I've learned is that shared bank slots are not assigned against a character so you can have a lore item on the mule and one in the shard bank slot. There are 10 types of collapsed/folded containers so I can have one of each on my trader and a spare one of each in a deluxe toolbox in a shared bankslot. That way, when I go to check my trader in the morning before I leave for work I can quickly replenish the stock. Not perfect but still better than having to log onto my gnome and halfling to make up some new ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aryse Andenter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Has there been any word on if they intend to add the tokens for those weight reduction bags? There are still some missing and its most annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>tindiyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I guess im really late for this  but  there is no token for the odylic vial.    Not a huge deal   we have them sitting on perma guild mules anyways  and its not exactly a commonly made  item and I doubt youll ever see one in the baz.<br />
<br />
Tind</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I sent both these issues on not long ago; the issue about some bags not having tokens, and tokens not showing stats.  I posted the reply from Maddoc in the Fan Fair 12 weeks later thread (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/showthread.php?t=16759) on the general discussion page.  Basically, he said that adding the tokens (and the stats to the tokens) were not very difficult to do (especially with the list above, that I also sent on) but he did not indicate a date as to when they'd be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Lenore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">That looks promising at best.  I was a bit miffed I wasn't able to turn my Bolstered Hynid Backpack in for a token and had been making daily /feedback requests.  As to when, it does not matter now.  At least it is being looked at and considered is good enough for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Aryse Andenter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Okay, this is ridiculous. Where are these tokens? Put this back on the tradeskill to-do list, another expansion has come out and the GoD tokens are still not in place  :confused:  I have stacks of stuff saved up for these bags, but it's just not reasonable to make them when I don't have an efficient method of selling them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Even though it hasn't been official made yet (as far as I know), might as well add the new ice cream machine to the list of containers that should be tokenable.</div></div><hr />
