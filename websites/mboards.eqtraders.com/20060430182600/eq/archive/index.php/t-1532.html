However, I believe you mispelled the word &quot;you&quot; .   And for some odd reason, Your periods are not appearing at the ends of your sentences.<br />

You may want to go back and edit that.<br />

I have recently made a full set of Rodcet Nife armor for my cleric and I made the leggs on the 1st shot. Most parts were 1/1 or 1/2 (very good success rate) with the exception of the helm what was 1/5.<br />
<br />
The human smith had 239-240 skill (+5%) while making the set, she dinged 240 on the helms hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meirril</div><div class="date">12-28-2002, 03:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My cleric (227 wis, 188 skill) succeeds often making Acrylia Breastplates (average about 3 in 5 attempts) but fails more often makig Acrylia Plate Leggings (average about 2 in 5 attempts). Yes, he's using a gearlock and yes I'm wasting perfectly good windstones. It might just be a run of bad luck, but breastplates seem to be a little easier to craft than other peices of the same skill level (I have yet to succeed at a bracer, but I've only made 3 attempts. It realy feels like a waste of windstones making a 1 sheet combine.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kingbobb</div><div class="date">12-28-2002, 07:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On failing greaves more:<br />
<br />
waaaaaaay back when I was doing banded (when it trivved around 180) I heard from fellow smiths that cloaks were the hardest peice to make.   I had no problem with them, but couldn't get the dang legs right.  Must be something about making the joints....not sure.....maybe I'm just not deft enough.  I always seem to be breaking fishing poles, too. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I've not seen the &quot;hard leg&quot; trend continue into other types of armor.  I mostly make Imbued Field Plate BPs to skill up, and acrylia greaves to make some money in the bazaar.  This isn't a hard data number, but I'd reckon I'm at 90% or better on acrylia legs, and I've been making them since 200 (229 now).</div></div><hr />
