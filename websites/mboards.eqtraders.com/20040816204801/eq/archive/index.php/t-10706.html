<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xorithra L`Amante</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello!<br />
<br />
Are you a research component packrat?  If so, this might help you out.  I created a spreadsheet that can be used to keep track of what spells and how many of that spell you can make with the resources you have available.  All you have to do is an inventory of which components you have and how many, and it will tell you what you can make.<br />
<br />
I'm uploading it here for your use.  I play two characters with my boyfriend who also plays two.  We make a great team and typically, unless friends wish to join us, all the loot goes to our cause =)  I hate selling useful things like components or tradeskill items because I'm a big fan of tradeskills.  Therefore, I found the task of sorting through all those 16 bags of components to figure out what we could make intimidating.  I found creating this spreadsheet more interesting so I'll never have to think that hard again ;)<br />
<br />
I hope it proves to be a useful tool for at least some of you out there!  Please post any questions or comments about the spreadsheet on this thread, whether it be complaints or compliments.  Most definitely, mention anything inaccuracies you might have noticed.<br />
<br />
Thanks ahead for the feedback!  Good luck fellow artisans!<br />

Revision:<br />
Hello!  My wonderful boyfriend fixed that horrible &quot;Want to update links?&quot; problem that I accidentally incorporated into the sheet.   Here it is without that irritating question.<br />
<br />
Also, I can eliminate the &quot;Yes&quot; column in the spreadsheet, so all you do is input the numbers.  I had promised to post it last night though, so I somewhat rushed trying to make it user friendly for anyone else but me =) When I originally created it, I didn't care about knowing how many I could make.  Only when I decided to make it available did that option occur to me.  Now, the Yes column isn't really needed, so I'll revamp it and post it within a few days.  Those who already downloaded it will just need to copy &quot;Amount&quot; column and paste into the new spreadsheet.<br />
<br />
So, here is the revised sheet that wont pop up that links question, the next (and hopefully last) one will come soon!<br />
<br />
(If you've already entered data and don't want to download the new spreadsheet, simply unprotect the &quot;Makeable&quot; sheet and changed cell A2 to =Spells!A1  )<br />
<br />
FINAL Revision:<br />
Hello again!  Here is the final spreadsheet, changed so you have to do is input amounts.  Kept the YES column on the &quot;Makeable&quot; sheet because I think it draws your eye more to those spells.<br />
<br />
But yes, this has eliminated the &quot;Availablity&quot; column in the &quot;Components&quot; sheet.  For those who have the first (or second) spreadsheet, you should just be able to copy and paste the  &quot;Amount&quot; column (minus the title).<br />
<br />
Funny thing is, took two minutes to change it, and 20 to fill out out for my personal use~  Have to admit though, knowing how much is incredibly helpful (original only had the &quot;Makeable&quot; column).<br />
<br />
Have fun!<br />
<br />
Correction:  Graal pointed out two lefts for BoA instead of a left and a right.  A quick check in the eqtraders database shows left and right (whereas I took the info from eqtraders shortly after LoY came out, and there were a couple uncertainties on recipes).  It is changed and once again uploaded here.<br />
<br />
For those who don't wish to mess with Excel:<br />
*Download the sheet (making sure it will not overwrite yours.  Hopefully you renamed it ;P).  <br />
*Open up old and new.<br />
*Highlight cells B3:B173 in your old &quot;Amount&quot; column in the &quot;Components&quot; sheet, copy.<br />
*Select B3 in the &quot;Components&quot; sheet of the new file and paste.<br />
*Save new.<br />
*Close old and delete old.<br />
*Eat a cookie or do a little dance to the wonders of copy and paste.<br />
*Don't forget to rename new to something happier.  Bob, for example.<br />
<br />
For those who just like to mess:<br />
*Unprotect the &quot;Components&quot; and &quot;Spells&quot; sheets.  (Tools --&gt; Protection --&gt; Unprotect Sheet)<br />
*In cell C20 of the &quot;Components&quot; sheet, add &quot;blessing of aegolism (C60)&quot; before KEI if you want to be consistent.<br />
*In cell E30 of the &quot;Spells&quot; sheet, change 'Left' to 'Right'.<br />
*Be a safe and reprotect the &quot;Components&quot; and &quot;Spell&quot; sheets.<br />
*Eat a cookie or do a little dance to the wonders of me staying up too late to type out instructions that you didn't need.<br />
<br />
For those that don't have it and will download for the first time:<br />
No worries!  Hope you enjoy.<br />
<br />
Thanks for pointing it out Graal!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xorithra L`Amante</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hi there everyone!<br />
<br />
Glad to see it's getting so many downloads.<br />
<br />
In reply to Az's request, I'm afraid I can't do it.  There is a lot of potential for tradeskills with this sheet because it's in a format that could be used for ANYTHING.  Inventory on the first, actual list of ingredients on the second, and combines on the third... the problem is that since EQtraders changed their format, it's not easy to copy and paste the information for the second sheet any longer.<br />
<br />
As most of you probably can remember, the former format was columns with final combine, then component 1, 2, 3 and so on.  Now, it is final combine in one cell, components in another cell, with much more information.  Beautiful for the site, but unfortunately the idea of the spreadsheet came a little too late.  The only reason I was able to do it was because I had copied the old format info into a document a long time ago for my own tracking.<br />
<br />
So... if any of you out there also have acurate old formatting, feel free to use the formulas and format of this spreadsheet.  Could be altered a little bit for tailoring... like how many pelts you have, then how many bonings, studs and the like you'd need... anyhow I'm rambling!  Just throwing ideas in the air.  If you do use the format and formulas of this spreadsheet, please be so kind to mention that you got it from Xorithra L`Amante ;)<br />
<br />
Enjoy, and I'm sorry I can't bust any more out.  If someone does have the old format with correct components (any skill, not just research), upload it onto this string and myself (when this semester is over, or I have more time) or anyone else who knows how can work with it.<br />

I have been compiling a similar listing, but you took it that one extra step and linked all the components with the corresponding spells!!!!<br />
<br />
This will be great for organizing my mules (yes I have one for each type: Runes, Words, Pages, and Misc items/trade skill) for use for my GF (65 Necro) to get her research up!!<br />
Alhtough not an advocate for selling spells, this will be a great way for her to make some side money, and get the spells into the needed hands of serveral characters at a cheap rate (because she will definately undercut all others to help bring the spell cost market down just a bit). <br />

<br />
I haven't posted on this thread for a while and didn't want anyone to think that I wasn't paying attention any longer.  I REALLY appreciate everyone's feedback and it's gratifying to hear that people are enjoying it.<br />
<br />
Also, Prach emailed me personally about a modification for the sheet.  Through conditinal formatting, Prach came up with a way to highlight components in the &quot;Spells&quot; sheet to show which ones you had (and thus visually showing you how close you are to making a spell) and if you have all the components, it highlights the spell.<br />
<br />
It's an awesome modification, but I've been so busy with work and class I haven't had the time to go through it and make the necessary modifications so I could post it up.  It's coming soon though!  This week is finals week.<br />
<br />
I suggested to Prach to just post it up on this thread, but he (or she?) didn't want to impose.  What a gem ;)<br />
<br />
Check back in a week or so and the new sheet should be posted.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Xorithra L`Amante</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hello Everyone!<br />
<br />
So I've been bad.  The holidays have come and gone and I still didn't have time to upload the conditional formatting change...<br />
<br />
But, if you were to look at the OTHER sticky in the forum, you would see a very nice program that also allows you to keep track of prices.  The only bad thing about it is that you are not able to view all your spells, therefore skimming through wouldn't be easy.  The programmer seems to be happy with suggestions though, so who knows, maybe even that wouldn't be an issue!<br />
<br />
I'm pretty lazy myself, so I've asked my boyfriend to program something that would parse a character magelo file and let me view all the spells I can make and components and all that jazz that the spreadsheet allows you to do without having to manually input numbers~  (He doesn't want to write it for public view though... only way I could get him to do it was to promise it was just for my use).<br />
<br />
Anyhow, if anyone DOES use the spreadsheet and would want me to go ahead and upload the conditional formatting, I will.  I just don't want to if no one will use it.  The other program is pretty awesome, and I would use it if it weren't for my boyfriend ;)<br />
<br />
Those who are interested in the LoY Matrix, here is a link to the post -- http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=12215, and you can also find the site to download the program!<br />

<br />
I too have created a spreadsheet for high level research, but it does not actually contain inventory columns.  Mine is strictly like this:<br />
<br />
Column 1:  every ingredient (sometimes duplicated because some classes use it for more than 1 spell)<br />
Columns 2-8: each class.<br />
The 'meat' of the spreadsheet says what each ingredient is for in this format: &quot;53, Scent of Terris&quot; which is in the necro column.<br />
<br />
On top of each column I put pull down arrows; you can pull down the class arrow to the spell you want, and see what ingredients you need from column A (the ingredients column);<br />
OR you can pull down the arrow in the ingredients column to see what spell(s) it is used for.<br />
<br />
I also created separate tabs just for each class, incase I gave this to someone who didn't know how to use pull down arrows.<br />
<br />
If anyone wants to see mine, send me a message and I will send it along to you...<br />

Basically I've put a button at the bottom of the screen. Once clicked you can select a magelo text file. It will use that file to read in all these spell components from that file and place the appropriate amounts in the spreadsheet. I've also added a column so that it will tell you whom has that component and how many. Let me know if anyone is interested and Xorithra let me know if it's ok and I'll post a link here.<br />

But at least one person seems like they could use the macroed sheet so I'll make it available. I only hope it helps you as much as it did me  :) <br />
<br />
Things you should know:<br />
This pretty much will require you to use magelo's program to gather your char's information and present it in a text file so the macro can read it in.<br />
<br />
Magelo's database seems a bit incomplete; there are three research components I could not find magelo ids for. Toharon's 18 Left, Toharon's 19, and Rune Of Zephyr. If you happen to find these ids let me know via pms or just leave a message here. If they are really not in the database then using magelo update is supposed to request them as an addition if you have the items on you. <br />
<br />
Along with a new column for maglo id there is another new column called &quot;Owner&quot;. Once a maglo profile has been read in it will list that person's name and how many copies they have. (Ex. Bob(3) , Tom(8) )<br />

I thought that there were better tools out there, but maybe the simplicity of this one is what keeps this one alive.<br />
<br />
I spent about a week contemplating how to implement my initial idea... had no idea how I was going to do it at first, cept that I knew it could be done if I thought hard enough.  I think I even dreamt about the darn thing.  Well, nine months later and it would probably take me a few moments of looking at the formulas to know what in the world I did.<br />
<br />
The whole purpose of this post is to thank those of you who use the spreadsheet as well as those who take it one step further and improve it.  Thank you for checking with me first, but I'd just like to give any future interest the go ahead to post it on this thread (and hopefully the mod's won't glare at us for using too much space!)

Since the Read Me page is password protected I could not add my revision notes so they are as follows.<br />
<br />
Added conditional formatting so that if you have a component in stock then it will be HiLited green on the spells worksheet.<br />
Since I often don't keep common items in stock I also made it HiLite a component light green if you have .1 in stock. This makes it easy to scan which spells you can make and what you need to buy to complete them<br />
<br />
On the Makeable page if the quantity you can make is .1 then you only need to obtain items you marked as common to make the spell.<br />
