<br />
I'm once again trying the smithing thing on my Human Warrior named Syberfang.  I've gone through all of my sea tempers and most of my acrylia stockpiles, end result was a few points and I'm at 194.  I'm looking for reasonably priced smithing supplies, be it human cultural or acrylia or LDoN temper stuff, or even velium for the new enchanted velium bits recipe.  I'm willing to pay reasonable prices, but simply don't have the bankroll to pay current bazaar prices for this stuff (velium pieces are now at around 75pp per and climbing). Anyone who might have any of these things taking up space in their bank and would like to sell them all, please drop me a line in-game or leave a note here.  I appreciate any and all help with this I can get, I've been hunting the elusive 250 smithing for around 2 years now and would like to finally put this demon to rest.  :D<br />

I've been trying to work on Smithing since they day they introduced Cultural Smithing (yeah, back when Enchant Mithril cost a BD every cast!).<br />
<br />
I'm a bit over-stocked on Blocks of Acrylia, I think, right now... since I don't have a Gammy to make Troll Weapons anymore. :(<br />
<br />
Gonna collect more Velium first, I think... or, that should be &quot;I hope&quot;. :D</div></div><hr />

You're welcome to all that I have that may be of use to you.</div></div><hr />
