<br />
Specifically Ice Burrowers and Velium Hounds?<br />
<br />
I'm a 57 wiz, wondering if I can solo either of those.<br />

<br />
Maybe if I'd mentioned I was doing it for tailoring =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Niellya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At 57 you should have no problem with the velium hounds once you get them snared.  Note that they run at SoW speed when unsnared and probably normal running speed when snared.<br />
<br />
As for Ice Burrowers, they're a lot tougher and I doubt you'd be able to do it.  But here's a thread from Graffe's that has a discussion on Ice Burrowers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bearcaller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can forget about doing ice burrowers.  They are level 61 and have tons of HP.  Not to mention they have an AE 500 DD dispell proc that is very nasty should they ever catch up to you.  At your level you could probably get lures to land, with everything else probably at least partially resisted enough to not make it worth casting.  And this includes snare.<br />
<br />
Velium hounds are certainly possible for you to do at your level.  Be warned though, they move fast (not quite RS3 speed), attack fast and hard (doubles in the high 100's, will interrupt spells 9 times out of 10 when in melee range), have a large aggro radius (similar to raptors in TD), and are VERY social.  They are also hard to find, if there happens to be a tracker in the zone hunting them as well you might as well leave because you will probably not see one that the tracker isn't already engaged with.<br />
<br />
Last but certainly not least, don't attempt to hunt WW at your level unless you are non-kos to Claws of Veeshan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Niellya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">He's right about the insane amount of hit points.  Incredibly magic resistant so snare takes a while to land if you try to snare, but fire nukes work fairly well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One more thing about hunting in WW.... make sure you have good CoV faction.  Would not be a fun trip of hound hunting to find all the dragons/wurms/wyverns trying to eat you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>baody</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have now proudly made two ice burrower caps. I have a 50 percent success rate at 237 tailoring (248 with a geerlok). They are terribly expensive to make, and I cringe every time I hit combine on one.<br />
<br />
I'm a 65 druid, so I usually kill ice burrowers by leading them into the dragon necropolous valley, snaring them, putting the insect DoT series on them, and then using snare to agro kite them while a dire charmed put nips at their tail. I believe you can epic dot them, and it does take time. I think the drop rate is under 50 percent, and I've never seen them drop anything but two silks. <br />
<br />
I hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Annaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm a 65 druid, and I spend 90 percent of my time in WW.  <br />
<br />
Velium hounds have low hit points, but hit hard and fast.  Once they are snared, they are VERY easy to kill.  You could probably quad them, especially if you have KEI.<br />
<br />
I can take on an ice burrower, but it will use most of my mana, and I really need a dire charmed pet to help out.  Takes about 15 to 20 minutes to kill one.  They might be a bit rough for you at your level.<br />
<br />
Make sure you are not KOS to CoV.  If you can do that, then the only things that will attack you on sight in the zone are the IBs and the hounds.  You really DON'T want dragon adds.  IBs are easy to avoid, low aggro range and they are HUGE, so easy to see from a distance.  Velium hounds have a huge aggro range, blend into the landscape, and will jump you from out of nowhere, it seems.  Sometimes 2 or 3 will just seem to appear right on top of you.<br />
<br />
Even at 65, I still get exp in this zone, blue and light blue cons.<br />
<br />
Edit: Wanted to add that if you are simply looking for materials for skillups, you would be much better off staying in CS and doing Wyverns.  WW wouldn't be worth the hassle.  If you are already 250 though, then WW can be a goldmine for you.  I have sold over 100 Mastadon Fur Cloaks at about 15k each.  The extra velium hound hides I get also sell well to people working on their shawl quests.  A few of the pieces of IB silk armor sell well also, especially the cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kheera</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hounds ate my poor shaman alive at 58 when she went there to get the hound fur for her shawl... ended up buying them in the bazaar.  Now (much later) my druid tried them at 52 and was able to take them on fairly easily (if carefully, and KEI a must, and much easier by 54).  Snare is a beautiful thing.<br />
<br />
Ice burrowers, now, yes, ow.  Evil evil things.   My partner will take his 65 necro and swat one for me in revenge, the occasional time I don't pay enough attention and get overrun ... but with the dispell and high MR, they're evil.  I'm not certain I'd try one even with my shammy at 65, now.<br />
<br />
Mastodons are other good prey, xp at 54 and 55 at least and the occasional fur to sell, or brontos to try to pop more of either.<br />

One other kos-to-all mob, Guardian Kozzalyn (I think): giant elemental.  Mean sucker, he summons too.</div></div><hr />
