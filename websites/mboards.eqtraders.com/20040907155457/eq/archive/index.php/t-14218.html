<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arhallia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Consider the following:<br />
<br />
A &quot;smithed&quot; item is nothing more than a quested item which:<br />
<br />
1) Has a readily obtainable quest container<br />
2) Requires a considerable amount of &quot;back work&quot;, on par with faction work for many quests, to have a *chance* of completing the quest successfully.<br />
3) Requires &quot;quest drops&quot; from zones that are usually only readily obtainable by a character who is beyond using the &quot;reward&quot;.<br />
4) The item is almost always tradable.<br />
<br />
Given those facts, compare the quest mace from Natimbi:<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
Mace of Focused Flame<br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP  <br />
Slot: PRIMARY SECONDARY  <br />
Weight: 0.0 Size: MEDIUM <br />
Damage: 14 Delay: 23 <br />
Str: +7 Dex: +5 Wis: +3 Int: +3 Disease Resist: +5 Cold Resist: +3 Poison Resist: +5 HP: +50 Mana: +30 End: +30  <br />
Classes: Beastlord Ranger Paladin Shadowknight Bard Monk Rogue Warrior  <br />
Races: All Races <br />
Slot 1: Type 7 <br />
<br />
Effect: Bolt of Flame<br />
Type: Combat <br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
...with one of the best smithed weapons for most classes in the same zone:<br />
<br />
Pale Velium Short Sword   <br />
MAGIC ITEM  <br />
Weight: 2.0 Size: MEDIUM <br />
Slot: PRIMARY SECONDARY  <br />
Damage: 10 Delay: 22 <br />
Str: +8 Wis: +8 Int: +8 Agi: +8 Fire Resist: +6 Cold Resist: +6 Magic Resist: +6  <br />
Classes: Ranger Paladin Shadowknight Bard Rogue Warrior  <br />
Races: All Races <br />
Slot 1: Type 4<br />
Slot 2: Type 7 <br />
  <br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
These both require drops of about the same rarity/difficulty.  The smithed weapon is tradable, but also costs an additional ~600p to make, plus there's a chance of failure, effectively increasing the &quot;average&quot; difficulty of the drops for the &quot;quest&quot;, and you had to work pretty hard (or spend a lot of money) to get to a skill level where you could do the quest.<br />
<br />
First thought that comes to mind is what?<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I propose the following solution to this imbalance:<br />
<br />
* If the NODROP flag is the &quot;issue&quot; behind the low stats of the smithed item (which is FAR harder to obtain on average) then....<br />
<br />
Add three new augment slot types for Smithed Gear ONLY.<br />
<br />
Type 9: Stat augments for tradeskill armor/weapons.<br />
Type 10: Weapon damage augment for smithed weapons.<br />
Type 11: Weapon proc augment for smithed weapons.<br />
<br />
1) Make the augments NODROP, and reasonably spendy, AP-wise.<br />
2) Make the augments a bit superior to the other augments at LDoN camps, or mildly raise the stats of basic smithed items everywhere. (Make a +3 damage augment for 1H, 16+ delay smithed weapons for 1150AP, for example, a 15 AC augment chest/legs/arms, a +10 Sta and +40 hp aug for smithed gear, a 250 point proc for 1150AP, etc.)<br />
<br />
...voila.  Problem solved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They need to reduce the temper requirements on elemental smithed armor. My guild has a lot more ele molds/patterns than them. Drop rate on temper components is pretty horrible on top of taking 6/7 for a single breastplate attempt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cantatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tradeskill augments were something I suggested back before LDoN that I really would've liked to have seen.  It'd at least give you some ability to customize what you're making and also make it so there would be a larger variety of items available to make.<br />
<br />
And Flabbo, keep in mind only the GoD weapons we've seen haven't been stellar.  Some of the weapons made from harder to get stuff might be a lot more impressive.  It might not, but we can't really right off the entire set of smithed weapons within one week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daikoku Ashikaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pale nehyte is going for 2k, how is this going to effect the price for the better ores?.<br />
<br />
Tae ew has a 12/20 ratio, with HPs, a group of level 60s can farm Tae Ew blood  for hours,  there are a lot of 65's I would not group with , if they would be tanking in feb, or most other spot in the group.  Would have to be a guildie's twink or another high end twink.<br />
<br />
Basicly, if you are not an Uber, you will not see anyof this,  unless you have uber friends,  for myself, spending most of my raaid time in time, this has no effect on me, but I think this is very unfair, I did not like it in PoP, where the lower smiithed armor, the one people could hope to farm was such junk.<br />
<br />
There should be a way to reward the out come of smithing persistance over raiding persistence.<br />
<br />
Give my char name, as I  have said before, I am in favor of, surprise, given my char's name, mutiple fold sword ('pale velium' katana, I could hope) same hilt recipe, but the blade requires a different on,  some smithing or JC/smithing combo for a untempered velinum bar and needing 2-3 of those, using farmed, not vendor pucchasable velium,  2 untempered velum bars, folded use a powder made of say dark matter, out of natimbi, fold it some number of times, and take another untempered bar, 'hammer' it, then 'weld' it  to the first blade, make these combines difficult so they fail alot, but not cost an arm and a leg,<br />
<br />
give it the stats of the PV bastard sword, and ad the level requirement, AC, HP, and mana of the argent protector,  then you have a competive, slightly superior blade to some old kunark drop at least (Well protector was vielous, post revamp.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Something that would amount to more work then the average AGer would not do, but someone that that makes MTPs because they, in the end would rather make there own food then buy it, would not really think twice about.<br />

With the items being tradeable, even those with very casual playstyles will be able to get the components necessary to make the higher end weapons. <br />

You won't necessarily be able to get them tomorrow, but they're also not so rare that you'll never be able to get them. They will be available, just give it a little time :)<br />

<br />
Did we not see this in pop with fletching, the ability to make stuff, but you have to be an uber guilder (Or close) to aquire, or pour out  50K+ per one attempt to try?<br />
<br />
Why is this coupling of Raiders to to be , well leeches off the tradeskill comunity, if any of these weapons turn out to be better then the WMBS, dealing here with 2hdrs, do you think that the  raid crowd will not  raise perices to unaffordability?  Is this somethingthat is concidered good?<br />
<br />
Third guild into elemental planes, third guild into time,  I am going to bemaking out like a bandit if what happend in PoP is repeated here,  but why must it be that way, why can not someone that has put enough workk to get 242+, that does not have access for the forces  to do shei, be completely locked out of the ability do make themselfs something decent, something usable, relitive to the market fornear or less then what he pays for components.<br />
<br />
I expect PN to be going for 200pp soon,  meaning that a smith that is 55 250+ skill  will end up 575 or so on velium, 400 on PN,  plus other various bits to make a wepon that  will not sell for more then 750?<br />
<br />
Maybe I am the only one that would like to see a paradigm change, something that entails more smithing work rather then more buttering up to the nearst uberguild.<br />

Edit:  shei was for my shears, XTC does drop the hammer, I wont even go in to XXWEDYT or whatever is the accronym for the mob that dropped my gaunts in VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Right. We havent seen the end items. I just dont see why they bothered to makle the lower tier items at all, if they arent going to be worth a fraction of the vendor purchased components. Theres a pretty significant timesink of getting the materials, shelling out money, only to make a piece of junk. People who would use a 24/30 2 hander CANNOT effectively hunt for the components there. The mobs are way too mean. They either need to up the drop rate on the materials and lower the vendor component price, to allow a viable skillup path, or make them worthwhile to produce by raising ststs to be commesurate with the cost. As is, they are eating up database space.<br />
<br />
The only light at the end of the tunnel is the new type 7 procs, so you can have a player made weapon with 2 procs. Until theres a 10 base damage damage, 50hp type 7 aug, I just cant see the lower end weapons being useful for anything, with SO much superior and cheaper weaponry being out there.<br />
<br />
But hey, the whips are a joke as well, so at least I can tease my tailoring friend :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Arhallia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have to disagree with the &quot;because they are droppable, even the average joe will see them&quot; comment.<br />
<br />
Like PoP tradeskill drops, they will be way WAY out of the pricerange for the average joe.  Its been this way (we're talking 150k pp+ to make an elemental BP *attempt* on my server) for eons, and the elementals have been open for a while where I play.<br />
<br />
The prices are like this because, frankly, the plat-garnering exploits that allowed some people to become horrifically rich allowed those same people to spend as much money as possible in purchasing the best tradable gear (or components for making said gear) possible -- which in this case tends to be elemental PoP armors.<br />
<br />
Anyone who didn't benefit from the plat-making exploits would be doing themselves a huge favor by getting LDoN armor (which is superior to all elemental-smithed or -tailored gear), or Ornate armor from places like BoT.  Earning 300k to *make* an elemental BP (when the Ornate BP costs 150k even) is well beyond the time commitment of most players.  The LDoN stuff is just within reach... therefore the market for Elemental-grade armor (and these new GoD weapons) is limited to the filthy rich players who are very very good at trading, and have crazy gear (from uber guild raids usually) to trade, or who have exploited the game at some point in the past.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, many uber guilds have grandmaster tradeskillers who make them &quot;filler&quot; gear (which gets placed back into guild hands, or goes to twinks after its done &quot;filling&quot;) from these drops -- effectively making the items NODROP, since they never change hands outside of the guilds that can acquire them in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Naelia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Arhallia, I couldn't agree more with your assessment above.<br />
<br />
The aug idea sure would be nice though.  They could even let jewelers make augments, or something.  Wouldn't that be cool.. :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Eidolon Faer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Frankly, another area I would like to see smithed items expand into:<br />
<br />
Pet weapons.<br />
<br />
I don't usually buy pet weapons in the bazaar, because all those mages are just bazaar bots run by Yantis, and I dont feel like aiding and abetting.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, pet weapons are ****ed inconvenient unless you're a Mage.  They're NoRent.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I'd love to see a range of smithed pet weapons, of varying difficulty and cost to make.  Give the top couple of them dropped components even, but give them superior stats to the Blade of Walnan and maybe a nice graphic.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I think it incredibly silly that a 250-skill Enchanter Blacksmith has to buy summoned swords from a Mage in order to make them dance and fight for me.  And I'd pay 100 plat in materials and farm a Sand Verbena or two for a weapon that gave my pet a cool graphic and a damage upgrade.  It'd be situational but both an excellent plat-sink and not unbalancing.  And skelly pets with particle weapons would be worth it.<br />
<br />
And it would keep the Smiths happy too, they're consumable.  The market wouldn't glut, like it has with Black Acrylia.<br />
<br />
And it's not like it'll screw over the Mage class any worse than it already is.  They still have a massive edge in convenience and price, they just no longer have a monopoly.  I'd feel sorrier for them if Shamans couldn't make Clarity potions.</div></div><hr />

  <br />
<br />
squeeze me? i am not a yantis bot by any means, and i have relatively frequently gotten mage summoned pet gear to sell on my trade mule from a friend of mine when i needed to make some plat fairly fast to get something i wanted. i know i work my tail off getting things to sell in bazaar, including fishing until i was so bored my brains felt like they were running out of my ears to get cobalt cod for the oil...making innumerable zillions of combines for celestial essence, stat foods...running my ranger around fraging her little heart out for plains pebbles, tea leaves, cinnamon sticks, cabbages, baking and brewing and smithing and tailoring components...:steamed: nope, i am *not* a yantis bot, and i resent the idea being flogged that anybody selling certain items is always a yanis bot. grrrrr!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">First I agree with all the information about the elemental planes smithing items that have been posted here. Heck even the Hurricane items (Electrified copper, drops of pure rain and the like) are HORRIBLY expensive on Tunare. It is so bad that other Smithers that I have spoken with are just selling the componants after they make what they want from them. <br />
<br />
I understand what you are saying here Maddoc that we have not seen everything AND that because the ore is droppable we might see it but I have to go along with Arhallia here.<br />
<br />
If the ore can only be gotten by groups/raids that are elemental/time geared then most average tradeskillers will never see it. IF the trend started in PoP continues in this expantion and others then Tradeskills will be obsolet (maybe not baking) in that the items made will only be for twinking rather than for the casual player to use.<br />
<br />
Now My idea would be to allow Smiths to work with Jewel Crafters to create Augment Mounts to add to ANY smithed items. Keep the same augment types but just allow us to get a Augment holder (JC made) and attach it in a forge to an item we have made (Max of 3 slots).<br />
<br />
What you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Maddoc-the-Wayfarer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Now My idea would be to allow Smiths to work with Jewel Crafters to create Augment Mounts to add to ANY smithed items. <br />
<br />
That was pretty much the concept behind the jewelcrafted portion of the combines, but on a smaller, more limited scale -- Which is why you get not only a Type 4 augmentation slot on the Gates smithed weapons, but a Type 7 augmentation slot as well. <br />
<br />
If the ore can only be gotten by groups/raids that are elemental/time geared then most average tradeskillers will never see it.  <br />
<br />
Certain types of ore/materials are only available in the Time level zones. As I've said before, for the casual player, this might mean they need to vendor-dive or search the Bazaar in order to obtain them. Even though some of you might disagree, that's not necessarily a bad thing, as it gives even casual tradeskillers something that's somewhat attainable to strive for.  <br />
<br />
-- Maddoc<br />
<br />
Edit: Drop rates are a completely different topic alltogether, and I think it's a bit unfair to compare Gates drop rates to PoP drop rates quite yet.  <br />
<br />
As with any expansion launch, people intentionally don't sell items, either in the Bazaar or to merchants -- At least not until they're sure that they're not used for a quest they're going to kick themselves over later if they happened to sell it too early. Give it a little time. Let the players explore the content and the market settle. Gates drop rates are something I'm keeping a very close eye on, and if changes are necessary, you can be sure I'll make them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Maddoc I really appreciate your honest feedback here.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to &quot;Retro-fit&quot; some of the older smithing combines like I was discussing in my original Idea? So let us say I make a pair of Blessed Full Mithrial Greaves, Currently they only have one type 7 slot on them. <br />
I find a Grand Master Jewel Crafter to make me an &quot;Augment Holder&quot;, this would be an additional Augment slot for the Greaves I just made, I put the &quot;Augment Holder&quot; and Greaves into a forge and click combine (This is a CANNOT LEARN combine) if I succeed I get a new set of greaves with 1 type 7 and 1 other Augment slot. If I fail I get the same old Blessed Full Mithrial Greeves back. <br />
<br />
The problem I see from a Coding Stand point is that IF I am correct about there being a Master Data base of all items then we have Just Bloated it by a factor of 6 (one for each Augment type other than 7), and that is if you only allow one additional Augment Slot per item. <br />
<br />
Lastly I would like to say I will indeed give it time before judging the drop rates Maddoc, I honestly will try. But I would like to know if you have attempted to &quot;Dumpster dive&quot; (Bazaar or Vendor Shop) for most smithing items lately? I always check for the Hurricane items when in Bazaar and also any of the Elemental Planes items. When I do find some on Tunare the items tend to be outside of a price range I can afford or in to small of a quantity to attempt anything other than a sub-combine. Sure if I had a Million Plat I would be fine with this BUT currently I do not have that much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's absolutely possible to do something like that, and in fact... That's actually something I thought of doing for Gates, but I didn't have enough time to evaluate everything, ensuring that it was all done properly and didn't break bards or boats or gnomes or something...<br />
<br />
This is something that's on my list of &quot;This is a really cool idea, I should implement it sometime...&quot; stuff -- It's there, it may not necessarily ever get done, but it's always an option. :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>GunnyBurlfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well, I would like to say, as a tradeskiller, that it is indeed refreshing to see such an active official presence within the tradeskill community. <br />
<br />
That being said, I *do* check the Bazaar and the PoK-LDoN camp-Druid ring- merchant run on a fairly regular basis, and more often than not, barring the rare find on an NPC vendor, the elemental subcomponents for smithing and tailoring are found in the Bazaar and priced such that you might be able to show a slight profit if you never failed any steps. Since you tradeskill, you know how unlikely that is. <br />
<br />
I really can't offer up any method to allow the most dedicated tradeskillers to manufacture and sell gear almost equal to the most dedicated raiders' gear,  that would *also*  be safe to use and somehow cut out the macro bot hordes of The Enemy Who Will Not Be Named. :shocked:<br />
<br />
If they (you know, THEM)  can macro bot farming a camp in Seb, what truly is beyond their reach? <br />
<br />
Also, as a side note, what is *up* with the PoP leathers? Being a tailor/smith druid, I'd love to crank them out, but they require tempered elemental steel AND blood AND hide. If I did manage to luck into a supply of liquified earth on some unknown NPC vendor, I'd be stark raving mad to try to make those leathers, when plate requires LESS combines and sells for more. :irked:<br />
<br />
Anyways, good to see someone closely monitoring the tradeskills!<br />

You mean...<br />

Just like the Smithed Elemental Plate BPs?  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kolotha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Theres none of those on my server so I wasn't really thinking about them. Good point though, considering how difficult it is to make them, their stats  should be upgraded as well or have some of their ingredients removed to make them easier to make. All smithed gear and alot of other tradeskills need to have their stats overhauled, it is just such a waste to be able to make hundreds of different items that noone would ever use. Here I'll post some example of what I mean: Drop the trivial of banded armor to 20 or so, drop the trivial of fine plate to 50, drop LDoN armor trivial to 100, drop the trivial of acrylia armor to 130, change the stats of the low end smithed weapons to something that someone might actually use (for example change<br />
regular smithed longswords to 10/25 or something similar), get rid of the useless stuff like lanterns or drop their trivial down to 10 or lower etc. Another option might be limiting the amount of skill ups you can get from making one item, or changing the way they trivial. For example rather then setting a trivial for an item, arrange tradeskill items into sets. Like making weapons increases your chances to make a weapon, but has nothing to do with your success rate for making armor and vice versa. I really don't get how being good at making sewing needles makes you better at making armor, as the process to make them would not be similar in real life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">There's nothing wrong with the stats on Elemental Plate/Chain armours, IMHO.  There are Inferno &amp; Livestone Chain armours for sale in the Bazaar all the time on Xegony.<br />
<br />
Yeah, Elemental+ Guilds aren't impressed, but I sure am.<br />
<br />
The drop rates are a -tad- low... but the biggest real problem seems to be hoarding.  Many Elemental+ Guilds don't use the drops, but don't sell them either.  Also, with the release of GoD many Guilds aren't farming the Elementals anymore... thus, &quot;fewer drops&quot;.<br />
<br />
Elemental Plate requires too many tempers.  Remove the (Elemental) Chain Jointing from the recipies and they become very close to balanced with the Chain armour recipies.</div></div><hr />

Not debating that... Farwater Plate is considered decent.<br />
<br />
But Inferno &amp; even Livestone Plate isn't.  Not really sure about the Air stuff.  I think people just don't go there except to Raid for progression. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I've actually been bouncing a couple of ideas around on how this could be improved.  The trick I'm thinking of is not to change the recipes on the armor, as the plate recipes follow the pattern for most plate armor.  Rather, I'd like to see a change in yields on the subcombines.<br />
<br />
For example, the subcombine for sheets is one temper, two bricks, and a hammer, yielding one sheet.  What if the recipe became four bricks, one temper, and hammer to yield two sheets?<br />
<br />
The rings recipe is fine; it already yields two and that can't be changed without messing with the chain recipes.<br />
<br />
Do the same thing with chain jointing, though.  Two rings, one temper, hammer, and file in the forge would yield two chain jointings.<br />
<br />
Thus, two tempers would get you two chain jointing, and three tempers would get you six sheets of metal.  Add in one temper for the final combine, and that would mean seven tempers is enough for two plate BP attempts -- or 3.5 tempers per BP or legs.  This is in line with chain recipes<br />
<br />
To compare, here is how it would shape up.<br />
<br />
Chain one-ring items currently require 1.5 tempers per attempt.  Plate one-sheet items currently require 3.5 tempers per attempt.  With the new proposal, they would require 2.5 tempers per attempt.<br />
<br />
Chain two-ring items currently require 2 tempers per attempt.  Plate two-sheet items currently require 4.5 tempers per attempt.  With the new proposal, they would require 3 tempers per attempt.<br />
<br />
Chain three-ring items currently require 2.5 tempers per attempt.  Plate three-sheet items currently require 5.5 tempers per attempt.  With the new proposal, they would require 3.5 tempers per attempt.<br />
<br />
What would you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Tricsun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Thus, two tempers would get you two chain jointing, <br />
I think you mean one temper here.  :D  But that might help lessen the cost of these things.  The temper ingredients are by FAR the hardest pieces to get for elemental armor, and atm it's not really worth the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Kaycie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Just a few comments the part maddoc said about vendor diving.... thats fine but with the way the vendors are atm with if all the slots are full whatever the next thing to be sold is poof gone not coming back.  Make is so we can dig the hidden slots out again (that was half the fun anyhow)<br />
<br />
And the comment on the&quot;uber&quot; guilds hording drops i have to fully agree with this statement and it annoys the snot out of me, when we first got into elementals we gave out all the ts drops on a first come first serve basis now there where times when if you were to slow on a tell after the raid was over poof it was all gone but it was getting used.  Now one of the officers has 8 count them 8 mules full of ts stuff that unless your makeing said item for a main or raid bot just sit there, Ive offered to buy it from the guildbank etc but it really quite annoys me with the way it is atm.<br />
<br />
lol i honsetly dont want to know how much air and water temper drops are collecting dust. (fire temper is rare simply for the fact that so few kill the magma guys, and earth is at least expable to beable to farm drops in groups with out major hassle)<br />

/em grumble crawling back under my rock now <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Solarax_Manastorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">i spent the last week vendor diving with my wiz and 150k and guess what . i found almost nothing worth buying.<br />
<br />
BD and raw diamonds are about it .<br />
and yes i have access to EPs and am almost to time.<br />
<br />
the vendor diving is not a viable option as it stands to luck that may help you in one instance which wont yield enough combines for skill ups or might fail for important items because your not gonna find 50 solidified magmas or even 2 or on ab even 1 on a vendor( just an example not a BS TS item) i know cause i just spent a week doing before i opened my mouth.</div></div><hr />

No, I mean two.  You need one temper to make a brick into two rings, then a second temper to make the two rings into two jointing.</div></div><hr />
