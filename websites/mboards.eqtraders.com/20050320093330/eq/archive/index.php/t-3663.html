I'm told this is was put together by the Japanese guild Mirage.  It has a huge loading time but is so well worth it.  It took me a good 15 minutes to win the battle not to cry, sitting here at my desk at work.  It's beautiful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But what is this a tribute to? A memorial to?  Huh?<br />
<br />

<br />
Slow, apparently,<br />

<br />
Maybe I'm just an old sap hehe...well, no, I definitely am an old sap.  I guess it does a good job of capturing the fondness I have for the game and the world and the people after three and a half years now.</div></div><hr />

I want a copy of the song.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhisk</div><div class="date">03-02-2003, 11:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Huh?  OK, I watched it... I watched it a second time thinking I missed something.  Then a third because I still couldnt see what was so great about it.  The music was ok, the pics were nothing that special.  Screen shots with the color washed out.  OK, yay!  Maybe I am just missing something deeper, but I just can not see anything worth getting excited over.  <br />
<br />
Oh well...<br />

<br />
When I watched it, it was not the images that I enjoyed, instead I enjoyed that it served as a catalyst for similar memories from my own EQ experience.<br />
<br />
Truthfully, the EQ community has a jaded edge these days. So a reminder of good times is welcome.</div></div><hr />
