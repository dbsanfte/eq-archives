Just how far above trivial should one stick to when skilling up ?<br />
I have read some posts where people went to idols right after Opal steins . Thats a 20 point difference. Reason I ask , is I am at 222 now , and was going to make the White Ceramic Bands . Then maybe try a few Crucibles&lt; depending on heavy clay stores&gt; and then take a run at idols . Although I am disgruntled about the costs of Opals and Peridots for the Bands , I was weighing that against the almost double trivial lvl of the Idols . Would it take me twice as long to skill up using idols , therefore increasing my costs to somewhere near White Band supplies ? <br />
<br />
Any insight , info and advice would be greatly appreciated .<br />
<br />
Thanks ,<br />

The trivial of the combine is irrelevant to skill gain, only to success rate.  If you don't care about the successes and just want fast skill gains (i.e., most of pottery), just make whatever item is (a) not trivial and (b) cheapest/fastest/most convenient for you, and throw away all the results.  Idols, ceramic bands, ruby steins -- they'll all net you approximately the same skill gain rate.<br />
<br />
If you care about maximum success rate because you want to sell the finished product, make the item that has a trivial as close as possible to your skill level but still above it (i.e., as you do with jewelry making).  Since most pottery skill gain items are junk and have near zero sellback now, I doubt this is a consideration for you.</div></div><hr />
