<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dyllwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wondering if anyone else is seeing a reduced forage rate for tufts of dire wolf fur in Thurgadin. A guild mate who normally supplies me with tufts has been complaining about a severe reduction since the last patch or two, not sure if he's just having a run of bad luck or if others have noticed this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since I'ma WE Rogue, my foraging skill is at 50 (just an FYI).<br />
<br />
In the past 6 months I've noticed a serious reduction in morning dews, Misty dews, tufts, and several other useful items.<br />
<br />
Someone posted a link to a site where someone did about 400 forages in each zone (or got reports of forages) and listed what your chances of getting the items were, when I did forage, it did seem to go along with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tufts in Thurg seem to be the same or very close to what they used to be. If it did get nerfed it wasnt by much.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As odd as this may sound considering that Forage is totally random this is what I have discovered, please bear in mind that this isn’t in any way purely definitive just what I have noticed. <br />
<br />
For example if I want to forage Oak Bark in Kith, I’ll zone in do 5 to 8 forages if I’ve not gotten an Oak Bark I’ll camp out or zone out, then zone back in and resume my 5 to 8 forages until it results in the desired Oak Bark (you may not want to do this after three zones, depends on your patience). <br />
<br />
Like I said this could be purely superstition but once I forage an Oak Bark with in that 5 to 8 I’ll remain in the zone and most likely (9 times out of 10) I will continue foraging Oak Bark with in 5/8 rarely more than 10 forages before yielding another Oak Bark. <br />
<br />
I’ve been doing this now for over two years and in that two years this method seems to work pretty well. Again I don’t have a logical explanation as to why it seems to work, I just know that it seems to work more times than not. <br />
<br />
Once when I was PLing my Bard Songs (Vha Shir) I zoned into Kith and got 5 Oak Barks in a row upon zoning in, I remained there and foraged Oak Bark with in 5/8 forages.<br />
<br />
I’ve also noticed that upon zone ins you can sometimes forage that rare item as soon as you zone in. I’ve had this happen with Oak Bark, Druid Epic and most other rare foraged items. I’d like to hear any methods you guys may have.</div></div><hr />

I did this for the first few days he told me about it, only when it seemed to be a long term pattern did I decide to bring it up :)</div></div><hr />
