<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rerashyaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gunthak beach - zombies there can drop multiple.  Also check the lighthouse merchants.<br />
Innothule swamp - low level zombies drop 'em, but rarer. Check the merchant in zone and in gukta.<br />
Estate of Unrest - I'm kidding, don't farm here, the drop rate sucks. But by golly, that's where I had to farm for 'em back in the day :-D<br />
<br />
Also check merchants in newb zones for puma, polar bear, tiger and black wolf skins (white wolf and mist wolf also work, but I seem to recall a lack of stacking).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There's an undead ruins in EC, so the merchants in EC have them sometimes, but Gunthak is, to my knowledge, the best place to farm them.</div></div><hr />

Nektulos, Nektulos, Nektulos.  Multiple undead spawn locations.<br />
<br />
There is the crucible by lavastorm, tons of zombies and rotting citizens<br />
There is the undead pyramid, tonz of zombies<br />
There is the monolith by the EC zone, though they pop there less frequently<br />
<br />
Blurgurg by the bridge always has some<br />
The vendor in front of Neriak &quot;Somethnig Bloodwalker&quot; always them<br />
<br />
And if you are an evil race....my god.  Farm the vendors in the FQ<br />
I picked up over 130 zombie skins last night from the vendors</div></div><hr />

Once more where my mask of deception will come in handy, but even as a wood elf I'm not KOS.  MUUHAHAHAAH!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>HalfNotez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nadox - Just past Upper Luggs. Hallway is a safe spot to pull or the Hatesfury zonein.<br />
<br />
Blue to 65 so its still exp and you can get some decent drops there also (Gems, Bow of Suffering, Gem Inlaid Longsword...etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Liandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As Rerashyaka said go to the newbie area outside Gutka.  Zombies seem to be on the same spawn table as the crab spiderlings.   Spiderlings spawn during the day and zombies at night.<br />
<br />
So, just head there and wipe out the spiderlings for the silks and by night take out the zombies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grimsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like Gunthak Beach but I have more reason than just zombie skins sense I'm a Gnome Necro. The zombies drop zombie skin for my pottery and watterlogged rigging for my tinkering. And the skeletons there drop bone chips for my pets and silver tipped quills for my tinkering.<br />
<br />
Plus the mobs have dropped up to 6pp in coin and sometimes a gem so the money helps cover the cost of the tradeskills some.<br />
<br />
So for me Gunthak Beach is the place to go. I win all the way around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Pirsquared</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There is a small tower in the northern part of Innothule Swamp surrounded by Fetid Froglok Ghouls which drop zombie skins.  There are 5 or 6 surrounding the tower and another 2 ghouls nearby.  This is the best place for farming that I have encountered because no other types of mobs spawn there.  Unless it was recently changed, of course.  Also check the merchant Ruala near the Gukta entrance.<br />
