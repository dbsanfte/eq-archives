Stormguard Root Beer is the only way to go. :D Root beer floats if I feel like chasing golras for a few hours.

<br />
But if you're looking for something that lasts a long time and actually has useful stats added to it then yeah, kaladim constitutionals, maybe quenos afternoon tea if you have a forage bot that is also in charge of spider killing.<br />

 GOOD Stuff tah drink, so's folks knows yer no pansy,<br />
<br />
 Stormguard rootbeer is creamy and frothy and as thich as a good stout ale, so it is a fine substitute for when yer &quot;On Duty.&quot;:D <br />
<br />
 Tis why it was invented, guards can't take a normal ale break so this fills in while on duty guarding Kaladim.</div></div><hr />

It has a few stats, and is cheap to make, so newbies are wowed if you give them away.:goodvibe:  But you need the GoD expansion to buy lemons, as they are only available in Abysmal at them moment...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lanalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Kaladim Constitutionals. :)<br />
<br />
With IM3, it takes me forever to go through a stack. My tradeskill mule still has about 15 stacks on her just because I consume them so slowly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Been making some Taelosian teas... not tasty, but quite potent...<br />
<br />
I keep a good supply of flasks of bloodwater around to drink while I keep the teas in my main slot.  I prefer to think of it as drinking the bloodwater to quench my thirst, but letting the aroma of the teas keep my stats up.<br />
<br />
As for my favorite drink... Root Beer Floats without a doubt... not only my favorite drink out of game, but well worth the time to go out and get some chunks of ice...<br />
<br />
EDIT:  now if only those gnomes could come up with an ice cream maker... seriously... with absolutely NO new tinkered stuff added w/ GoD... they could have at least given them something fun...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah - I did a stack of combines a couple months ago when I finally got around to maxing brewing, and the resulting 3-4 stacks of Constitutionals I got back was way more than enough to last me until now with IM3. I think I still have more than a stack and a half from that initial run. IM3 is great, only 3 AA to make food and drink last for freaking ever!</div></div><hr />

<br />
how did dwarves invent a root beer if no dwarf can forage? <br />
<br />
<br />
before the TSUI i drank pods of water (you forage way too many at 200 skill) or Fuzzles. Now, since I can make root beer with a click, I steal the roots and actually brew stuff ^_^ <br />

<br />
Buy it unless you are a gm - it trivials at 339.  We fail half the time at 250 brewing.  Still, it is what I carry - lasts forever.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>The Judge, Alchem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">As a Barbarian Shaman who rides a horse often, I already have IM3.  My stats are close to all being maxed so I don't use stat drinks, just food.  I usually gulp down Fuzzlecutters.  I use to make fruit juice just for fun and drink it.  Force feeding yourself is a good practice though.  Put your stat food in your first slot in your first bag, then your last slot put some iron rations and right click every now and then.  Too bad Magel-o doesn't show these stats as working :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Obina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Perhaps this is a silly question, but this thread got me thinking of changing my drinking habits.<br />
<br />
Today I always drink milk.  That's because I can buy it everywhere and I dont by accident use it up smithing or pottery-ing and end up begging for water during raid.  But t-t-t-t-trigger drinks too much, so I'd like something that lasts !<br />
<br />
So my silly question is what do the drink descriptions mean in terms of lasting?  Drink, Miraculous Drink, Lasting Drink, Refreshing drink and Whistle wetter?  Seems like perhaps other than Fizzle 500 (buy in one place), if I want somthing that lasts longer than milk, and easy to make (i.e not Qeynos tea - I'm only 188 in brew) im looking at Lemonade as suggested above!  But that assumes &quot;Whistle wetter&quot; is better than &quot;Drink&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">As far as observations go I'd say whistle wetter is not as good as drink in duration. Really, you gulp whistle wetters down faster than a frat boy at free Oktoberfest.<br />
<br />
Fuzzlecutters is the longest lasting 'plain' (non-stat) drink I know of, and with only occasional forcefeeding can keep my little lizzie from guzzling down all those QATs - well, it slows it down at least, occasional accidents will happen. Other than that if you don't mind drinking your stat drinks those do all have pretty good duration on them. Sad to say I don't believe we have even a single drink we can make easily or cheaply that's as good for duration as that hair tonic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Thicket Tundrabog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Kaladim Constitutionals is my drink of choice. They're easy to make with the tradeskill interface.<br />
<br />
Hero sandwiches for stat food. I quad in HoH a lot. Kinda expensive because I can sell them easily at 100 pp each, but hey... I make them myself  :) <br />
<br />
IM3 makes a stack last a very long time, if you don't use a horse.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gagzab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I use twice brewed constitutionals.  If you're able to make them and drink kaladim constitutionals anyway, they're highly recommended.  As a troll I eat more, but haven't gotten IM yet.  Even so, I can go through 2 or 3 stacks(forget exactly) of 10lb meat pies and still be on my first stack of twice brewed.  They seem to last much longer than normal kaladim constitutionals.<br />
<br />
And if you're still skilling and working kaladim constitutionals to skill on, twiced brewed are also &gt;250 combine so you can get more bang for your time.  They also are easier to make :)</div></div><hr />
