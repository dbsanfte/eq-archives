An Enchanted Imbued Elven Chain (tunic and legs I think, can't quite remember) So I agreed to hit combine for him for 50p. But I am now sick with the flu and don't really feel like logging in. <br />
<br />
I told him exactly what he needed (left out file and elven smithy hammer since I had them already) and he told me that he had everything but the imbued emeralds and should have them soon. So, I was wondering if you could please combine for him? I would be very grateful if you could. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.<br />

<br />
Make sure they mention your name though.<br />
<br />
Most of the time my trader-wench Adelie is on, but I'm not actually around.  However, I do look at my most recent tells when I do get home (assuming I'm still logged in, that is).<br />
<br />
Also I got my left index finger slammed in a door at work yesterday, so I probably won't be doing much adventuring (I'm left handed).  I will be checking in though.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, I'm all antibioteced (probably not a word) up so I should be good to get back in game now. :) Thanks for the offer and hope your finger gets better!</div></div><hr />
