If he hadn't.... then it's too late.  The Sleeper's Tomb zone has been revamped on every server and renamed to Kerafyrm's Lair.  The Sleeper is gone, but a new menace has taken his place.  The Key to Sleepers still works here.</div></div><hr />

The Sleeper was just awoken a few days ago, creating quite a hubbub...to say the least.  The posts about it are almost all immersed in flames, but there are links there.  I never followed any, but I assume at least some of em are what they say they are.  <br />
<br />
Karana might well be the last of the original servers to have awakened The Sleeper.  Until now everyone held off to keep the old drop tables available.  Kaidian, what did you mean about it being too late?  I heard about the revamp of the zone but didn't pay much attention.</div></div><hr />
