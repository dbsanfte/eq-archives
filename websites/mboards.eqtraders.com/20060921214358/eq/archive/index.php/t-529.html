So... since I FINALLY passed 197 tailoring, I wanted to post the data for my last few skill ups, which happened over a few weeks.<br />
<br />
I'll start with the 190's.<br />
<br />
Skill - Combines<br />
190 - 31 <br />
191 - 42 <br />
192 - 49<br />
193 - 48<br />
194 - 5<br />
195 - 5<br />
196 - 1<br />
197 - 71 <br />
<br />
Currenly 5 combines into 198.<br />
<br />
I really felt that I paid for my mid-ninties 'lucky streak' with the two in a row skill up I got from 195 - 196.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jannelle Silverthorne</div><div class="date">12-08-2002, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's my data from Kirasha's run from 190. Skill to 191 was primarily solstice robes and some velious items I'd saved up and burned in a push to be able to do Ethereal silk prior to the patch. Skill from 191 to 211 was all ethereal silk combines the night before the patch.<br />
<br />

212  -  24  So far.<br />
<br />
<br />
Total from 155 where I started keeping records is as follows.<br />
1206 combines for 56 skill ups. Average 21.5357 combines per skill up.<br />
<br />
Worst were 175 at 69 combines and 179 at 71 combines. There were also 6 sub 5 combine skill ups scattered through the range.</div></div><hr />

Between 190 to 205, I didn't have a single skillup that took less than 100 combines, and several took 300+ combines.<br />
<br />
Grats though, soon you will be able to fairly reliably make velious tailored items, and you'll start making back *some* of the money you have spent on tailoring... =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jackoal</div><div class="date">12-08-2002, 09:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First I have to say &quot;I WAS PISSED&quot; at the adding of a forge to town in CC. I had spent 3 days fishing in CS to get enough cod for 5 stacks cod oil to go with my 5 stacks of wyvern hides I had collected and save while lvl'ing my 50's. I sold the oil and hide because there is nothing worse then farming ore as a chanter even with reduced wgt bags. ( rant off)<br />
<br />
After having no hides or oils I desided to go another way Solstice robes. So off the EK with my SK. Sure I was taking all the spider but hey need them silks. After collectin 650 silk swatches (1300 silks). I PL an elf cleric to lvl 29.(can you believe people want 500pp per stack of imbue emeralds). For 2 days on and off I imbue 33 stacks of  emeralds ( thank god for having a lvl 61 chanter on 2nd account, unlimited C3). Emeralds done. Next spend the next 3 hours making celestrial essence (Varent really need to have a vender sell per-made). Anyone know what it's like to sit down and make 2600 celestrial essence? (It sux a$$). Essence done. Spend the next 1-2 hours making the scared silks. 600 scared done, Next on to the gem studded collar. Buy a stack of emeralds, rubies, and sapphire. (dont remerber the total pp spent but it was alot) Out of the 20 attmpts at collar I had made 12, thats with 260 int, 250 JC skill and tinker item. So now I have all the stuff need for 200 combines on solstice robe. I dont watch skill ups because it doesnt go up.  So off to find a littel corner in an empty building. Start combining, I started with a skill of 187 by the time i was out of silks, I had made 9 robes and skill was at 195, was hoping to get to 200 or higher but guess it's off EK to farm more silks.<br />

<br />
Yes I do oh yes I do. I make all of my own Coldain Velium Tempers as well as all of the Essence for the Robes. OUCH. <br />
<br />
Back to the topic of tailoring runs I do not have my specific numbers but dang I have to say it has gotten a bit easier. I know from 190 to 201 it took me a month or so of 20 or more combines per night. Now I seem to have hit the wall again at 208. I did a good 40 combines this weekend and nothing for skill.</div></div><hr />

In a word: yes<br />
<br />
Though I do usually do them in &quot;sessions&quot; of a hundred or so at a time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup. I found the most efficient way to handle the gazillion sub combines was to work on them all simultaneously. So I would sit at the kiln in the Bazaar and imbue emeralds until I was oom, sit down, make enough CE's to process those emeralds through dusts and silks, then make dusts, then make silks. Go to the bank, drop off completed silks and pick up more regular swatches and emeralds and I'd be nearly FM again. If not, make more CE's, pick up more CE supplies. Sometimes I would work with a mule next to me so I wouldn't have to stand up or move (full of CE supplies, silks, emeralds, acid...)<br />
<br />
I also used to carry a mortar-n-pestle and celestial solvent with me everywhere - and made CE's from dropped pages and stuff whenever I could, either soloing or in groups.</div></div><hr />
