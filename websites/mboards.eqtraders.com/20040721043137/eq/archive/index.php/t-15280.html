<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was curious at approximately how much plat you all spent to get Pottery to skill 250?<br />
Was it like 500k Plat?<br />
If I were to stop at skill 200......how much would that cost?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Obviously, your experience can differ, but at 255 wisdom, I did the following, more or less:<br />
<br />
To 199: Do poison vials, casseroles and such: very cheap.  Probably less than 1000 pp total.<br />
<br />
199-216: I got about one skillup per 17 tries, but that was pre-nerf, so expect it to be about twice that now.  I did opal steins (cost 22 pp, sold all of them for 15-20 pp) and unfired planar steins (made them all into planar peridot steins and sold half, used half for experience, but again that was before they nerfed the experience payoff on the quest (honest, I didn't know it was excessively high experience, and I only turned in about 30)).  So, at 22 pp each for opal steins and 16 each for planar steins, expect to spend about 10k, not counting selling the mugs in the Bazaar, which will get you back about 6500 plat.  Sellbacks to merchants will only net you about 1200.<br />
<br />
217-222: I did opal steins exclusively to 222, since I didn't need mana vials for them, and the steins sell (below cost, but the rings don't sell at all).  Again, expect about one skillup per 30 tries at 255 wisdom, or 180 mugs.<br />
<br />
223-241: I did a mix of crucibles of escape ( I fired them and sold them all for 235 pp each) and unfired idols (Quellious, the Tribunal and two stacks of Bristlebane).  Total for the idols are 15 pp plus the cost of the gem, plus imbuing/enchanting costs.  Costs for the crucible is 8 pp unfired (do this if you're just practicing) or 50 pp for fired.  Also pre-nerf, I got about 1 skillup for 18 combines.  The idols don't sell at all so it's all lost money.  Considering the five stacks of crucibles were a profit leader (made about 2000 pp net for those stacks) I spent a total of  6000 plat.  Remember that these prices reflect the fact that I got all (I say again, ALL) of my mana vials for the cost of components, and ALL of my imbues done for free.  If you need to hire someone to do this sort of thing, or pay premium for materials, you'll spend a lot more.<br />
<br />
So, it is cheaper than fletching, but not cheaper than jewelcrafting.  And none of them are cheap.  But it is doable without a raid guild bankroll behind you.<br />

I've been turning in the opal-encrusted steins and white ceramic bands to my tribute master instead of selling them in Bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Elmier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well,<br />
<br />
For me pottery from 199 to 250 cost me 50k. I found brewing to be cheapest to 250, with JC second as it only cost me 9k to do JC from 0 to 250 in 10 hours, used the guide on RPGexpert. Oh and I am a ranger with a 305 Wisdom. I would also like to add that now I am using Pottery, to fund my last two skills (smithing and tailoring) in their quest from 220 to 250.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cubwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">according to my skill up notes (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=12997), I did 1703 combines from 200 to 250 at 16.388pp each, for a total of 27,908.764pp. 1-200 took less than 500pp (I don't keep track pre-200).<br />
<br />
roughly 28,000pp to GM pottery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LexBardMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Whatever.  I didn't do JC when you could enchant the stuff and lose barely any PP.  Compared to the other skills I've maxed it seemed like I had to do an asstastic amount of combines in JC which of course resulted even in more costly failures.  Fletching I failed hardly anything but the sheer attrition of the combines is what hurt so bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Baldaek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Currently 246 Pottery.<br />
<br />
199 to 246 was all rings and unfired idols.  Easily spending in the neighborhood of 30K.  Most of the cost is on gems and vials - i traded imbuing of emeralds (through my druid) for imbuing of the gems i needed for the idols.  <br />
<br />
Though I want to get to 250, I'd rather spend the 4K or so on just about anything else, like the tailoring I'm working on.<br />

<br />
Tailoring should be more expensive then smithing, I think. Farming rockhoppers for tailoring generates a LOT of hides usable for fine steel skillups. I started downgrading medium and HQ hopperhides after I had 4 stacks of HQ hide around. <br />
<br />
Also, you can PBAE smithing components in a lot of zones, while wyvern and rockhopper hides require quadding in a few (usually overcrowded) zones, or even single kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Iumini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I made 250 in profit by selling my wares in the bazaar. I think i made 250 in about december 2003.  The main advantage i had was I had a levle 62 chanter with horse for the huge amount of vials etc and i am a cleric worshipping CT. I did all combines after 199  at 280 wis with a geer lock.<br />
<br />
I made mainly opal steins 199-222. Making in batches of 40 and selling in bazaar before I made more. Prices varied from 15-30 so sometimes I made money sometimes lost.<br />
<br />
<br />
At 222 i started making golden idols of tunare (80-90 percent sucessrate at this skill plus geer lock) in batches of 4 or 5. I would then sell these inbazaar for 600-1k depending on current price. I think i got 2 skill ups on these total but they made enough profit to fund a huge number of<br />
idol of cazic thules I made and destroyed. I also did some cruciples of escape those these don't sell well.<br />
<br />
From 248-250 I made star ruby steins making about 50 percent and selling at 200 ish I made a small profit.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are in a hurry you will loose money but if you have the time to wait to sell you wears to players you can do it without too much cost</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aalar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The key here is time.  Less time to skill up = more plat.  More time to skill up = less plat.  The more time would involve doing a lot of ones's own farming.  And farming itself will bring one additional cash in form of PC sellable loot - vendor trash loot and just straight cash.  Less time would be going to bazaar and buying something someone else has spent time farming.  It just depends on what you are willing to do.<br />
<br />
When I was skilling up thru the lower ranks of smithing I didn't want to spend a lot of money doing it.  I went the ornate chain route so I needed lots of HQ ore - I just didn't want to pay for it.  So I went to Sol A with a bunch of empty backpacks and killed everything there (made many trips).  The gobs drop lots of FS and some HQ ore and unrefined ore and plat and other items.  I converted the FS into HQ ore - sold the vendor trash drops.  I actually ended up several thousand plat richer going up to 158 skill in smithing.  If you have the time I suggest you take this route to 158 skill in smithing.  And as a side benefit I knwo Sol A really really well now.  :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fulminate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yesterday and today I did 1000 pottery combines, and went from 200 to 229.<br />
<br />
The cost was about 17 pp ea for the first 800 (planar and opal steins), and about 30 pp ea for the last 200 (white rings)... making it about 20,000 pp total.  <br />
<br />
This is more than I spent on getting JC from 200 to 250.  Despite each individual combine being cheaper, the skill up rate for pottery seems a good deal lower than that for JC, and the products produced dont sell back to vendors for very much at all.  <br />
<br />
I expect the last 21 ups wil cost me as much or more, and be more difficult to achieve, since my enchanter mule is only level 24, and cant make the level 29 mana vials needed past 231.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Elmier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well,<br />
<br />
      I did expensive method, of steins. Cost me abut 35k total to get to 250. But I have more than made 5 times that in profit from Golden Idols of Tunare. So, some of the tradeskills can pay for themselves without a major amount of flagging done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aalar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think pottery is one of the skills an unflagged individual can make a tidy profit from.  A lot of the nice items can be farmed from the lower level PoP zones.<br />
<br />
One of my favorite spots to farm items is the PoF where the charm birds spawn.  They are on a 3 day spawn, more or less.  So if you are able to solo there you can kill the magmas which drop solidified magma which is used to make the ceramic incense burner of Ro.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>The Judge, Alchem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think Silverfish's way of skilling up is less than admirable.  EQ Traders has a guide where you can level up to Mastery by doing bowels in succession for less than 100pp.  Then choose your route to go from there.  I would have to agree with the majority here, after reading the EQT guides I spent less than a few hundred pp to get to 200.  Vials were most exspensive in components to make.  I got greedy and just wanted to get to 200 so I bought from Bazaar, but you could farm your own stuff that you need til 200 cap, or 198 rather.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Akishka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I don't understand why Silverfish's way is less than admirable?  Seems like a viable option to me and I'm doing something similar.</div></div><hr />

This sentence leads me to believe he may not realize that one can use Crow's Special Brew for poison vials.  Doing it with pelts or skins can get very costly in time and materials, but in the Abysmal Sea that's not necessary, so it's easy and much cheaper than anything the Bazaar can provide.<br />
