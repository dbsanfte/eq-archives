<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solarax_Manastorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok i have started the journey of tradeskills and have 250 pottery (OMG did that suck @$$) 200 JC 200fletching 200 brewing 191 baking 188mithing and 183tailoring ( got lucky on my 8th shawl combine)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you had searched for rockhoppers in the forum you would see that the general area considered &quot;best&quot; is the hopper caves in DSP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Is there anywhere else that they drop?  I always thought this was a DPS exclusive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ChaseFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Had you searched, you'd have discovered that the superb and flawless rockhopper hides also drop in the Scarlet Desert and in Mons Letalis. Both zones are far more likely to result in adds that will detract from your farming time. Dawnshroud is by far the most superior place to hunt the hoppers for their hides.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Deedolith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Only problem with DSP is the place is highly contested (either by farmer up, or by people looking for their VT shard). And samabatas can be up instead opf hoppers. IF so, you have to kill the sambata leader, wich have the sambata keeper as PH.<br />
Also, even if you have good faction with those, some are KoS, no matter what.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Solarax_Manastorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the dsp spot is highly contested and i was asking for the places that the pros use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kahmon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did a lot of farming in scarlett desert at the base of the ramp to the plateau. There are about 4 or 5 that roam in that small area and I could usually find a few more farther out before they repopped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Solarax_Manastorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">is the drop rate the same % for each zone or does 1 zone drop them more than others. i know there are more to kill in dsp but the drop rate there is reported as 5%-6.5% by the 6 diferent people i asked and thier answers didnt vary but that was ONLY for dsp and none of them had hunted anywhere else</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tzaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I tend to go to Mons Letalis so as to avoid DSP which tends to be a popular camp. ML usually has one other person or just myself, 3 boxing. My method is to send out my 65 monk, come back with a train of 6+ mobs, rinse and repeat.  I couldn’t guess at % of drops, as I pull a unavoidable mixed bag of adds. But I would guess it averages out to 1 hide every 3 pulls or there abouts? Not a high ratio at any rate, and far from easy work.</div></div><hr />

Having hunted only in Dawnshroud and Mons Letalis for pelts, I can tell you that there is no discernable difference in the frequency of pelt drops. Not scientific, just an observation.<br />

Hope that helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Solarax_Manastorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">would you say that solstice robes are an easyer way to go to skill up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">long and involved subcombines and expensive.  quicker normally though if you have plat to throw at the problem.  take lots of silk.  many people do them to 210 where they start suceeding and losing too many chains.  <br />
<br />
hoppers are one of the best wizard soloable routes.  obviously quadding cs is good too.  cs is crowded with wizards and druids quadding though already.  good luck solarax</div></div><hr />

From extensive experience this is not true.<br />
<br />
Hopper hunting.<br />
<br />
Dawnshroud peaks.<br />
<br />
Plus side. <br />
1. Lots of hoppers. The cave can support several people or groups hunting.<br />
<br />
2. Ease of access  and least dangerous hungint spot<br />
<br />
Down side.<br />
1. Low drop rate of pelts<br />
2. Often contested<br />
3. They may not even be up if someone is questing and has changed the cave from hoppers to sambata.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mons Letalis<br />
<br />
Plus side.<br />
<br />
1. Lots of hoppers.<br />
2. Drop rate is slightly  higher<br />
<br />
<br />
Down side<br />
1. Terrible hunting terrain<br />
2. Lots of potential adds especially if you are KOS to the SHik Nar.<br />
3. Since the last attempt at fixing pathing. You have the old big pile o mobs stuck under the world at 1 point problem<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Scarlet desert.<br />
<br />
Plus side.<br />
<br />
1. Relatively safe place to hunt the hoppers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Down side.<br />
1. About same drop rate as DSP<br />
2. Very few hoppers to farm<br />
3. small but anoying possibility of adds<br />
4. Pathing near mesa is horrible<br />
5. Location is remote <br />
<br />
That is from extensive hunting in all three areas.<br />
