<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I remember a while back someone posted a list of all the loc for the fruit groundspawns in shadeweavers thicket.  I had copied it and reposted it so it wouldn't get lost because it was valuable information.  I can't seem to find it, probably due to the move to a different server.  <br />
<br />
Is there any way I or someone can look up the old archives and find the post?  <br />
<br />
many thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gareen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just look for the &quot;trees&quot; with blue leaves.  On the ground under that tree is a ground spawn for the payala fruit.  I think that all of the blue-leaved trees have the payala fruit ground spawn.  That's much easier than remembering specific locations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Right, but I was gonna code the locs into my map.<br />
<br />
Besides, some of them were hard to find without the locs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
basically its a circle on your map starting at shar vahl down to bottom of the zone up thru near the path and back over to shar vahl, really no need to put locs on map just look for the blue trees in those general areas. Sal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i got 28 per circuit.  i also marked on map first time through and sped me up greatly.  dont need map now though.<br />
