<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I was in Wl trying to forage Yew leaves.  I am in the tower in the middle of the lake, on the level below the portal for PoG.  I figured I was well out of the way to avoid any wandering mobs.  I went afk for a while, only to come back to find I had been killed by a human mercenary.  Is this normal pathing, or did this guy follow someone up, and just happen to agro on me on the way back down?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taushar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am not sure about the pathing but I found the safest place to forage is the succor point. The succor point in WL is entrance to Kael. I have never seen any mobs come that way unless someone trains to the zone, which happens once in a while. If you go afk, it's a good idea to either hide or invis. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You were in the tower... I presume at the top, right next to the Tree Zone in to Plane of Growth?<br />
<br />
The problem with going AFK there (regardless of being inviz or not) is that someone else could bring a train to the PoG zone in, anouncing it or not... zone in and leave the mercenary standing next to you.<br />
<br />
Invizibility is a rotten way to go AFK when you are alone... because of the dang un-predictable length of the spell. It could last 10 seconds, 10 minutes or 10 hours. You just have no clue.<br />
<br />
If you insist on sitting in a zone where mobs will agro onto you (if they get close)... you should either be always there, have friends keeping you company when you go AFK... or simply zone to a SAFE zone before going AFK. <br />
<br />
Even Feign Death is not a gaurantee (think AOE spells going off near you). It is much safer FD than inviz... <br />
<br />
The potential of trains might be low... but you can never tell.</div></div><hr />

Invizibility... [snip] ... dang un-predictable length of the spell. It could last 10 seconds, 10 minutes or 10 hours.   <br />
<br />
Actually the ABSOLUTE maximum for invisibility to last (or superior camo) is 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
I personally hate invis because magicians don't get many divination spells, so I used to fizzle it all the time and even when it worked, it never lasted very long.  Now, of course, my diviniation is 2 points away from being maxed but I still have that old superstition so I use &quot;Veil of Elements&quot; (improved invis) which has a length of exactly 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
Best spell ever.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, am I wrong or don't druids get self only invis that has a fixed duration? I know my druid at level 52 has it and he's the foraging type. I usually use that fixed duration invis and can go afk without any problem. He's also Wood Elf, which means he has hide, which doesn't go away until you move, cast spell or attack. One tip on hide, since it won't tell you if you successfully hid or not. Go target a mob that is not indifferent to you. Go stand where you want to go afk, do a /con. It should say scowling. Hit hide and do /con again. If still scowling, cancel hide and try again until you get indiff. Then you are safe to go afk unless a see invis mob comes nearby. I don't think there is a see invis mob near Kael entrance that I know of.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yep, they can try to get it at 51.  It is mob dropped in the deep.  I have not checked to see if it can be researched or not, and I am not sure if I am going to want to pay the astronomical price it is bound to be in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Aren't there a bunch of giants that hang around the entrance to Kael in WL?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Taushar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sorry Lilosh for not reading that link.  My company has the **** filter that does not allow certain sites to show up on my browser. Also, the connection is unreliable sometime. I assume that is the invis spell I was referring to? <br />
<br />
The giants in Kael entrance is outside the tunnel that leads to Kael. When you succor, you end up right near the actual zoneline, a bit further from the tunnel entrance. I have never had aggro problems there since I had the port spell to WL. Besides, those giants do not see through invis or hide. If you can do either, you are safe there to go afk.<br />
