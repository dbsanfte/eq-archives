<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ngreth Thergn</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 08:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This was not me.  I got it from the tech tales website...<br />
&lt;hr&gt;<br />
<br />
Frankencompaq<br />
<br />
So the next box in line to go on the bench is a Compaq whose ticket claims it just needs a new modem. Okay, easy enough. Right? <br />
<br />
Right?<br />
<br />
Uh, no.<br />
<br />
First thing I notice when I get it on the bench: the power supply that's in there obviously does not belong there. Half the fan is obscured by the case, and an AT power switch is poking through a jury-rigged hole on the back. Unshielded, I might add. I know for a fact that this particular model takes an ATX power supply.<br />
<br />
Something told me that before I so much as plugged this thing in, I needed to look inside.<br />
<br />
OH DEAR GOD.<br />
<br />
As soon as I get the case off, the other tech falls off his chair laughing. After I put the outer case down and look for myself, I see why.<br />
<br />
No, that's definitely not the right power supply. Or the right motherboard--/that/ appears to be held in place by a piece of cardboard wedged between it and the chassis. And then, /then,/ I see exactly what had the other tech laughing so hard.<br />
<br />
*****! ***** ON THE MOUNTAIN WEARING A CRASH HELMET!<br />
<br />
The hard drive is dangling from a random support in the chassis, held by electrical tape.<br />
<br />
I laughed. I laughed until tears squirted freely from my eyes. I had to laugh, or I would have screamed.<br />
<br />
Other tech and I root around for the webcam we have stashed somewhere, so we can get pictures of this.<br />
<br />
Boss #1 comes out of his meeting. I wave him over. He makes a face that utterly defies description and runs to get me his digital camera so we can get /better/ pictures of this. I express my reservations about so much as plugging the thing in, let alone trying to fix it. He agrees and suggests I write up a release for the customer to sign if she decides she still wants me to work on it.<br />
<br />
I attempt to call customer. Line is busy.<br />
<br />
Customer finally returns call. I tell her in no uncertain terms that there is no way in Hell I am working on this computer unless she signs the release, and then proceed to tell her exactly /why./ <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God,&quot; she says when I am done. Apparently, she's never looked in it.<br />
<br />
She comes to collect it rather than have us attempt surgery on it. She looks in it and is as horrified as I was. <br />
<br />
I finally demand to know who worked on it before us, so that I may go and poke his eyes out with a spork. She says her sister bought it from a flea market.<br />
<br />
Moral: Do not buy computers from flea markets without looking inside the case first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A friend told me thier computer wouldn't work right. (a very detailed description of the problem at that)  I check everything is plugged in and yep..something is very wrong.  Asking the standard question of did you install or delete any files recently.  Well, they had gone through the C directory and deleted any file that did not give an error to delete to clear up space since the computer would not let them delete the file if it was needed.  I managed not to laugh...but that was so hard not to.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doomspark Deathfire</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And it's always worse when it's &quot;a friend&quot; or &quot;family member&quot; asking for help. Take my ex.... PLEASE, someone, take my ex...<br />
<br />
My ex has custody of my kids (now 14 and 15). I bought them a computer last year, which my ex promptly proceeded to appropriate for her own use (*growl, snarl*). Anyways...<br />
<br />
She calls me saying &quot;It quit working!&quot; - and doesn't understand why I can't fix it from 2,000 miles away. I told her to box it up and ship it to me and I'd look at it. She does so, and it arrived over this past weekend.<br />
<br />
I knew I was in trouble when I realized that she'd simply wrapped it in brown paper (NO BOX!!!) to ship it. With trepidation, I open the case, revealing a ton of crumbs, dust, and other unindentifiable things. I clean it up, reseat all the cards and cables and power it up. &quot;Non system disk, or disk error.&quot; Errrg.  I boot it off floppy and FDISK to look at the partitions.<br />
<br />
Wonder of wonders! There aren't any! <br />
<br />
I repartition the hard disk and reinstall the OS. Then I call her and explain the concept of &quot;proper packaging&quot;. She says &quot;It was broke anyway.&quot; I let this go, as I'm obviously beating a dead horse. But out of curiosity I ask her when it stopped working.<br />
<br />
She tells me that it was &quot;slowing down&quot; and she read &quot;somewhere&quot; that there was a &quot;fix disk&quot; command that would fix this. So she looked on the hard disk and found FDISK... ran it... and deleted the partitions. And then it &quot;quit working&quot;.<br />
<br />
The scary part of this: she's got her A+ certification.</div></div><hr />

So, how long were you curled up into a tiny ball, crying, and asking god what you had done to deserve that?<br />
<br />
Me? I would have to spend at least 30 minutes just shaking my head, blinking, and uttering the occasional curseword.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Woodeckt</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A+ certification = I can read a book memorize a couple lines and pass the test for a fee.<br />
<br />
I state the above with 100% certianty, case in point below. <br />
<br />
I will not droll on with my resume or my certifications.<br />
<br />
First my wife is an Accountant in charge of her office's network and pc's. She does the ordering and specifications for new machines and software. (While this is scary she is very smart and asks for help when needed) She a couple months ago ordered a couple new workstations for her small group as they hired 3 new people. I went over the specifications and all was good. She placed the order and proceded to wait.<br />
<br />
If you think camping in EQ is boring try getting a Purchase order through state governement. <br />
<br />
/wait<br />
<br />
Three weeks later a glimmer of hope the PO comes back approved. Send it off to manufacturer. <br />
<br />
/wait<br />
<br />
Two weeks later (one week after promised) the machines arrive.<br />
/cheer <br />
/dance<br />
<br />
Wife calls Information Services Division to install machines for workers who have been sitting around with just phones for a week. <br />
<br />
The technician (A+ certified and tells everyone he is the hardware expert) showes up to install machines. <br />
<br />
/unpack boxes<br />
/plug into network and power<br />
/plug in keyboard and mouse<br />
/plug in monitor ?????????<br />
<br />
No place to plug in monitor strange I will look again.<br />
<br />
(note at this point technician has told my wife that you need a special adapter to attach a monitor.)<br />
<br />
Technician takes computer and puts it on desk and shows my wife that the SCSI port is not a standard monitor port and you need a special adapter to attach the monitor to it. <br />
<br />
My wife tells her boss what the technician says and he gets very upset with her for not ordering this &quot;adapter&quot; because his workers cannot work. <br />
<br />
I call to go to lunch and wife is upset.<br />
I go to her office and ask what is going on (note technician is still standing there) I get told the above tale and procede to ask if I can take a look. <br />
<br />
I look at computer and notice first that there is no cover plate where the AGP slot is???? (generaly if there is no card there is a blank cover) <br />
<br />
I ask if I can open the case for a second (I do not work for her department) and get told ok. <br />
<br />
I remove finger screws and look and OOOHHHH no card installed.<br />
<br />
I point this out to my wife and the technician who gets annoyed and leaves mumbling under his breath.<br />
<br />
Wife calls manufacutrer and is informed that the cards went out the day after the machines and would be there the next morning. <br />
<br />
Needless to say the technician is a MORON but he is Certified.</div></div><hr />
