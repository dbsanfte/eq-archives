<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aulinya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Today I visited the Gorge of King Xorbb to kill muddiites to get heavy clay.  I killed lots of muddites. I collected lots of clay and ore but nothing named heavy clay.  Does anyone know what has happened?<br />

It is a relatively rare drop, but it does exist. At least it did then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Was dropping as recently as Tuesday when I was last collecting it.  Seems to be kind of streaky - can kill 50 muddites and not ever get a drop and then the next 3 will all drop it.<br />
<br />
Elders might drop it a little more often than minors.  I had to pull them out of the cliffs - many many many of them were stuck inside the cliffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cherryflavour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I also got a number of them recently and kept for future use, I was just in the area and wanted to see if I couidl get King Xorbb to pop to follow a possible quest lead, kinda want to do the blue hammer quest too ;D  I had most/all of them drop off muddites near the EE area, and most were elders.</div></div><hr />

That said, you can use an AE damage spell to bring them out of hiding...</div></div><hr />

I'd rather wait for them to fix the @#^&amp; zone. Less frustration that way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been farming heavy clay since before the first DX9 patch, and Muddites have been hanging out under the world for a lot longer than that, so any DX9 fixes are unlikely to fix them.</div></div><hr />

Since I'd need hundreds, and since they are ridiculously priced on Fennin Ro (50+ each, when crucibles sell for 100 if they sell at all), it's not a viable choice if the drop rate is low...<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
You would be very luckey to see 5-10 in a hour. I have taken my BST (52) to collect them. Just let my pet run wild. :) After the first 20 min of kill kill kill I saw 1. Yup just one. Painfully rare but if your willing it can be done. Boring as watching paint dry so I decided not to melt my brain and take my ENC (62) to CoD for tainted drops. <br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

Depends how you do it.  I used to zone in, track, find the couple of spots where they get caught in the wall.  Target myself with an AOE and kill them all.  /target a, /loot, repeat until all the corpses are gone, and move to the next spot.<br />
<br />
Come back the next day and do it again.  I'd get a few a trip on average, but it only took 10 mins tops to clear the spots (including port time).  <br />
<br />
I'm sorry for saying this, but I don't mind the zone being buggy - saved me lots of times pulling the zone to aoe it....they are already nicely piled for me.<br />
<br />
I didn't use the clay, would give them to a potter friend during her skillup run to GM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I checked it out tonight just to see how things were dropping. I killed maybe 50 Muddites with the majority of them being Elders, and I didn't get a single drop.<br />
<br />
Probably just bad luck with the Harsh Mistress, the RNG, but I did expect at least one.<br />
<br />
Not conclusive my any means, but it is the first time I've killed that many and not gotten a drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fystz O'Malley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">For those of us that are unable to cast spells to bring the muddites out of their &quot;hiding spots&quot; (ie. underworld, or stuck in a cliff) we used to be able to &quot;pull&quot; them out of the world by sitting near them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Actually, spent about 3 hours there last night with a guildie, in search of heavy clay.<br />
<br />
Killed anything in our paths, and ended with 16 heavy clay, along with stacks of small blocks, large blocks, ore, silver bars, a couple polished bone hoops, and assorted words.  There was definitely a spike in the middle of our time where the RNG smiled and almost every other muddite dropped one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bindamel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just a &quot;bump&quot; update on the gorge.<br />
<br />
The muddites appear to be completely free of the underworld now, although a few like to path high along the walls.<br />
<br />
I hung out there for an hour or two last night, and harvested 16 heavy clays.</div></div><hr />
