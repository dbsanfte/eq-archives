<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Faymar</div><div class="date">04-19-2003, 08:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When chat channels were added to the game, I read the posts about a serverwide channel to discuss tradeskills, which sounded pretty neat. I joined it now and again, but there was an issue where whenever I (or anyone on this network) would zone, chat channels would disappear, I couldn't see them, join, nor receive cross-server tells. So I often didn't bother to join chat channels at all as it would just mean my disappearing off them suddenly.<br />
<br />
Now and again, though, especially when tradeskilling in one zone where I knew I wasn't going to be moving around, I'd join up. It was always pretty quiet.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, after an EQ break, I threw myself at tradeskilling. My son is away for the weekend, it's a holiday, no commitments and no obligations, a great chance to really push my way through.<br />
<br />
I started in the afternoon and went through my mule making things for imps, making things for future combines, making things just to clear out space. I made ornate chain to get smithing up a bit, which I'd meant to do for ages. I did some brewing so that I could make my own coldain heaters. I made celestial essences like there was no tomorrow. I made 3 stacks of velium studs and then realised it was actually velium boning I needed and I made more celestial essences. I crushed blue diamonds, I wove dire wolf furs, I made some centi steaks, I combined and combined and combined.<br />
<br />
Around 9pm I opened a bottle of red wine and kept going, ignoring the numbness in my mouse arm. I drank and combined and drank and combined and drank and combined. Meanwhile, the tradeskills channel was still quiet.<br />
<br />
Now, I'd noticed before that people would discuss things that happened on the chat channel, talk about how helpful one should be, all the questions thrown at the tradeskillers, etc. And I'd sort of wondered about this, as I'd only ever seen one or two conversations there, ever. But I play on Euro times and it was quite feasible that all the action was happening at night, after I'd gone to bed.<br />
<br />
Except it was now 4am and there were 3 people on the channel. This just didn't make sense. Somehow a sensible thought slowly managed to make its way through to my red-wine fogged mind ... would they maybe be using &quot;eqtraders&quot; for the chat channel, and not &quot;tradeskills&quot; at all?<br />
<br />
I tried it. 82 people. Text flowing past rapidly. Names I recognised from the boards, others I'd never seen before. I'd found you.<br />
<br />
So, apologies to all of you who then got me rambling drunkenly at the channel for the next half hour. I was so pleased to have actually found you that it took a while for the thought &quot;you are drunk, it's almost 5am, you should be in bed&quot; to sink in. It wasn't actually the way I would have planned to introduce myself :)<br />
