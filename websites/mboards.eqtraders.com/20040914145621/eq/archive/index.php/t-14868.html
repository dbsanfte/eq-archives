<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MissV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Based on the general formula given in the FAQ for success rate:<br />
<br />
Percentage = (skill - (trivial*.75)) + 51.5 <br />
<br />
My question is this:<br />
<br />
Trivial of the robe = 335<br />
<br />
If my skill is less than 200, the above formula would give me a negative success rate. At 200 skill, it gives me 0.25%. So, would I be guaranteed failure on this combine up to skill 199?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No exactly,<br />
<br />
There is a 5% chance that you will succeed any combine you make no matter how far below trivial you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, the 5% minimum success rate is now debatable.  We know for sure the 5% minimum fail rate was removed not too long ago; I haven't seen much by way of tests, studies, or parses since than showing that the minimum success rate still exists.<br />
<br />
I suppose an easy way to test it would be to have a non-gnome do a high-trivial but cheap and easy tinkering combine.  Anything trivial higher than 67 would do (that's 1% predicted success at zero skill), preferably around 100, but the higher the better.  Do a few hundred of those combines and see what the success rate would be.  You'd expect it to be around 5% if the minimum is still in, or much lower if it's not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aquila Swiftspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did solstice robes from 194 to 213, with a few around 187.  I succeeded on a couple at 187, while trying for skill ups.<br />
<br />
I went through 10 chains between 210 and 213, which means I succeeded ten times in the number of combines it took to get three skill ups (I don't keep track of actual combines).  At that point, I didn't feel like making more chains, but it seems like the number of successes is higher than it's worth using solstice robes as a skill up path for me for now.  IF I had 100K to burn in the bank, yeah, I'd still be doing solstice robes!<br />
<br />
So, I guess I'd have to say, you're likely to succeed just when you MOST don't want to, and to have a very low chance of succeeding when you want to on robes.<br />
<br />
It feels stupid to be doing combines and hoping NOT to succeed, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lanalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I made solstice robes a lot between 180 and 230.<br />
<br />
When I got close to 230, I was succeeding 1/3 to almost half :eek: my combines, and I wasn't using a geerlok. The chains were becoming outrageously expensive so I stopped doing the robes.<br />
<br />
If I get a lot of money sometime soon, I might go back to robes just 'cause they're easy, but I pretty much expect to spend a lot of money making chains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>MissV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It is rumored that you have a better chance of skilling up on success. From my personal experience it doesn't hold true. But regardless, even if I only had a slim slim chance of skilling up on failure, if I am pretty much guaranteed (or 95% chance accounting for the 5% success rate) the return of the chain, wouldn't it be worth making robes before 200? <br />
<br />
My skill is around 160 now. I am contemplating doing the platinum ribbons and when I compare the cost with the solstice robe, I just can't justify doing the ribbons. Not with their horrid sell back value. While the solstice robe is pure loss due to almost certain failure, a few basic calculations show that this route would be much cheaper over a few hundred combines.<br />
<br />
My character is not old enough to get the rockhopper hides and buying them is of course out of the question considering their outrageous price on my server.<br />
<br />
I am a bit discouraged with this tailoring. I don't have the hundreds of thousand to spend on it and I can't say I even enjoy doing the skill. I don't plan on taking tailoring all the way to 250 until all my other skills are capped and/or I am insanely rich. All I want is a decent chance at combining my 6th shawl.<br />
<br />
So what do you guys think? Platinum ribbons are out of my wallet's league. Acrylia studded masks are out of my hunting and wallet's league. What should I do? Attempt the shawl combine with my current skill and a geerlok or do a few solstice robe combines? I'd be ready to invest into 4-5 chains but that's all I can afford.<br />
<br />
Advice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's easier (and cheaper) to just hit combine on the shawl and suck it up if you fail than to skill up farther.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ambertha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I succeeded my first try on the 6th shawl at skill 163 (+ geerlock). I think it is fairly common practice to try it there, as it is faster to get all those hairs again, than it is to save up lots of $ to continue skilling tailoring. <br />
<br />
Best of luck to you...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aquila Swiftspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/agree<br />
<br />
Just try the combine on the shawl with a geerlok.  You have a pretty good chance at success, and a whole lot less frustration even if you fail!<br />
<br />
Getting siren hairs and stuff is WAY less painful than skilling up tailoring really high, and there's still a chance of failure even at 250.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>MissV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thank you for the advice which I will follow. All I am missing for the 6th shawl are the siren hairs and my reason for trying to get my skill up is that I don't think it will be easy for me to get those hairs hence my reluctance to chance a failure.<br />
<br />
I do have enough manticore manes, whiskers and beards to try more than once though so only getting the extra hairs would require time.<br />
<br />
I feel relieved that I can put tailoring on the back burner until I am high level enough to farm my components.<br />
<br />
Thanks again to all those who took the time to reply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>banazir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have skilled three characters from 158 to 240 ish (some 250) on solstice robes.<br />
<br />
From 158 to 215 or so, you should get between 20 and 40 completed robes.<br />
<br />
From 215 to 250, you should get another 350 robes.<br />
<br />
For whatever reason, success rate seems to max at around 25 percent starting close to 220.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tshesebe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I made a run yesterday at Solstice robes for skill ups.  I made 107 attempts, had 5 successes and ONE skill up (from 199 to 200).  I'm so disgusted I can't say, because I'd get banned.  Additionally, if that isn't enough of a kick in the teeth, apparently a guildie yesterday went from 131 to 202!  :steamed:   <br />
<br />
Someone convince me not to throw my computer out the window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>crystilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">When I hit 188, I decided to do the Acrylia Studded tailoring and then gave up because of the rarity of the Rockhopper hides and bazaar prices were 350 a piece at the time.  (Lots of guilds were working on Grimel quest since they'd gotten Elemental access.)<br />
<br />
So I switched somewhere around 193 to the solstice robes and for a while went fine.  Once I got above 200, it became cost prohibitative for me because my success on the robes was so high.<br />
<br />
On my worst/best run, I made around 40 robes in about 127 attempts.<br />
<br />
Once I hit 221,  I stopped that all together and switched to Arctic Wyrven hides and been doing that to date (228 now).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dalur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Don't feel too bad Tshesebe.<br />
<br />
I was at 200 and it took almost 195 combines of robes to get from 200 to 201 - that is with 320 wis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tshesebe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thanks for the encouragement Dalur, but it still frosts me to no end that he was able to go from 131 to 202 in less than 24 hrs.  Considering what I've gone through to get where I am now, my biggest question is HOW IN THE &lt;insert expletive here&gt; DID HE DO IT???  It couldn't be an exceptional run at the RNG, and i don't think there were that many raw supplies in the bazaar!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Perly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It took me 3 weeks to go from 0 - 250 tailoring. It was easy up to 225 when solstice robes became too costly to skill up on. Then the last 25 skill ups I bought all the artic wyvern tailoring supplies I saw in bazaar, only needing to fish about 5 stacks of cod at the end.  It took 300k from start to finish, including getting jewelcraft to 250 so I could make my own chains. Most ever combines without skill up was 86. My wisdom was 355 but no idea if that mattered much. But then there are stretches where I would get up to 3 or 4 skill ups within 20 or 30 combines after 200 skill. Anyway, it can be frustrating, but the feeling after accomplishing your goal is worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Yandros</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm at 215 Tailoring now and still doing robes.   The RNG can really skew what appears to be happening it seems.  I've done 60 combines gotten 4 improves, and not used up one chain with around a 210 skill.  Then I did another batch of 60 combines, got 1 improve, and burned up 7 chains. :mad: <br />
<br />
Since there are actually two events that are governed by the RNG, the improves and the successful combines, you can get some really streaky results, at least I have.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The chances on the robe seem to be tied to your psychic energy.  I found the following formula to fit rather well by my own experience:<br />
<br />
Chance of success: .50 + (desired result)<br />
<br />
...where desired result is -49 if you need the robe, and +49 if you're doing skillups.  When a friend wanted a robe for the earring quest, I had two chains and about 80 blessed silk, and I figured I'd do it at 165 tailoring and get at least one hit in 80 for the robe.  I got 4 skillups but no robe.  Later, I had fifteen silks (five combines) to do to clear some space, and tailoring at 170.  I blew both chains I had in those five combines, with no skillups.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fufinski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I did a run of 33 over the last couple of days.  Skill went from 184 -189 and I made 6 robes.  Thats around an 18 % success rate which is painful, but at least I got 5 skill ups which was a 15% rate which I can not complain at.  I think both numbers were just products of the RNG, so you can not really make any assumptions from such a small sample size.<br />
<br />
I have 233 JC with geerlok and failed 2 out of the 3 belt combines I tried, so I Asked a chanter friend to make me 5 and he made 5 out of 5.  I guess one of the important cost considerations is get a chanter with the JC AA to make the belts for you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kanstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hellos!<br />

I've been doing Ceremonial Solstice Robes since, 187 and now sitting on 202 with much further to go.<br />
<br />
*If* I had my wits about me, done more research, I would have done CSRs instead of the platinum ribbons.<br />
<br />
Basic fact,  CSR costs me about 100p or so to combine and fail (Baz buys some subcomponents instead of farming.. still have nightmares from all the time spent in Hollowshade Moor).<br />
<br />
As a dorf, forage is not an option, so have to baz buy the dye for ribbons.  Plat ribbon, 104p, dye, 50-100p.  Lucky if i can make dye myself buying component for 10-40p.  In essence, base cost is anywhere from 110p to 200p.<br />
<br />
The ribbons offer speed of combines over CSR, but at much greater cost.  Even with sell back, the cost of ribbons didn't go below 100p very often and would average over 150p easy.<br />
<br />
Anyways, other thing to mention.  I'm GM jeweler as well and was making the &quot;gem studded chains&quot; myself.  Normally done in grp of 5, with one or two failures.  The other day, I had a run of 5 failures and this was rather upsetting.<br />
<br />
I therefore recommend anyone doing this, asks a nice chanter friend with JCM AAs to make them for you and will be my next port of call.<br />
<br />
As with all things, 199-201 was &quot;hell&quot; for me.  3 AA waiting to go, lots of combines and eventually made 200.  Burned the AAs, continued to combine and got 201..  then a couple combines later made 202.  That session was in the region of 100 CSR makes, with 3 or 4 makes to get those points.<br />
<br />
I've had nice runs with couple of skill ups in block of 20 makes, others I've gone a some of blocks and not seen anything, with WIS of 305.<br />
<br />
When I get a make of a CSR, it is bagged and transferred to mule for selling in the bazaar.  Current Bristlebroke Baz rate is 400-500p so the overheads on GSC is covered somewhat.<br />
<br />
Personal plan is to continue with CSR until 210, get those magical 2 points from ethereal like did with smithings and brewings, then back to CSR.<br />
<br />
If i can find components for making the new GoD bags on my travels, I will do for personal use (replace 10% reduction bags) and the fluke chance of a skill up doing so.<br />
