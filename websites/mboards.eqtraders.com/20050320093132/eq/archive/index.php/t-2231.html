Helps if you can make the items yourself :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yakk</div><div class="date">01-15-2003, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Worn mana regen stacks up to 15 points.<br />
<br />
This rule has changed a number of times.  At one point it was &quot;FT 1 stacks with FT 2, but FT 1 does not stack with FT 1&quot;.  Later it was &quot;15 points is claimed by verant, but they are wrong&quot;.<br />
<br />
FT gear is hard to get.  Mostly they are aquired by L 60 and above players on massive raids against very tough mobs.<br />
<br />
There are a handful of possible aquireable FT items at your level.  The solstice earring is a quest that you can buy all 9 components for -- it gives you a very good earring, with FT 1.<br />
<br />
There is a FT 2 DROPable belt from BoT, but that's probably out of your reach.<br />
<br />
There are FT 3 boots from CT, but you can't wear those until L 50.<br />
<br />
There is a shawl you can quest for.  This quest is long and hard, has 8 main steps.  The end result is a good shawl with FT 3.<br />
<br />
A better thing to look for would be focus items, or a pony.<br />
<br />
A 8 k pp pony will allow you to meditate while standing/casting outdoors.  Not cheap, but it works out to alot of FT.<br />
<br />
Mana Preservation items are very good to get.  They are as good, or better, than most flowing thought gear, in terms of effectiveness.  The ODS is one (see above), another one is a crystalline torque.  There are cheaper ones (like the Black Alloy Meddallion) that only work on L 45 and under spells.<br />
<br />
Also think about getting spell casting haste, extended range, extended enhancement (makes buffs last longer), and even affliction haste (2) items.</div></div><hr />

I have been searching allakhazam and magelo for items and thing of the sort and soon found that the FT was out of my league but i am looking forward to the time when they arnt.<br />
<br />
As for the focus effects Yak they are awsome but as a cleric i see no point in having a focus effect in spell haste becuase the majority of spell haste descriptions i have read says that it doesnt work for CH or any other healing spell or i might be reading it wrong ....who knows.. i do make these mistakes but ia m currently working on the mana presevation and i am after a medicine totem for the improved healing. Also i am after something better then a moonstone ring for range enhancement  it is a good thing being further and further away from the mob trying to heal your tank <br />
<br />
thanks again for all the info</div></div><hr />

I have the solstice earring and the 7th shawl</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ngreth Thergn</div><div class="date">01-19-2003, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">says that it doesnt work for CH or any other healing spell or i might be reading it wrong ....who knows.. <br />
<br />
I know! :)<br />
<br />
no focus effect works for Complete heal, not the druid/shaman 75% heals.<br />
<br />
It should work for any other of your instant heals.<br />
<br />
it may or may not (depending on the focus effect) work for your heal over time spells.<br />
<br />
it may or may not (depending on the focus effect) work for your GROUP (more than one person) healing spells.  But then... not many clerics use these because of the HUGE agro generated.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope that helps :)<br />
<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net is a good way to research focus effects :)  you will typically see an etry like this:<br />
<br />
Spell Haste IV:<br />
1:  Increase Spell Haste by 15% <br />
2:  Limit: Max Level(65) <br />
3:  Limit: Spell(Complete Healing excluded) <br />
4:  Limit: Min Casting Time(3.0 sec) <br />
5:  Limit: Effect(Percentage Heal excluded) <br />
<br />
<br />
#3 aplies to clerics.<br />
#5 applies to Druids and Shaman :)<br />
<br />
So for a CLERIC this spell will work for any healing spell, up to level 65, that has a casting time of at least 3.0 seconds, EXCEPT Complete Heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pojodan</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 09:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a quest out of PoK that nets a ring with Mana Pres II, which is good for spells lvl 44 and under.  I'm at lvl 52 and still have this thing on since my pet haste and main pet heal are both lvl 39 spells, and anyone who's a Beastlord will tell you that mana is very precious amongst beastlords since we have such small pools to draw from.  The ring has no other stats, but it really helps with mana savings and is very cheep to get since it requires 4 items from 4 different zones that are all common drops</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please show a source for this; common convention says this is not true.  It is generally excepted you get the FT effect from level 1. I have not personally tested this, perhaps I should.</div></div><hr />
