<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Elmier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay all due to making a Froglok pally recently during a quest I was given the book &quot;The Bowyers Guide&quot; the excerpt below is only being used as a reference and is not meant to plagiarize the original author..... <br />
<br />
LUMBER<br />
<br />
The Material that the bow is constructed from is directly proportional to the performance of the bow.<br />
<br />
List in order of difficulty and quality.<br />
<br />
Hickory<br />
Elm<br />
Ash<br />
Oak<br />
Darkwood<br />
Steel<br />
Ceramic<br />
 <br />
<br />
So does this mean there are two unknown bow staffs out there or ones needing researching on how to make?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Galain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The steel and ceramic never made it into the game as far as we know.  However, VI has said that there are numerous unsolved quests and recipes still in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gherad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A ceramic bow?  That wouldn't make any sense - the thing would crack and snap in two the first time you tried to draw it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">tried 1 and 2 blocks of mq ore, with and without file and planing tool last night.  had a fow too. :)<br />
<br />
chose mq ore because the other arrow parts use it.  chose blocks cause they're bigger than bricks that make arrows.  <br />
<br />
no loss i needed folded mq sheet metal anyway.  :)<br />
<br />
none of that combines though.<br />
<br />
might try with hq ore for a bow staff?  it was just a place to start.<br />
<br />
1/2 block mq ore + fow<br />
1/2 block mq ore + fow + planing tool<br />
1/2 block mq ore + fow + file<br />
1/2 block mq ore + fow + planing tool + file</div></div><hr />
