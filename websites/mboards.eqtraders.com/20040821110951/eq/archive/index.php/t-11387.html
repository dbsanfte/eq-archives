<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nieccole</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, wanna preface this post...<br />
<br />
1) If this isn't the right forum for it, sorry, didn't know exactly where it should go, since it's not really an update...<br />
2) I looked through the FAQs first, didn't see it mentioned, tho I am a bit brain burnt after 12 hours of work...<br />
<br />
There...  my question/request, which is prolly gonna make whomever works the DB cry has to do with how the recipies are linked... ATM each item lists only recipies used to create said item... which is fine if you're looking for the finished item... however, if I've got something that I'm not sure what it's for, say like the White Primrose foraged in Rujarkian Hills... there's no way easy way for me to check up on what it's used for, and searching each tradeskill forum for &quot;white primrose&quot;, &quot;primrose&quot; and any other permutation is a pain in the butt... <br />
 As much as I'm sure some people don't want comparisons, I like the way Allakhazam has their tradeskill items catalogged (SP?) since I can punch in an item name, and it'll call up everything used to make it and everything it can be used for... and whenever I'm looking up items I haven't seen, I always have 3+ windows open (1 for EQtraders DB, 1 for Allakhazam, and 1 for each EQtraders tradeskill forum search) ... <br />
 Personally I prefer EQtraders over most allakhazam info because EQtraders usually has more accurate information, faster, and is updated quicker if it's wrong.<br />
 Overall, sorry for pestering, but this has just been bugging me for a while and I wanted to get it off my chest.<br />
<br />
*POST PATCHED 10/17 1712* <br />
 Edited grammar/spelling.  Fixed a door in Freeport.  Added new tailoring recipies for 177 - 220.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We do have that feature.  It is the &quot;Find recipes that use this item&quot; link.  If it says &quot;There are no known recipes that use&quot; the item, then there are currently no recipes in the database for it.  We may have goofed in setting up the recipe(s) that should use it, or we may not have a use for it yet.<br />
<br />
We don't usually put things in unless we know what they're for since there are a lot of items flagged as used in tradeskills that are only for obscure quests that we don't want to mess with.  But sometimes, especially with the flood of new information with an expansion, it'll happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is easy... I will take your example item &quot;white primrose&quot;.<br />
<br />
1. Go to the main site page (www.eqtraders.com)... on the left you see various menu items (About, FAQ, Search...Quests, Links, PayPal, and a entry field with Find button next to it). <br />
<br />
2. Into that entry field type in 'White Primrose&quot; and Click  the Find Button.<br />
<br />
3. You will get a page with the basic information on the item, with a Link on the Name... Click on that Link<br />
<br />
4. The next page will provide more detailed information... with a Link Find recipes that use this item. Click on this link<br />
<br />
5. And this returns (for White Primrose) that No Recipes are found that use it. (we don't have any yet recorded).<br />
<br />
If we change it to 'Chub'... we get Rujarkian Chub in the list.. Clicking on the Rujarkian Chub and then the 'Find recipes that use this item... gets back 4 Recipes back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What I have wished is for the ability to cut Krazick's step 4. <br />
<br />
I search for cinnamon sticks. When it gives me the results page, I wish that page could also include a direct link to the &quot;Recipes that use this item&quot; page for cinnamon sticks. <br />
<br />
Granted, I know I have NO IDEA how the DB works in terms of processing things and the stress it would generate to find all those links and return them as well. But, to me, it seems maybe worth it for not having to return that page in the middle, the Cinnamon Stick data page, when all I want from IT is the 'recipes' link. <br />
<br />
<br />
I know, I know, I know you aren't taking DB modification ideas now. But someday, you might. To me, this seems worth considering as a bandwidth saving feature (assuming it doesn't cause the processor to expload or something due to giving one more chunk of data back on a search). <br />
<br />

i need to go learn stuff about databases and the like, so i know what's possible and what's not. i dislike being uneducated &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't mind step 4.  But when my search only returns one item I wish it could skip directly to the item information page.  The way lucy works, if there's multiples you get a list to choose from, otherwise you go straight to your info.  But...I'll ask when you're accepting ideas for database changes. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nieccole</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd have to agree with Sanna... I completely missed the &quot;find recipies that use this&quot; link, and it's frustrated me to no end... and now I feel kinda dumb for having missed it. Well, like I said before, Alla has an in-line link on the item info page so you don't need that link.<br />
 /shrug You'd think someone who's just waiting on AA to join the 1750 club would've been a bit more observant ... /boggle<br />
 <br />
<br />
 I appreciate the help, and I definately appreciate the time and effort that's gone into this site since I started visiting... erm, years ago~  I'm more of a lurker in most cases :)<br />
<br />
 Sorry for the &quot;Duh, I rooted myself&quot; moment :D</div></div><hr />
