I was saving up components to make my monk some.  Well I don't know what to do with all the components now.  Not really worth making, anyone know of something else worth while that I could do with the components?</div></div><hr />

What makes them not work making?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hilbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">But the made ones are not required 55 like the WLK and has a type 7 slot too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Silound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">IIRC the PVIC was something like 5/11 ratio, so it was putting out rediculous damage because it hit so fast and so frequently applied damage bonus. Obviously, this has since been jujued.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I made about 200-250k off the prenerf Cestuses, and had 3 left when the nerf hit, I had loaned a guildmate a pair of them for his alt to try (55 epic monk), he parsed the prenerf Cestus's damage at *less* than bare fists (though epic), although it might have been better for lower levels (I was obliterating things in a frenzy of attacks when i tossed a pair onto a level 1 monk).<br />
<br />
Kinda irrelevant now though, I can't even sell the 3 i have left for the 1k (each) it took to make them. ;p</div></div><hr />
