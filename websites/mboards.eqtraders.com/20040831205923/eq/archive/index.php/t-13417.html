It only took me a few days of off and on here and there combining to get my smithing from 222 to 250, totally on Sickles!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">While I think that the new UI will indeed make it easier to get to 250 (1 click VS 7 for SS boots). I am still singing it's praises This idea was the best thing I have seen for Tradeskills since they took out the ability to get over 200 with fine plate. <br />
<br />
The Ability to do combines at ANY decent rate of speed is AWSOME.<br />
<br />
How many times have you been in POK doing smithing only to find someone using all 4 forges in the zone... Then you Wait and Wait and wait. With the New UI the wait time will be much lower. That in and of itself is a GREAT thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gurck-Quellious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My guess is that it will devalue goods crafted with the brewing, baking, and JC tradeskills the most, the others to a lesser degree.  While I don't wish carpal tunnel on anyone, I do think that making skillups difficult/time-consuming/annoying discourages many people from doing it, and thus keeps it profitable.  People had no reason to tradeskill if they didn't wish to before the plans to make it 'easier' went in; money could be made farming or winning drops in exp groups; crafted goods could be bought, and the few tradeskill quests give nice rewards, but nothing unreplaceable with dropped goods.  I think this is a bad idea in general, but inevitable as EQ plods relentlessly toward appealling to the most people possible. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Optimum1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gurck you're absolutely correct. I, too, believe the new skilling UI will deflate the price of crafted items across the board. The fact that most people lack the patience for tradeskilling was a major factor for me to take it up and now that too will be ruined. In many ways it's a shame that the game is being made more and more Romper Room all the time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Garndart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think the market prices will fall yes but....<br />
<br />
Ive watched Grobb meats, halas meat pies and MTp's for over a year on the server and I have noticed this. First started making grobb meats and halas pies could easily make a batch of 100 of each put them on my mule and wake up the next morning with them sold out at 10pp a piece.<br />
<br />
About 6 months ago prices on theese items crashed. Grob meats and Halas pies sold for about 3pp a piece. Hell it was easier for me to buy them in bazaar. They were about the same cost as making them myself and no clicking. About 2 months ago I was cleaning out inventory and found 100 Grobb meats on a mule. Decided to sell them for what ever just to reclaim some space back. Guess what for 4 nights in a row the lowest price was 10pp a piece.<br />
<br />
Anizok minimizing device another example Started out selling them for 2500pp a piece. The price dropped to like 700-800pp stopeed selling them. 4 days ago was cleaning out inventory decided to use up some of my steel casings so i could get Inventory space. I;m averaging selling 1 a day for 2kpp again.<br />
<br />
Cermaic shield of war. Went from 8k to like 2k saw only one in market past 3 days for 10k <br />
<br />
My opinion....  I think you will see deflation in certain markets. But even as a baker who can make my own food when I see food items or whatever that I can buy in bazaar for about the same price as I can make it for. I'll buy the ones for sale. This causes people to stop making them and guess what the prices then start to go back up.... Until people see they can make &quot;Mad&quot; money in it and glut the market again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>lilsneezy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The same cycle you describe is currently going on i the velium market.  Even before the EVBs were found to be a good skill-up route, I always played the velium market in the bazaar on The Rathe.  I have seen the prices of small pieces go from 25 to 75 and now back to 50 as the same cycle occurs.  The key is to watch and learn when the up or down swing is about to occur and capitalizing on it.  Same can be said for player made items.  When there are 50+ vendors in the bazaar selling Tae Ew, sure the price will plummet.  So will the cost of the goods to make such items.  When the prices plummet, people will stop making them.  Those that don't pay attention to the market will not notice that there is a shortage for Tae Ew and those that do pay attention to the market will make a fortune.  I wouldn't mind paying 100 plat for Tae Ew blood vials and Iksar blood because noone can sell the stuff one day, and then a month later cleaning up on selling shields for 4k because noone but me has realized there is a market again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gurck-Quellious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Garndart I think you're seeing two different things; 1) with food &amp; drink such as you mentioned, the market's always there because they are items which get used up.  2) The lasting effects of the plat duping incident.  I've seen a lot of higher-ticket items come back down to where they were before that dark period in EQ history, but a lot of the lower end items went up and have stayed up.  My layman's analysis of it is that people without much cash, like everyone else, benefited from the excess amounts of plat in the economy - but they, being used to not having much money, were in general more likely to hold onto whatever they had than gamble it away in that godawful casino.  So you see prices on lower end items stay up a bit, as the people buying them have more cash.  Just a theory )  And yes, the sky is in fact falling :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>xanticles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">About the Prices...<br />
<br />
Yes all those went undet the said price (ceramic shield of valor...) just cause PoV was opened for ALL people so a lot of Metallic liquid were collected and resold...so prices went down...<br />
<br />
Now people do Ldon and do'nt hunt in PoV as much which makes Metallic liquid rarer...so price gets upper...<br />
<br />
Same for Elemental bows...they sold on RZ server at start for 100K pp went down to 50k pp now NO ONE is selling them anyone cause of the 3 elemental capable guilds on server all does Ldon raids and no more Elemental farming...<br />
<br />
Xan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I personally agree with Xanticles. The Plat exploit hurt but not as much as the introduction of LDoN for those of us just tired of doing SS armors for skill ups. <br />
<br />
The only other Viable ways to get skillups in smithing are: <br />
Cultural (Oldworld to 242 then BD)<br />
Tae Ew <br />
Planier armors<br />
<br />
Now looking at the rarity of the items for each of these when PoP first came out you could in theory get to 250 by farming Nightmare iron then buying or farming the blood and Fetid Slime. Now however most people stay out of the tier 1 planes and simply do LDoN adventures till around 55 or 56 because they can get better items from LDoN and the EXP is better. This causes all planes dropped items to be far rarer than say the LDoN tempers. IF there is a shift away from LDoN (not likely but possible) back to the PoP zones you will see a rise in the price of the LDoN Crafted armors and a decrease in the price of the Planes armors. Look at the Tae Ew shields and Chain Armor... Was around 2x what it is going for now, However the prices are starting to creep back up because people do not farm CT very often and the Blood is getting rarer. <br />

<br />
The most annoying part is always the camps/drops.<br />
So this really won't change much. It will be a novelty for some people who normally don't do tradeskills much, but that is all.<br />
<br />
Lessening the chance to get repetitive stress syndromes really should not change market prices. I wasn't making misty thicket picnics because I don't want to bother running around getting the stuff to make them, not because I did not want to click and drag. I might be more apt to make some for me, if I was still playing ;) , but I still would not be making them en masse to sell in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i have sold an amazing (to me) number of picnics to other gm bakers.  6 stacks just to one for all his toons.  i can live with the loss of a few others who are bakers anyway with the new ui.  i will be able to make picnics so much easier myself it will be worth it.  i also think baking and brewing will be the most effected by the new ui.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Quinner Sparrowhawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">HAH! The new UI will do very little to smithing or tailoring nor will it hurt the market for other tradeskill items requiring dropped components or enchanted ones. People who were too lazy to tradeskill before will still be too lazy to go through the trouble to gather the necessary materials to skill up far enough in tailoring or smithing.<br />
<br />
I will admit that the new UI will kill johnnybot and suzybot's markets for heady kiolas and other tedious combines that the rest of us hate doing. CVT's will still sell because the N.E.B.B.P. won't want to be bothered with porting to CS for brown algae.<br />

There are no camps/drops with Sickles; it's just a matter of platinum and clicking.  The UI takes out most of the clicking so I think we will see a whole new batch of insta-GM smiths.<br />

Combined with EVBs, which completely trivialize the route to 222, Smithing will no longer be considered one of the two difficult trade skills.  A GM Smith will be about as impressive as a GM Brewer -- /yawn.</div></div><hr />

If you make 3,000 combines, I think you will play an extremely large role in causing the market to crash, or at least limbo, on your server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree. I did mostly sickles to smithing GM recently and I can tell you, it will still not be easy to do. First of all, it cost me about 10kpp to attempt at one stack of sickles if I buy everything. If I make everything, it takes me about 6kpp. This means unless I have tons of money, I can only afford to do a stack or two at a time, sell the sickles to fund the next stack of combines. The cost will prohibit many to easy GM route.<br />
<br />
I usually do the combines in SH. None of the final sub combine stack so that means I have to have 60 slots open, which I never do, or have a mule next to me to transfer items. This takes a while and this time is not saved using the new UI.<br />
<br />
If I was to do all the sub combines myself, this what I have to do. I have to run to PoK and grab 120 each of Celestial Solvents and Scent of Marrs. Combine to make 120+ celestial essences. I have to run to FG to buy Elvin Wine for Mistletoe Temper. I have to run to the gem merchant to grab 4 stacks of Emeralds and a stack of Ruby. I then run to other end of SH to grab a stack of Sapphires. I then sit down and imbue 3 stacks of Emeralds, takes me 1.5 full mana bar to imbue them. Run back to the pottery area, get jars of acids, go to the kiln and make Blessed Dust of Tunare. Buy Mistletoes. Run to the brew barrel and make Mistletoe Tempers. Run to the forge, where my mule is at, grab sheets of metal, pommel molds and make pommels. Transfer pommels to mule. Grab more sheets of metal and hilt molds and make hilts. Transfer to mule. Finally get more sheets of metal and run to the cleric guild to buy curved blade molds. Make curved blades. Now you are ready for final assembly. <br />
<br />
This one stack, even if I were to buy celestial essences, would take me about 3 hours. From those 3 hours, I would spend maybe 45 minutes total on combines at most, rest are running around setting things up etc. If the new interface saves me half of the combining time, that would mean I would save maybe 25 minutes out of total of 3 hours. <br />
<br />
Does it make it easier? Of course. Does that mean I can combine 5 times more per session than before? Nope. The new interface will save me some time but for the tedious sub combine heavy items, it will only save me fraction of time. I would doubt this would creat tons of more new GMs than we have now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">buy your gems in pok.  :)<br />
<br />
i have the same thing with baking.  thankfully just pok and rivervale for picnics.  still at least 3 hours for all the combines.  mine final combine stacks though.  they have too.  <br />
<br />
this will make smithing as easy to get as brewing once there is unlimited supply of everything you need in the bazaar and can be gotten for at most 2k to gm it.  not in this norrath.</div></div><hr />

The issue is not time, it's tedium.  With the new UI, you click go click, click, click, click in the same spot while watching TV.  It's almost like sitting AFK.  That's why a lot of people will do it, because they're far too lazy to actually drag the item into the little square and then drag the cursor to the combine button.<br />
<br />
I don't know how you manage to make a stack take 3 hours (try PoK maybe?), since 30-60 minutes is more like it.  Each stack is a point, so we're talking about 222 -&gt; 250 in 14-28 hours or a week of average play time (2-3 days of hardcore play time).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>branagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Yeah I dont understand why everyone is complaining about the new UI.  OMG its gonna break tradeskills!  <br />
<br />
I am GM of almost all the tradeskills cept tailoring and pottery.  Getting carpal tunnel syndrome from dragging and clicking like mad just isnt that big a badge of honor for me.   Most any tradeskill now can be mastered by throwing plat at it.   Specially with being able to buy most anything you need in the bazaar.  Yeah you may spend 3-5 times as much as if you did it yourself, but most people have too much cash now anyway. <br />
<br />
Realistically I do tradeskills now for myself.  There are a lot of nice items out there, and a few decent quests involving tradeskills.  Plus being able to make planar tradeskill stuff for guild use is nice.  There has been little or no market to really make any profit using tradeskills for a long time.   UI is not gonna change that.<br />
<br />
I'm really not looking forward to the crap load of posts that will show up on the boards here with people complaining about the UI when it DOES actually go live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">My biggest fear is that once the new UI goes live, the prices for expendable items made using tradeskills (namely Baking and Brewing items) will plummet, while the prices for the dropped and foraged components for most tradeskills will rise. I forsee the # of people selling food and drinks rising dramatically. <br />
<br />
To keep this on topic, I'm betting the prices of Blue Diamonds and planar drops used for Smithing go up, although I doubt the price of Blue Diamonds will go as high as they once were.<br />
<br />
However, I'm kind of looking forward to it, as it will save me from risking carpal tunnel syndrome. Doing HMP and MTP combines (well, the one stack of MTP combines I did, anyway) just about killed me, and I don't look forward to doing Minotaur Hero Brews or advanced Smithing unless the UI goes live by the time I'm ready for those....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Droppable and foraged prices on my server already suck.   Why people think I am gonna pay 75 plat per swirling shadow i dont know.   Its like people see that tradeskill tag on items and immediately put them up for sale for 75-100 plat.

<br />
Aye, but on Prexus, the market is so bad it won't matter. 2 hours from patch point, I'll bed 50k there will be at least one person with over 1000 MTP for sale at an absurdly low price, like 6p each. I've talked to several major suppliers in the market, most plan to keep the price stable at ~10p as best they can, however, since it's so cheap to GM baking and will now be easy, I wouldn't be surprised to see 4-5 new GM bakers selling off MTP  at &lt;10p each trying to get a cut in the market. Hopefully the price of BD's will drop as well though.</div></div><hr />

I agree, but I tend to blame the buyer more than the supplier, same with Ebay in EQ.  The buyers, in this case, are mostly Grimelers and, by extension, the blame lies in large part with SOE for implementing the quest as it stands.  The earring should have been far less uber and not have required EP flags.  It would have kept tradeskilling for those who wanted to do it (or have a thing for self-punishment :D) and not done so much harm to the TS economy and morale.  It's literally more profitable now, in many cases, to farm for Grimelers than to actually craft items - ie. the Norrathian equivalent of skilled labor.  That's out of whack imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Garndart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I find it hard to beleive the ui will trivilize smithing.<br />
<br />
1. If you just go the throw cash at smithing im not gonna farm a damm thing route. your looking at 200-600k in cash outlay. If a person has and decides to throw that kinda cash at it the new UI is only gonna save them 2 days worth of clicking. If they dont have the cash to throw at it there not going to save much time at all you can farm velium bits for 8 hours and combine all your farmed components in a half hour  it will save them like 20 mins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Quinner Sparrowhawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I don't get how the new UI will trivialize getting to 250 in smithing. Anyone who can afford to strictly go the mistletoe route has little if any motivation to achieve 250 in smithing.<br />
<br />
1. He/She could afford anything for sale in the bazaar already.<br />
2. To be making that kind of ready plat, he/she probably already has better nodrop gear and would be a member of an uber guild.<br />
3. If he/she is getting 250 in smithing just for Grimel quest, it is doubtful that such a power gamer would be interested in the commercial aspects of tradeskilling.<br />
4. One could argue that 250 in any tradeskill is trivial since there are certain individuals out there who take advantage of nefarious means to get 250 already without a new UI.<br />
5. We still don't know how close one has to be to the triv rate to use the new UI to access Mistletoes. Any &quot;bridge&quot; to get closer require farming.<br />
<br />
All other routes to GM smithing require constant farming so poor lazy players who could not be bothered before to GM tradeskills will not bother to GM them now.<br />
<br />
SO, the sky IS NOT falling.</div></div><hr />

No you're not.  First, obviously you buy velium and do EVBs until 222, new UI or old UI.  From then on, you do 28 skill points with sickles, which averages out to about 28 stacks at 7.5K each = 210K platinum average (with a variance of roughly +/- 100K).  That's not a lot of money, and on almost every server you can sell the sickles at a minimum at cost, and usually at a profit if you're patient.  In the end, you get your skill for free; the only effort involved is all the clicking for those horrendous celestial essences and such, which will disappear with the new UI.</div></div><hr />

I've spent most of yesterday's evening editing xml, making the tradeskill UI much more compact and pretty.  Gonna upload it to EQInterface soon.<br />

Really, with exception of brewing and JC, getting any skill to 250 was subject to materials availability, rather than actual combine process.</div></div><hr />
