<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SauriaSoulfarer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been back and forth working and not working on tradeskills for a very long time.  I have worked on getting a good suit of wisdom gear to make that my prime skilling-up gear for tradeskills.<br />
<br />
I used the search function but could not find a thread explicitly answering this.  I am a monk, what is the highest I can push my wisdom?  Does your class determine the cap?<br />
<br />
Right now my gear takes me to 253 wis before KEI.  I am eyeing some upgrades to this in the Bazaar, and some non-Lore augments in LDoN.  How far can I expect to push this stat?<br />
<br />
My magelo below has my tradesgear as an alternate profile...magelo does not support stat consumables on alternate profiles, so it omits the +12 wis from Qeynos Afternoon Tea and Beer-Battered Cragbeast Pie.<br />
<br />
What would be my wisdom cap, and does being a monk affect it?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Itek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Monk level 60 and under 255 WIS (max)<br />
<br />
Monk level 61 ... 260<br />
62 ... 265<br />
63 ... 270<br />
64 ... 275<br />
Monk level 65 ... 280 WIS (max) ((and all other stats for that matter))<br />
<br />
Planar Power AA (must have PoP expansion, if you don't.. go buy it)<br />
<br />
Each level of Planar Power adds 5 max to all stats. You can buy one (and only one) level of Planar power each level 61 thru 65 (or any time there-after)<br />
<br />
Planar Power 5 and Level 65 max stats (all) 305.<br />
<br />
That's it. Non-casters (Cleric, Druid, Shaman, Wizard, Mage, Necro, Enchanter) are capped at 305 for WIS/INT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SauriaSoulfarer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks, someone in eqtraders channel told me much the same...but though I am currently logged off, I looked at the AA interface...<br />
<br />
I get the 280 at 65 thing.  But if I read it right, there is the first Wisdom AA sequence that has 5 levels that give 2 wis each...then another higher sequence with 10 levels each giving 2 each.  That would be 280 plus 30 or 310?   Why then the figure of 305 that I see quoted?<br />
<br />
I'm probably reading it wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The general Innate Wisdom AA does not raise WIS cap, it raises actual WIS.<br />
<br />
The 61-65 level actually raises the WIS (and all stats) cap but not actual WIS.<br />
<br />
Planar Power also raises WIS cap but not actual WIS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Itek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Um... yeah.<br />
<br />
To clarify.<br />
<br />
Innate Wisdom (or Int) raises your CURRENT Wisdom, not your MAX Wisdom.<br />
<br />
Ditto for Improved Innate Wisdom (the PoP version, which requires 5 points (10 Wisdom points added to your base) in Innate Wisdom before you can buy up to 10 additional points (which raises your base Wisdom an additional 20 points) at any time, with no level restriction, other than 51+ of course)<br />
<br />
In my personal experience I haven't seen a need for any of these four AA's. My really ordinary gear and self buffs has me at the Int cap of 280. I could, in theory, spend 12 AA points on Innate Enlightenment and get my max Int up to 313 which would add a whopping 33 points of mana. Behold my joy. *sarcasm* Then I could, in theory, bump up my base Int 30 more points with 15 more AA spent. But I'd have to spend 9 more AA points on Innate Enlightenment -and- Planar Power to extend my Int cap.<br />
<br />
280 Int and no AA points spent.<br />
313 Int and 12 AA points spent. (Innate Enlightenment - 4)<br />
343 Int and 36 AA points spent. (Innate Int - 5, Planar Innate Int - 10, Innate Enlightenment - 5, Planar Power - 3)<br />
<br />
Sorry, I don't need 63 mana points THAT bad. And if I wanted to max my Int for tradeskills I'd need to spend AA's, additionally, on New Tannan Craft Mastery ranks as well.<br />
<br />
39 AA points to have a -potentially- 10% faster skill up rate on my next tradeskill over 200.<br />
<br />
When I'm exp-grouping in PoFire sure, no problem. I'll be working on Aid Grimmel quest earrings and will really want to get through Smithing and Tailoring in a hurry. And the exp will be flowing in faster than I can spend it...<br />
<br />
Of course this will happen shortly AFTER I win the Lottery and can play more...</div></div><hr />
