<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rhiamon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the best zone to find spiderling silks? I just started a new character on a new server, and I am trying to do the HIE mage newbie quests, but one thing it calls for is silk threads. Back when I was a REAL newb, I remember these dropping like candy. But for some reason now, I have killed dozens of hatchlings in GFay and only gotten 2 silks. It seems like they really decreased the drop rate on them. At any rate, can anyone suggest a better zone to get spiderling silks? Perhaps one where they drop more often? I do have a druid friend that can track for me, but even with that I am still having very little luck. Any help you can give would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Despite the fewer quantity of spiderlings the lack of noob quests makes it the best for drop rate.</div></div><hr />
