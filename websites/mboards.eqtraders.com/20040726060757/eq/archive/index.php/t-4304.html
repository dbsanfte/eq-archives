<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fuelman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I fiannly got myself a tacklebox and decided to make some lures to add to my chances of catching a fish.... BUT when i combined the correct ingredients for a Yellowjacket Circular Fly, i failed... OK so no big deal there... bad RNG... but when i did eventually make one after 3 tries... (good RNG!) it DID NOT say that the item was trivial... and my fishing skill is 47.... I tried the same with a Screeching Circular Fly as well, and got the same thing. No trivial message, and failed a few times before actually making one.<br />
<br />
On the plus side, i tried making the Yellowjacket Dry Fly, and made 5 of those with no problem. These were trivial to my 47 fishing skill...<br />
<br />
Anyone else tried these?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fuelman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can now confirm that the yellow jacket Circle Fly trivials at 53. Got trivial message when trying to do combine at skill 54....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the update! I posted back in December that trivials on lures had changed, and asked for folks to give me updates.  (See http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=941 if you're curious.)<br />
