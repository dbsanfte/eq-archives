<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Olgruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, first time poster here...<br />
<br />
I am currently at 195 skill in smithing and am working on EVB.  Previously I have always farmed velium in CC and am very familiar with that zone.  But it's always such a headache first trying to get a the upper tunnels or pit camp, then finding orc miners amongst all the others, and then waiting for them to respawn.  <br />
<br />
A guildie told me Tower of the Frozen Shadow would be a good place to farm velium...on the 5th floor from the golems.  However, I've read that the velium drops from the golems that used to common, are now more rarely dropped...I have no idea if this is true or not.<br />
<br />
Also, some people have told me to do VL as I can gain some experience at the same time (52 SK).  But I'm really not concerned with leveling right now and just want to get my skill to 222 asap so I can begin my ogre cultural armor, and this seems like a difficult place to &quot;farm&quot; and I would instead need a group.<br />
<br />
Can anyone give me some insight on the most &quot;time efficient&quot; place to farm velium for a 52 shadowknight?  Any discussion and advice is appreciated and I apologize if this has been discussed earlier in one of those huge EVB and CVT threads.  Thank you all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raytheon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Any translucent model (Garg or Golem) in Skyshrine will drop velium.  Since there are hundreds of them there, on a 18ish minute repop timer, I find Skyshrine to be the absolute best place to farm velium.  Also handy becuse there is a forge in zone to break down blocks and bricks, as well as a banker (who will aggro you if KoS, but will let you bank while fighting you), plus you can forage eggs there while farming (if you can forage).<br />
<br />
I don't know how a 52 SK fighting there would fare, but im a 65 ranger, and regularly pull 7-8 at a time and let them beat on damage shields as I mow through them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As a 52 pal, I found the drop rate off the ToFS Golems to be decent, heavier on the blocks than CC was.  Some of the golems are still light blue, too, so you can get a little xp out of the deal.<br />
<br />
I seem to just have horrible luck with Velks compared to other people, but spending much time soloing there (around the entrance mostly) netted me virtually no velium.  I believe higher up in the platforms has better chances to drop velium, but it can be difficult to get to and hold solo.<br />
<br />
I tend to find CC is the best if I'm looking for small pieces and small bricks, while ToFS has a better drop rate for the blocks.  Your luck may be different ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aethn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have to agree 110% that Skyshrine is by far the best farm location in the game to date.  In 2 hours I farmed enough velium to convert a total of 7 stacks of pieces.  Thats 140 pieces for 2 hours work.  <br />
<br />
I also netted about 3.5k pp in cash and sellables in that timeframe.  I never pulled beyond the fountain, never had to, repop always came just as I got there.  Oh, I got 17 drake eggs too!!<br />
<br />
Skyshrine is a GREAT zone.  But it is so under used it makes Najena look like a high traffic zone.  Shame too, because SS has some good places to EXP even at 65.  But the Golden rule in Everquest will always be... No Loot... No Hunt.   SOE, add loot to SS so ppl go there.  The upper mobs  near Yelinak should be dropping Kael Quest pieces like West TOV.  They hit just as hard and are the same Risk vs Reward now that you have to get past 3-4 see invis Crusaders to hunt there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Olgruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">*sigh* I was just in CC last night and had to compete with so many other people for the orcs, including a 65 warrior who ingnored camps and just tore through the orcs like butter.  It's just so frustrating there.<br />
<br />
I would like to try Skyshrine, but I am actually trying to keep my CoV faction for questing.  How bad are the faction hits there?  Would killing a giant basically counteract a kill in SS?  Also, I am only 52, could i realisticaly farm there, or would i need a group?<br />
<br />
Does anyone feel ToFS would actually be better than CC?  Or should I just stick with CC or SS?  Thanks for the comments guys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think you have to go up pretty high in the ToFS to get velium drops.  I don't recall any velium dropping from the lower floors (but it has been a while since I've been there.)<br />
<br />
If you can get in on a ring war, you can get some major CoV faction hits.  I went from dubious to indifferent in my coldain faction in 1 war.  One more will take me to amiable or maybe even kindly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aethn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The MOBs from Wakeing Lands to Fountain will be green to blue for you at 52, so its not bad for you there.  The hits to COV are about the same as the hits you get in Kael for giants I would imagine.  Probably a 1 to 1 ratio.  So if you killed 200 mobs in SS, you would probably need to kill 200 giants to get it back.<br />
<br />
COV and Kael faction are pretty easy to flip flop back and forth.  I have done it at least 7 times on my Shaman.  Usually took 4 days max to go from max KOS to max Ally on either side.  Also killing in SS has no effect on Coldain Faction + or -, so you dont lose any ground there.  <br />
<br />
TOFS is also a source but its a poor one at best.  You need to hunt to the 5th floor (wedding floor, although the floors above have some very limited golem spawns also), obtaining keys along the way.  When you arrive, you will find only about a dozen spawns.  All fairly simple at your level.  In my opinion, on a farming basis, TOFS is the slowest of all.  Not enough spawns, difficult to get too and a few bad RNG rolls and you can go an entire spawn with not one drop.  Then you need to consider banking.  In TOFS, you will need to leave the floor to bank if you get too many bricks.  That means fighting back to the floor when you return.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Pointee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I recently just read this post and looked like skyshrine is the place to be for velium. I went down this morning and killed the closest 10 mobs and no velium dropped. I was at the WL zi gate and pulled the left path rooms of golums and whatnot before a friend invited me to goto ldon(working these also, skill 189).<br />
<br />
<br />
Is this the spot and I just got unlucky???<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Horanaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Here is how I did my time in SS farming velium (222 smithing as of today, no idea where to go next :) ). Start at the WL zone in, kill those first 4 mobs. ten go right, and kill the 4 golems and 2 drakes that are in the 2 rooms. then clear to the bank, gettinig the roamer gargs, the 2 golems in the brewing room, and the 2 in the bank room. Then clear to the CS zone in area, clearing all the golems you see. Grab those 6  and the drakes/wurms that come with them, and kill them all. <br />
<br />
By this time, the WL ZI golems are spawning again. So rinse and repeat until you are tired of it.<br />
<br />
Drops are mediocre to great, really just random. some cycle i would get about 5 small pieces' worth, some cycles i would get 2 stacks worth of velium. <br />
<br />
Feel free to add/subtract spawns based on killing time, as all this is with a 65 paladin with about 6800 hp self buffed, 41% haste and a 51/37 weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Pointee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I figured I was in the right spot but thought I'd check. <br />
<br />
Mobs were going down fast for me and my 65 shm 2box so I should be able to pull all the way to CS like you suggested.<br />
<br />
I appreciate the advice and information.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thank you for the post.  I finally got to 222 smithing, but find I need blocks of velium for my bd cultural. /sigh<br />
<br />
I personally did almost all my farming in Velks.  I got AA's from the Upper spiders at 65 and a few drops to sell from the named.  4 out of 5 times it wasn't camped and I do play on peak hours for my server.<br />
<br />
Most of the velium hunters seemed to hang out downstairs.<br />
Looks like I will be back for my cultural.  60 combines of shadowscream, 15 combines of mistletoe sickles, 4 combines of black acyrlia weapons and 5 combines of bd cultural and I made it to 223.  <br />
<br />
I did have some success on the hard stuff by the way at 222 with a geerlock, so don't be afraid if you have pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Pointee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Simply awesome farming spot there in skyshrine. I started at max ally and finished somewhere in warmly. Came out with 280 small pieces in one kei duration. I cleared all the way to the 6 spawns at CS zi and then cleared the vendor and then the forge area last so i could just break my bricks/blocks up on my way back to start respawn cycle. Bank on premises so very handy too.<br />
<br />
I have the combines saved up right now as I have been doing ldon armor. Had a really nice run from 189-202 last nite in about 90 combines but sunk 120 combines this afternoon to get to 203.<br />
<br />
If you dont care about faction its definitely a great place to farm. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Samoht</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Where is the forge at?<br />
I will give this a try tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aethn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Oh yeah, lol I forgot to mention there was a forge there in my decription.  My bad.  Between the forge and the banker, I never had to leave SS until I had my farming done. (parked a non_KOS mule in SS ro mule my blocks I saved for BD culturals.)<br />
<br />
Pointee: Yes you were in the right place, just a bad RNG roll is all.  I farm with my 65 War/Shm/Enc trio, so I can usually clear from WL to Rotiart (steps to upper) and then rinse repeat.  Since SS is virtually empty all day long, I have never had a problem losing this camp ever.</div></div><hr />
