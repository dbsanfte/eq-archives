I've been thinking of getting the cheepest horse I can for my Shaman. But I just want to get some real info on them if I can please. If I have a horse up I can't have SoW up also right? How slow is the cheapest one? DO I regain mana standing still the same as sitting? I hear I don't get the &quot;Sitting argo&quot; on a horse, true? Please, any info would be great, thank you all.<br />
See ya,</div></div><hr />

<br />
The slowest horse is supposedly slightly slower than Jboots. The fastest is on par with Spirit of Cheetah, from what I've heard.<br />
<br />
Mana regen on a horse is about the same as if you're sitting, or slightly better. <br />
<br />
No idea about the aggro, though.</div></div><hr />

The 8k horse is extremly slow, about run1 speed, you can outrun a non-SoW'd mob if you run in a straight line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verdandi</div><div class="date">03-03-2003, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love my horse.  My favorite use for her is while travelling, since she's one of the speedy chain steeds.  It's lots and lots of fun to outrun darn near everyone and everything hehe.  It was SO satisfying to outrun one of those bloomin sowed orcs in East Wastes, ones of the ones that spawns when they're having the battle at the fort.<br />
<br />
On the practical side, she's invaluable for times when I'm having a hard time keeping up enough mana and we're in a zone where I can use her.  But it takes some practice to learn to compensate for the slow start/stop times and the inability to duck.  They've gotten me in trouble more than once.<br />
<br />
Oh, hee hee, and having newbies snap my picture like gawking tourists is kinda fun too.  :D</div></div><hr />
