<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turner_USA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I will be 200 eventually doing Candied Cockraches, then hitting 218 with Breaded Storm Salmon.<br />
<br />
My Questions is at what skill should I try Justice Fruit Pies.  I have access to 400 Planar Fruits.  I could start right at 218 OR I was wondering if it would be better to skill up on something else and then do Justice Pies at a later level?<br />
<br />
What you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">MTP are less time consuming in terms of gathering components imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did justice pies low 200s with a mix in of all the other non-great-stat-pop-food-items-that-I-saved-for-higher.  If you have the ingredients now, use them now.  No sense waiting til a magic number.  This assumes you are at least in the 200 range skill level.  Doing them at skill 5 would be silly.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree. Just do them - and sell them. Bristlebane party platter folks will buy them from you in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are also a few GoD recipies you can do at this level.<br />
<br />
I personally also when the PoP route after Storm Salmons ran trivial.  But then, I had a few k plat to toss around and buy up supplies.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Justice Fruit Pies were my &quot;magic&quot; combine. I got more skillups more often with this particular item than any others. I did the truffles &gt; cockroach &gt; halas &gt; lotus &gt; easy PoP stuff route, with a few MTPs mixed in. Somtimes, past 230, I would get 2-3 skill ups in only a handful of combines of justice pies, usually less than 10, as I would make them as I got the fruits.<br />
<br />
They are much easier to do than MTPs, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Runcade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did GoD baking and found it to be extremely easy.  heres a link to a thread i made about it<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Daragoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As soon as Breaded Storm Salmon went trivial I did nothing but Pies till 250.  If you have a char (or in my case a friends char) that can forage for you in PoJ then it's too easy and cheap not too IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Iumarex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Try Beer Battered Hyanid/Cragbeast. It'll take you to 222, no eggs or vegetables required.  You will need a forager to get the meats, but probably will have plenty with 2-3 hours of foraging.  Much less time than foraging the breadcrumbs and fishing the Salmon.  So unless you need the fishing practice head on over to Natimbi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ciws Phalamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not the easiest to gather but griffon and anaconda melts can take you to 250 also biggest draw back is if you were KoS in Jaggedpine. and it takes a little while to gather enough meats to make it worth while. I was leveling my Druid there on the griffons anyway so I just passed the meats off to my Character that was baking when Id get a few stacks built up.</div></div><hr />
