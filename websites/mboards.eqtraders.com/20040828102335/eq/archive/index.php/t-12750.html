<br />
I have finally acquired Grandmaster (250) in Fletching and I found a good place to farm Chunks of Condensed Shadow (the drops aren't spectacular, but the risk to a 40+ player is almost non-existant).  Go to Shadeweaver Thicket and hunt Shak Dratha.  Now, I know this is also under trade supplies, but I wanted to add some more detail.  If you go there to hunt, you must keep in mind that they only spawn AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE DAY.  Between 8pm and 6am Game time.  I had a friend that was not in Luclin check the times when the first ones started to appear on my track.  Its best to clear some of the other wanderers in the zone so they will also spawn faster too.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps the other aspiring GM fletchers out there.  Good luck guys!</div></div><hr />
