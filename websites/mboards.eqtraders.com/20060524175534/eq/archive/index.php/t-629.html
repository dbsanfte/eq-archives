&gt;&gt; Gwynna, are you the Gwynna that used to brew Moonlight Tempers in kelethin for Denowon ages ago?<br />
<br />
Yes, I am the same player/character. I went on a hiatus for about a year and a half but returned to the game recently. My former guild, The Dragonriders of Norrath, have been scattered to the wind (moved on to other games), but I have found a new home with La Familia along with some of my old friends from DRoN.<br />
<br />
Nice to see the old folks from Greater Faydark have grown up to become successful in their trades. I see Maena has become quite the fletcher as well--another person I used to cross paths with a lot. I think she foraged more morning dew for me than anyone.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

Good to see you around again.  After you left I leveled a alt character to 250 brewing to make my smithing tempers with the best chance of success.  Look up Denowon in the bazaar and look at the armor that he usually always has for sale.  I ended up bringing 2 of my alts to 250 skill in smithing befor is became profitable to do it just because I enjoyed it so much.<br />

I thought that was you! I was unsure though and didn't bring myself to ask. Don't know if you remember me, I was in DRoN too and sold those Tiger pelts to you from LOIO at the time. You made me a Othmir Fur Cap too, which was one of the best caps at the time and very rare.<br />
<br />
Good to see you back! I'll have to /tell you in game and catch up.  ;)</div></div><hr />
