<br />
As many of you know I am college student, a senior, and a RA (Resident Assistant). I have been a RA for 3 years, working non-stop over both my summers at this job. 5 staffs, 12 RD (Resident Directors), 6 building, and a lot of change everywhere. I have seen people hired, fired, and many, many people promoted over me.<br />
<br />
Like many jobs, this is one of politics. It's not what you do or how hard you work, it's who you know and who you b*** to get promoted. I truly love this job, I have done it UNPAYED for 3 years, all the time watching co-workers and even people who where once my &quot;kids&quot; (Freshmen I had while I was there RA) become my boss. I have taken everything in stride, doing my job, working a second or third job to get money. I have seen and done a lot in my days...9-11 was bad for my school, a lot of NYCers, detoxs, drug overdoses, attempted suicide, and even a guy selling the hard stuff with a loaded gun in his room. But also I have done good, helped people through deaths, classes, and breakups. I've laughed and cried with 3 years of freshmen and sophomores. Yelled when the community bathrooms got, literally, destroyed, cheered as I see a group spend a full day helping make food for the homeless.<br />
<br />
Last night was our annual RA Banquet. It was all the RAs form all the halls get together and reward each other for things. For 3 years I never got a single award, not even the Hall MVP, which is picked by the RD of that building. This year, I finally got MVP for my building. Also, my building got the Customer Service Award, for the kindest, friendliest staff in the department. Another fellow co-worker got Rookie RA of the Year, something I think she deserved but also someone who was one of my freshmen and would be my boss if I were to come back. But the thing that really made me happy was that I, after all this, got RA of the Year. All I can say is you should of heard the people cheer who have known me for 3 or 4 years. Many of the RDs started with me as first years and argued that I never got a promotion, so they were all ecstatic that I finally got some recognition for my deeds.<br />
<br />
And if any of you are wondering why I was passed over so often for a promotion, look to my girlfriend. She is a fellow RA with me, and is very much disliked by the BIG bosses of the department. Before you say that can't be the answer let me say this. When the Assistant Director of the entire department says to your face you will be promoted if you brake up with her, you know they don't like her. But, she does her job better then I do mine so they can't fire her, and she, like myself, just lingered on in the department. I have and always will chose happiness and love over a job any day and have never regretted anything I have done.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So, there is my little story, sorry for rambling on, just it&#8217;s a lot to look back on, and even more to look forward to.<br />
<br />
Have a great one all,<br />
<br />

My girlfriend at the time worked for Dept. of Residence Life, and without divulging too much information, our mutual boss made life hell for over a year when I was involved in an executive capacity with the student part. The boss was not fond of my girlfriend or my former boss, who I was also good friends with. <br />
<br />
Many of the RAs and Hall Directors I worked with felt similarly about the arbitrary nature of the power that was exercised over all aspects of their lives. <br />
<br />
I can truly say I understand.<br />
<br />
University politics must be the same all over the nation.<br />
<br />
That being said, congratulations on your honor.<br />

HAHA :D  Same here, I would not even break the smallest rule in my building. I lived by the rule &quot;I can't make you do it if I do it myself.&quot;</div></div><hr />

It hurts not being recognized, but it makes it feel 100000(just imagine ALOT of 0's) times better when you finally get it. Keep up the good work, I'm sure people will look back 30 years from now and remember you (WTB pat on the back emoticon)</div></div><hr />

My first memory of my RA was during only year in the dorms, freshman year. I went to a fairly liberal, nearly hippie college that year, and if I remember correctly, that night I had decided I needed to christened my new bowl (I did pottery) by burning dried herbs to the four winds. (No drugs, just my mind worked like this then).<br />
<br />
Anyway, so I'm out on the college commons, ritually burning basil and lavender in this big bowl (it was a pretty bowl - wonder what happened to it) in the moonlight when a large group people came running by -- naked.<br />
<br />
And guess who was in the group? My RA.<br />
<br />
College is funny like that. =)</div></div><hr />

Sadly (or maybe not), I missed out on all of that college residence stuff. My app for housing got lost my freshman year so I ended up in a private dorm (I know, cry me a river). After that it was apartments for the next 4 years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verdandi</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Congrats on the honors and even more congrats on being true to yourself.  That's not easy to do in such a situation!<br />
<br />
My favorite college residence story is from my junior year.  I had started the year with two other roommates in a triple.  One of the two roomies moved out fairly soon when a good friend of hers came up with an opening.  The other left the school entirely at the end of the first semester.  So when the second semester started, I had the whole triple all to myself, whoopie!  Having gone through the depths of misery with my roommates in my first two years (let's just say I had to call the police on one of them) this was a dream come true.  <br />
<br />
Then I got the message on my machine from the head of housing saying that they had two freshmen they wanted to put in with me.  Now, I like to think I'm not elitist, but there was a very clear rule that they never put freshman with juniors or seniors.  I think the idea was to foster community amongst classmates and prevent the youngins from picking up our bad habits hehe.  The room really also was too small to be a triple.  It had obviously been designed as a double, if a bit bigger than most, but three people was a tight squeeze.  So, I tried valiantly to stop them.  The HR at the time, who was also my HR in my sophomore year and the RA in my freshman year, and knew well what I'd been through, did what she could to dissuade them as well, but they had their minds made up.<br />
<br />
So, when going through the proper channels and arguing my case failed, I decided to fight dirty.  :twisted:  The girls they wanted to put in with me called and set up a time to come.  I can't say I'm entirely proud of this, but I can't say I regret it either.  First, I borrowed a friend's Weird Al CD and had it blaring.  I believe &quot;The White Stuff&quot; was on when they arrived.  I'd emptied most of my pop can recycling bin onto the floor and a few miscellaneous surfaces.  Blankets were in disarray, dirty laundry heaped all over, papers strewn about, etc.  Then I sat on the bed in my pajamas, feigning a cold and trying to look like I was trying not to be sulky.  Our conversation was friendly, if a bit strained, and after they left I never heard another word from them or the head of housing.  I had the triple to myself for the rest of the year.   :D <br />

Oh OH OH-OH-Oh, Oh Oreo.  Oh OH OH-OH-Oh, the white stuff...</div></div><hr />
