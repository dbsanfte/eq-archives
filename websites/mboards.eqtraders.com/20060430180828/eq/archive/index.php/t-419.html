<br />
Large Fine Plate Bracer, when attempting to dye with 2-resin black dye, is DNC. (3-resin is fully functional, however)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I put in one Ethereal Temper, one file, and 17 Ethereal Energy Bricks (by mistake).  I successfully combined them into one Ethereal Energy Ring.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Akassha</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">According to the lead GM on my server, the patch which supposedly fixed being able to combine full stacks of things in forges, etc. did NOT work, and they are spending a lot of time refunding items. <br />
<br />
I was refunded a full stack of celestial tempers a couple of days ago with absolutely no hassle, due to this &quot;known bug.&quot;<br />
<br />
Be careful guys.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cantatus</div><div class="date">12-08-2002, 03:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd suggest that everytime you accidentally combine a stack of something, to /bug it and list what the recipe was, what it was that you had in a stack, and what type of container it was you did the combine in.  I'm not sure how the code worked, but it's possible there are loopholes so that some recipes are still eating stacks.  Perhaps submitting detailed examples would help them iron out any problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarubine</div><div class="date">12-14-2002, 08:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This happened to me today on the new Venril Sathir server trying to make banded armour. Combining a stack of metal sheets really does hurt on a new server. And to add insult to injury, I failed on the combine.  :cry: <br />
<br />
Anyway I petitioned and was told forges do not count as containers and therefore the patch does not apply to them. I don't think he tried to get rid of me quickly as he was very kind and explained in detail. He even pointed me to eqtraders... where I promptly found this post. <br />
<br />
So did anyone else get this reply?</div></div><hr />
