<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zolina</div><div class="date">04-13-2006, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've tried all the camps, my observation is that yttrium ore drops about the same percent of the time off all the mobs, about 1 in 6.<br />
<br />
The Grey - sun revenants<br />
Pros - Easy single pulls, no casters<br />
Cons - Only six mobs, have to wait a long time for respawns<br />
<br />
The Deep - thought horrors<br />
Pros - Enough mobs for a ranger to pull and kill constantly<br />
Cons - Lots of dispelling mobs, usually an add or two during pulls, often camped, don't try pulling elder thought horrors (unsnareable unslowable 500+ hitters that come three at a time)<br />
<br />
Akheva Ruins - mind burrowers<br />
Pros - No dispellers, plenty of mobs, mind worm hides and meat can be used to get tailoring and baking up<br />
Cons - They drain all your mana and run, they have lots of hp and are highly resistant to magic, need to have manaless snare to hunt here, usually 1-2 adds per pull, can get a big train if you pull from the right side<br />
<br />
Sanctus Seru - mobs that are dark blue at 70 (mostly through the curtains)<br />
Pros - Good experience, plenty of mobs<br />
Cons - CH and dispel mobs, they dual-wield so they hit harder than the other options, magic resistant, can't avoid multiple pulls sometimes, occasional nasty mobs scattered among the normal ones<br />
<br />
Grieg's End - shadow masters<br />
I didn't get to try these out, I couldn't find out which mobs drop the key to the second level and I read that they swarm and dispel you like crazy, so I don't consider them a viable option.<br />
<br />
I'd say the best two options are The Deep and Akheva Ruins.  Akheva Ruins is slower farming and it's tricky to avoid roamer trains, but it's not camped as often as The Deep.  Another thing I've had success with is farming Ssra shissar scales and ducking out every half hour to kill the sun revenants in The Grey.  You get less yttrium this way, but the total amount of scales + yttrium is quite nice.</div></div><hr />

hunt on the right side once over the bridge<br />
<br />
no risk of elders there, if lucky you can get to imperceptible camp with invis<br />
<br />
plenty of spaces to set up to have doubles pulled without problems<br />
<br />
a\nd the loop on the right is hardly ever camped as there is no named there and a bit harder to get to<br />
<br />
Yttrium is 10x easier to farm than piles of gravel<br />

Piles of gravel are 100x easier to farm than great reptile teeth <br />
<br />
so yes shissar scales are the best, but yttrium is by far second best of the lot</div></div><hr />

I have farmed it for more hours than I want to recall but I know that it is well over 200 hours so I know how hard/easy it is to get.  I don't mind farming it but I wish I could buy it at a reasonable rate.  The unfortunate thing is that we have some farmers on my server that put it up for 1.5k each and then everyone who comes in does the exact same thing.  Rarely do they budge on their price.  I wouldn't be so upset if it was worth it.  At 292 Tinkering, I need three bars per combine.  That is 4.5k per combine and the result is an item that goes straight to my DESTROY button because I already have over one hundred each of Servolinked legs and breastplates sitting in my banks.  To compound the matter, I know that a couple of the farmers are selling that plat online.  I understand the concept of supply and demand and I feel that people should be FAIRLY compensated for the time and effort they put into it but come on already.  <br />
<br />
Increasing the drop rates would increase the supply. thus reducing the demand and would hopefully force some of these plat sellers back under the rocks they came from.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are a lot better options of making pp and a lot more xp at the same time<br />

i farmed there for 3 weeks straight to finish tinkering, <br />

anyway 3 bricks is still easier than 1 clockwork carapace</div></div><hr />

At no time to I remember promising anything by any particular date.  I only promised that I mentioned that I let my management know how important it is for me to get time set aside to fix this.  I have defenitely made no changes to the drop rates that will be in the upcoming patch.</div></div><hr />

When I farmed there for my tinkerbot, I would do my version of quadding, although somtimes I had more that four mobs.  Round the mobs up and circle them to get them all lined up and then turn loose Hail of Arrows.  Good times.  I think the most I got at one time was about 10.  :)<br />

<br />
Nah...I'm fairly sure that you could loot all the corpses that had anything in under 7 minutes. Just &quot;/autohide looted&quot; and start looting away. Leave anything you don't want. The corpses would disappear rather quickly.</div></div><hr />

You can get some drops which sell for a few K (mask being the best) pick up a few gems and a chance at the shrink wand (in my time there I got one and saw 1 rot and another a guildiee got there with 17 seconds left on the corpse).</div></div><hr />
