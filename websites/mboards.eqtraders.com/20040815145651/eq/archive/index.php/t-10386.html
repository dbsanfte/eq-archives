<br />
My little Dwarven Cleric is going to begin his illustrious career as a brewer tonight and I have a quick question.<br />
<br />
Can I use the Tanaan Brew Barrel in PoK for the same recipes as a regular Brew Barrel or does it only work for certain recipes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can make all the combine in the PoK brew barrels that you would in a regular one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Savengriff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks a bunch for the quick answer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Leysa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes it'll work for regular recipes, but really, I'd ask you to use a barrel somewhere else if you're skilling up.  Can't count the number of times I've needed to use a Taanan barrel only to find them both being monopolized by people skilling up on non-Taanan recipes.  I don't even use the Taanan one unless I specifically need it; ShadowHaven barrels are usually open and that zone has most supplies for many recipes anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>munwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Best thing to do is buy a Cleric gate idol that will port you to your hometown. Very rarely are people using the containers in the oldworld zones. you can click it, make your combines without interruption or hogging the PoP specific containers.<br />

Leave the Tanaan barrels for POP combines. I do as much as i can in old world zones. In fact, I'm still bound at the firepots to make it that much easier for me :)<br />
<br />
Too bad we can't all use cleric gate idols. those are so cool!</div></div><hr />
