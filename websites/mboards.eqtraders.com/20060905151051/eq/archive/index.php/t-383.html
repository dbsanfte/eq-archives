<br />
Any suggestions as to when it would be a good time to attempt ?..what's everyone's experience been with them so far?<br />

I wouldnt attempt before 220 and only then if you hunt the supplies yourself. If your buying them wait till 230.</div></div><hr />

LGuk is near-IMPOSSIBLE to hunt for xp currently from all the people looking for faction to do this quest   :P<br />
<br />
Come to think of it I am curious myself now if there's actually any stats on the cloak, or just a quest turnin with nothing stats....<br />

The person who wanted one looked for a couple hours for a higher tailor on but decided he did not want to wait any longer and he wanted me to try.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaidian Blade</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've hunted in WW for quite some time and I'd say the drop rate of the hides is somewhere between 1 in 10-15.  They are VERY rare.  The only good thing about that zone is that there are many Mastadons up right after a patch, but they will all eventually be hunted and replaced with CoV faction mobs because they are placeholders for the Velium Hounds.  Once that happens... the zone is completely worthless unless you kill CoV mobs.<br />
<br />
I really wish Verant would fix the zone so there were two DISTINCT hunting tables. /rant off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pisaster</div><div class="date">12-07-2002, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I had to be diferent... L62 Half elven ranger, 252 wis with my tailoring gear on and KEI. (207 skill+ geerlock)<br />
<br />
Said to myself, &quot;Hey, a new recipe and I saved some of these pelts. Let's try it.&quot;<br />
<br />
First attempt with KEI and werewolf:   1 for 1<br />
<br />
2nd attempt with KEI (no werewolf):  0 for 3<br />
<br />
3rd attempt with KEI and werewolf:  1 for 3<br />
   (was gonna stop before this, but someone was offering sick price for one)<br />
<br />
So it is possible, but no reliable at low 200's, I'd wait til 220 if I just hadn't felt greedy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">data9724</div><div class="date">12-08-2002, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 249 skill + GM needle, i got 8/14 success rate on the cloaks. The other GM tailors on my server report similar success rates, swinging between 50 and 60%.<br />
<br />
So i wouldnt start making them at 200, or even 220 skill. Especially if you buy the furs, fur prices on Veeshan are now at 2500pp, so would be close to 11K a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geddine</div><div class="date">12-08-2002, 11:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I can confirm that this combine is skill restricted.  I tried at 171 + geerlok and it said I was not experienced enough to try.  So thinking you have to be 200+ to try.<br />
<br />
Server up is the only time I see a decent number of Mastodons up.  After the initial clearing seems to be only 1 popping every 20 minutes.  Deffinitely wasn't like this when I was hunting the Hounds.  Now hounds are everywhere and not a mastodon in sight.  Was lucky on 5th Dec patch, first 3 Mastodons dropped 1 fur each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abazagaroth</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once all the spawns are CoV mobs and ice burrowers just log out for 30 minutes and watch TV, or zone to SG and get some exp if you can kill in there. Those mobs despawn now after about that time. During my mastodon hunting time last week I spend 36 hours+ to get 4 furs, about half that time I was by myself and farmed all the mammals out several times, just waited, and those 6 ice burrowers I had roaming near SG was down to 1, and mammals were up again all over.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think the mobs de-spawn.  Likely, some folks came through and were Ice Burrower farming.  I've spent a gawd-awful amount of time hunting in WW.  Being able to track, I can pretty much say with certaintly that unless you kill something, it stays up.  There were many times (very late at night) I was the only person in the zone and the same number of Burrowers or CoV mobs were up while I was killing Hounds or PHs for the hounds (Mastodons, Brontotheriums).  The longer I was there though.. the MORE CoV faction mobs popped as I killed more of the animals.  The zone eventually becomes devoid of all animals and then it's deserted.<br />
<br />
By the way...<br />
<br />
What prices are being seen for the Velium Mastodon Furs on servers?  I've seen them for 2-3k already on Sol Ro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Canto Wolfheart</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext"></div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naeen</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On Emarr the furs go anywhere from 2-5k and the cloak ranges from 25-40k. Crazy if you ask me. But I'm already a wood elf so what do I need some silly crown for.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyrdlan</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2k on Rodcet Nife.<br />
<br />
<br />
Interesting aside, I went to bed with a cloak priced at 20k, and woke up Sunday morning to NINE different people telling me I'd never sell it for 20k and offering from 8k to 12k for it.  Also, one person (who had not sent me a message I should point out) had purchased it for 20k.<br />
<br />
I resisted sending a message to each of the nine people telling them to buy a clue.  When hides go for 2k each if you don't get lucky on the first or second try 20k is selling at a LOSS.<br />
<br />
Besides, I figure if you have the time and money to put that much effort into looking like a wood elf you deserve to pay up.<br />
<br />
Old saying accredited to Anon:<br />

It is morally wrong to allow suckers to keep their money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talanic</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My experience:<br />
<br />
The MOBs do NOT despawn.  I have gone to WW to hunt (I've been exping there for weeks) and found almost everything up as an ice burrower.<br />
<br />
I don't think that the animals are all on cov faction spawn.  However, they are DEFINITELY phs of the ice burrowers and vice versa.<br />
<br />
Killing animals spawns burrowers. Killing burrowers spawns animals.  Fortunately, I was after the burrowers for exp anyway...and at times I would use CoV faction pets against them (NOTE: I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE), thinning out both populations at once.  <br />
<br />
It's an odd phenomenon.  If a charmed npc attacks an ice burrower, the burrower's dispell proc will inevitably strip charm.  However, the proc is also a DD...which is applied AFTER the dispell...which means that the npc is then aggro on the burrower, 9 times out of 10.  If you can make it to zone (cov faction npcs all summon) after sicing your pet on a burrower, you may zone out to find the burrower laying waste to COV NPCs.  This is incredibly dangerous, and may cause trouble with your server GMs, potentially.  I talked a GM through it once and he did not comment.  Also, if you try it, be responsible and don't get anyone else killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prence Talormade</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2.5K for mastodon Furs on Prexus, and extremely rare to find them in the Bazaar. We do have several 250 tailors on Prexus so they may be getting combined as fast as they are pharmed. only seeing about 1-2 cloaks for sell a day and they last only minutes selling price is about 15K. I can verify that the mastodons/hounds/bronto being killed off in WW does eventually result in all CoV Faction mobs in that zone and no evidence that they will despawn until killed or patched out .</div></div><hr />
