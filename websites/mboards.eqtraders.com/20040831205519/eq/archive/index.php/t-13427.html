<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Farnyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Due to personal reasons Im taking a leave of absense from EQ at the moment, but still have a huge desire for online gaming intereactions(Man, i sound like a SoE rep or something with that). I had been thinking about FFXI for a while(read: big FF fan) and went out and bought it today.  Im currently downloading the patches(Oy! 2.5 hours and im on cable) and hope to be playing sometime today/tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Now down the actual post stuff.  I was wondering if anyone here plays the game and what server they are on. Im already considering rerolling to get the Bismark server (Grimmy im coming for you! :p ). But id really just like to join a server where I know theres a batch of good people and a few tradeskill addicts to boot. Which leads me to my next question.  Are there any EQtrader type sites out there?</div></div><hr />

There are some trade sites I think, but they mostly in japanese. <br />
Allakhazam's FFXI section has recipes and other tradeskill info, as well as a message board.<br />
<br />
Tradeskills in FFXI are more direct than EQ. X item combined with X item makes X item. You are very unlikely to fail if you are in the ballpark skill of the item you want to make, while you are not going to be able to make a higher item usually. <br />
<br />
You don't &quot;skill up&quot;, like you do in EQ. Instead you more or less profit from making stuff right away, if you know what sells at the auction house. You do skill up, making lower things, but its not really the reason you make them. You might have that item that sells better as a target, but the things on the way sell too.<br />
<br />
One neat thing is, even at a low level you kind of get constant stuff. Like you can make a tradeskill ingredient from synthing a drop with a necklace from a birdman, then synth that product you made with a thing from an onion man in the same area, then make something else. You can sell the ingredients for profit at the auction house, or make items and sell them. Another neat feature is players can make pretty much every regular item/armor thing. It would be like being able to make the barbed ringmail in EQ, even though it also drops. There are some things you can't make like the class special armors and such.<br />
<br />
For some reason, I've lost interest with FFXI. I'm back messing around in Anarchy Online which is a really complex MMORPG that i've got back into, with tradeskills and lots of stuff. One thing I like about tradeskills in AO is that you either have the skill to make this implant, or you don't. If you have enough skill to do it, you do it and its always successful, if you don't then you can't make the item.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what it was about FFXI, really. At first it seemed like a fantastic game, with tons of quests and such to do that you can start at a low level. After I did the 60 or so odd quests that I could do being only up to level 13, the rest are kind of far off and would take some leveling. Leveling got kind of boring, since it seems like its doing the same thing over and over, even more than EQ really. You kill the same things over and over and over, unless you run far off where you are killing orcs instead of the bird men you were killing by your city.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm just kind of mmorpg'd out in general. Its also weird that in FFXI you can be rich at level 13, but you can't wear any better stuff as a white mage until level 19. So you get forced to level at some points to get anything new. Meanwhile, AO is the king of constantly upgrading gear and such - mostly solo in missions.</div></div><hr />
