<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know how much we can sell a Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement for?<br />
How much do the ingredients cost?<br />
I was curious about the profit margin.<br />
Is there a website that shows how much items usually cost?<br />
I know there was eqprices.com, but i think most websites are outdated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">this goes in the market place forum.  each server is different so that really can't be answered</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>IantheDawnglory</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As an example, on Ayonae, the price for Bloodmetal bricks ranges from diddly (10 pp) to squat (40 pp).  War Wraith Blood nudges 200 pp if I run out and am unlucky, 100 pp is more normal.  And Highly Polished Gems run ~19k.  The completed earring usually sells for 30k - 32k.<br />
<br />
 IMHO, the profit margin of buying HPGs for 19k and selling the earring for 30k pretty much sucks, if it's there at all, so I buy fewer gems and make sure not to pay more than 16k, which gives me some breathing room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">:steamed:  I have found three highly polished gems on merchants and have failed the combination all three times. :steamed: <br />
<br />
So I can't give personal sale prices.  :(  However, they seem to sell for around 25,000 to 30,000 plats on my server.  Naturaally, HPG sell for 15,000 - 16,000 plats.  With my current record, I don't plan to buy any. :)</div></div><hr />
