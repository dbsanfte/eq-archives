<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LinaInverse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Perusing through these forums, you get a lot of nightmare stories about how trade skills past 200 (and sometimes earlier) become nightmares to train up.  From what I understand, it's now possible to use training points to up trade skills, with appropriate plats, even up to 250 (didn't used to be that way).<br />
<br />
So my question is, at what point does it become worthwhile to quit grinding and not getting skill ups and just paying the guildmaster his fee?<br />
<br />
I gave this some serious thought when I visited my Guild guy; I have a 248 Brewing and training another point would cost me a shade more than 100 plats.  Not cheap to be sure, but not all that harsh either, considering that it cost me about 5x that doing a small stack of Demi-Sac Champagne (and a Corking Device for KCs would cost like 1.5K minimum in my server's bazaar).  Other trade skills are far worse; costing potentially hundreds of plats, and a lot of farming rare drops per attempt, and often taking like 20-100 attempts to get a single skillup (or as the horror stories go).<br />
<br />
The skill point limits (5 per level) means you obviously can't take a skill from 0-250 doing this (or at least not more than 1), but is it a viable strategy to use your guild points to judiciously bridge the gaps when you hit a dead-end wall or run out of comps to try (or as is the case with many trade skill, break past the &quot;easy&quot; part of the training)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cubwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you can only use training points to raise tradeskills up to a skill level of 21. After that, you get the message &quot;you must do further study in the field&quot; or somesuch.<br />
<br />
Sorry. You're not the first to ask.<br />
<br />
proviso: it is possible to raise fishing, research, and poisonmaking using training points, though they all have level restrictions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LinaInverse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hm... OK, I thought they took that restriction out.  My bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well, I've not tried for an age, because I had tried and found out I could only get to 21.<br />
<br />
If someone could confirm this, would be nice and a shame. Tradeskills were like leveling, they took effort and time to get high enough to do anything. If you took away the skill point limit 250 tailoring would be first on many people's lists of To Do's.</div></div><hr />
