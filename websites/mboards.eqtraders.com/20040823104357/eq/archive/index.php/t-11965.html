<br />
I have more Star Ruby Encrusted Steins than I know what to do with too.<br />
<br />
I'll see about parsing out the skillup history on my pottery when I get a chance.</div></div><hr />

I can only dream of being there, 160 planar stiens and still stuck at 203.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I felt that way along the way at times as well, and stopped for long periods along the way.  I made the final push from 203 during the past two weeks.<br />
<br />
I had some runs of over 200 without a single skillup.  Fortunately, those all occured before it started getting really expensive.  Not having access to a high level enchanter, I had to purchase most of the mana vials I used, but, even so, Golden Idols of Tunare were, by far the cheapest part, as they sell quite well, at a profit.  Star Ruby Encrusted steins sell at a loss when failures are taken into account, but, at least I am getting back some of the cost of making them.<br />
<br />
To get from 199 to 242, I am not sure how much I spent, but I ended up with about 70ish golden idols of tunare, returning 65k or so, and 150ish Star Ruby Encrusted Steins, returning about 15k, once all are sold.  Overall, I suspect it did not end up costing me anywhere near as much as I expected it to, due to selling the steins and idols.</div></div><hr />
