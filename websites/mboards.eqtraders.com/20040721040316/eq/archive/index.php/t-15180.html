<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sshaithis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm using my cleric to try and raise pottery passed 200, so I am doing steins. I try to make celestial essence and none of the recipies are working. I right click and ctrl+right click on the mortar and pestle and the tradeskill UI doesn't come up. Is this because I don't have any skill in Make poison, or are there other dastardly forces at work here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Madbakerhobbit2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thinking it was moved to mixing bowl.  Try that.<br />
<br />
Last night, got a ton of tells for the two minutes I was on.... They moved CE's to mixing bowls!  CE is my most hated item.  I go through entirely too many of them :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A lot of the things that were made in the mortar are now in the mixing bowl. This includes the Chips of Granite-&gt;powdered and I assume this goes for all non-poison related combines that were done in the mortar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mocean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Strangely enough, after the patch I tried to make powdered sandstorm pearl in a mixing bowl and got the not in this container message.  I had just previously done chips of granite in a mixing bowl.<br />
<br />
I was able to do it  in an M&amp;P. I'm not sure if that was fixed in a subsequent patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There's a post from Maddoc in one of these threads around here somewhere saying that he may have missed moving some of the non-rogue recipes to the mixing bowl.  If you find one, /bug it.</div></div><hr />
