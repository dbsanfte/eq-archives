<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crucis Kryst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all this is my first trade skill. Im not really sure on what to do and how to do any pottery. I read the master pottery for 30pp forum and am trying that. My skill is at 51 right now. All i am making is Unfired Medium Bowls. How for can my skill go up just making those? Is that a good plan? Anyone have information that can help me?<br />
<br />
 p.s <br />
 Ill be reading other forum and i see alot of 200+ recipes nothing for lower skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your best bet is to follow the pottery guide under the Learn a Skill section of the main site (sounds like you already found that one.)  That will take you to something like 122, though when I did it, it was more like 100pp than 30pp.<br />
<br />
If you click on the pottery recipe (http://www.eqtraders.com/recipes/pottery_recipe_page.php?article=55&amp;rsa=Pottery&amp;sub=&amp;sb=item&amp;menustr=080090000000) page, it will take you to all the various things you can make.  You're more interested in the basic recipies (http://www.eqtraders.com/recipes/pottery_recipe_page.php?article=114&amp;rsa=Pottery&amp;sub=basic&amp;sb=item&amp;menustr=080090020000) right now.<br />
<br />
Always remember to check for your cultural.  I don't know if there is any cultural pottery, but I know for smithing, the wood elf cultural saved me a ton of time and money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Atin Brownsuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just followed that pottery mastery article today and got to 122 in about 2 hours and spent about 40pp. so it is about right on the money. Charisma was 135 and wis was 214. I am a cleric.<br />
<br />
I made a chanter bot to enchant clay as I see that getting it to level 8 is worth the investment if you plan to GM pottery. PLus when going past 200 skill alot of things require enchanted clay and mostly anything that youd make money off of selling requires enchanted clay. Took me 3 hours to get teh chanter to level 8. I farmed CB belts. took 40 of them to go from level 2 to level  8.<br />
<br />
All that aside,t he guide was on the money pretty much but the skill ups were hecka slow in coming. took WAY more than the guides reccomended number of sketches and clay to get to 122. took me about 100 sketches and clay just to get past the medium jar stage. I have no clue how many for the medium bowl. I was doing them in batches of 60.<br />
<br />
plan on doing lg bowls next followed by casserole dishes. Then probably steins idols, etc, whatever. Hang in there though, just takes some dedication.</div></div><hr />

Do you mean this one: <br />
http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g87&amp;menustr=040090000000<br />
<br />
The reason I'm a little confused is because on that page there is mention of:<br />
 One of our message board members has written an update to this guide. I will get this guide updated as time permits)<br />
<br />
And I thought maybe someone has that link somewhere</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The guide was written before they made adjustments to the difficulty levels of certain tradeskills.  Several patches ago Tailoring &amp; Smithing were supposed to have been made somewhat easier, and Fletching and Pottery a ‘little bit’ harder.  <br />
<br />
So yes, pottery now requires more combines that the guide would lead you to believe, to progress.  Just wait til you get into the hell levels.  /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">uh medium bowls trivial at 122.  then i'm doing the poison vial series.  poison vial to 148, lined to 168 and sealed to 188 i beleive.  going to farm zombie skins soon.  i just want it for the shawl quest.  casserole dishes will take you to 199 store bought but only in jaggedpine i beleive.<br />
<br />
good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lythia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ah I see. Thanks very much.</div></div><hr />

Casserole dish sketches are sold in JPF but you can make them on any wheel.  The obvious thing to do is to move an alt to JPF and camp him there then use the shared bank slots to purchase and transfer the sketches as you need them.</div></div><hr />

lol.  that better.  its what i meant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Crystal Thrall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You can now buy Casserole Dish sketches in Abysmal Sea.  They also have Ceramic Lining Sketches all on the same merchant...and he sells clay, too.  AND there's a pottery wheel right behind him and a Kiln like 10 steps away!  :eek:   Abysmal Sea may be a bit out of the way, but it's a goldmine for tradeskillers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Humphf<br />
<br />
I personally did Medium bowls to 122, Large bowls to 148 (no zombie skin farming!) then moved on to lined and sealed poison vials, followed by casserole dishes. My cleric is now 199, and ready for that phase of the shawl quest... once he starts the shawl quest... of course... hehehe</div></div><hr />
