<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heartsong_Steelsoul</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's actually 212.  I'll remind denmom to take that bit out; I forgot to last time it came up.  It used to be 250.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thunderheart</div><div class="date">12-23-2002, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The trivial is 212 WITH a geerlock, as soon as you take off the geerlock you can't make it. I verified this, this weekend. You can start making it at 210 tailoring with a geerlock. VI really sucks for nerfing this.<br />
<br />
Edit: I will continue to try and make this as I get more tailoring skill to pin it down. I am wondering if I will be able to make it without a geerlock at 213 skill, or will I have to go to 214 or higher. REALLY frustrating. Would it have killed them to let it stay at 250 trivial? I mean, I know it would suck for the tailors that worked hard to get your skill, but I think all trade skills should be equal, I mean, look at my skills below, see the ones that are 200? It was not that hard to get that, Smithing and Tailoring should be the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: Reading the page again, it looks like I will not be able to do the combine without a geerlock until I reach 220. I am wondering if the trivial is 220 as well, so when all is said and done, I will have only been able to get 2 points of tailoring from this recipe. That is so lame it is not even funny.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aelorean</div><div class="date">12-28-2002, 12:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did 91 attempts at 210 tailoring with a geerlok and did not get any skillups (270 wisdom).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malkyr</div><div class="date">12-29-2002, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The trivial is still 212 but the combines are not allowed unless you have 220+ skill.<br />
<br />
So using a geerlok you can use these combines to raise skill from 210 to 212. If you had a 15 mod you could raise from 192 to 212.<br />
<br />
I tried these combines with geerlok 2 days ago. Approx 30 combines and I went from 210-212 after which it was trivial.</div></div><hr />
