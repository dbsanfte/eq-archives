I was impatient and decided not to wait for the path in order to finish my Master Smithing trophy, so I dragged 3-4 friends to KT.  We spent 4 hours slaughtering everything we could find; didn't get a single shimmering aligned ore to drop.  (It was toward the end of hour 3 where I checked Ala's and saw they said it only dropped off the kyv's - of which we killed about 11 total only versus the 60-70 or so animals).<br />
 - Luckily someone was selling it in the bazaar this morning so I did the final combine (everything else was done but that).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KyrosKrane</div><div class="date">03-05-2006, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To the best of my knowledge, Shimmering Aligned Ore is a random drop off anything in Kod'Taz, Yxtta, Ikkinz, Qvic, Inktu'ta, Txevu, or Tacvi -- basically any of the flagged zones. (Did I miss any flagged zones?)  It's just that until now, no one really had a reason to report it to either Alla's or here, since it was a comparatively low-value item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crystilla</div><div class="date">03-06-2006, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The traders reference had refered to KT only the way I read it (and the mob models were indented underneath like the models of mobs within KT).<br />
<br />
Though I was more posting this to see if anyone had recently gotten one from those so I would know which was more accurate.  (If it dropped off something other than a noc, we'd know Ala's was out of sync.)</div></div><hr />
