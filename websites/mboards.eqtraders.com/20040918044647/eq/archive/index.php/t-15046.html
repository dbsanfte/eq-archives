<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I woke up this morning and saw blue sky for the third day in a row. This made me so happy, that I sat down and wrote this. <br />
<br />
<br />
I was also procrastinating on a Japanese essay and an English Poetry test. Also, in the past couple of weeks, we've gone through lots of Shakespeare in two classes (in one, I got to be crazy Ophelia from 4.v; I love playing that scene). <br />
<br />
So, enjoy. Or run away in phear, I don't know which. ^_^ Maybe this will make someone's day a little brighter too. <br />

<br />
Ah, March, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways:<br />
First thou art not February with cloudy ashen days. <br />
Secondly, not January, false snow and fickle sun; <br />
Thirdly, not December with his grueling Finals run. <br />
Lastly, not November, al'ys the Month of Insanity, <br />
Teachers want their papers, fifteen pages, hand in early. <br />
Add to this, the Chain of Life, wrapped around my feet, <br />
Seeming always wanting me to trip, then me to beat. <br />
Seas'nal Affectation, eighteen days of straight no light<br />
Is enough to cause my sunny self to give in to my plight. <br />
The Four of Darkest Winter always darkly stalk my dorm room door; <br />
But cometh March with Sun and Wind, commanding them, &quot;Begone! No more.&quot; <br />
E'en if another cold comes, tis curt, they're on their way, <br />
My March will bring me flowers and more temperate sunny days. <br />

<br />
Not to mention I've been playing Last Exile and Naruto music a lot lately. Don't ask why, but that combo = happy Sanna. <br />
<br />
<br />
ALSO.<br />
It's Spring Break now! That makes anyone happy. ^_^ <br />
<br />
Be happy! /dance! <br />

creepily enough, I'm on neither sugar nor caffeine.... hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Very nice, Sanna.  I could always tell you had a distinct artistic side. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That's a delightful piece, Sanna :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh, 'delightful' is being too kind. It's incredibly corny and cheesy. But if it brings a bit of a smile to someone's face, then it has done some good. Happiness and laughter and joy, and joy at the small things in life, is very good. I forget that way more often than is good either for me or those around me. &gt;_&lt;. <br />
<br />
It shouldn't surprise me to be happy, or to be in a good mood. But when I am, I try to be as visible with that as I end up being when I'm in a bad mood and fail to contain it. <br />
<br />
As for being artistic, I'd sure like to think so.... being a Creative Writing major means I'm gonna have be real creative when it comes to getting my arse hired somewhere... heh. (Hopefully the rest of me too....)<br />
<br />
So, this is nothing significant, just hope it made someone else as happy that Winter is pretty much over as I am. <br />
<br />
&quot;And so, I go to spread happiness to the rest of the station. It's a terrible responsibility, but someone has to do it.&quot;<br />
