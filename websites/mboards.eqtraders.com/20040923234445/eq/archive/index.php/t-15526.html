Farwater Scale BP<br />
Farwater Scale Arms<br />

<br />
Irrelevant drivel follows:<br />

OK, so i spent 350K on components to make myself a farwater bp, and of course failed first 4 attempts.  Anyway, then farmed the fish gills I was missing and made 2 bp's and arms in 4 tries total, cheer.  So, I want to sell farwater scale bp/arms to make back my initial cost as I'm now broke again, somehow.  <br />
<br />
I am on innoruuk server, if that matters - no one there seems to make this stuff for sale in general.</div></div><hr />

You can solicit opinions here, but don't expect any of those prices to be rock-solid. <br />
<br />
You have to consider all sorts of factors in your pricing, not the least of which is what people are willing to pay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Boleslav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Looks like soliciting opinions to me...<br />
<br />
These items are very nice.  I would do some comparisons to the very best droppable items on your server and go from there.  These are probably better than anything else you will see for sale in the Bazaar so you will have to do some extrapolating.  <br />
<br />
You also may end up waiting a bit to sell these as you settle in on a fair price.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you!<br />

<br />
or possibly some prices they seen farwater pieces sold at.</div></div><hr />

If you do a search on 'farwater' it will give you all of the pieces for sale, along with the lowest and highest price offered, as well as the &quot;value&quot; which is a moving average of the lowest selling price across all servers (what a patient buyer will expect to pay for the item).<br />
<br />
It doesn't say if the stuff will *sell* at that price.  Just that it was offered.  I've found it to be useful for &quot;best guessing&quot; prices on unusual items.</div></div><hr />
