<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Monual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wanted to update an old post of mine (smithing guide) that looks terrible now because of the old formatting.<br />
<br />
I made the necessary changes and tried to save it... only to be told the message was too large.  10K is the limit and the guide is larger than that.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to get the limit lifted for one post?  Or is this a global setting that cannot be touched?<br />
<br />
The original post - in its huge 18K glory - is still available to be read.  I'd just like to update it, is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I ran into the same problem when I tried to edit my first post in the Brodder summary thread. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Silly question is, can you find logical break points where you can split it? Make it &quot;Part 1&quot;, &quot;Part 2&quot;, ... &quot;Part N&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Monual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's hard to do that in a thread that's already many pages long.  I could, of course, make a new thread and break up the guide, but that would lose all the helpful commentary that follows.<br />
<br />
If the 10K limit can't be overcome I'll go ahead and break it into parts like you suggest, but first I want to see if it's possible to salvage it in its current state.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The 10K limit is global.  It can't be changed for just one post. <br />
<br />
I'd sugguest that you re-write the guide in sections, and make it a new post, including the information from the helpful commentary. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At this time I have no plans to up the limit.  Sorry!...  I sugest a repost :)</div></div><hr />
