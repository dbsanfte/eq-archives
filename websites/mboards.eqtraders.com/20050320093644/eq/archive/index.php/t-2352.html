<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laureana</div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guess is that it would be in VI's best interest to not give Froggies any cultural gear, can you imagine all the insanely irate half elves and sucht that would be down their throats if Froglocks were introduced with cultural and those without it were again left in the dust?</div></div><hr />

This is counting the Progressive Tradeskill quests as cultural.  If you choose not to include that, than Add Vah Shir to that statement.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pojodan</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 04:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, I hardly call the Progressive tradeskill quests to be cultural.  Most of the quests need only a skill of about 100 in order to get to the dropable peices part at which point you can get the parts from someone else without investing in that skill yourself.  Everything beyond that part has nothing to do with tradeskills.<br />
<br />
Yes, Vah Shir are also without cultural (Which can be considered a good thing since EVERY merchant in Shar Vahl is greedy.)</div></div><hr />
