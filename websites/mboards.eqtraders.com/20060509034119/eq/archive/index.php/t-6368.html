2.  kill seafury cyclops.<br />
3.  save all the mugs of sea foams,runes, words, gems, etc<br />
4.  give bartox the mugs of sea foam<br />
5.  sell off misc gems, runes, words.<br />
6.  use said cashflow to fund making mistletoe cutting sickles!<br />
<br />
actually, this is my basic plan for raising smithing in addition doing Shadowscream combines mixed in. <br />
<br />
and yes I will buy your mugs of sea foam collected!  I currently have about 180 saltwater seaweed... and only 1 stack of foam to my name.<br />
 :roll:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wondered where it had all got to!</div></div><hr />

What's your preferred price range on these?  I see them quite often in my dumpster diving expeditions, but they seemed a bit pricey to hang onto in case someone needed them.  Now that someone does...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ilona</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They sell from vendors for 10.5pp each.  Obviously you'd need a bit more than that for the hassle of collecting them.<br />
<br />
I'm looking for them too, but I have a suspicion Bartox will outbid me :roll:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bartox</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i wil buy at double vendor sell price.<br />
<br />
max i will pay is 25pp per mug<br />
<br />
i just want to mix up the skill up combines, kinda getting tired of farming shadowscream and figured i would try cultural for a bit.<br />
<br />
PS.  you can have extra saltwater seaweeds i probably wont use  ;)</div></div><hr />

Sometimes it's more a matter of who gets to me first than it is about the cash.  As long as I am shopping anyway, what's another stack of items or three.  Once I start running out of slots, however, it's a whole other ballgame.<br />
<br />
[I've got two stacks of Rune of Cyclone and a handful of clover/dye I've been carrying around for a week or so which is about to fall into this category...  *cough* Mother *cough* :twisted: ]</div></div><hr />

<br />
also after the patch, the HSM war is working...  too well  :D <br />
<br />
there are attacks just about every 15 minutes assuming someone is killing the &quot;leader&quot; at a respective camp.<br />
<br />
last night, in 2 hours... it was owlbears, then sonics, then grimlings (for all of 2 minutes) then back to owlbears.<br />
<br />
when you have more than one group farming.. its best to work some kind of agreement so each can get the type of substances you need without screwing over each other  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bartox</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">not working.<br />
<br />
defenders are not &quot;fighting&quot; the invaders... so when one side attacks... they will auto win...    it blows when your trying to farm south and every 15 minute.. it changes to the other side &gt;&amp;lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leafrat</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gonna respectably disagree with you Bartox...<br />
<br />
I love the fact that attackers always win.  When I see an emote that someone is attacking someone and I like the idea, they win, no problem.<br />
<br />
If Its an offensive that I don't like...up pops track, I track the 5 mobs taht just spawned...kill them in under 2 mins...BOOM back to farming :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bartox</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">but the attackers should NEVER win!<br />
your suppose to kill the defenders , i mean, WHY would they make defenders who CAN summon if they arent suppose to do anything but stand there and look pretty?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bartox</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh yeah i need imbued gems again <br />
<br />
star rose quartz, jade, plains pebble  (any of these will work)<br />
<br />
 :shock:</div></div><hr />

I can hook you up with a couple stacks of imbued pebbles.  I don't think I'm going to need them for a while.</div></div><hr />
