Extensive is right!  Aye, we're not really prepared to host downloadable files here, so if you can find a spot to host it, then get us the link, we'll put the link up on smithing guides page.</div></div><hr />

It kicks ass. Plain and simple.</div></div><hr />

I must say, this is by far the best smithing guid I have ever read.  My hat comes off to you, and my thanks goes out to you Zeralenn for this.<br />
<br />
To any one thinking of taking up smithing, or working on becomeing a GM smith READ THIS!</div></div><hr />

Thanx for the hard work. I especially like how you discuss the different routes, pros,cons, and then let the reader make choose a path<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zeralenn</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please note that I have changed the location of the guides:<br />
<br />
http://www.crimsonsnow.org/pdfs/guides.html<br />
<br />
I will edit what entries I can find with the new address. I have put an automatic forwarder up at the old address just in case.<br />
<br />
Also, I have written a new subset of THE ECONOMICAL SMITH called SMITHING FOR TAILORS. It is also available through this address.<br />
<br />
Are these going to go up in the Smithing and/or Tailoring sections as official guides?<br />

<br />
(Page 30) Having a caster put a strength buff or a Spirit of Wolf spell can help you immeasurably (although foot speed spells and items do not work indoors).<br />
The above should be &quot;foot speed spells and items have to be cast outdoors, so if it runs out you will have to go outdoors to cast it again&quot; or something like that.<br />
(Page 53) Progressive Vah Shir smithing quest (details starting on page 39)<br />
Page 39 doesn't mention the Progressive Vah Shir smithing quest.<br />
(Page 71) Depending on your situation, you may need to donate for this service, which will add cost to the finished product. fdsf<br />
I think the 'fdsf' is a typo.<br />
<br />
Cultural notes: Blood of all types drops in the new LoY zones quite often, you might want to add that to the guide.</div></div><hr />

Its complete and very extensive. I would say a must read for anyone wanting to go into smithing or already smithing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Incredible guide - thanks for compiling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chibbodee Crocket</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">(I wrote out a huge post but somehow it got all erased.. this is a more abbreviated version)<br />
Wow, thank you for this guide it is truely awesome a few problems i noticed though<br />
page 69<br />
in the second paragraph it says &quot;An human worshipping..&quot; it seems it would be &quot;A human worshipping..&quot; instead.<br />
Mithaniel is misspelled as MithRaniel<br />
(Froglok) shaman of mithaniel marr can imbue diamonds as well<br />
To my knowlege erudite clerics of cazic-thule can imbue amber, thats also missing from the chart<br />
page 62<br />
in the /ooc hint: the last part of it says &quot;One hint: if the ENTIRE zone is dominated by a single type of mob, the war is impossible to trigger. In that case, your only recourse is to petition a GM to have the zone reset.<br />
they changed the hollowshade war recently so that you can reset the zone by killing the boss that spawns at the vah shir outpost, you'll probably want to change/add that.<br />
thanks again for this wonderful guide!</div></div><hr />

<br />
edit: Actually, crimsonsnow.org is no longer there, period. Did you move the guides to another location, Zeralenn?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ChaseFV</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Zera, first off let me say that this is a professional-quality document. Extremely well done, quite readable, and easy to follow. I bow before your curriculum development skills.<br />
<br />
That being said, do you intend to modify the cost efficiency comparisons on Fine Steel conversions given the results of the recent patch? That was some brilliant work, and I think we're going to find a lot more Fine Steel is now more efficient to melt down.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
C (still using guide to work that smithing up - currently gathering supplies for humming orbs (which I pass on to the guild smith as I have no space).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zeralenn</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Version 4.0 was just posted today.<br />
<br />
I have not reworked the fine steel section; that will require some rather extensive research and I haven't had time to do it. There were several other things I wanted to try to get up and finished in a short period of time so that will have to wait until Edition 5.<br />
