<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Rawhide armour + fish oil = Leather armour (trivial about 55, I think.)<br />
<br />
Now, if someone on Test who had a tailoring higher than 21 were to post on this thread, more interesting things might be discovered. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trezark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heh, I stumbled upon those last night and was going to post here but I wasn't sure if it was new news or not ;)  I wonder how long those recipes have been in the game...  since the beginning?  Not sure how long Fish Oil's been around, it's only used in a PoP recipe according to the DB, but it uses old world components.<br />
<br />
Found the recipe for a &quot;Sewing Needle&quot; too.  Don't remember it offhand as it was pretty complex.  I seem to recall that as being the missing link for the Lemming Fur Backpack, before they changed the recipe.  Wonder what else it's used for...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Heartsong_Steelsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It was a trivial of 35, and works for small, normal and large raw-hide/leather.<br />
<br />
Nifty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">OK... but where do you get rawhide leather pieces? Or do you stitch those as well? They are not currently in our DB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Trezark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Raw-hide as in the standard, tattered/patchwork (Ruined Pelt + Pattern) tailored armor that's been around forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Velaraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Raw-hide as in the standard, tattered/patchwork (Ruined Pelt + Pattern) tailored armor that's been around forever <br />
what your describing IS tattered/patchwork<br />
<br />
Raw hide is mob dropped, ala oasis orcs and similar. It may be on a few vendors too but im not certain of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heh, I just came here to post this.  Was bummed to notice I wasn't the first.  Ah well.<br />
<br />
What are the stats on the stuff?  Is it better than patchwork?  I wasn't able to try any.  Also wonder what other little goodies we will find this way...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Velaraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rawhide armour + fish oil = Leather armour <br />
<br />
meaning the stuff you buy on vendors, stats are on alla or check out a merch in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Trezark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Originally posted by Velaraa <br />
what your describing IS tattered/patchwork Whoops, there was supposed to be a ? at the end of that post.  I wasn't able to log into test to check the recipe again and couldn't remember whether the Leather recipies called for the Patchwork pieces or if they did, indeed, say Raw-hide (which I see now that they do) ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">OK then could we get a list of the various Rawhide Pieces, stats and such? I can load them into the Database with the recipes. With the proper names of course<br />
<br />
should be 3 sets:<br />
<br />
SMALL RAWHIDE LEATHER XXXX<br />
<br />
(MEDIUM) RAWHIDE LEATHER XXXX<br />
<br />
LARGE RAWHIDE LEATHER XXXX<br />
<br />
Right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Could anyone check on the combine for Black Rawhide Tunic and Jade Studded Rawhide Tunic, please :)<br />
<br />
The quest info has been missing since Jaggedpine was released and it would be nice to know what the tailoring recipe actually is.  (The Jade Studded Rawhide Tunic may be the result from turn in instead of tailored.)<br />
<br />
THANKS!!!</div></div><hr />
