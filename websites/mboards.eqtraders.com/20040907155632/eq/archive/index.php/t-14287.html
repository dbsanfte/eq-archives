<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'd like to introduce myself, even though I already made a post here or there.<br />
<br />
Lvl 65 human monk on Solusek Ro, and I'm a newbie to tradeskills.<br />
Mainly because of the very annoying clicking it used to take, I limited myself to &quot;useful&quot; skills before the UI change, such as pottery to 122 for Thurgadin gate potions, smithing to 120-something for Antonian Javelins, baking to fish-rolls-level pre-statfood.<br />
<br />
The UI change made it much easier to bear for people like me, and so I decided to finally have a go at tradeskills.<br />
Got brewing to 248 so far (I had to dig up old banked equipment that has +wis ;)) and made my trophy. Oh joy of never switching my (+wis) weapons for the (+cha) steins again between stacks of combines.<br />
<br />
Everything I have known about tradeskills has come from this site, so I'd like to give a big &quot;Thank You&quot; to all of you that put up with unstackable ingredients, poofing items on DNC, &quot;small&quot; banks, no shared bankslots, 1-container-open, and more, to make this site the pool of knowledge it is.<br />
<br />
I'll try to keep the newbie questions low, everything one has to know is somewhere on the main site anyway ;)</div></div><hr />

OMG, the Horror....  thanks for reminding me of my old days, i probably wont sleep for a week now!<br />
<br />
You forgot a few -<br />
<br />
Vendors not selling stacks<br />
Slide bar when selecting one item from a stack (or money from bank)<br />
<br />
&lt;Shudder&gt;<br />

P.S.  Glad you have rekindled your tradeskilling love, and grats on Brewing!</div></div><hr />
