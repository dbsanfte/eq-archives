<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Apolline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was looking to start up a website for my art, since quite a few guildies and such have said it's worth doing.. And got christmas money to pay for it (For awhile at least), annnd was trying to figure out WHICH host?<br />
<br />
<br />
So question is.. What is the host for Eqtraders? they seem to be pretty reliable and good overall.. worth looking at anyway. Anyone else have a reccomendation? My min specs would be a domain (most places, seems to be 15-20$ per year), with at least 5k mb of space, with a large amount of bandwith.. (Since you know, HQ pictures = Large bandwith. I hate compressing them.). <br />
<br />
Just kindof lost.. right now am looking at infinology(sp? dont have site handy to get it right), which seem to be good. but dont know anyone whose used them i can trust. I would trust the opinions of the EQ traders folk though :) Good people, heh.<br />
<br />
Oki that it.. besides Merry Christmas.<br />

(Posted in DenMom's Corner, because question to denmom.. Apologizes if you guys choose to punt it to OOC, I wasnt sure :confused: )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In the upper left corner of the screen, right unfer the EQTC logo you'll see an image for Rack 9, our web host.  <br />
<br />
Clicking that link will take you to Rack 9's site, and information about hosting. <br />
<br />
Move to OOC where it belongs. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">also if you use rack 9 tell them eqtraders referred you and click the link in the upper left corner so it says who reffered you. Dem Mom may get a kick back for refferals :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Apolline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sorry.. I swear, there are some times where my brain just does not click. Too much pie.<br />
<br />
&lt;promises not to post without 12 hours of sleep and paying attention first&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Been looking.. And Rack9 Seriously seems the way to go.. Should've noticed sooner. Leh sigh. Since most likely I'll be using them.. I'll try and slip a &quot;referred highly by eqtraders&quot;  in there :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I use a company called ReadyHosting ( www.readyhosting.com ), and they're quite decent.  $100 a year for an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink package, but SQL databases are extra (that's the kitchen sink :) ).  Worth checking out, if only to compare.</div></div><hr />
