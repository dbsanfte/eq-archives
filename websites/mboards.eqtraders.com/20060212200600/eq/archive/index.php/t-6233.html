Basically, a character named &quot;Saeolron&quot; on Rathe has been offering to do high level combines and keeping the results for himself (check http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessage?topicID=1150.topic for details, I have no reason to believe the posters are lying, particularly Kathartic).  Since he must be of significant skill level to succeed at these combines, I would expect he frequents this site and, perhaps, looks for victims here as well (not to fault the site in any way).  Anyways, be wary.</div></div><hr />

Also there is a warning about him posted on the RTA by a separate person.<br />
<br />
He seems to be getting around...</div></div><hr />
