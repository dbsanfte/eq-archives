<br />
Druid Airlines (NASDAQ - DRU -0.75 / 9.85) has announced though their CEO, Tunare, that they are filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protecion.<br />
<br />
Tunare stated that since the portals to the Plains of Knowledge have been discovered, Druid Airlines has seen a 90% reduction in profits.  This is only more fuel for the fire after they announced that they have seen a 30% drop in profits soon after Luclin came back into range.<br />
<br />
Druid airlines was once the main form of transportation all thoughout Norrath, bringin in profits in excess of 100,000 platinim pieces per day.  Since the latest hits, their profits have dwindled to a mere 2,500 platinum pieces per day.  Mass layoffs and flight schedule cutbacks are expected in the next month.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a sad time for Druid Airlines, but we will pull together and make it though this difficult time,&quot; Tunare told Reuters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Druid Airlines is based in Surefall Glade, western side of Atonica with a major corperate office in Kelethin (Greater Faydark, Faydwer).  They also had major hubs in South Karana, &quot;Toxx&quot; Forest, and the Nexus.  Currently has 750 employees.</div></div><hr />

Grimling, Iceclad, South Ro, and other zones that may only be &quot;A zone or two away from a book&quot;....<br />
<br />
<br />
And when I shout in HHK, (Where I am still bound from 10 levels ago) that I am porting to the nexus for donation, I always get a nibble.<br />

<br />
I charge for whatever someone is willing to pay for.  I charge as much as I possibly can for said service.<br />
<br />
I just can't imagine not charging the 100th person to ask you for a port while your trying to tradeskill? hehe<br />
<br />
To skill up brewing, in either FP or PoK I would start and end the day roughly the same amt of money, counting on the occasional x-loc to pay for the past few stacks of ingredients, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noni DeeCups</div><div class="date">01-09-2003, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess the difference is - I don't port people unless I am not doing anything. <br />
<br />
Sometime when I am working on trade skills I will see someone ask multiple times in OOC and I will port them because I feel sorry for them - I do have other characters that can't port and I can feel their pain. <br />
<br />
I have never &quot;advertised&quot; ports for donations blah, blah, blah. Nothing wrong with the people who do - I just have too many other things I need to do /shrug and I personally get offended when people seem to think it is okay to treat me like some sort of a taxi. <br />
<br />
All time pet peeve - Out of the blue I get a tell from someone I don't know:<br />
<br />
Player X ask for a port.<br />
I say &quot;Sorry, (busy, in a group, whatever)&quot;<br />
<br />
Player X says &quot;Come on, I'll pay you 100 plat&quot;<br />
I say &quot;I already said no and it has nothing to do with money, good luck&quot;<br />
<br />
Player X says &quot;Please! I have to get to a raid! Come on, what? You want more money or something?&quot;<br />
I say &quot;Dude - what makes you think your time/raid is any more important than what I am doing? It says &quot;Hierophant&quot; not &quot;Port Whore&quot; over my head - welcome to ignore. <br />
<br />
Guess I am kinda grumpy  :roll:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Hahaha...  With the literacy level of most EQers, I bet that couldnt pronounce Hierophant. :) <br />
<br />
And there are many grumpy tradeskillers.  We should form a club or something........ As long as nobody pisses me off...    &amp;lt;grin&gt;<br />

<br />
Herofant, hehe<br />
<br />
Anyhow, not being anon I get asked for ports fairly often, but I don't have to go with them or stop what i'm doing for more than the 10 second casting time.<br />
<br />
Thats where wizards win out ;)<br />
<br />
I will refuse ports that require me to go with them pretty much out of hand, unless the donation offered is significant.</div></div><hr />

So I was in PoK and I asked a high lvl non anon druid if I could get a lift.  He said he was busy and I responded with my usual &quot;thanks for the reply sorry if I bothered you&quot;.  He told me I was the nicest person he had ever turned down.  <br />
And my reason for telling this story...I became that way after hearing everyone's rants here about how rude people are when they say no.  I now do my best to let people know we aren't all rude ungrateful people.  Just so you know some of us do listen to the rants and take them to heart.  I was never pushy before but now I let them know that I am grateful for their reply. <br />
<br />
So I hope that wasn't to much of topic. :) hehe</div></div><hr />

Some people are clueless about how much further you get just being polite /sigh <br />

<br />
But when 29 hit, I was already making good money in the bazaar and 10pp a port just wasn't worth my time. I am usually very busy tradeskilling of some type. (Aren't us all) Whether its skilling up or just making more things to sell in bazaar.<br />
<br />
I am like Noni, I usually don't port unless I am free. And when I do, its no cost to them unless they offer.<br />

<br />
Nice job.  I always make sure I thank someone for any kind of assisstance.  Sometimes even over-paying  (I paid someone 20PP for a SOW the other day because I was encumbered down while making banded)...<br />
<br />
Its worth it.<br />
<br />
I just hate it when you save someone's butt (after you ask if they need help and their response is either 'yeah', 'y', 'yes' or HAIL an ORC LEGIONAIRRE!.<br />
<br />
You save their butt then they accuse you of KS'ing them...<br />
<br />
Its sad, but I'm almost to the point of not helping anymore because of that (I've been warned by GM's about that, too, on Rodcet..).<br />
<br />
But I still love to go to Crushbone and derail trains.  Its so fun.</div></div><hr />
