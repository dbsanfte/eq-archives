<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Najib of MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild has raided in Plane of Fire numerous time, however, I have yet to see the rare drop for this ring, Eye of Eternal Fire.  I was curious if anyone else has had any luck seeing this drop.  In Plane of Earth, we have seen the rare drop there several times, however, we have raiding more in PoF without seeing a one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">IIRC, as a non-elemental kinda person,  it only drops from the Phoenix model stuff in PoFire.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Najib of MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've read that, its just that as a guild we have to have killed the birdies at least a dozen time each and not one has dropped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The eye is a rare drop from 3 spawns in pofire, Quavonis Firetail is a 3 day spawn, Jaxoliz Dawneyes and Criare Sunmane are more like 36-48 hour spawn time.  All 3 are raid mobs.<br />
<br />
The ring isn't worth the effort really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is a 4th bird--one of the spawns along the road to Fennin Ro. Don't remember her name, but one of the last 4 defenders before you reach his throne room.<br />
<br />
We've done birds lots of times, done Q probably two dozen times, done FRo at least a dozen times. Never seen a single drop of the ring item. Its even more rare than solidified magma. :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BrizzyWillbender</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just GM'd this week (after 2 years of more off than on skillups), and had gotten the eye from a recent raid - oddly enough, I was the only tell for it, which is strange considering most of my guild is a bunch of tradeskill whores. :p <br />
<br />
Well, I was feeling lucky, having just gone 0-for-2 on GM eyeglasses, and tried it. Success! I even learned the recipe, even though it won't show up on my collapsable jeweler bag. :grumpy:<br />
<br />
So, they DO exist...but considering this was the first drop I saw in...oh...two months of raiding Fire, I'd say they're pretty **** rare. Odd, considering most melee prefer the Earth ring, which, while just as rare, drop from yard trash mobs. But my paladin isn't complaining, mind you.<br />
<br />
Edit: my drop came from one of the charm birds. Don't remember which one, tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>OberonMiM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ive ONLY seen it drop from the mob in the fennin event.<br />
<br />
never from the 3 pheonix's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xanafeldier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I bought one of these rings for 70kpp after looking and asking around for many months.<br />
This is one of the strangest PoP tradeskill items imo. It's not THAT great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>scaevola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ultra rare<br />
I think it was like 6 months til someone actually made one (in to pop) we've been in elementals almost 9 months now seen one ever drop.  <br />
<br />
Its a pita - the PoJ ring is way easier to get and is only tier 1 but its for priests.  Pures seem to always get the shaft :(.<br />

Drops of the Phoenix Models</div></div><hr />
