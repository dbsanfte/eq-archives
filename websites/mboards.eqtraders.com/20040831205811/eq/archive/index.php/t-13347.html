<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Phirelight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I've tried lots of things, but have this bizzare problem and am turning to the vast knowledge of this forum for help.<br />
<br />
On only ONE of my toons this happens: Anything in my cursor is invisible including spell gems.  If there is a stack of something i see a floating number.  <br />
<br />
Yes I have a custom UI but this happened before that UI and I run the same UI on my other toons with no problem.  <br />
<br />
Anyone have any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Melinia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm not much of a techie but it could be a corruption in the ui files. Lets see if i can explain this right... <br />
Go into your EQ folder and remove all files containing that characters name. When you log back into EQ, the game will update those character files. <br />
Someone please correct me if i'm wrong in this so i dont screw someones pc up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you delete those files, then you loose things like bazaar prices (for your trader), screen settings, window arrangements, hot keys, friends lists, etc..<br />
<br />
The character itself is stored on the server.<br />
<br />
(I found this out when I forgot to backup one toon's files when I reinstalled Windows)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Phirelight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I may still try that - Friends list I just copy from my main toon so thats no biggie and I dont use this toon for trading....<br />
<br />
any other suggestions :) ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">in graphics settings turn OFF texture caching... run the game exit the game... and turn it back off.  if it is off, turn it on enter the game exit turn it off exit... <br />
<br />
You do this BEFORE you connect... in the option choice there (before you even ener you password)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Phirelight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok, problem fixed :) I tried the house Ogre's suggestion first but that didn't work........so I deleted the files &amp; logged back on and it was fixed.  Thanks everyone who read my post &amp; gave suggestions!</div></div><hr />
