I don't currently have any pebbles, but will be happy to imbue all you can carry in.</div></div><hr />

I think we're having a marinated grilled chicken salad with mexicali ranch dressing for dinner tonight, so I will likely be eating in front of the computer (yay, me!)  Dinertime is a wonderful time to do imbues!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">will look for you in game Zabu for imbuing. think i got like over 100 for you to imbue. this week might be good for this since it will be a non-busy week for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>lonewylfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And if Z's too busy, we have an almost ready to go imbuer of pebbles. Think he just needs 6 more levels (which should be easy)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ilona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I can do both plains pebbles and rose quartzes as well as emeralds.<br />
<br />
I don't tend to do many for others, since I had so many to do for myself, but can do a few stacks now and again.</div></div><hr />

Lately I've been getting on earlier, say around 8:00 EDT.  Just drop em off, sit back and relax, and I'll give a call when your order is ready   :D</div></div><hr />

These days, the only time I am too busy, so are you!   :roll: <br />

Mid-20's -- two nights in Paludal Caverns oughtta do it.  I have a 23 shammy that could group with you.  One or two others, and we take a hill at B1, and listen for the dings!</div></div><hr />

I've been trying to field all the pebble requests, since those of you that can do emeralds could pretty much imbue around the clock and never get through all the requests!   ;)</div></div><hr />
