<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kieroth_whiteleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry to hear about your problems - I run a website and we get hit with this kind of stuff all the time, fortunately in this case we're way smaller so we don't have such horrid losses.<br />
<br />
If there's anything I can do to help let me know. I've got the usual collection of servers and stuff.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>vbcypher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think after we're 100% we need to consider having mirrors of the database for multiple redundencies.  And, as any good disaster planner will tell you, they must be at least 100 miles away from each other.<br />
<br />
100 mile rule is the basic concept that whatever natural / otherwise create disaster that may strike one, will most likely not hit someone more than 100 miles away.<br />
<br />
Even though my public domain sites run in WIN32 environments, i'm pretty sure I can at least hold archives on my systems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Serenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mirroring has potential for static information, would it work for a database?  If so, how big is/was the db?  I might be able to host a mirror if it's feasible to do at all.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I will not be doing full site mirrors... what I will be doing is having daily or weekly backups of the DB saved to my personal computer which is in Southern California, while the server is in Dallas Texas.<br />
<br />
So sorta a Data mirror.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I completely understand your desire to retain intellectual ownership of the database.  I know i would guard it with my life, even if it's all free...you know what i mean.<br />
<br />
I would, however, advocate at least one other location equidist from Dallas and South Cali.  Even if you just buy a little web storage space and put it out there (such as a canadian company or something).  Becomes a hassle, but if anything like this ever happened again, you'll be very happy.<br />
<br />
Of course all of this is mute, I still advocate legitation against rack-nine for negligence.  I have never heard of a hoster who didn't have nightly tape incrementals of all their servers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>vbcypher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hey, wrong location I know...but I got yer attention so I might as well ask here while you're looking.<br />
<br />
I'm making a story mod for Tradeskills, I don't know, because i like reinventing the wheel I suppose.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to make sure it was ok to use your site as my source for recipies.  That way I can get the &quot;reproduced with permission from EQTC&quot; tag at the bottom of my pages fine print.<br />
<br />
Let me know or fire me a private email.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">you can use good old SQL statements to back up the database to a txt file easily. Make a webpage only you know about and run it every few days or after large updates and save the database data and structure. Takes a bit of time and know how to set up but once its workign you can save and fully restore a database in less than 5 mins should it get deleted.</div></div><hr />
