Cuva's Guide to survivalist baking (and other tradeskills)<br />
<br />
The first point to make is this guide is not about efficiency.  I have tried trade skills with previous chars and I found the best way to raise skill was to plat farm and then buy as much of your supplies as possible.  Then, for those supplies you couldn't buy in large enough quantities level until the neccessary mobs were very green so you could massacre them in huge numbers.  The only problem I have with these two effective methods is they both bore me senseless.  This guide is solely for people who have the same problem.<br />
<br />
I wanted to start a new trade-skill orientated char from scratch and get all the needed trade skills for the Coldain Prayer Shawl and Protection of the Cabbage quests (for a minimum 5 or 6 of the PotC items anyway.) I wanted to try another method of trade-skilling other than: farm plat &gt; buy lots of stuff &gt; click combine a lot &gt; repeat, so I decided to try a &quot;follow the recipes&quot; approach at least for the early skill levels and especially for baking.  Also I did this as a goodie druid so it is a bit skewed in that direction particularly as regards zones and foraging though I hope at least some of it applies more generally.<br />
<br />
nb: I am *way* behind on expansions so there may be a lot of options I didn't even consider.<br />
<br />
I decided on a number of rules I would apply:<br />
<br />
1)  Start at level 1 and follow the recipes.<br />
2)  Get the components off xp giving mobs as much as possible.<br />
3)  If I had to get stuff off green mobs then they would be mixed in with blue mobs.<br />
4)  Buy as little as possible.<br />
5)  If buying then only buy ultra-cheap stuff.<br />
6)  Use blue recipes as much as possible, only use yellow ones when the components were common.<br />
7)  Make as much of own gear as possible.<br />
8)  Ignore the rules whenever I felt like it.<br />
<br />
Research at eqtraders gave me my first list.<br />
<br />
Baking:  Edible Goo &gt; Fire beetle eyes/rat ears, (triv 21)<br />
Brewing: Bog Juice &gt; needs snake scales, (triv 17)<br />
Smithing:  Tarnished weapons, needs rusty ones, (triv 20+)<br />
Tailoring: Silk threads and Swatchs, needs silk, (triv 15)<br />
<br />
nb: Sort the recipe lists by trivial like I didn't, that way you'll miss useful recipes less often than I did.<br />
<br />
Also I looked a short way ahead in the recipes to check what else I needed to save for later: bat wings, rat meat, rat ears, snake eggs etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuva</div><div class="date">03-19-2005, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stage 1.<br />
<br />
So the first step was to pick a newbie zone with mobs that dropped as many items on the list as possible and level on the mobs that dropped them.  (I only did the tutorial up to getting the kobold charm as I wanted to see what it was like to follow this method from level 1.)<br />
<br />
There are a number of good options for newbie trade skillers but I picked North Qeynos.  It had everything but spiderlings for the trade skills, a forge just inside the gate and rat tails to pay for the first two sets of spells.  So you pick your zone and level and instead of grumbling quietly at the crappy loot you go &quot;woot!&quot; whenever you get a snake egg or snake scale, lol.<br />
<br />
nb: Whenever I was doing this I also did whatever I could to raise merchant faction to at least indifferent as I think that is part of trade-skilling.  In North Qeynos that meant killing a few gnolls and handing in rat whiskers etc.  It didn't take much effort so I think the named gnolls that spawn outside NQ *may* have good faction hits.  Either that or wood elves start only a short way into apprehensive with the Qeynos merchants.<br />
<br />
I got into the habit of having a skill up session after I dinged each level, apart from sharpening the rusty weapons which I did whenever I got encumbered.  Over these first few levels smithing went up fast and the others nudged up steadily. I didn't think of it at the time but if I did this again I'd turn the tarnished weapons into ore for more skill ups and save any I made in the bank for later.  Also save all eggs.  <br />
<br />
nb: I never did find a reliable source for eggs and they are too useful to waste skilling up on.  Save them all until making dough is 20 or so points below your baking skill.  Eggs, along with spiderling silk, became one of my exceptions to the &quot;avoid buying&quot; rule. Rat whiskers for faction too.<br />
<br />
After some skill ups from &quot;Edible Goo&quot; I started making &quot;Rat Sandwich&quot; (triv 26) and then &quot;Rat Ear Sandwich&quot; (triv 36) as well.  Originally my plan was to stick to one recipe until they trived and save stuff for the next recipe in the bank but the bank got so full I ended up using up whatever was in a blue or yellow recipe just to clear space.<br />
<br />
nb: Use the plat from rat tails to buy lots of bags, you'll need them.<br />
<br />
You won't get much foraged stuff at the beginning but save it all for later. I also maxed fishing at each level.  I saved the fish for later and turned all the rusty daggers into ore--for later. The rat tails paid for all my spells and I had a small stash left over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuva</div><div class="date">03-19-2005, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stage 2.<br />
<br />
NQ turns mostly green around level 4 or 5 so it is time to move on to a new zone.  There were a number of options but I picked Misty Thicket because it had blue bats, rats, fire beetles and snakes for baking and brewing and spiders, spiderlings and wolves for tailoring.  It lacked rusty weapons in front of the wall but I was close to triving that already.  Basically the same as NQ with end of level trade skill sessions.  &quot;Edible Goo&quot; trived and I said goodbye to fire beetles just as they started to go green.  I carried on with the rat recipes, collected bat wings and bixie parts for later and added &quot;Wolf Sandwich&quot; (triv 31) to the current baking list.  &quot;Bog Juice&quot; trived and it was mostly goodbye to snakes except for the occasional desperate attempt to get more eggs.  I added &quot;You can never have too many eggs&quot; to my list of trade skill mottos to go alongside &quot;You can never have too many spiderling silks.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think all the spiders in Misty before the wall drop spiderling silk so I trived the silk combine quite soon and started making small tattered leather armour (triv 26) for myself from the large amount of ruined wolf skins I was getting.  (Wood elves have an advantage with the tailored stuff because they can wear both small and medium sizes.)  After &quot;Bog Juice&quot; trived I used the few berries and fruit I'd foraged to brew: &quot;Flask of Berry Juice&quot; (triv 21) and &quot;Flask of Fruit Juice&quot;, (triv 24).<br />
<br />
If I'd remembered I would have picked up the three berries that spawn in the hollow by the ruined tower and used them too.  They respawn regularly.  I would also have brewed &quot;Storm Guard Root Beer&quot; (triv 31) with the foraged roots if I'd noticed that recipe at the time.  There are no low skill recipes I know of for the large amounts of &quot;Chunks of Meat&quot; that I collected so I saved a stack (for later) and sold the rest.<br />
<br />
nb: There really should be lower skill recipes for chunks of meat. You get stacks and stacks of it.<br />
<br />
By level 8 I'd trived tattered leather and the baking recipes I'd been using so it was time to shift the wolf meat to &quot;Wolf Steaks&quot; (triv 41) and break out the stacks of stuff I'd been saving: snake meat for &quot;Snake Steaks&quot; (triv 41), bat wings for &quot;Batwing Crunchies&quot; (triv 46), bixie parts for &quot;Bixie Crunchies&quot; (triv 46).  I had so many saved bat wings that baking jumped up very nicely at this point.  I'd misread the recipe for &quot;Wooly Spider Crunchies&quot; (triv 46) and saved spiderling legs instead of spider legs otherwise it would have jumped even more as spider legs are quite common.  Apart from the one time with bixies I avoided the various cannibal type recipes.  If I'd done this with an ogre char I'd have used those more.<br />
<br />
The expensive level 9 spells were looming now so I thought it was time to play normal EQ for a bit and went and smacked the goblin warrior camp in Butcherblock until I dinged 9. (Harmony is a great spell.) The goblins kindly paid for all my level 9 spells with a nice lump left over so it was back to the hunt.  I needed brewing and smithing at around 68 to comfortably make the stuff I'd need for the various tailoring trivs coming up so I invoked Rule 8 and just raised them the store bought way: &quot;Short Beer&quot; &gt; &quot;Short Ale&quot; &gt; &quot;Ale&quot; and &quot;Skewers&quot; &gt; &quot;Scalers&quot; &gt; &quot;Lanterns&quot;.  I also at this time started Pottery and raised it to 36 making ceramic linings. I used ceramic linings because they stack and because I'd need a bunch later for making baking equipment.  It isn't the cheapest way but I was feeling rich after the goblins.<br />
<br />
At this point I'd more or less achieved my initial targets: 68 in brewing and smithing, baking and tailoring as high as they got naturally from the quantities of components I'd looted along the way and Pottery to 36.  I'd planned to play normal EQ from this point with occasional trips to get pelts for tailoring but I was quite enjoying this method so decided to carry on with it for a bit longer.<br />
<br />
I also forged a shield and mace to upgrade my uber gear (smithing trivs 68 IIRC)<br />
<br />
(I found a mistletoe cutting sickle on a merchant for 11pp shortly after this and invoked rule 8 again because they look cool.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuva</div><div class="date">03-19-2005, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stage 3:<br />
<br />
Level 9 and I wanted to get tailoring up to 36 so I needed LQ pelts for leather padding (triv 31) and silk for &quot;Raw Silk Masks&quot; (triv 36) so the next choice of zone had to have decent drops of those items from blue mobs or mixed green and blue mobs.  There were a few options and I tried a few.  I think East Commons is best for this section now.  West Karana has better pelt drops but the silk and meat are about the same and you can forage Griffon Eggs in East Commons (yield 7 dough) which is a lot more useful than it may sound.  If I did this again I'd go to EC for the raw silk tailoring triv and WK for the studded leather/reinforced leather trivials.<br />
<br />
nb:  It makes more sense to just level to the point where the Crag Spiders in EK are easily farmed and raise tailoring that way but I found this gradual method using available blue mobs more satisfying.<br />
<br />
I was mostly in WK down by the Miller farm which is pretty safe as long as you avoid the ploughed field where the scarecrows roam.  WK is actually a lot better now the lions aren't KOS and you're not blinded by constant rain.  There are giant spiders and grizzly bears to level off mixed in with lions and normal bears that were mostly green and light blue.  WK does still involve a lot of running to get there and becomes a much more appealing zone with SOW.  I leveled normally collecting pelts, silks, meat and spider legs (for later), as they dropped. The mobs drop a lot of items for Qeynos newbie armour quests too, most of which aren't no drop, so my plat stash went up ok.<br />
<br />
The end of level trade skill sessions involved &quot;Leather Padding&quot; (triv 31) and &quot;Raw Silk Masks&quot; (triv 36).  I'd made a skinning knife to reduce MQ and HQ pelts but the bears in WK drop quite a lot of LQ pelts so I saved the MQ and HQ (for later) and trived this section mostly using silk and the LQ bear.  The baking sessions involved making a &quot;Pot&quot; (smithing triv 50, from the metal bits I'd made from fished rusty daggers and my stack of ceramic linings).  I broke out all the fish I'd caught from level 1 plus all the foraged rabbit meat and vegetables and made &quot;Vegetable Soup&quot;, &quot;Fish Head Soup&quot; and &quot;Rabbit Stew&quot; (all triv 68), also &quot;Beer Braised Bear/Lion/Wolf&quot; (also all triv 68).  Baking jumped nicely again and &quot;Rabbit Stew&quot; became my standard rations as there was no other use for rabbit meat after skill 68.  I also got into the habit of buying one stack's worth each of Pottery (&quot;Small Bowl&quot;) and Smithing (&quot;Dairy Spoons&quot;) combines so those skills would nudge up a couple of points each level.  I saved one dairy spoon for later.  My head was too full of baking recipes to figure out the cheapest way to raise pottery so I broke all the rules and picked one simple to remember red recipe to save myself some brain ache.<br />
<br />
You don't get many silks off brown spiders but raw silk trived pretty quick anyway and it was time for &quot;Studded Leather&quot; (triv 56) which uses MQ cat/bear/wolf pelts.  Also I'd got past 68 in baking and collected spider legs for &quot;Candied Spider&quot; (triv 88) and the fish I caught for &quot;Fish Fillets&quot; (triv 82), foraged rabit meat became &quot;Rabbit Stew&quot; rations, roots I ate as I got them, the other foraged items were saved for later. LQ pelts became &quot;Leather Padding&quot;, HQ pelts were reduced with the skinning knife to MQ for studded leather.  It is cheaper to skill up studded leather on masks as they only take one stud but I upgraded my armour to studded first then switched to masks afterwards to finish off the triv.  I also brewed up some &quot;Heady Kiola&quot; (brewing triv 46) to make &quot;Cured Silk Masks&quot; (tailoring triv 82) from each silk swatch I collected. It would probably be better to save them till after studded was trived but I didn't care.<br />
<br />
nb: Using this method of trade-skilling I rarely targeted specific mobs for their loots, instead I killed the nearest mob but picked an area where 90% of the nearest mobs dropped stuff I could use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuva</div><div class="date">03-19-2005, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Baking was going a bit slow at this point because I'd used everything up on the triv 68 recipes without thinking what was going to bridge the gap afterwards.  I also wanted to use the meat I was getting so I invoked rule 8 again and bought a lot of spider legs off various merchants I passed on my travels to finish &quot;Candied Spider&quot; off, (1 silver each).<br />
<br />
Triving &quot;Candied Spider&quot; brought a bunch of useful recipes into blue range. It also made &quot;Filleted Bear/Lion/Wolf&quot; (triv 143) yellow.  &quot;Apricot Marmalade&quot; (triv 99) turned out to be a great skill up recipe for a forager.  The recipe takes one fruit but yields 6 &quot;Apricot Marmalade&quot; which can be combined with loaves of bread to make &quot;Marmalade Sandwich&quot; (also triv 99) so each fruit gives a possible 7 skill up attempts.  I had about 9 foraged fruit saved at this point and got a bunch of skill ups out of them.<br />
<br />
Which was nice.<br />
<br />
It was finally time to unleash all the eggs I'd been saving up to make &quot;Clump of Dough&quot; for &quot;Cookies&quot; (triv 102), followed shortly after by &quot;Brown Gravy&quot; (triv 111, using the few bear meat I'd saved) and shortly after that by &quot;Loaf of Bread&quot; (triv 115, needs Bread Tin) with the last of the dough.  All in all this was a pretty good skill up session.<br />
<br />
After this stage Bear/Lion/Wolf meat all got filleted (for later).  <br />
<br />
nb: Outside of Qeynos Hills, and to a small extent Misty Thicket, wolves are a very bad source of quality pelts and I'd started to leave them alone.  However wolf meat turned out to be very handy later on so I'd recommend still killing a few for their meat.<br />
<br />
Berries, fishing grubs and Vegetables (and fruit after apricot marmalade trived) went into brewing whenever I had a combined stack's worth of combines saved up: &quot;Red Wine (berries, triv 95), White Wine (fruit, triv 82), Fetid Essence (fishing grubs, triv 122) and &quot;Vegetable Oil&quot; (vegetables, triv 102).  Brewing rose slow and steady which was fine as I wasn't going to need to brew tempers for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuva</div><div class="date">03-19-2005, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stage 4.<br />
<br />
Around this time the existence of DoN cultural armour started to seep into my brain.  (Mainly through accidentally buying a load of &quot;Blessed Water of the Sceptic&quot; when I meant to buy water flasks and losing most of my plat stash selling it back for much less - DOH!!!!!!!!!)<br />
<br />
Anyway, research into this revealed the need for a cultural needle and sewing kit with higher smithing skill than I had planned to get at this stage.  So I wondered if the blue mob method could apply to triving banded armour.  I was leaving Pottery at 36 until the muddites were comfortably blue and they drop *some* ore as well as lots of clay, but not very much as I recalled from previous chars.  Then I remembered I'd been turning my fished rusty daggers into ore since level 1 mainly just for the sake of fitting in with my &quot;try to use everything you loot&quot; idea rather than to save money. Checking the recipes showed a lot of rusted weapons can be sharpened and then turned into &quot;Small Bricks of Ore&quot;, two small bricks turn into &quot;Sheet Metal&quot; and sheet metal turns into &quot;Banded Bracer&quot;.  I was already 68+ in smithing so I wouldn't fail too often in the sharpening and converting so I decided to try and farm my smithing skill ups off blue mobs too.  I think I was level 11 at this point and there are swarms of possible places to get rusty weapons off blue mobs at that level so take your pick.  I chose the towering brute camp in Butcherblock because a) they always seem to drop two rusty long swords, b) I killed a few spiders, greenbloods and goblins traveling to the brute camp and back, c) I like fighting Ogres cos the luclin model ogres look great imo. <br />
<br />
Oh yes, and d) foragers can also get &quot;Aviak Eggs&quot; in Butcherblock.<br />
<br />
nb: Did I mention you can never have too many eggs?<br />
<br />
I bumped smithing up to 74 on dairy spoons with the cheap metal bits and decided to split my levelling in two, half the time getting rusty weapons, half the time getting silk (as I'd trived studded leather).  I'd get meat for baking by killing animals during the silk hunting time and brewing was all foraged stuff anyway at this point.<br />
<br />
Mostly kitted out in studded leather by now, apart from the bearhide quest armour from the millers in Qeynos Hills, I could melee the blue and even brutes comfortably, the yellow ones I kited a bit first.  When I could barely walk from the weight of the swords I'd gate back to PoK and turn the swords into &quot;Tarnished Long Swords&quot; (triv 26), then convert them to &quot;Small Bricks of Ore&quot; (triv 21), then convert two small bricks into &quot;Sheet Metal&quot; (triv 31).  When I had a stack of sheet metal in the bank I made &quot;Banded Bracer&quot; (triv 95).  Free smithing, at least for a while, as I didn't fail often on all these conversions with a skill of 74+.<br />
<br />
nb: Yes of course it would be a lot quicker to just kill loads of Butcherblock goblins and buy the sheet metal but that's not the point :)<br />
<br />
nb: Carry lots of sharpening stones and flasks of water at all times if doing this as you pick up rusty weapons all the time at these levels e.g I went to Crushbone at one point to collect belts to raise faction in Kaladim and to get the drops for the wood elf DoN book.  The reward for the belts often includes rusty weapons which I'd forgotten since with previous chars I just sold them straight away as junk.  There is a forge just opposite the Kaladim warrior guild.<br />
<br />
This carried on till level 14, half a level in Butcherblock getting ore, half a level in EC or WK getting silk/meat/pelts. During this stage tailoring nudged up steadily with &quot;Cured Silk&quot; and the occasional bit of &quot;Reinforced Leather&quot; when I had a lot of HQ pelts.  My collection of leather padding grew (save it for smithing Plate armour, you'll need a lot), as did my collection of filleted Bear/Lion/Wolf (saved for later).  Smithing bumped up steadily too and I levelled fast enough, at least for my taste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuva</div><div class="date">03-19-2005, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I seemed to have collected quite a lot of plat (for me) without actually trying so the level 14 spells all got bought with a lump left over.  Smithing was around 100 now and needing two sheets of metal for helms so the ore collecting was getting a bit slow.  SOW made WK more appealing but I was still on &quot;Cured Silk&quot; so I wondered if there was a better source of blue mob silk anywhere.  Generally in EQ it seems red-back spiders (of various names) drop more silk (and have nastier poisons) and I remembered two spots that had them around this level, Erud's Crossing and Upper Guk.  So off I went.<br />
<br />
If you're not KOS to the frog folks then you can move around Upper Guk without any problems and there's an area in Upper Guk with about ten red-back spiders split across various chambers. I could break the furthest two-spawn with the highly technical &quot;root one and desperately try to kill the other before root breaks&quot; method.  They were definitely a bit of a handful.  Cure poison spell helps a bit--for the nanosecond it takes before they poison you again.  Take lots of bandages unless you're a chanter in which case take lots of tiny daggers.  Apart from the close calls breaking the spawn when I logged in it was okay.  They resisted root a lot so I didn't risk trying the three spawn in the next chamber and filled the time waiting for respawn by killing the nearby crocs.  These drop &quot;Gator Meat&quot; which have a few recipes my brain couldn't handle at this time and chunks of meat which I saved for &quot;Meat-Filled Pie&quot; (triv 142) for when I had some eggs.  I'd hoped the crocs might drop some alligator eggs too but they didn't.  The silk came pretty fast as sometimes the spiders would drop 4 at a time and the xp was very fast for me.  I dinged pronto with a stack of swatchs to combine.<br />
<br />
nb: Anyone who says I lost level soon after through attacking Nillipus by the lake in Rivervale when I was unbuffed and armed only with a fishing pole is lying *cough*<br />
<br />
I got withdrawal symptoms because I had very little to combine except the silk so I bought more pottery stuff than usual to make up for it.<br />
<br />
Despite being a one-skill spot, Guk was such a good source of combined xp and supplies I went straight back.  It was as good as before except the three-spawn kept tempting me to leave the crocs and come after them when I'd finished off the two-spawn.  This ended badly...a few times.  Knowing I wasn't going to be able to resist the temptation despite likely death I moved on after I had 30 swatchs worth of silk off the two-spawn and went to finish the level off in the druid friendly outdoors.  <br />
<br />
At this level Upper Guk is definitely a good spot for a less greedy blue mob tailor than me and would be a *great* spot for a class with indoor pacify spells as soon as they could beat a single spider.<br />
<br />
nb: There is at least one other place with spiders in Upper Guk too and no I didn't find out blindly snare-kiting three spiders through the tunnels of Guk without a map and running slap into a chamber with three more *cough*<br />
<br />
nb: The crocs aren't social so you can fight one right next to another without it adding.<br />
<br />
nb: The mobs in this spot run in the direction of the frogs which is great if you're not a dark elf hehe.<br />
<br />
I was going to go finish the level in Erud's crossing to see what those spiders were like as silk suppliers but I went to combine the swatchs first and got big big love from the RNG and nearly trived cured silk. As I wanted to move on to the armour I could wear I was well pleased and I left Erud's for another char, another time.<br />
<br />
So I finished the level in the karanas instead getting the usual: lions for HQ and MQ pelts and meat, bears for LQ and occasional HQ pelts and meat, wolves now only for their meat, spiders for silk.  Carrion spiders in East Karana seem to drop more silk than other brown spiders.  Chasm crawlers drop as few eggs as every other snake so far.<br />
<br />
nb: The reason wolf meat is good is that the filleted lion and bear recipes yield 1 and the filleted wolf yields 10.  The next recipes I had in mind were the &quot;Bear/Lion/Wolf in Cream Sauce&quot; (triv 152) which use the filleted meats as ingredients.  So wolf meat equals more skill ups. The &quot;Creamy Fennel Sauce&quot; which is the other ingredient is very expensive to make but the final product sells for a good price to merchants so worth the expense I think.<br />
<br />
After the end of level trade-skill session I was pretty much where I wanted to be.  Baking was 130 ish and would be close to my target of 152 from meat by the time I'd got enough HQ pelts to triv reinforced leather (triv 108) and tailored quivers (triv 115).  Smithing was close to 115 which is where I planned to leave it for a while.  Brewing was bumping along on the foraged items and that just left pottery to bring up to an okay level for the Prayer Shawl. I tend to do trade-skills in bursts and I was going to leave it there and go do other stuff for a bit then every time I dinged I planned a trip to the karanas followed by a smack a muddite session for clay followed by a skill up session.  <br />
<br />
So that's it basically.  Which is good considering how long this has got.<br />
<br />
In all I found the baking part of this enjoyable and combining baking with tailoring eased the inevitable grind of farming tailoring supplies a bit. As did getting xp off the animals while I farmed their pelts.<br />
<br />
I did this with 110 wis.  It is definitely true that high wis/int helps skilling up a lot and I've played chars where I wouldn't touch a combine button until wis was at least 150 however I think sticking to blue recipes helps as much as high wis *as long as* your supplies are cheap and common.  When you get to a point where supplies are rare and/or expensive then don't cause yourself unneccessary pain by trying to get skill ups with low stats.  Doing lots of combines with lots of different recipes helps too.  It doesn't help the rate of skill ups but you'll be so dazed by the number of recipes you won't notice if the RNG is in a spiteful mood.<br />
<br />
Last word for anyone reading this who is new to EQ or trade skills.  This *isn't* the most time-efficient method just something I found quite enjoyable so I thought I'd write about it.<br />
<br />
Actual last word is...<br />
<br />
eggs.<br />

I was wondering though, is there any way to improve fletching self-subsistently? (or at least partially so) Can you whittle any fletchings or vanes, like you have to for some cultural? I know I can make arrowheads, but is that all. And bows too. Can any staffs or strings be found in the wild? (other than nightmarewood, stonewood etc. hehehe).<br />
<br />
I'm going to do some research and see what I can come up with. I'm also going to see if anyone can manage some jewellery skillups using only looted gems (we'll have to buy the bars).</div></div><hr />

Now if only I had realized back in my days before EQTraders that banded comes from rusty daggers........ lot of em.... but back when I did banded it was uber... or at least desirable....<br />

D'oh!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did about the same thing back in the day, but it was with my first (and still main) character.  It wasn't a statement or anything, just seemed like the way to play the game to me.   I didn't have a regular group of people to keep up in level with (or to twink me) so I just did my own slow thing.  I probably bought about twice the amount of stuff you say you did, especially for low -level pottery and banded in smithing.<br />
<br />
As a Paladin in 2000 I wasn't able to solo an even con by the time I was 10th level, so my mob curve was a few levels behind yours, but all the places are the same.  I started smithing when I was 7th level.  I remember seeing molds for sale on vendors.  I bought a couple even though I had no idea what they were for.  A lot of searching later turned up the books on how to do basic smithing combines and I was hooked. <br />
<br />
Spiders everywhere!  I still cannot pass a spiderling without killing it!<br />
Pelt bearing animals everywhere!  I also still kill any animal that can drop a quality pelt, even though I haven't used a leather padding in a long time.<br />
Roaming EC and WC for spiderlings and feeling uber when I could tackle all of the lions/bears/wolves on my own.<br />
Spiders in Guk, and EK.  <br />
I remember thinking EK was the best zone ever because I could get silks for tailoring,  pelts for smithing, and experience at the same time.<br />
<br />
My smithing has always been ahead of my tailoring, so when I was just able to solo in EK  I was already making fine plate (lowest trivial for plate was the 202 bracers back then) so I didn't use any pelts for tailoring until after my cured silk was triv.  And then only a few, pelts were precious.  I remember actually buying a few pelts from a player.  I though I was overpaying a lot when I gave him 60pp for a stack of leather padding.  <br />
<br />
I farmed a LOT of my own padding, and vendor dived for pelts and spiderling silks regularly too.  Everfrost was a good place for silks and pelts back then, but since it was all green to me I didn't like to hunt there much.  <br />
<br />
I was able to sell banded and fine plate for a good profit back then, which also helped me buy stuff to cover the cost of MQ ore and to skill up pottery and brewing.  Baking was a pastime for me.  I carried a spit with me all the time and enjoyed cooking what I killed.<br />
<br />
By the time EK greened out on me I had established myself as a profitable smith and mostly left the realm of sustenance tradeskills.  But those are still some of my fondest EQ memories.<br />

This gave me an idea for helping my son learn more about the game he has started playing as a Vah Shir BL. Between this style and the Vah Shir quests, I think we're gonna make him a tradeskilling fiend.. Like mama like son heheheheh. :D  :p  ;)</div></div><hr />
