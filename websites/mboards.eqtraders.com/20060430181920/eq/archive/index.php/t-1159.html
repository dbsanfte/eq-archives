<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brildayr</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was at 182 did a stack of combines (fine plate) and got one skillup which put me at 183.  I then did 1 3/4 stacks and got ZERO skillups.  My str was at 255, int 149, wis 133.  Is this normal ?  Did the RNG get me ?  Should I worry about any other stat ? ( although verant says your highest int, wis, or str is counted for smithing)<br />
<br />
Could use some examples of skillups from other people around this skill level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fallwell</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't be too concerned.  You will go through many periods where the RNG will bite you, but it will even out with many single digit combines/skillups.  I noticed a significant skillup decline beginning in the 180s with 255wis and 180+ strength.  You are now entering what appears to be the dog-days of smithing, but be patient and you'll get through it.  You may even go through a few 100+ dry spells before it's all said and done.<br />
<br />
btw, I've recently gone through a streak like this at 218<br />
213......14 combines<br />
214.....108 combines<br />
215......8 combines<br />
216......12 combines<br />
217......63 combines<br />
218......2 combines<br />
<br />
The 108 and 63 are the longest runs w/o skilling up for me so far.  While i've seen much nastier ones out there on these boards.  So even though I curse the hammer, I'm a little thankful at the same time.<br />
