<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bellandra</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is just about the least expensive way to get very high brewing....  Boost your Int/Wis to as high as you can(Kei is great even for Melee class). Its a good idea to get as MUCH inventory room as you can(Hand-Made Backpacks--10 slot 10% weight reduction Great for the up and coming tradeskiller) Head to the Plane of knowledge and buy Fishing grubs from Caden Zharik (-344, 756) then locate Vuli Ironstove (-20, 249) and buy Water Flasks.  You will be making Fetid essence 1 Fishing Grub and 1 Flask of Water in a brewing barrel. This is trivial at 122<br />
<br />
You will now need to go hunt Cyclops to get a Cyclops Skull or buy one in the bazaar. Then go to almost any vendor who sells drinks (Swin Blackeye in W.freeport or  Tenso H'Rugla &amp; Rista S'Ion in Neriak commons) and buy TONS of Short beer(you will see why). Then go to The Plane of knowledge and find Culkin Ironstove (-104, 271) from him buy vinegar and Spices. In you favorite brew barrel combine 1 Vinegar, 1 Spice, 1 Short beer and your cyclops skull to make Skull Ale which is trivial at  151. <br />
<br />
I like the above track because you don't have to buy any bottles or casts.<br />
<br />
Now on to Minotaur Hero's Brew. Visit Basur TuQual (107, 259)  and buy Malt and Yeast  then go around the corner and get some Flasks of water. Sirekoth Eshe (103, 280) will have the casks you need.  In a brew barrel put 3 malts, 1 yeast, 2 flasks of water, and 2 short beers. If you fail you get 1 cask and 2 empty bottles.. if you succeed you will get you 1 brew and 2 empty bottle.. This is trivial at 248.<br />

<br />
Please don't take offense to this, as it is clear you spent some time on that...<br />
<br />
Just that a few paragraphs of very commonly known information isn't really a &quot;guide&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also I don't think you should switch to Mino at 151, it is something you have to make thousands of and will hate with a passion... I'd do Fadwer Shakers til the 180's, then switch.  You'll still be sick of Mino, but you wont be ready to kill the Mino Hero 1000 times just for spite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bellandra</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">:oops:  Well..... I was going for short acutally. I think sometime people just go on and on when they really dont need to. And when it comes to brewing there is really not ALOT one can say.<br />
<br />
You are probably right about the mino brew. I was thinking that 151 was a bit early to be jumping to Mino but that is what I was told to do by the person teaching me.</div></div><hr />
