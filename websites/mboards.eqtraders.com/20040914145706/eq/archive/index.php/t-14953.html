<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>badlucas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My Enchanter on Stromm recently combined for the paralyzing earth spell using the Wisdom caster recipie:<br />
<br />
flake of lodestone<br />
rune of opposition<br />
rune of incitation<br />
<br />
along with the requisite quill and parchment.  It was successful, but i noticed the spell had one difference from what is listed in the recipie database.  The resulting spell was usable by Cleric, Shaman and Wizard.  The recipie shows that the spell is supposed to be useable by Cleric, Shaman, and Necromancer.<br />
<br />
I did look through some of the old posts before posting this.  There seems to have been much discussion about cross caster use on researched spells but there have been many patches since some of those postings.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if different casters get slightly different results on who can use it?  So, Wizards, Mages, and Necro's...try the recipie and let's compare results.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
