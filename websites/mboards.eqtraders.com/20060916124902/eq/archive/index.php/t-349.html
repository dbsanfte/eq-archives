Basically I want to know an estimated number of heady kiola's and vials I will need so that I can have them all made in advance.<br />

I remember when I did it long ago it was about 1 point in 20-30 combines at that level but I had 230 or higher wisdom at the time.</div></div><hr />

With 255 INT I was able to get 9 skillups with 33 combines (162 to 171) during my last tailoring run.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EQPlayer</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow thanks for all the advice, my Intelligence is 240 currently.<br />
<br />
I think I'll just gather enough for 40 or 60 attempts then go from there.  Will let you know how many it takes, I haven't seen it posted anywhere since most posts regarding skill ups only address 158 and up.  Only part I really don't look forward to is Vials, but I have c2 now so it shouldn't be too bad.<br />
<br />
Regarding 158+ I've seen posts saying Solstice robes were horrible for skill ups and others saying they weren't bad at all, anyone here used them solely for 158 to 200 range?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Woodeckt</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I have almost exculsivley used the robes to skill past 158 with a few cultural and others thrown in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
19 successes and 5 skill-ups, so now I'm at 148.  (/sigh)  I want my SHAWL!!! (failed 6th so far 2ce -- took me 3 attempts at 5th when skill was lower)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mochaboy</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">187 combines to go from 131 to 158 at 255 wisdom *with* a geerlok equipped.  However I have a dwarf cleric friend that did 131 to 158 in 84 combines at 263wis w/ geerlok.  Seems luck played a factor in this as my combines were on the high side.<br />
<br />
Also as a side note.  At 158+5% I successfully made 14 of 16 soft fur paddings, plus got 3 skill points in the process.</div></div><hr />

Currently working on collecting silks/kiolas/Vials for the final run up to 158 and I am assuming I will need at least twice as many for final nine points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only reason I remembered this was I made 200 vials is mana before doing this and had 47 left.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So 1 for 3 for me at 218int on the nose.<br />
<br />
I expect the next 23 to take more, so I plan on buying 5 stacks of mana when I get the money.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't take me to 158, then I'll switch early to hoppers and stop bothering my guild enchanter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
60 Combines with mask: 3 skill ups  :( , skill 118<br />
85 Combines with mask, 15 with mantle: 18 skill ups  :) , skill 136<br />
115 combines with mantle, 45 combines with sleeves: 12 skill ups, skill 148<br />
22 combines with sleeves, 24 combines with tunic: 10 skill ups, skill 158<br />
<br />
So a total of 266 combines, all with WIS at about 140-ish, or about 221 combines for 135-158... guess I had worser luck than most</div></div><hr />

Wu blows, bites, sux :(<br />
I have a skill of 137 I went through 2 stacks of heady kiola with a wis of 158 and I'm ready to shoot myself :(<br />
goto WC buy 6-8 stacks of kiola sap, gate to pot buy stacks of bottes and water flasks and sit and combine to make heady kiola :(<br />
things that gets me is that you make a stack of heady kiola that enough for 5 combines of Wu :(<br />
wish they would make the yield higher for heady kiola.  well getting close to running out of vials soo I must found a nice chanter to combine for me :)<br />
once I trival on Wu I will absolute refuse to make another heady kiola <br />
oh yeah I went from a skill of 132 to 137<br />
someone shoot me please, this has to get better <br />
best laloin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pockets FullOfGold</div><div class="date">01-09-2003, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, it's really tough to go through Wu's when it requires so many Heady Kiola's.  But I found it harder to farm the Silks.  I was so happy to have trivialed my last Wu's piece and screamed that I didn't need to farm Spidder Silks anymore  :P <br />
<br />
It's a tough road to hoe and it'll get even harder, unless you decide to buy everything in the Bazaar for their outrageous prices.  I've seen people seeling Heady Kiola's in the Bazaar for 5 PP each.  Glad I do my own brewing  :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harliquinn</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've gotten tailoring up to 158-162 with two characters now, a druid and bard. I found the bard was much easier in gathering materials than the druid. Tailoring up to 158 didn't seem nearly as painful the 2nd time around. There was of course massive farming of silks, crystal silks, etc. But being able to AoE with no mana really helped a lot in Crystal Caverns and in Eastern Karanas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korman</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No exact data here, but I know it was less than 90 attempts!  I did my run from 131 to 158 in less than an hour.  I spent much more time making 400 Heady Kiolas (2 10-slot backpacks full)!  I finished with appox. 50 HKs left (2 full stacks and a bit more), roughly 350/4 = 87.5.  So somewhere between 85 and 90 attempts to get from 131 to 158!  oh, and Wisdom was at 240.<br />
<br />
I was shocked that it was so quick!  the hard part was making the kiolas!  Ever since the patch, the skill-ups are much quicker.  I feel for all the old-school tailors now!  We have it MUCH easier!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eumerin</div><div class="date">01-13-2003, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just started on Wu's.<br />
15 combines the other night with 5 skill-ups.  I count myself very lucky in that regard.<br />
Problem right now is running after that lousy Kiola sap.  I don't understand why it isn't sold in PoK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username"></div><div class="date">01-13-2003, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 146 tailoring from Wu's... having trouble finding silk... don't like farming too terribly much.<br />
<br />
Started Wu's at 115 from Quivers, so 31 pts in, and roughly 100 combines.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also somehow my Kiola's keep ending up on my trader at 4pp each, and selling like hotcakes.<br />
<br />
Make more doing that than I can on the darn Wu's, hehe</div></div><hr />
