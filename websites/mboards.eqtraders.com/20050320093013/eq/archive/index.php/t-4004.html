<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EnfinitiStarr8</div><div class="date">02-19-2003, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone can play on test, you have to log into it from your EQ Directory files, I forget just how to but it's not that hard. I remember doing it to check out the new Jagged Pine zone when it went up on it.  :D  Hope it helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cubwynn</div><div class="date">02-19-2003, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a warning about playing on Test... it goes down without notice, there is no GM support, and you have to repatch daily (and also if you go back to a live server).<br />
<br />
Other than that, it's a quiet environment, and most people I've met there have been extremely friendly and helpful. The economy is a little wacky, and it can be a little lonely in some areas. If I ever tire of server and guild drama, I'll spend my time fully on the Test server before thinking of quitting EQ altogether. *ahhh peace and quiet*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gillin Whisperfoot</div><div class="date">02-21-2003, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, if you have the space on your hard drive and go over to test often enough, I would suggest copying your live EQ directory into another directory and keep your test and live configurations seperate. I switch between test and live often and don't have to worry about a huge download going from one to the other all the time that way.<br />
<br />
And I just want to reiterate the point about no GM support on test... When you are sitting on a dock and you go afk and come back to find yourself drowning underwater and a nearby necro locates your corpse OUTSIDE of the zone... you can kiss your equipment goodbye.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, people on test are generally very friendly and will respond well to maturity. For example, said necro (high level fellow) gave me a little money to get myself started again when he discovered I was out of luck. I never asked for anything other than some help to find my corpse, respectfully of course.<br />
<br />
Test is truly a refreshing environment.</div></div><hr />
