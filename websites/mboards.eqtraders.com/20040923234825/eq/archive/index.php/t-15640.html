Noise is just projecting.  Everyone thinks he's female so he's returning the favor to you.<br />
<br />
And Sanna, you're not that clueless.  Mostly.  Ok, except for that.</div></div><hr />

Many apologies.<br />

I wonder why Lothay locked it.    I made sure to clarify that I meant the post in a lighthearted manner, and wasn't actually trying to insult you.<br />

/boggle.   No PM from Him, either.  Weird.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cantatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I hate to put words into Lothay's mouth, but it was moved because it was questionable.  That's not to say you did anything wrong, but Lothay just wasn't sure it should've remained open, and it was copied to the Moderator's Corner for discussion.  <br />
<br />
I'm sure if it is decided to remained locked, you'll get a PM from either Lothay or Niami explaining why it was.  Regardless, in the future if you have a question about something a moderator did, PMing that particular moderator or Verdandi, Niami or Ngreth is the best way to get your answer.  We really hate having to drag moderator discussions into the public if we can avoid it.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't it take two to make a discussion public? I've seen &quot;check your inbox&quot; in this whole situation at least once already. (Edit: And on checking the thread again, I see a lovely explanation from the Bear-In-Chief.)<br />
<br />
And second-- I for one appreciate seeing the reasons why things are locked or left open with a warning-- for the same reason I appreciate seeing the rules of the board posted. I want to know what kind of interpretation is being put on those rules so I can choose my post content appropriately.<br />
<br />
Yes, I'm well aware that the only real rule is &quot;Whatever Denmother and House Ogre say, goes&quot; with a side of &quot;And same for the moderators they picked, within reason.&quot; But seeing your and their thought processes makes that appear a lot less of an arbitrary decision.<br />
<br />
I'm half-tempted to suspect that Lilosh's post was only locked because of the *hug* used in it, since that's obvious proof that someone else was using his posting account.  ;)<br />

<br />
Because it usually leads to poinless arguments that we have to end with &quot;because we said so&quot; and often someone comparing us to a certain world war 2 dictatorship.<br />
<br />
Also... some of our moderators are not on 24 hours... meaning that &quot;why&quot; can hang out there for quite a while... inviting other complaining posts that just are not needed.<br />
<br />
If *After* the conversation is had, the moderator in question wants to point out why a decision is made, that moderator is free to post an explanation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cantatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Doesn't it take two to make a discussion public?<br />
<br />
Different moderators do things different ways.  My general philosophy is that if someone publically questions a moderator decision, it has to be dealt with in public.  My main reasoning is that it lets others who post here know that an issue is being dealt with and that we aren't ignoring a person.  I suppose it's also a good way of reinforcing the rules once again and leaving the posters with no question of why a certain action was taken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I never meant to drag it into &quot;Public&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
I just commented here that I was unsure as to what was going on.   I then went over to the Denmum's corner, and politely asked why it was locked.<br />
<br />
Dandi explained to me, In PM, why it was, and she was very cool about the whole thing.   I'm not happy with the ultimate outcome, but I totally understand why it has to be this way.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm just pouting that my joke got no love.  :-(<br />

Hahahahaha. Knowing Kiz, that's the point.  <br />

Lilosh gets no love, because Lilosh gives no love. Or if he does, it only lasts three minutes.... <br />
