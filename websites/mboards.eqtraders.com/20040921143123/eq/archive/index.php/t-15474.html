Straight answer: only if you farm everything yourself.<br />
<br />
Seriously, go fishing in Abysmal, turn all the saltwater tuna into 1-pounders (stick one in a mixing bowl and hit combine, seems to be no-fail *shrug*).  Get a goodly supply of algae spice and kelp garnish (7 cp each) from Cobalt Scar.  Make a goodly supply of butter (you need a dairy spoon, but butter only costs just over 2pp a stack to make).  Sit between the two baking vendors in PoK with a spit, buy bread and lettuce and make spicy tuna salad sandwiches.  Triv 202, I think.<br />
<br />
I don't think it cost me more than 75pp to get from 191 to 199, and that included paying the wizard for the TL to Cobalt Scar.</div></div><hr />

Hehe, forgive us for being so dramatic. =)<br />
<br />
Tailoring and smithing are without a doubt the hardest, longest and most expensive skills to master; many will say tailoring is the harder of the two (and I would be one of those).<br />
<br />
So for those who have experience grand mastering many or all the skills, baking, while it may have it's hell levels, is far easier in comparision to tailoring.<br />
<br />
600pp spent in a day for components with no skill ups sucks. But back in the day when I was rich and impatient with tailoring, I'd spend 45,000pp in a day for components just for a good run of pre-combines and not think a thing about it.<br />
<br />
Baking and brewing are, for certain, much easier for foragers, but in general, are still easier and less expensive than tailoring and smithing. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>MissV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Veggies and fruit are fairly cheap in the bazaar, about 5pp per stack.<br />
<br />
HA!! I wish!! Veggies go for 15-20pp PER VEGGIE on my server! That's right, 300-600pp a stack!<br />
<br />
Nobody can come here and say &quot;just buy &lt;insert low end forage/drop/subcombine&gt; in the bazaar...&quot; because the low-end drops/subcombines is where all the fluctuation is from server to server. It's worth checking out your local bazaar to see if it's affordable but never assume it is when recommending recipes to fellow tradeskillers please.... it causes unncessary sighs and roll of the eyes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nhin Impious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Nobody can come here and say &quot;just buy &lt;insert low end forage/drop/subcombine&gt; in the bazaar...&quot; because the low-end drops/subcombines is where all the fluctuation is from server to server.

<br />
So, you want I or someone else should come to YOUR server and check prices before daring to give a suggestion? OK, here's my suggestion.  If something is cheap buy it; if it's not, don't complain about it uselessly, SELL it.  I tell you if veggies went for 15-20pp on Tarew, I'd be selling those babies like hotcakes and skilling up on HMPs or griffon melts or something.<br />
<br />
As it is, I got a boatload of veggies for 2pp each and I'm picnicing myself to tears. My baking hit 231 last night-- it's much easier this time around than when I GMed it on Nhinx on Vallon, because of the new UI and because I'm playing a foraging class also, race relations are better, and there are far more tradeskillers who see the use of components and actually sell them.<br />

<br />
If you think that's a lot of cash, consider not tradeskilling.  Single smithing and tailoring *combines* cost in that range post 200 and you get 200 combines from a stack of veggies, not 1.<br />
<br />
Personally, I skilled up on PoP combines rather than de-mothball my ranger to forage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a 1750 tradeskiller, I'd say that baking is the third hardest for skillups... however, tailoring and smithing are much, much worse than baking.<br />
<br />
Go for the tried and true Misty Thicket Picnics for baking skillups... or Halas meat pies. Foraging in PoJ for justice fruit (I forget the new name) and making fruit pies is also fairly easy.<br />

As yet another GM Baker who is a non-foraging class, I say simply, make due. You don't want to buy vegetables and fruit like I did? Use PoP meats, JP meats, HMPs, etc. Make a druid/ranger or a foraging race and getg your own. There are plenty of ways to GM Baking without foraging. I GM'd Baking first along with hitting 200 Brewing, and those gave me the initial income I needed to raise my other skills. Some tradeskills make money with certain products. And no, I'm not telling what they are. :)<br />

anyway... I have to agree with what most are saying. It'll take a while, but be patient and it'll all work out.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Velorek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Beer-Battered Tuna Rolls. Can start at 191 and up to 207.<br />
<br />
Fish for Saltwater Tuna and combine them in a mixing bowl to put them into 1lb stacks. Then combine those again in the bowl to make them into Tuna Meat.<br />
<br />
Then head upstairs on the Abysmal Sea boat to the back where the Baking and Brewing vendors are. From the Bakers, buy Cups of Sugar, Cups of Flour, Ground Pepper and Vinegar. From the Brewer, buy Red Wine and Short Beers. Combine those 6 in the Brew Barrel (trivial at 87 I believe) to make Beer-Based Batter.<br />
<br />
Then combine 1 Tuna Meat with 1 Batter in your bowl to make Beer-Battered Tuna Meat. Combine that with a Bat Wing (sold directly beneath you from a General Supplies vendor across from the bank) in a spit to make the end result.<br />
<br />
It's a few sub-combines but everything you need is right there and very easily accessible. The only farming that is needed is for the fish and you may be able to even skirt around that some if other fishers have sold their catches to surrounding NPC vendors.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">191+ in BAKING??! Sorry, had to read the thread to make sure I read it correctly.  MTPs are not expensive at all, and you will make a killing paying even 50pp a piece for those veggies with the minimal successes you will get leveling on them.  I chose not to make MTPs till 205 skill or so, but you can do just fine.  If the cost bothers you on the veggies, try making Halas Meat pies, all the ingredients with the exception of the two vendor bought ingredients (the fennel for the cream, and the sage leaf per combine,) all either farmed, or bought for less than 5gp each, and this assumes you negative charisma.  Halas pies sell well, and you should be able to have quite good successes with them at 191, probably 80% or better.  <br />
<br />
As a small suggestion, it sounds like your server has a rather fun economy, I suggest if you are low on cash, go to your random X newb zone and kill spiders for silk, if people are paying 300pp per stack for veggies, I'll bet good plat that your server has a wacky silk market =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Or...as the beautiful person behind me (watching me type) suggested, created a ranger (wood elf preferred), level him to level 5, and hit forage the whole time and don't eat anything, you should end up with a fair amount of fruit/veggies despite the low successes in foraging, and you may have yourself someone who can become a career bazaar price gouger, as foraged goods can rake in some money if you are patient.</div></div><hr />

Many started tradeskilling a long time ago for fun rather than the rewards. I remember my level 25 druid that discovered tradeskilling and I thought the price of each mandrake root for MTPs was going to kill me!  A bit of humility would do us all a bit of good, and baking will be a fine way to raise your money for other skills.  I financed my first couple kpp on Fish Rolls.  It was hard work, probably inefficient, but it worked and now I am a GM smith.  Keep trying and don't let people get you down too much.<br />

Humility? What, pointing out that &quot;components for the stuff you need to GM something may be expensive&quot; is arrogant?  I'm...astounded. But then again, someone who refers to those who achieved level 65 and a decent amount of plat in the bank as being &quot;able to have a lot of money&quot;... that wording rather suggests that you're missing the point here somewhere. We're &quot;able to have&quot; anything we want to put in the time, effort, brains, and a bit of luck for.  We all may have to, at times, STOP tradeskilling and go do something to get some more money to tradeskill some more.  This idea is pretty common in real life, too, among artists of all sorts, and is usually referred to as &quot;the day job.&quot; <br />

As much as I hate Halas Meat Pies, I did them for a bit because I could hunt and buy everything I needed relatively cheaply, and at the time I could make a profit. The same goes for Grobb Liquid Meat. By keeping a fairly steady stream of income, low as it may have been, and reinvesting the profits back into tradeskills, I managed to raise them all to a fairly decent level. Oh, and I'm 54. I started this when I was in my 30s, and had GM'd baking in my 40s. Baking isn't expensive, it just takes time. <br />

I don't think warning her that tradeskills are expensive is arrogant, but suggesting that she should stop tradeskilling because the thought of 600pp is expensive is.<br />
<br />
Many of us GMed skills early in our careers, but the fact is that now it is easy to buy up a tradeskill, so for those that may have had the ease of tradeskilling in the later game for quest or whatever other reason prompted them to, should realize that many players play the game for the RPG aspect and not just for as an XP grind.  <br />

No, not everyone who is 65 has a &quot;Summon: Cash&quot; spell, but that doesn't negate the fact that it is easier to get money through XPing at 65.  Even a warrior can go solo Hill Giants at 65, something not every mid 40's toon can do.

We all KNOW tradeskill is expensive.  We are still in it because we KNEW what we are getting into.  That's why we don't come to Primal Scream to RANT about it.  It is arrogant to tell someone who think tradeskill is expensive should stop.  It is NOT arrogant to tell someone RANTING who think tradeskill is expensive should stop.<br />

<br />
Is there something wrong, to you, with the idea that HIGH END tradeskills (i.e. the stuff that you do to Grandmaster the skill) may cost more than some people have?  No one was saying &quot;stop tradeskills forever&quot; but simply-- go earn some money! Then go on!<br />
<br />
I know it obviously really hurts you in some way, but the TRUTH is that sometimes when you have a lot of stuff in the bank, you get to do what you want, and when you don't have a lot of stuff in the bank, you have to work hard before you get to do what you want.<br />
<br />
And for someone who seems to be awfully hung up on &quot;arrogance&quot; you make some mighty stabbing comments about high-end players not RPing, which I really think you ought to reconsider. <br />
