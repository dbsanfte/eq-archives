<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drubear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After doing a stack of Wu's sleeves, I figgered I'd see what their Tribute point value was to decide if I should sell the things or turn them in.<br />
<br />
As it happened, I got 6p from a vendor but 18tp (tribute points) for turning it in. Guess what I did!<br />
<br />
So, is there any thought to add Tribute Point value to the databases here? I think someone mentioned that Lucy was collecting it, so maybe it's not really worth the effort here... ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NobbinTook</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm actually glad you brought this up. It reminded me to share this tip with tailors.<br />
<br />
I am working towards 250. I'm at 199 right now.  I've been switching from Solstice Robes (so my Tunarian Priest Guild Members can get a break) to Reinforced Acrylia armor.  I figured I could make back some money on my purchases that way.<br />
<br />
Some of the pieces seem to get snapped up by the new Zerkers who can wear them. But I can't figure out which pieces they like and which ones they don't.<br />
<br />
So I decided to test out the new tribute system by turning in some reinforced acrylia pieces.  I was amazed at the following:<br />
<br />
1 Boning Pieces (Bracer, Mask) = 24 Tribute Points<br />
2 Boning Pieces (Cloak)=**800** tribute points.<br />
<br />
It only costs about 50-100pp to get an extra boning, but it gives you about 40x the value in Tribute points. So if you don't want to just throw stuff back to vendors (which I hate doing), you should consider making cloaks for an extra 100pp and get all the Tribute points!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Britneyy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would say if it does get added give it atlest 2-3 more months for them to chance some of the values as noted the 800 value cloak probably will get nerf'd, depending on when u checkdd that it might already be. Otherwise im sure there are still quite a few items they need to fix out there or rebalance to make it more `fair` on trib points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I doubt we're going to add the tribute values any time soon, if at all.  That will be a call for our data entry volunteers, but not for a bit. We'd definitely need to wait for a while to make sure the values have been tweaked as much as they are going to be.<br />
<br />
No promises.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqNichola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lucy (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/) has started collecting tribute values (automatically collected by their item collector), so you can always go there and check. Also if you are an Allakhazam premium member you can include tribute value criteria in an advanced item search.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KanadWinterstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Lucy adding tribute values is a superb addition, and I applaud Illia for giving it to us. What I'd want to see (and what I've spreadsheeted out for myself) is a quick means of calculating favor per plat spent to make tradeskill pieces. I've done this for all the major types of LDoN smithing (heloo Calcified Ringmail Bracelet!) but I'd like to spread it out to all the major tradeskill recipies. Maybe a project for rainy afternoons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Was real happy to see that robes of capacity still generate over 6400 tribute points. :)<br />
<br />
The lodestone robes brought me nearly 1500 tribute, however, oddly, the robe of concussion, with uses the harder to get dye, is worth very little in tribute.</div></div><hr />
