<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wyntyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi All,<br />
<br />
I am a level 23 Mage and have been faithfully spending the training points and pp at my Guildmaster to keep this skill capped every level.<br />
<br />
When I get to 24, my skill will be a whole 45 and the trivial for those spells is 71. According to the calculations I have found on this site, my expected success ratio is 43%. In working on other tradeskills, I have found this formula to be very accurate. Needless to say, this is not an acceptable ratio for something so important (and expensive) as a new circle of spells.<br />
<br />
Except for the level 20 spells which I can get in OOT, I have enough components for 4 attempts at the level 24 fire and water pets.<br />
<br />
Most likely, I will try the combines myself 3 times then if they fail, get a higher level Mage to do the final combine.<br />
<br />
In your experience, is there a higher level of successes for Research as opposed to other tradeskills?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input!<br />
<br />
PS: I play on Fennin Ro so if any of you high level mages want to do the combines for me, I will donate. Or, you can do all 8 combines and keep any successful combines after the first (which I will get) to sell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Whizbang_Dustyboots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nope, the success rate is about the same for all tradeskills, although there is a Geerlok quill available to help out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can understand wanting to research them yourself, but do realize that many (but not all) research spells are available from merchants in Katta.  Also, many of them are sold in bazaar for 25ish plat.  Really cheap :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i might suggest, hold off on spending your points for it each level.  Sub-150, research skill actually goes up very fast.. unless it's been changed in the past couple years.  It was not uncommon to do 6-8 combines to get 5 skillups in the earlier skilllevels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Whizbang_Dustyboots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I never saw results like that before I started spending points. :(<br />
<br />
And I went and updated Graffe's spell database a few months ago, and found that many of the research spells in Katta had been removed. I suspect some or all of them may have been there accidentally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aethia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would have to disagree with Moraganth.  I would spend my training points (and did) on research.  Although, I must also say it also depends on class and server.<br />
<br />
I am a necro on Stromm.  Low level words weren't hard for me to come by to research.  However, the cost per attempt and my success rate caused me to return to buying research points.  Each level it was cheaper and given that there was a glut of low level necro researchable spells on the market, I had to decided where to take the loss; in the bazaar or from a vendor. <br />
<br />
With training points, I was guaranteed a skillup for a certain price.<br />
<br />
My strategy changed after 101 - when you can get the advanced research tome in Gunthak.  I was able to buy all sort of research components, and for that plus the cost of a quill and parchment, I easily raised my skill to the mid 130s, at which point, I returned to buying points.  These research swatches can be sold in the bazaar for LoY Robes (or keep them if you are a tailor of that race).<br />
<br />
My magician friend had no luck raising his skill through research, but all my enchanter friends raise their skill through researching Faded pages. <br />
<br />
So I'd have to say, your luck will vary on all those points.  I had the plat to be able to raise my research every level and I knew that after x pp, I would have that a specific level of skill.  Less risk for me, but probably more expensive.<br />
<br />
Good luck with whatever route you choose</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They've changed the skillup rate from them then... ignore what i said.<br />
<br />
In the old days /shudder, you were more likely to get a skillup than not with each combine.   Mind you, also, virtually no one did the practice research, because of the significant cost and farming times.  People would skilup as they aquired things as there was really no rush to get the skill up... it ws easy to do a /who all 50 chanter, and one of the 3 or 4 that would pop might do the combine for you if they had the skill.. or, heaven forbid nowdays, you simply didn't have the spell till you got more combines (8 atempts on Feedback till i succeded).<br />
<br />
Mage research has always been a bit more difficult as well, needign a copy of previous spells was a bit trying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wyntyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the replies all.<br />
<br />
I checked the Bazaar and actually picked up a copy of the lvl 24 fire pet for 35 pp. The trader was afk and anon and didn't look like a mage, (unless in the last patch mages got the ability to dual weild) so I wrote down the name for future reference.<br />
<br />
So now I just need the water pet and words of transcendance (everfount) and I am set. A trader had the words listed for 500pp<br />
<br />
/boggle!<br />
<br />
Vendor mining time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hi wiz. fancy meeting you here.  <br />
<br />
anyway.  i am doing almost every tradeskill atm and all but jc (36) and tailor (99 woohoo. i hate lions)  are mastered.  i buy every research point.  the only ones i get are when i go ahead and try to make the spell when i'm broke and need the spell.  have gotten one that way.  the rest are purchased and i wouldn't do it any other way.  that is my advice.  that and have a lv 62 wiz (for me mage for joo) with maxed research help you in her off time. :)  love my guild.</div></div><hr />
