<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Natasya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I mean ... expansion for raids time+ level ... we can make a +16 hp food ... when i look back at mtp and halas thats just ... :steamed: <br />
<br />
If you make the tea, you use a rare mob drop and get ... +5 hp/mana drink .. uh thats awesome ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was commenting on this in the thread &quot;Lackluster Food in GoD&quot;.<br />
<br />
Should still be a few threads down.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>aaer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm sure this is only the beginning. If you look at PoP, how many great recepies could you make without progressing further into the expansion?<br />
<br />
Look at the following recepies so far:<br />
<br />
Dried Crab/Tuna/Hynid/Cragbeast Meat<br />
No known use. This could very well be subcombines in a much larger recepy yet to be discovered. Compare with lion/mammoth/wolf subcombines in Halas 10lb Meat Pie.<br />
<br />
Salads and Dressings<br />
Theese are most likely also subcombines in a much larger recepy. This time compare with Misty Thicket Picnic. If so, quite possible recepies covering a multitude of tradeskills.<br />
<br />
Cross-Expansion Recepies<br />
Recepies like Chowderly's Delightful Tuna are already covering drops from three expansions.<br />
<br />
Progression<br />
Recepies like Tuna Rice Suprise gives 5sta 30mana, almost double mana compared to the easy skillup recepies. It requires forage from PoP. Expect more recepies like this to come.<br />
<br />
Finally, a quote from our very own Niami Denmother<br />
&quot;It will, of course, take time for us to get all of the expansion's tradeskill information in place on the site. Not only are there several new tradeskill quests, but there are over 1500 new recipes as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't know her sources, but I don't think she was just rambling mentioning over 1500 new recepies. How many have we discovered so far.. 200? 500?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Maddoc has outright stated that there are about 700 new smithing recipes alone.  If anything, I would peg a total of 1500 new recipes as conservative.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed.  look at the Basic Cragbeast, Hynid, Tuna, etc recipies.. 4 meats with the same sets of recipies weighing in at 20ish recipies right off the bat.  And Maddoc says we're just scratching the surface (granted he said that in direct reference to smithing but i'm going to take the optimistic route here and hope that goes for all skills)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Teaamillie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have wondered (and haven't had time to play with yet) if these new baking recipes are to be combined into a bigger better food....similar to Bristlebane's platter.  If the tradeskill community has only discovered 1/3 of the recipes out there, I wonder if there's one or several new recipes of this type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zaephod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There are several new ones that have been found and have the tradeskill flag on them.  This is either a nasty trick the Devs/Designers are playing on us or we're in for another Party Platter style recipie</div></div><hr />
