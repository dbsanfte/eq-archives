<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I understand that JCM3 will cost me a total 18 AA points. I am currently lvl 65 Enchanter with 9 AA points in left. I wish to make lots of Gem Studded Chains.....is it worth payin the 18 AA's?<br />
Is it worth it for all other high lvl stuff?<br />
Has anyone tried the math......is that 50% really accurate that it claims to give you, or is it an approximate?<br />
Does JCM2 work almost as good? I could spend my 9 AA on that and future AA go towards other stuff...let me know what you think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Belanar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just depends on how much plat is worth to you compared to how you value AAs.<br />
<br />
I believe the description is accurate now (it wasn't the first year or so the skill was out until they broke it and made it work like it says).<br />
<br />
So if you would fail 50% of the time before, with JCM3 you'd fail 25% of the time. With JCM2 you'd fail 37.5% of the time.<br />
<br />
Gem studded chains trivial at 335 I think, so people that want a lot of them tend to seek out enchanters with JCM3... :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KletianTellah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's worth 18 AA if you answer yes to the following:<br />
<br />
- You have 250+ AAs<br />
- You have 250 JC skill<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
- You make most of your money off JC<br />
- Most JC you profit from is 250+ Trivial<br />
- The money you make can buy you better upgrades than 18 AA can</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>feressa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's worth it if you're flagged for the elemental planes. The PoP rings will be good upgrades for many in elemental guilds and the drops for them are rare enough that you don't want to fail on them. <br />
<br />
Other than that, there's not much point in getting JC3. The new GoD AAs contain some useful, but expensive, upgrades that I'd get long before JC3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>banazir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I believe JCM3 is always worth it.  I believe it should be one of the first things you buy when dinging level 59.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Why are you asking us?<br />
<br />
You need to ask YOURSELF that question.<br />
<br />
Is it worth it to YOU? Theyre youre AA and its your Jewelcrafting.<br />
<br />
<br />
I purchased a lot of defensive and healing AA before my Offensive AA (theres still some things i havent bought yet at 265 AA like Ambidexterity). <br />
Other rangers would howl in agony at this saying rangers are an offense/dps class and the AA that increase your damage output are paramount. I feel otherwise.<br />
Because of this, when groups look for a tank for their LDON adventure, they look for Warriors, Paladins, Shadowkinghts or Splunge, and I cant just be replaced with a wizard or rogue.<br />
<br />
So my AA path was worth it to me. Are the JC AA worth it to you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Skeetus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What splunge said... but personally, JCM3 was a lot more attractive before all the crazy expensive Gates AA came out. Although, as I'm finally getting close to Elemental access, and will be working on Tailoring shortly, I might go ahead and finally invest the AA. If nothing else, get JCM1. A noticable difference in JC success for 3 AA can't be beat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xanafeldier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Is JCM3 Really Worth 18 AA Points? <br />
<br />
Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Leafrat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">First of all, I'm a druid.  Now, for Tailoring I did Solstice Robes from 188 to 240 (I DONT reccomend that, but that's a subject for another post) and let me simply say that I would have certainly paid 18 AA for JCM3.  18? Bleh, 32!  And its not like I have a lot of points to throw around, Im inactive atm (again, dont do solstice robes for 52 pts you'll regret it), but I think I have something like 120 AA...so its not like im floating in the stuff.<br />
<br />
All I can tell you is that for me its principle.  I'm JC 250 + Trophy.  Im close to 1750 now.  But...no matter how dedicated I am, I will always have to bug my guildleader for those pesky JC combines.  If not him, one of the other enchanters with JCM3.  The % increase isn't what I see as important, although it IS significant, its simply that I've worked dang hard on tradeskills, and the fact that in the end I'll NEVER be quite as good as enchanters bothers me.<br />
<br />
As for numbers--it makes a difference. I don't have data for you, but omg...NEVER do solstice chains without it. REALLY.  Learn from my mistake...NEVER EVER!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sovran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">At 252 modified skill with no JCM, your chance of success on a 335 triv item (aka Gem Studded Chain) is 52.25%.  This means that, at this level with no JCM, each chain costs you 481.823pp after you factor in the cost of failed combines.  If JCM3 reduces the fail rate by 50%, as advertised, then the new success rate is 76.125%.  At this success rate, each chain costs you only 329.668pp.  You save 152.155pp per combine.  If you need 100 chains (and trust me, you will), you'll save about 15k by getting JCM3.<br />
<br />
The same calculation works for any of the other 335-triv combines, though of course the cost of each varies.  For Steel Rings, for instance, you'd save a LOT more due to the cost of the stones.<br />
<br />
For you mercurial enchanters, this also means that you can sell your JCM3-made chains for 470pp each (a 150pp profit), at least, and your buyers will still be saving money over the cost of making the chains themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dulsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would recomend it to anyone who is going to start mastering JC or Tailoring. If you are already a master tailor and jewler .. it isn't that big a deal. There is nothing in JC that is more than a twink item once you hit the elemental planes. So the loss of componants isn't that big a hit.... GoD had nothing for jewlery that I care about.<br />
<br />
Now if there are all new recipies in OOW I may change my mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sehra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I really wish I could buy this AA. I'd consider it a pleasure to spend 18aa on it. I sure hope JCM gets made a universal AA with OoW. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dulsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">New Augment recipes in OoW are well worth the 18 AAs <br />
<br />
Time to grind some exp.</div></div><hr />
