<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Akishka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off, Hi Guys!!  I've used this site for a while and finally decided to post.  Awsome site  :) <br />
<br />
Second off, I now have a 190 in tailoring.  I'm looking at two different options to continue my skill ups to the 210 and then have other plans from there.  <br />
<br />
First is the whips from GoD that trivial out at 202.  I've tried a few, suceed almost always but they just don't resale (keep in mind I have a trader up almost 24 hours a day in the bazaar).  I have been working on the 6/23 ones but considering moving to the 10/24 ones with the same trivial to see if they sell better.  To make one whip it costs around 400 pp since I cannot farm the ingredients.  I have an extremely high sucess rate on these so far (made 15 ish, failed once).  On my sucesses, they don't sell to players at 30 pp each but do sell to NPCs at 7 pp each.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, there is the ceremonial solitice robes which I'm sure we are all familar with (trivial above 300).  Considering I can farm pretty much everything but the emeralds and already have a stack of chains, each of these cost me about 40 pp to make.  However, I'm pretty sure I'm going to fail almost every time here and on the rare sucess, it only sells for 200 pp on my server which is less than the cost of the chain.<br />
<br />
So, any thoughts on which would be the better route to take?  I am worried about the pp lost but could take it either way if one route is much better than the other.  I'm thinking the whips will skill me up much quicker right?  Is there another option that I'm just missing here or are these really the way to go?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input!!   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yitara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I certainly wouldn't go for the GOD whips at that cost and payback ratio, although the success rate is nice.  I detest the Solstice robe route having had nothing but horrible luck (get no points, succede on chains a LOT).  I actually found it was costing me more like 70/80 plat per attempt given the chain cost and me succeeding 1 out of 7 to 10 tries.  The robes are going for as low as 75 plat recently on Druzzil which is just insane IMHO.  And since I am not elemental or in an uber guild, i.e., poor, I hate losing that kind of plat to get skill points.  I also got tired of farming Rockhoppers, especially when they went GTM.<br />
<br />
However, I have found something that is working pretty well for me, not sure what class you are and if you can dot it.  I am working up through the LoY robes.  I find Bazaar vendors or NPC Vendors selling the words and runes I need usually quite often (I pay anywhere from 2 to 25 plat in bazaar, 6 to 7 plat from NPCs).  As allways, just after a patch is the best NPC shopping time.  Occaisionally I sometimes even find the temper components (bamboo shoots and sea horse roe for me), although usually I have to spend a few hours and farm them myself, analogous to spider silk farming.  While the low level robes also don't sell for a lot, they usually do sell for more than the cost to make them (silver ribbon, rune/word, parchment, quill, shoot and water, for instance.)  Occasionally I get a nice Dew Clover or, more rarely, a Rune of the Tempest  (Robe of the Tempest sells for 5,000 plat on Druzzil).  I am currently at 213 and when I trivial on runes of inverse at 222 I will start mixing in words of ethereal (232) and Velious stuff as I come across it, farm it.<br />
<br />
Now, this is not a fast way to skill up, but it is one of the most inexpensive ways.  If you're not a class that can make these then you're probably stuck with the Solstice robe or the hoppers.  Good luck to you.</div></div><hr />
