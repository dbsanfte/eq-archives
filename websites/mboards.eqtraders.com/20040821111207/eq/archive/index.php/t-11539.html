<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nanamage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It has been a while since I last brewed, however, I searched the database and can only find one source for this in Cobalt scar from the Othimirs.<br />
<br />
I thought I bought some in POK once upon a time, but perhaps it was just luck I found it on a vendor.<br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm if there is a second source for this?  and if so can we update a location on the database?<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">othmir merchant in cs sells it.  if your faction is bad, which it shouldn't be unless you ruined it, kill ulthorks in ew or bulthork in cs to raise it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">oh yeah.  wyverns all around port in on cov faction.  do kael raids to live there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>casikoto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">found another merchant that sell brown algae... Celtir Gronback ..dwarf barkeep in thuragin.. in the building called the Velium Keg ... loc pos 109, neg 402</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">unless that is a new change, it's probably just player sellback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>casikoto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It might be a new change..checked it out on two different servers..Celtir Gronback is now selling brown algae.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brickhaus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Check on Xev server at 4 pm on Nov 10th. Celtir did NOT have any brown algae for sale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>casikoto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I made a mistake... before i posted Celtir Gronback carrying brown algae i bought 3 backpacks of the stuff on the seventh hammer server. then i went on tribunal server and bought a stack at the same vendor.. (it was even on the same vendor slot). After seeing the brickhaus last message.. went back on Tribunal server and much to my dismay i only bought 2 more stacks before it ran dry. I was fooled by the fact that it was only a day after the patch and the Velium Keg is usually not a business that has a lot of junk items on the merchants.<br />
<br />
I appologize for the misinformation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brickhaus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't think an apology is necessary...you checked on 2 different servers, which is definitely more than I would have:)<br />
<br />
I've seen brown algae before on vendors that people have sold back. And for some reason, it's never one and two, but many groups of 20.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">3 stacks is all i would have checked.  prolly less if it sold for a lot.  might of sked in traders chat channel for someone near thurg to look at it.</div></div><hr />
