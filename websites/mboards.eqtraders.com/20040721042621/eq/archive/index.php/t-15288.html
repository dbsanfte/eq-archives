<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Diledryten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been working to skill up with Ethereal metal rings from 210 to 212,  however I have realized on some occasions that I have not put my geerlok on me for the attempt and I have still been able to make it with an unmodified 211 smithing.  <br />
<br />
It seems like the skill requirement may have been changed down for 220.  Can anyone confirm as well or give a guess as to what the skill required to attempt is?<br />
<br />
This may help other smiths if you can start the combine earlier in your progression.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Reddoak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I just tried this at 208 unmodified smithing and got the &quot;You are <br />
too inexperienced in your craft to even consider attempting this <br />
combination&quot; message. <br />
<br />
If what you're saying's true, they may have moved the required <br />
minimum skill downward a few steps, maybe to 210 skill, but <br />
that's it. I wont believe it though until someone else can confrim it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eleon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can confirm this as well. I was doing 210 to 212, and made a few but got no skill ups. went around ended up being called to a raid, and then back back after raid and did a few more form the UI, after I got a skillup I noticed I still had my epic in hand and not the gearlock. <br />
<br />
Now this might mean you can use abilitiy of the UI without the &quot;required&quot; skill, once you know it.<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
This means the trivial changed a little bit.<br />
<br />
I am willing to bet it is a feature of the new UI.<br />
