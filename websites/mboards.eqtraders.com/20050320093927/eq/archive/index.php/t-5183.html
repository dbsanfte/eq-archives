<br />
They had a call in contest for the best adult pleasure taken in a public place ( this about as PG as I can make it , and still retain what it was about) . The last call they got was from in side St. Patric's Catheral in NY . Tha act was taking place in a confessional. It was aired live on their radio show. Even when the cops caught the couple in the act . <br />
<br />
Also only Opie I think played EQ and Anthony picked on him for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Last thing I am happy they are gone . The station they were on was the premier Classic Rock Station in NYC. <br />

Not a big rock fan. Opie and another guy named Keith played EQ. And I can see why he was cought by the cops... Keith was a cop. Lol</div></div><hr />
