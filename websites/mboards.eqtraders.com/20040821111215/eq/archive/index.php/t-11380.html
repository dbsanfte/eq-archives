<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mendatenrognabs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would like to start a thread of DNCs for recharging the Stalking Probe (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=4127&amp;menustr=080120020000)... This item is not expended on its last charge making it seem like a canidate for recharging.  On the other hand it is an old world item.  Be sure to check if you are using a zero charge probe or not.  I will get back when I have a chance tah try a few ideas I have.<br />
<br />
If anyone from SOE sees this give a hint, does this recipe exist or not :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Whizbang_Dustyboots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">According to the best attempts of tinkers historically, it is not a rechargeable item. Given its extremely low cost (18p for parts), I would be surprised if it not being tagged &quot;expendable&quot; was anything other than an oversight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mukkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can sell the used probe to a vendor for 14 pp, then tinker a new one for 18 pp. Net cost 3-4 pp.<br />
<br />
Even better, used probes can be vendor-recharged: Sell a fully charged probe to a vendor with free slots, then your used probe, buy them both back fully charged. Net cost 3 pp and no re-tinkering involved.</div></div><hr />

Have you done this recently?  I thought that vendor charging was not too long ago changed so it's no longer doable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tudani is correct.  This was corrected quite a while ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mukkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Have you done this recently?  I thought that vendor charging was not too long ago changed so it's no longer doable.<br />
<br />
Yes I have done this very recently.<br />
<br />
As far as I know, vendor recharging still works like always. On certain items, they skyrocketted the sell-back price to make recharging them unviable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was under the impression that they had made it so that items with different numbers of charges would not stack on the merchant, so you wouldn't be able to merchant recharge anymore.</div></div><hr />

K, I found it in the October 9, 2003 patch message (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/updates/recent_updates.jsp?id=58800):<br />
** Interface **<br />
<br />
- Merchants now separate items with different charges in their list. For example, 9 dose and 10 dose potions will show up as separate items on the merchant's list.  Items with the same amount of charges will be stacked.  NOTE: This will remove the ability to &quot;recharge&quot; items by selling them to a vendor and buying them back.<br />
<br />
Go ahead, try it. Either they're back to stacking again or they never fixed it in the first place.<br />
<br />
- The Bazaar now supports selling different charged items. For example, a 10 dose potion with 9 charges can be sold for 90 plat., while a 10 dose version of the same potion can be sold for 100 plat.  NOTE: All currently priced charged items will no longer have a price attached and will need to be reset by the trader.<br />
<br />
Heh, so that's why all the spell scroll prices on my trader were reset when I came back to EQ from a break.</div></div><hr />
