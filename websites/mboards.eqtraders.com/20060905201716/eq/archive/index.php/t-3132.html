<br />
After spending a great deal of time gathering supplies, I had components for 200 wyvern hide mask combines.  My skill is currently 204 and I had an int of 253 going into the session.  I also had already made 50 attempts to raise the skill to 205 in a previous session so I was hoping for a quick skill up.<br />
<br />
I went to my favorite combine spot and started in.  The result was that after burning all 200 attempts, I did not get a single skill up.  It was like driving by a car accident.  It's a horrible sight but try as you might you can't look away.  I just kept trying thinking that surely the next one would be the skill up.<br />
<br />
Was I just bent over by the random number generator or did the patch somehow mess (intentionally or accidentaly) with the chances to raise your skill?  Did anyone else do any training immediately after the 1/28/03 patch and successfully train?<br />
<br />
I had a hard time believing some of the horror stories about training that I had read on the boards.  Now I am a firm believer and also ready to cancel the account.  I only play EQ now for the tradeskills but if skill ups are going to be this rare, its ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input and thanks for letting me vent,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veldin Darkfire</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably just bad RNG. We all seem to get hit by it now and then and it totally SUCKS :)<br />
<br />
However before this patch I did Ceremonial Robes<br />
<br />
14 tries - 1 skillup - 0 robes<br />
18 tries - 1 skillup - 0 robes<br />
19 tries - 1 skillup - 1 robe<br />
<br />
Then I ran out of chains seeing as I only had 1 :)<br />
<br />
After the patch had 4 chain attempts done, got 3 made. Then my robe run looked like this...<br />
<br />
28 tries - 0 skillup - 2 robes<br />
06 tries - 0 skillup - 0 robes<br />
<br />
So who knows what the patch could have done. Wish I had kept that skillup streak seeing as I'm almost 200 now. Will probably pick back up next time I log in (knocks on wood)<br />

Went through 40 combines, not a single skillup, a little odd for that skill level (and WIS 233) ... figured I'd better hold off in case it wasn't just the RNG being cranky.  <br />
<br />
Someone else reassure us and say you got a skillup on something after the patches!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiatek</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">probably just bad RNG.  I did 30 wyvern combines last night and got a skill up to 200 on the 14th combine.  Then I did 12 cobalt drake (3 successes yay!) but no more skill ups.  I had previously done over 50 combines  and no skill ups.  <br />
<br />
Next time, I would advise stopping around 40 or 50 with no skill up and waiting.  If I havent gotten a skill up in that time, I stop and try another night and pray the RNG is kinder.</div></div><hr />

Pure speculation on my part (or perhaps superstition), but I tend to avoid a skillup session on a patch day.  You never know if something goes wrong with the patch and I don't want to burn hundreds, or these days thousands, of plat without any reasonable chance of skillups.  I just wait a few days and gather more supplies, then try a skillup session a few days after a big patch.  <br />
<br />
Mind you, I have no data to support any of this.  It could very well be a bad RNG day.  It's just one of my quirky habits.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaidian Blade</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My sentiments too Myrron.  I avoid working on skillups the day of or sometimes even the day AFTER a patch.  Just superstious I guess.  But you never really know just how much Sony BREAKS with their &quot;untested&quot; patches until a few days afterwards.</div></div><hr />

One day I made 3/4 on Erudite cultural pants, 1/1 on BP, and 1/3 on a hat, and then a week later burned through 17K worth of supplies with not a single success.  :(   I have barely picked up my kit since then.  LOL everyone has those bad days.<br />

<br />
People tend to post more on bad runs than good runs.  But I had very good runs after patch to the point I was expecting skillups every 10 combines. :)<br />

<br />
Legs 1/1<br />
bracer 1/3<br />
cap 1/3<br />
boots 1/2<br />
tunic 1/5<br />
sleeves 1/16<br />
<br />
No skillups either.  What is with Wyvern sleeves?? Did a run of 3 sleeve attempts after making bracer and cap failed.  Did a run of 5 sleeves after making legs and boots failed.  Did a run of 5 attempts after making tunic failed.  Did 2 attempts failed.  Did a run of 2 made on 2nd attempt finally.<br />
<br />
I had enough studs for the first run.  Had to go farming for 2nd run.  I farmed enough for 2 more attempts failed.  Begged zone to sell me more velium(really needed my fix).  Made studs and woot finally on 16th attempt.<br />
<br />
Sometimes the RNG just sucks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also everyone gets hit by the bad RNG every now and then, it all really balances out in the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pockets FullOfGold</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just have to ask real quick.  Has anyone had any more major problems with skillups on combines or does it seem to be as it was prior to the patch?  I will soon have over 200 Flawless Rockhopper Hides farmed and I don't want to combine to make Reinforced Armor and not get any skillups.<br />
<br />
Guess what I'm asking for is... are you getting skillups when you combine now?<br />
<br />
Pockets FullOfGold - needs to be reassured of his skillup chances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liat</div><div class="date">02-02-2003, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been having pretty poor luck post 200 in tailoring in skillups. I'd say I'm averaging only 1 skillup per 80 combines. I had 1 skill up for 7 stacks, 2 skill ups in 5 stacks, and again 1 skill up in 6 stacks. that got me to 213 tailoring. It's very disheartening to watch your stacks of components that took many many hours and plat to acquire dwindle away with absolutely no skillups. Doing combines at 280INT and 260DEX. I'd say that pre-200 lvls I was getting more like 1 skillup per 20 combines. Am I having bad luck, is post 200 just a lot slower, or did they change tailoring again?</div></div><hr />

<br />
tailoring 154+5%<br />
<br />
1st combine : success, 1 skill up<br />
2nd combine : success, 1 skill up<br />
3rd combine : failure, no skill up<br />
4th combine : success, no skill up<br />
<br />
just luck</div></div><hr />
