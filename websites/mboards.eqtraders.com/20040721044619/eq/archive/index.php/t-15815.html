<br />
I'm looking for some advice for dwarf paladin to skill up from 235 please.<br />
<br />
I followed many a chart on making arrows to get through to 202.  Switched to Darkwood bows and no cams till 215, then introduced cams to get through to 235.<br />
<br />
After that run, there were a few k plats left over, so thought would try and see what happens with making Rough Shadewood Recurve bow and watched the plats disappear fast!  It was costing some 370p odd to make the bow and believe the resale was at least 100p loss.  Can you say ouch!<br />
<br />
Help please! :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Footsore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I suggest you consider Acrylia Arrows. At the loss you are looking at for bows on sellback, and adding in the loss on failure, you might find it more desirable to do arrows. Even buying the components in the bazaar if that is your inclination, I think you will see more combines for the same cost.<br />
<br />
Building your smithing skill sufficiently to make the arrow heads and shafts won't cost much.<br />
<br />
Of course, you could always farm condensed substances and acrylia and save all that pp, too.</div></div><hr />
