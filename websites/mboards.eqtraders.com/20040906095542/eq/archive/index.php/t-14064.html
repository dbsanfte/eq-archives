<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kormus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have relied on the rather easy route with casserole dishes so far.<br />
<br />
The problem I got now is that the way to get crawling to 250 seems clouded. Question is:<br />
Is there any combines that do not require outside help?<br />
I am a SK and as such cannot create my own imbued items - and I cannot rely on a Chanter or Cleric to help me go on (at least not reliably).<br />
I got a druid that I could use and got some cash in my bank so I am not looking for an ultra cheap way - rather something inbetween. Money does not matter as long the advice is not 'then buy it in bazaar, toll'. *grins*<br />
<br />
Any ideas are greatly appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your next step would be opal encrusted steins to 222.  If you really don't have access to enchanter made mana vials, after that will be crucibles of escape to 230-something and then I think the only other thing that doesn't rely on another class would be star ruby encrusted steins which will be pricey.  You will need to get your jewelry skill up to lacquer gems but it really isn't bad.<br />
<br />
With the druid you can imbue either pebbles or emeralds (and the druid needs to be 29 or more), but will need clear mana to make old style idols.<br />
<br />
Um, any chance that you can make yourself a lvl 29 enchanter?  I am looking in that direction as the best way to make clear mana without abusing all my enchanter friends.  Or maybe someone will be nice and only sell at 10% over cost in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daeanor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Star-ruby steins need magic clay, so you still need an enchanter help, but it's a very low level spell.<br />
<br />
By the way, the new interface says they trivial at 335. I made two in 15 attempts with an effective skill of 211.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>scaevola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The bands cemanic bands I believe they don't require anything ...and they pretty cheap just don't fire...require some kind of pita glazing... or maybe they require distills I can't remember.<br />
<br />
If you can find an iskar shammy making steins is kinda of cheap like 10p + distill per combine <br />
<br />
or a Errosi Marr human cleric(very very FEW of them) ..make the cheapest go go rose quartz<br />
<br />
<br />
after planar steins it gets hard and expensive..ruby steins are really $$ to fail...(the idols are far cheaper) but they are sellable ..the idols are sadly not or not very well on veeshan at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>drtyaty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't you only need to level a chanter to lvl 8 so you can enchant clay to make these?  <br />
<br />
If that is so, wouldn't this be the most viable route to 222 for non-chanters and classes that cannot imbue things?<br />
<br />
I was also searching for the most viable path and happened to level a chanter to level 8 previously to enchant silver for me.<br />
<br />
After opal encrusted, then couldn't you move on to skill up on star ruby encrusted steins?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />
