<br />
Last night I was doing a few tradeskill combinations and earned some skillups.  Normally when that occurs, I trade food/drink items with my wife's charater and EQ forces a save of both character's information.  That way, just in case the server crashes and rolls-back, we have relatively recent information saved.<br />
<br />
However, last night after trading food/drink, we did not get the character saved information.  WTF???  Are they supressing the save message, or is the system no longer saving when characters exchange items?  Anyone else able to verify this?<br />
<br />
On one hand, I can appreciate that all those character saves might bog down system resources.  But on the other hand, I hate the fact that I might lose 10 minutes of tradeskilling skillups if I don't zone out and back in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NuldaasV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I noticed the lack of saves too. Normally I have tells and the saved message going to the same window. When I set up my trader I change into indvidual tell windows. This results in a huge long scroll back of saved messeges. This morning I thought it was odd that there was none. Wonder whats up.</div></div><hr />
