<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">took 97 combines of payala fruit and water.  did a 100 combine run.  tonight going to do a full hand made backpack instead of half of one.  will add tomorrow.  they skillups were a patch of 3, 1, 4, 2, and the last one right before i ran out of combines.  always at least 1 per stack though.  thinking mhbs after this or doing mtp with a bud.  the friend to bs with while skilling up has big plusses.</div></div><hr />
