<br />
any of this inaccurate?<br />
<br />
additionally i can brew constitutionals as well as any other high end drink available on our server. my tradeskills are below, usually charge about 2X price for brewed stuff.<br />
<br />
250 brewing, 200 fishing, 200 baking, 200 fletching, 190 pottery<br />
<br />
send tell to pazuzu or PM me on here or eqmac for trades, can do most solstice combines (less the tailoring, smithing, and star ruby steins which fail often).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you trying to use the portable bew barrel the Grimmel gives you?  It only works in a taanan brew barrel.</div></div><hr />
