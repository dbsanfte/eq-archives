<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've gotten my pottery and baking skills close to 200, and am trying to decide which of them to GM.  I've made a nice return on Golden Idols of Tunare...which I can do just fine, thank you, with a Geerlok and 200 skill.  I know how I would GM baking (MTP - got 255 wis, know the drill, enough supplies to do it).  However, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot (other than more MTP baskets) that I actually get from GM baking except for the spoon and bragging rights.<br />
<br />
I could just make opal steins to the 220s and some combination of bands and star ruby steins to 250 - assuming 20-30 attempts per skillup it won't be ruinously expensive.  It will be far more tedious than GMing baking, though, because I'll be making hundreds of nonstackable things that sell for little more than they cost to make (when they sell at all).  The real question I'm asking: are there any nifty things that other folks would actually want and pay for that I could do with a pottery skill of 250 that I can't do with a pottery skill of 200?<br />
<br />
Do people buy faithstones?  Non-Tunare golden idols?  Crucibles of escape?  Ceramic bands?  Is there a market for the various focus effect items (ceramic gavel of justice, etc.), and is it possible for a modest-sized guild to get the parts?  I will probably eventually GM pottery, but I'd like to get a clearer understanding of what I'd gain from it before I sink a bunch of plat and hours into the exercise.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cubwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since I don't bother with PoP pottery, I make most of my pottery cash on golden Tunare idols. I sell a few Faith/Soulstones, ceramic bands, and crucibles. No one buys the other golden idols, though I've made a few for guildies. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kudikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Check your local bazaar for items that begin with the word Ceramic; such as Ceramic Shield of Valor, Ceramic Sword of War, Ceramic Shackles of Torment....etc.  Most of the PoP Pottery items sell for a reasonable profit, if the RNG doesn't get to you first.<br />
