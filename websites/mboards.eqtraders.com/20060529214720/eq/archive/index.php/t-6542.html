Currently, I have just been using spine bruise (modest movement reduction) and was somewhat surprised to see my poison be not resisted, but interrupted during a battle. Now, it wasn't a big deal. It was hardly a life or death situation, but how often does this happen? I have only had it happen to me once (that I have caught), so I suppose it isn't too common. Also, and I do hope this isn't completely old hat to everyone,  are these &quot;proc'ed poisons&quot; resisted through PR (as I would imagine they would be) or MR? It seems a silly question, I am sure, but then again I never expected a poisoning of mine to be interrupted. ;) <br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

As for resistances, I think most poisons are resisted on Poison, although a couple of Classic ones were resisted on Fire (notable the anti-undead ones).<br />
<br />
To really be sure what's resisted on what, I suggest that you look up the effect names on Lucy (http://lucy.fnord.net).</div></div><hr />

Btw, arent poisons FUN...?  :D</div></div><hr />
