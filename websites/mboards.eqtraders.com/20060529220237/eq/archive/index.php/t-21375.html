<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sofurious</div><div class="date">04-09-2005, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Feeling bored one day in EQ (imagine that) I decided to kill time working on poison making some more (hadnt done any in a while nor even played my rogue).<br />
<br />
My Rogues poison making skill is currently 186 and when last I left off with poisonmaking I was making Bixie sting to get me to 231.<br />
<br />
After logging in and sitting down with my bagfulls of Celestial Essanse and Ethrereal Suspension to make the Celestial Suspension (trivia 46) I'm getting the message now that &quot;This combine is far beyond your skill level&quot; or similar.<br />
<br />
The trivia on the combine reads 46, my skill level is 186...this does not compute... :confused: <br />
<br />
It doesnt even attempt to do the combine giving me a &quot;you have failed you dolt&quot; message. :irked: <br />
<br />
To me, this is not an improvement in gameplay that is being touted about in all the latest tradeskills revamp hype, moreover its a handicap.<br />
<br />
Furthermore I have bags of subcombines to make this cockamamie concoction that now, because of this &quot;WOOT&quot; change in tradeskills skillups are worthless to me... :grumpy: <br />
<br />
So please, as if talking to a child, explain how a combine with a listed trivia of 46 cannot be done with a 186 skill level ? :boggled: <br />
<br />
Wouldnt that make the combine trivia &gt;186 and say so in the container trivia listing ? :irked: <br />
<br />
If this is not a bug then the trivia to make Celestial Suspension should not be listed at 46 as it is but more correctly at its proper combine trivia level.<br />
<br />
Now that being said, what other combines could I make that are easily found, or cheaply purchased to get me to 250+ since Bixie sting can no longer be even attempted until I am passed the trivia level to make it... :grumpy: <br />

Would take maybe an hour or so and 5kpp to get to 202+ so you can make bixie sting again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KB1</div><div class="date">04-09-2005, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make your own vials and it cost way, way less than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wacko</div><div class="date">04-09-2005, 09:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've always purchased vials when I could, more money but less time - but if you make your own vials don't forget you can use Crows Special Brew (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=12829)  - I think Abysmal is an unlimited supply, Qeynos isn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KB1</div><div class="date">04-10-2005, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I run all my alts through Gunthak so zombie skins here, but yes Abysmal has unlimited Crows. Basically turns a 6 plat buy into less than a plat combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanadila</div><div class="date">04-12-2005, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">gunthak is a great place to find zombie skins on the vendors.  So is Innothule Swamp.  Innsothule is also a great place to farm them.  Lots and lots of little low level zombies there with pretty good drop rates.  I usually get a bunch of zombie skins when I go there to farm spiderling silks.</div></div><hr />
