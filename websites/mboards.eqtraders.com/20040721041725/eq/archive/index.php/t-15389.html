<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>drtyaty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been collecting LOTS of condensed shadow for when I make my run to 250 fletching, which is after I get the aa's to finish up all the other tradeskills before it.<br />
<br />
Anyone have a rough estimate of how much condensed shadow it will take me to get from 202 to 250?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>yawp64</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Each chunk of condensed makes 2 arrow heads.<br />
<br />
So, multiply 48 (the number of ranks from 202 to 250) by how many combines per skill-up you expect (I used 20), then divide by 2 (since you get 2 arrow heads per chunk).<br />
<br />
So, the answer is 480 chunks of condensed.<br />
<br />
Then multiply that by an integer that represents how deeply the RNG hates you. In my case, it's 2. :-)<br />
<br />
(also, see the thread called Cheapest Path: 202-250? (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=13644) )<br />

Good luck,<br />

Yamp's calculation of about 24 stacks seems like a good one to me. I did not track exactly how many I used - but I would guess it was in the 20-24 stack range. Since thats a lot of stacks - you might want to get a few stacks - and then do some fletching - even if it does not take you all the way. This would help you gauge how much More you mihgt need each time you do this - and eliminate - the possible - &quot;Awe - I just spent X days farming 10 stacks of condensed for arows - and got my last 4 skillups using only 2 of those stacks!&quot;<br />
<br />
Take care and good luck!<br />
