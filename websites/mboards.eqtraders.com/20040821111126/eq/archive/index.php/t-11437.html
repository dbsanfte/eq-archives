<br />
So that's Shadow Knights, Monks, and Necromancers.<br />
<br />
I'm a Necromancer, and I confirmed that I can Feign Death and then start fishing and AGRO is never gained even if a pathing mob is standing right on top of me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could swear that dead gnome is fishing!&quot;<br />
&quot;Your stupid, it's obviously dead, how could it be fishing?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well how do you explain all these Rusty Knifes and Tattered Sandles then?&quot;<br />
&quot;Were wasting time, get a move on!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nimphe Wildwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's old news, BUT always is a nice reminder!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I keep trying this with my kitty shaman but he just can’t seem to get it right.<br />
<br />
“Hey Grog, is that a dead cat lying by the water?”<br />
“You mean the one with a fishing pole in its paws and the twitching tail?”<br />
“Ya, that’s the one.  Lets make sure it stays dead.”</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I used that method a lot in Ocean of Tears.  I would hunt the Sea Fury Cykes for their Mugs of Sea Foam.  When I started getting low on life/mana I would fish on the beach for Saltwater Seaweed.  I would do it while feigned to make sure a surly Cyke didn't wander by and decide to step on me for funsies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Araon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have often fished and hunted seafuries in OOT.  Feign death is definetly the safest way of doing it but it is worth noting the seafuries do not normally wander to the water's edge.  <br />
<br />
Kites and/or trains of them, on the other hand, do not follow that rule...</div></div><hr />
