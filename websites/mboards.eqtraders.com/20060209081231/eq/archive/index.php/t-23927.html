The highest researcher I could find on Bert was in the 220's and unaware of the god spells being researchable.<br />
<br />
I want a combine for mental horror done. I am willing to pay more than one would think for it, but would prefer to donate for the combine. I have all subcombines finished except for the auqa regia and the runic parchment solution.  I have all of the ingrediants.  Had someone at 202 try it for me, but she failed the runic parchment solution.<br />
<br />
Crystallized sulfur drops?  I got 3 in the Burning Woods in an hour.<br />
<br />
<br />
Where are you Bert server researchers please?</div></div><hr />

My main has skill base at 229, plus 5% (so 240 total) with Arcane Tongues 3.  He is near the highest on the server.  On runic solutions, the last &quot;batch&quot; i made i was 11/12 on combines, and overall, am 25/43 (57%) on lvl 65 final combines.  Give me tell and we can discuss Mental Horror.  <br />

<br />
Im also on Bertox, with 226 base reasearch (+ additonal 5% with greelok)  Arcane Tongues 3 and Salvage 2.  Ive already made mental horror for an SK guildie and believe I have extra of all the components except for the Smudged runice parchment (but do have a stack of the solution :P).<br />
<br />
Shoot me a tell in game if you cant get a hold of Zkull</div></div><hr />
