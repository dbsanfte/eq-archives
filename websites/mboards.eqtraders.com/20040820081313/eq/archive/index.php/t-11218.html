<br />
I am a wizard so dont have the luxury of enchanting all my medals beforehand to minimize my losses.  Was thinking to get my JC to aroudn 220 unmodified then start making them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I wouldn't use these for skill ups, unless you are skilling up tailoring via solstice robes at the same time, and I wouldn't start them til 240 + geerlok.  Without JCM AAs at 250 they are about 50% success rate, it would be ridiculously expensive to try from any lower.  <br />
<br />
Use the chart and follow the regular progression.  It is not that expensive to do them unenchanted.  I didn't enchant anything and it was less then 10k from 1-250.  200-250 is about 7k of that.  My enchanter was a lower level when I GM'd her, and only had about 200 INT.  Gem studded chains will cost a ton more money then regular progression.</div></div><hr />
