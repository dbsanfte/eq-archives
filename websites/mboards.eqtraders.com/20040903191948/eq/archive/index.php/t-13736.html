Go Berserker! (http://www.goberserker.com)<br />
<br />
So you've decided to become a Berserker? Welcome to the community! GoBerserker.com, the ultimate fan site for EQ's newest class in Gates of Discord, has launched.<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
Off EQLive's homepage, heh.  Now I'm quite surprised.  Especially after the last community chat where Smedly reaffirmed that SOE is officially against the selling of EQ goods for RL currency.<br />
<br />
GoBerserker.com has the prominent logo &quot;Sponsered by EQ Interface&quot;.  Click on the link, it takes you to eqinterface.com, which has a little banner &quot;Our Sponser: Internet Gaming Entertainment www.ige.com&quot;.  Clicking it takes you to www.ige.com, which has the html title &quot;IGE - Cheap EverQuest Platinum Store - EQ Plat, Items, Guides, and Power-Leveling!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Smedly's comments, from the EQLive's transcript of the Live Chat:&lt;Brenlo&gt; Smed, what is your position on the Yantis/IGE issue?<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; We have made our position on this issue very clear<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; we don't endorse the idea of selling items or characters<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; it's a violation of our EULA and more importantly it's not in keeping with the sprit of EverQuest<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; We are looking into this further and but don't expect us to go this way with EverQuest<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; and no, we do NOT condone it<br />
EQ Interface was bought out by either Yantis or IGE in the recient swath of buyouts - which bought it doesn't matter any more, since they merged.  Yantis and IGE were the two biggest sellers of EQ items, platinum, and accounts, and now as one they certainly are the largest.  And Everquest's official webpage has a prominent advertisement for a messageboard sponsered by a company whose primary business is violating EQ's EULA?<br />
<br />
Given SOE, I probably shouldn't be, but I was legitimately surprised to see that, heh.  Guess I'm not quite as jaded &amp; cynical as I thought - need to work on that :p<br />
<br />
Not sure if this more belongs in OOC or Primal Screams, and I apologize if I wound up choosing wrong</div></div><hr />
