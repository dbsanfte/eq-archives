<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Marlus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was wondering do the items need to be recharged by a tinker or can me, a barb warrior, recharge the item if I have the battery?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zallarenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Kritta said that it's a No Skill Combine, but perhaps some need elaboration.<br />
<br />
Anyone of any race or class can do the combine with zero chance of failure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zamkin the Mage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Many many times I'm asked how to recharge items which turn out not to be tinkered products. The answer is: I don't know, I doubt very much that there is anything you can do with a toolbox to recharge your XYZ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Forthofer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The traditional way to recharge non-tinkered items has been to find a vendor who does not stock any of the item, sell him a fully-charged item, sell him a no-charge item, then buy both back. Both will be fully-charged.<br />
<br />
Verant is now aware of this &quot;feature&quot;. For example, Lady Vox drops a rez stick with limited charges. To recharge this stick using a vendor now costs well over a million plat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I'm pretty sure you sell the empty item to the vendor first, then sell the &quot;full&quot; item, then buy them both back.  Not sure if the order matters, but that's what I've been told.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ranger_Lahru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The part of this dealing with Recharging devices such as the Anizok's line should be made into a FAQ I think.  And although it has been said it could be included in such an FAQ that the combine for recharges is a No-Fail Combine similar to the creation of CEs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gaell Stormracer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Wasn't the 'vendor recharge' method 'fixed' last year, such that vendors would hold the copies of the same item with different numbers of 'charges' in separate slots?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>vbcypher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Got a report back the other day from someone who bought my Minimizing Device that he had failed on the recharge.  I believe he was Iksar and using my Collapsed Toolkit I sold him.<br />
<br />
I cannot confirm this, but it makes me leary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gumble Tinkertumble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The trivials aren't zero for recharging. I think they are 15 or something. Anyway, you can check with the new UI.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>gnain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i seem to recall seeing something about non-gnomes not being able to use toolboxes (but presumably still able to use collapsed ones, which may explain a recent increase in my collapsed toolbox sales)--are you sure that your non-gnome friend was using a collapsed toolbox for the recharge?  My understanding is that recharges are no-fail</div></div><hr />
