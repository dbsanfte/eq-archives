<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BrindalayShadowlace</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 08:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm at 188 myself,  just did a small order of visible enchanted tier'dal adamantite plate.  Did the first 8 combines and only failed on boots once. Then tried 4 more on my own and got another bp, legs, and helm,  failed on the boots again.  ;-) So 2 failures out of 12 isn't too bad in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Probably should add i had my buyer enchant 3 combines worth of every piece they wanted so these combines weren't costing me anything.  Not sure how viable it would be to buy and have the matierial enchanted on my own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kradlum</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 03:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've made 1 skillup per 9 attempts so far on shadowscream. My strength has been between 232 and 255, when at 255 I also use a geerlok. Made 196 last night on the 60th combine, from 188.<br />
<br />
Success rate is pretty good. I have been making a mix of the 1 orb, 2 shadow combines, plus a few of the more expensive combines if I have extra swirling shadows or someone actually required one of the more intensive combines. Most of my combines have been given away, either to alts of guildmates or to newbies in Oggok or GFay. For some reason, I manage to sell a pair of boots each night, for 50pp. I now have 2 pairs of bracers, 2 pairs of gauntlets, 2 collars and 1 pair of boots in my packs. I'm planning to use this to bribe newbies to collect Swirling Shadows for me in Shadeweavers while I am farming the Shrieking Substance.<br />
<br />
The Grimlings have the whole of Hollowshade on AB again, so things are going to get even slower when I have finished off my stacks of Wailing Substance :( I got an Iksar Ceremonial Chestplate yesterday, so hunting the Dire Sonic Wolves in Tenebrous Mountains will hopefully go a little quicker. It's not easy soloing them as a 43 warrior.</div></div><hr />

Looking forward to the mad dash to Hollowshade as soon as I get home tonight. I just hope my druid friend will be around to give me a hand with the war.</div></div><hr />

I was doing it solo as a 60 cleric and then AEing all the buggers to farm the materials. <br />
But good luck !<br />
