<br />
Try that link to the rules regarding post moving, deleting, locking.<br />
<br />
The reason it was removed, was a) Thinly veiled swearing and 2) you were asking for prices outside the marketplace forum.<br />
<br />
To quote Heartsong:<br />
<br />
Firstly, even veiled swearing is strongly discouraged. Secondly, the rules are the rules. If we allowed buying and selling posts in our tradeskill forums, it would dilute the quality of the information contained in them. All buying and selling posts should be made to the marketplace forums; it is not our job to convince the tradeskillers of your server to check them. - Heartsong</div></div><hr />
