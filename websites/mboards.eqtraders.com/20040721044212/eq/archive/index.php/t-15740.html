<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Emptybuckets</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Maybe this is old news and I just haven't been keeping up on the latest, but what gives with the intoxication effects from the ldon brewed drinks?  They don't work.  Intoxiciation II, Spell Effect: Increases your running speed for up to 0:10:00.  When you use it (at least, when I used it after combining 8 of them in a cask since they're not stackable... haven't tried with one  drink on its own yet), it casts Intoxication II.  The other drinks cast either Intox 2 or Intox 1.  I'm assuming that Intox. 1 is just a slower version of 2.  I tested Double Brewed Double Dry Stout.  I timed myself running along the side of the library up top along the pavement.  Without the effect, it took me exactly 17 seconds to run from one end to the other.  With the effect, which shows itself in your buff column as a SoW icon, it also took me exactly 17 seconds.  My character is lvl 44, and has no run AAs, so that wasn't messing things up.  I was otherwise unbuffed.  Anyone know how long these have been messed up?  This skill has a lot of opportunity for money-making if this effect were to work properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Intoxification II is only 8% increased speed... I'd be surprised if you can tell the difference on such a short test.</div></div><hr />

Just go buy a sow potion.</div></div><hr />

   Apparently you think I was posting this because I have no idea about such work-arounds as a sow potion.  I was just putting the info out there to see if maybe there was a fix that I didn't know about since I happen to like doing the brewing skill and would enjoy taking advantage of the various avenues that the skill might provide for me.  One of which seemed not to be working, so I posted about it.  <br />

And by the way, you shouldn't post information like it's fact when you're making an assumption about a subject... it doesn't make you drunk.  All it does is cast a spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>banazir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree the distance is too short, run from one side of WK to the other side along the shore.  That should produce a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Emptybuckets</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey Ba****r, what did you work on to get your tailoring skill to 250?  It looks like a monumental task not even worth undertaking once you get to lvl 168-ish.<br />
<br />
edit - AHAHA!  It wouldn't let me include the letters n.a.z.i in your name, how wacky.</div></div><hr />
