<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kenamena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been making BFTs for over a year now - was one of the first to mass produce them for the Xev server when Blue Diamonds were still 2Kpp ea. I have in that time made over 200 BFTs to my estimates. In that time I have consistantly averaged 50% success - this is at 250 fletching plus GM Knife. However, in the last 3 weeks, I have had a 100% success rate on final combines. The sampling number is small, but I am 10 for 10 over 2 batches. I simply have not seen numbers like this before.<br />
<br />
Before I go and say the trivial has been reduced, it could be I've hit an amazing streak. I would like to know from other 255 fletchers if you are seeing the same results I am?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The odds of going 10 for 10 on a 50% chance item are only 1 in 1024. Nothing to get alarmed about.<br />
<br />
100 for 100... now that might be something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">One batch of 5 i went 5/5. Odds: 1 in 1024<br />
<br />
The next batch i went 0/5. Odds 1 in 1024<br />
<br />
Total: 5/10. Odds about right. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pondlife</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Luck, it seems to me, has been on your side.  I am currently 4 for 9 on the BFT.  I have 250 in fletching, 252 with geerlock.<br />
<br />
With the scarcity of Blue Diamonds on Stromm, and the hyper-inflation we have seen there the past few weeks, its tough to get more ingredients together to keep making BFT's.  Failures are SO expensive!<br />
<br />
Bottom line, it doesn't appear that the trivial for BFT's has changed at all, least not for this increasingly poor Ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>intertex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Have tried 10 by now and only succeed in making 4...with 238 skill with a geerlock ( I didn't have the heart to move it to 240, guess have to think about it now)<br />
<br />
Sold 3 with around 10K each. Looks like I am the first and only one who can make and sell them in my server ( SOL has JUST released about 1 week here)</div></div><hr />
