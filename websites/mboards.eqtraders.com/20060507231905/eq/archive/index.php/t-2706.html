<br />
If i'm not mistaken these 2 require drops from the elemental planes which no guild on our server is into yet. I'd imagine several of us will be there soon but I doubt the items will be sold any time soon since they will be used by the guilds able to get them.</div></div><hr />

I have the only known Ceramic Water Sprinkler of Marr so far.<br />
No one should expect to see any of these available for quite some time as the ingredients are rare and all the healers in each of these guilds wants their own.<br />
Once they ARE available, expect to pay six-figures for them at first.<br />
<br />
If you collect your own supplies, I will hit combine free of charge as always.</div></div><hr />
