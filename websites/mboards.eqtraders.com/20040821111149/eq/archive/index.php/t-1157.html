<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oznoyng</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can combine them for you.   I am currently at 237 skill (I think).  I have not failed on innovative cams yet.  <br />
<br />
I generally ask for something in return, but I am not particularly greedy about it.  The more you pay, the more likely I am to make time to combine though.  :)   I play from 8:00 pm central to about midnight most nights.  I can be on later or earlier.  <br />
<br />
I am bound at the Soulbinder in Tranquility.  If you want them combined, a good idea is to park yourself or a twink there with a planar toolbox and all the items you want combined.  Then even if I am raiding, I can combine for you when the inevitable death occurs.  Your best bet though is to catch me early in the night before guild raids start, or late after guild raids end.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Qallainx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">:o there are such things as a planar toolbox?  Where have I been... I'm behind the times using my deluxe and collapsable toolboxes...  :D <br />
<br />
Anyways, you could also look for me (or mantik) to help you with a combine... I tend to ask for ball bearings and coiled springs as donations, however,  if you do not have those, then money is always an option... I'm at 209 skill now, so those things are trivial now... :)  I'm on most of the day, but you generally have to find me/hunt me down if I'm not lfg...</div></div><hr />
