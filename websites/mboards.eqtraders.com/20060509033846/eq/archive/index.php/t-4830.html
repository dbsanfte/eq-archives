<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zabu</div><div class="date">03-13-2003, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see that the ribbon dyes, once &quot;valued&quot; at 250p have dropped to 100p, and now again to 70/75p.  Funny thing, even at that price, the quantity remains the same...<br />
<br />
I was getting set to unload my dye collection at a substantially lower price when I decided to do one more search for swatches.  Voila'!  One enterprising individual had a number of them up for sale, some in decent quantities.<br />
<br />
Now, the question is, do you think that these swatches are worth 50p each?  I had about 1500p on my trader and was about to unload on him/her, when I came to my senses and decided to see if everyone considered this a reasonable price (I hate to encourage gougers, no matter how badly I want the items.)<br />
<br />
Given that there seems to be so few, and the level of researcher required to make them, my gut instinct says yes, but I'd like to open this up to the floor for input.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the price shouldn't be set &quot;across the board&quot; as it were, but might need to depend on what level of ribbon it combines with.  Since I have not seen any of these research items drop yet, I don't know if there is a variable drop rate based on rarity, or if they are all equally accessible.  <br />
<br />
Input, anyone?</div></div><hr />

Dunno, 50 seems a bit much for a swatch, but if they had nothing else to go on, they may have just stuck it at that based on the dyes (which imo are WAY overpriced)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok currently I am at 218 skill.  I have done about 20 robes and gotten 0 skillups off them. I have succeeded on 19/20<br />
<br />
Robe, Trivial level, Research Component<br />
<br />
robe of sorcery - trivial &gt;211 &amp;lt;=214 - rune of sorcery<br />
robe of the skewn - trivial &gt;218 &amp;lt;=225 - nitillim's grimoire pg. 115<br />
robe of tears - trivial &gt;225 - Tears of Prexus<br />
robe of slant - trivial &gt;226 - keris's dissertation pg. 5 (right)<br />
robe of impulse - trivial &gt;233 - rune of impulse <br />
robe of virtue - trivial &gt;226 - words of virtue<br />
<br />
Comment on Reserch rarity<br />
<br />
Rune of Sorcery is a mid level (30-40ish) reserach component and can at times be found on merchants but not in great quantities.<br />
<br />
nitillim's grimoire pg. 115 is also mid level and maybe slightly more common then the rune of sorcerey.  I personally have 7 swatches of this left I belive.<br />
<br />
Tears of prexus is a 44-49 mage research component and seems to drop like candy. I see this all over merchants and have at least 1 stack.<br />
<br />
Keris' dissertation is semi rare, I have seen 3 and are for the new research stuffs.<br />
<br />
Rune of impulse same as keris' dissertation and have seen 3 also.<br />
<br />
Words of virtue. Rarer then sin. It is used in the mage 60 pet heal spell and I think another rare spell. Don't expect to see this for robes, though I do want to try at lest ONE robe with this.<br />
<br />
Breakdown<br />
<br />
At my current skill level the robe of skewn and robe of tears may be a viable path because they use silver ribbons 15p for skewn and gold ribbon 31p for tears.<br />
<br />
Robe of sorcery didn't seem that viable because i trived it very fast and got 0 skillups on all the combines. Also the rune is used in at least 1 int caster quest so they are not as easy to find as the grimoier pages or tears.<br />
<br />
Tears of prexus are just about the break point where i would throw money at tailoring due to not being rich. I'd rather keep making solstic robes for guild earrings and skill up that way.<br />
<br />
Solstic robe = 50p if all self done, maybe 95p if buying from other traders. Not counting if you succeed and have to get another chain.<br />
<br />
The last 2 robes impulse and virtue will cost 105p just for the ribbon. On top of whatever someones going to charge you for the words or rune..which can be up to 1k.<br />
<br />
I think that at skill 218 I am close to the trivial of tears and every combine makes a robe. I would hate to see these become so flooded on the market they become worth 20p each.<br />
<br />
The thing i find stopping me is the stupid lichenmoss and sylvian berries seeing as I do not forage and HATE having to rely on another class to do tailoring...hell that pisses me off about solstic robes and imbued emeralds.<br />
<br />
Anyway I doubt I would buy a swatch of the first 3 for more then 25p each maybe 50p for tears but that would be pushing it as solstic robes cost about the same and i could outfit a guildmate with an earring then.<br />
<br />
I would pay at least once to make the robe of virtue even if the effect sucks just to have one :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zabu</div><div class="date">03-14-2003, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">:!:  Now THAT'S what I call input :D  :!: <br />
<br />
Since Euell can forage, and regularly mines merchants for other crap anyway, I've used the ribbons post-Wu to get him to 162, and will likely take him to 167, but I doubt I will invest further in platinum ribbons, since he has cultural to fall back on.<br />
<br />
As for Zabu, human that he is, the options are a bit more limited.  However, the Robe of Scent uses Essence of Rathe as the research combine.  I'm well on my way to my first stack of Rathe since I started this post, and should be able to gather quite a bit more.  Then hopefully I can find an INT caster that loves clerics (or at least THIS cleric  ;) )enough to blow thru the combines for me.<br />
<br />
The really nice thing is that it only uses a silvery teal ribbon, cutting the cost even further.  The only holdup will be the plant shoots for the dye.  Thanks to the baking uses, these are usually a bit pricey in the bazaar.  I guess I can always send in The Forager to hunt griffons in wolf form, gather up a bunch of exp and loot, and hopefully walk out with a stack or two of shoots (200 foraging should up the odds a bit, at least.) <br />
<br />
Not counting &quot;taking care of&quot; the researcher, I ball-park this at less than 20p per attempt, which is a heck of a lot better than I have been doing with acrylia and arctic wyvern.  The current recipe page lists triv &gt; 216, so that gives me a lot of room to play, pretty cheaply.  I may have to hold off getting that next point in baking after all.<br />
<br />
[Edit: Just noted in the tailoring forum the Scent robe is still not triv at 221!]</div></div><hr />

I hate them for making it plant shoots :( As if it wasn't hard enough to get them, now I have no other way but to stand there and forage for hours on end (can't afford kei to fight there atm).<br />
Imo, they should've used miller carrots, then the danged things would have a use (other than handing out to begging newbs). Or one of those random things foraged in JP that really has no use other than to annoy.<br />
<br />
Just whiny from the constant crashes today &gt;_&amp;lt;<br />

IF you feel generous enough to forage up some lichenclover and sylvian berries to swap I won't say no :)<br />

For swatches, I'll not only forage them up, I'll brew them up and even giftwrap them in some Forest Green ribbons!</div></div><hr />

<br />
My trader is Pennyy (the pirategirl :)  ) so if you see her asking for you its me.<br />
<br />
I will be on saturday for a few hours and then probably late sunday evening and probably monday too.<br />
<br />
Let me know so i can make the swatches for you. If anyone else needs swatches done I will be happy to do the combines for you. Its nice for my research skill to be used since my L49 pets.<br />
<br />
I am still looking to buy. If you see any of these please pick them up for me and I will pay you back for them. About 1k max is my limit per word but I want to finish out my spells and that Robe of Virtue.<br />

Spent the day exploring Kunark yesterday (including a near miss in Kaesora) and found myself a nice quiet spot on the ramp to Kurn's tower, where I foraged the day away while doing things around the house.  <br />
<br />
Bound myself there, I may build a small house nearby.  Quiet, fertile forages, and if you keep the newbies buffed, they give or sell you plenty of spider and spiderling silks (at old world prices!)<br />

Everyone is home today with the stomach flu, so the numbers above may be increased by the time we get together.</div></div><hr />

Gave me game time.  I suppose that would be considered the silver lining.  And for you, too, since I picked up another 17 berries in the process :)<br />
<br />

<br />
I've been combining inventory across chars, and have fallen short of my two stacks of essence of rathe target.  I want to grab as many as possible at once, in case you decide to get out of the combine business...</div></div><hr />

<br />
EST here, soon to be EDT (yay!)<br />
<br />
I'm usually on from about 9pm - 1am, give or take.  If I keep the kitchen table cluttered and we have to eat in the family room, I can usually log on sooner.  I'm trying not to be on later - they prefer it when I am awake at work!  ;) <br />
<br />
If not, perhaps on the weekend.  Anytime you catch me, basically.  Whatever is good for you.  The longer you wait, the more dye you are likely to end up with.<br />
<br />
One of these days Mrs. Zabu is going to get wise to my ploy, and it's back to logging in when the boys finally go to bed.  Meanwhile, I have removed my clutter, in favor of hers and number two son's.<br />
<br />
They never suspected a thing...   Muhahahahahahaha &amp;lt;&amp;lt; cough &gt;&gt;!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've lost track on exact counts, but for your planning purposes, I have 2+ stacks of sylvan dye and 1+ stack of lichen dye.  <br />
<br />
I'm also closing in on my third full stack of Essence; perhaps I'll plan for a bit o' the tailoring this weekend after all.</div></div><hr />
