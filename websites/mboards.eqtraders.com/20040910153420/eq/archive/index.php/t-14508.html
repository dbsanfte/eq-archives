<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wanted to get fellow Fishermen's opinions first before I contact Sony.<br />
I have been a casual EQ player since Oct. 1999. I was so bored of the game recently that I was going to quit. But I just started doing Tradeskills for the first time....mainly Fishing and Baking. I found a new love for EQ.<br />
I realized quickly that Sony does not view Fishing as a true Tradeskill (ie-cap at 200 still; limited variety of recipes).<br />
I would like to contact Sony and ask for the following:<br />
1- Make Fishing cap at 250. Once you pass 200, there could be a chance of getting a higher end item needed for high end quests in your catch.<br />
Or maybe catching Fish needed for high end Baking, etc.<br />
2- I feel we should have an opportunity to obtain Flies and Lures that can be re-used. In real life, you could re-use flies and lures till you lose them. We should have a chance to re-use a Fly or Lure until it breaks off. So maybe you could get anywhere from 10 to 50 uses. If we could go past skill 200......then maybe at that lvl we could get the skill to do Combines with high end items to make these re-useable Flies.<br />
****So these are just a couple of things Sony could do. I am sure you all have ideas and there should and could be more.<br />
First....how do I contact Sony to send them this letter.<br />
Next, do you think it is possible Sony would ever make these considerations?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>illovich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Fishing seems fine as it is to me. I used to wish there was more to it, but frankly... it seems to serve it's purpose. I think the new &quot;fish converting&quot; recipes should be fishing and not baking, but hey. <br />
<br />
Look at what you're asking for, namely that more interesting things be added to fishing, including the fishing of high end quest items. <br />
<br />
I think that, short of a &quot;fishing quest&quot; (there is one in the Abysmal Sea, where you need to fish a key) ir new quests involving tradeskills, SoE would not add that to the game. They certainly wouldn't change a quest unless t needed fixing anyway. <br />
<br />
However, I didn't come here to flame you, but to tell you that you pretty much have what you want, if you look at things a little differently:<br />
<br />
Sony does not view Fishing as a true Tradeskill (ie-cap at 200 still; limited variety of recipes).<br />
<br />
I think Sony views Fishing as a secondary tradeskill, perhaps a better way to think of it is as a &quot;utility&quot; skill (it supports other skills, namely baking). <br />
<br />
Make Fishing cap at 250.<br />
<br />
At first blush, this seems to improve fishing, but if you think of all tradeskills on a scale of 0-whatever, all improving the cap means is widening the scale. <br />
<br />
In other words, it doesn't really make it different experientially, just wider and longer.<br />
<br />
Or maybe catching Fish needed for high end Baking, etc.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, the GoD expansion will make you very happy. Except that there doesn't seem to be a fishing quest master who will give you a fishing quest to get to skill level 54 for free. /rude SoE. <br />
<br />
 I feel we should have an opportunity to obtain Flies and Lures that can be re-used.<br />
<br />
Do the lures do anything? I never got what they were for.  But you're right there... it would be cool to get a stack instead of one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What bothers me is that the Mods on the Flies we create don't even add any Mod at all. It seems to be broken if it even worked at all.<br />
And now that Key quest in Abysmal sea is nerfed on Test Server and you cannot sell the Troll Potion anymore for 57pp.....it will become no drop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't have a problem with that, I just wish you could make either a multi-charge one or that they would stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gnormy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">anyone can combine 5 or 10 potions in a bearskin potion bag to make the 5 / 10 dose potions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My understanding is that the new no drop potion you get from this particular quest can not be combined.<br />
<br />
But I'll check it out next fishing run.</div></div><hr />
