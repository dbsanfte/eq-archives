<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vbcypher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am going to put together little writeup as well as a little story-mod of what the &quot;rare&quot; research components are for the various classes and spells.<br />
<br />
However, I need help determining which ones need to be included in this list.  What i am looking for is people to sound off which their suggestions for what should be on this class.  Make sure not to forget the Wisdom based spells.<br />
<br />
I know most of the Necromancer words that are rare, however I need serious help in the other caster components as well as the wisdom based components.<br />
<br />
The idea is so that you can have a printed list (or the story-line mod handy when you're vendor diving so you don't miss a GREAT BUY becuase you're unfamiliar with one type of component or another.<br />
<br />
...<br />
I really appreciate any help you can give and hope that there is enough participation to make this guide valuable enough for all.  <br />
<br />
Thank you all in advance,<br />

<br />
When you are thinking about what to list, a good rule of thumb would be to gage your reaction to finding it on a vendor for 10pp or less.<br />
<br />
e.g. - Words of Torment or Words of Awareness that you've just found on a vendor   :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>zaendol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ah yes, Rune of Scintillation is definitely a rare component.  Only drops off ubers in Ssra, HP and Cursed to my knowledge.  The spell it makes, Garrison's Superior Sundering only drops off Emp Ssra I think.  If any of that drops in LDoN I have not heard of it.  The spell sells for between 30k and 60k usually on Drinal when you can find it.<br />
