<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I was just visiting the Casters Realm website.  They have an announcement posted there that you now have to have DX9, or you will not be able to play EQ.  Is that true if you did not buy the new GoD expansion?  Granted, I will not be worried about it with my &quot;new computer&quot; that is going to be put together for me, but I am not so sure that my wife's laptops video card will support DX9.  Can anyone shed some light on this?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

No, it doesn't matter if you ordered GoD or not, SOE has rewritten the whole EQ gfx system from the base up.<br />
<br />
Cross your fingers, we might see less lag and better overall performance......or not :p <br />
