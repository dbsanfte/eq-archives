<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verdandi</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm noticing that the Tradesfolk for Hire thread has fallen into disuse.  I don't know if it's due to the three month limit or the presence of a similar thread on the Karana Boards (http://pub76.ezboard.com/fkarana89215frm42.showMessage?topicID=4.topic) or what.  What would our users of the forum here like me to do?  I could resume deleting things as they hit 3 months, change it to a longer period, stop deleting altogether, or remove that list and just sticky a thread with a link to the Karana boards list.  Or is there something else you would like to see?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">caena</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like having this list--each &quot;ad&quot; is personalized, with contact info and other useful facts.  The Karana board doesn't include the guild the character is in (which can make a big difference--someone who is in a big raiding guild may well be harder to get hold of than someone in a more casual guild).  Here, you can say if you'll &quot;just click&quot; or if you have a specific fee or materials requirement.  You can say the name of your most-played alts or give your email.<br />
<br />
Moreover, this is the &quot;Tradesfolk for  Hire&quot; thread.  Nothin on the Karana version says that any of the folks with those skills are willing to do them FOR anyone else (though admittedly anyone who posts his skills and thinks that no one will ever contact him is pretty deluded).  <br />
<br />
The fact that the thread here is updated as posts get older is also good.  There doesn't seem to be any contingency for removing people from the Karana board list when they leave the game or decide to stop tradeskilling for hire.  You know that the people in the list here have at least stopped by and done something purposeful to their posts fairly recently.  They are likely to still be playing, likely to still be interested in customers, likely to be findable.<br />
<br />
People posted to the Tradesfolk for Hire thread knowing that their post would be deleted if they left it for more than 3 months.  If they have allowed the post to go unedited that long, perhaps they no longer wish to advertise in this location?<br />

Gosh.  I had more to say than I thought I did.   :roll: <br />

So it's getting *some* use :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LadyAz</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also had a PM about haversacks this weekend, so I do believe it gets used. I have alot of people ask me if I know a Wood Elf tailor or Dark Elf smith, etc.. so I check the list and also refer them to check this forum as well.<br />
<br />
I know I keep editing my post as I increase in skill. Though for those who are 200-250 max they may not have the need to edit. /shrug<br />
Not sure what you could do about those posts.</div></div><hr />

There are some who still update and if it wasn't for the thread I would not have found Caena for tinkering and research combines.<br />

I cleaned it out and added a note in the first post with a link to the Karana boards as an additional source of tradesfolk.  Thanks for the feedback! :)</div></div><hr />
