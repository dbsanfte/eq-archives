If you are one of those people who click on the parts you need and then  enter the number needed (1) there is a much quicker way. Just hold down Ctrl and click on it and it will take only one of what you are clicking on and things go MUCH, MUCH quicker.<br />
<br />
Like I said, hopefully most people already knew that =) But if not I just wanted to let you know of it, as this go for everything stackable.<br />
<br />
I was just reading what it said on the front page and if you are quick with the mouse it takes all of 2-3 seconds to get the parts in the box and hit combine. I don't really think they should make it easyer then that because it should take SOME time to make your arrows (and everything else that requires these kind of actions).</div></div><hr />

B) OUCHIES!!!  It burns!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And soon, even the CTRL button wont be neccessary. Wheee!<br />
<br />
And by the way, if you post in red again, ill have a GM turn you into a gnome paladin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>RebornDragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Any why are we not allowed to post in red? Tell me so I know and will stop. Just have to pick another color I guess:( <br />
<br />
Also, why should they make it even easyer to make items? Then everyone will have a 250 skill in no time at all. Why make it that easy? It's supposed to be work, so people have to work for those skill points. If people don't want to spend the 5 seconds making 5 arrows then they are being unreasonable.<br />
<br />
Also, since everyone will be having 250 skill points in no time at all if they make it even easier then it already is, then most items that can be made will drop in price dramaticaly.</div></div><hr />

i dont think prices will be that big of a deal. even though more people will be 250, they are still lazy. the average elemental guilder isnt going to sit in kaladim picking mushrooms, or spending 4 hours in SH to make some MTP.<br />
<br />
for fletching there isnt much use except elemental bows (depending on your god), which may go down in price. but as for me, i do not have elemental access, and i havnt done a thing with fletching since i got 250. most people are not going to go farm the components to make arrows either.<br />
<br />
the prices may actually go up, considering if more people can make them, more people may try to buy the parts in the bazaar, which will then be in demand, and go up first.<br />
<br />
guess we'll find out =)</div></div><hr />

No rules, just its hard on the eyes to read.  Keep it black or you may find people wont post replys to you and your questions will go un-answered.<br />
<br />
Had to put on sunglasses and suncream to read your posts, i now look like this -&gt; :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">there is a thread in general discussing these things.  go there or go to rants.  fletching isn't the place.  <br />

i just want to make picnics.</div></div><hr />
