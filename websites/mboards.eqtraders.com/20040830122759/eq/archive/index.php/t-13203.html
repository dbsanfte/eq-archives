<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Straightening up, her back groaning as she does... wiping her hands on a nearby rag she looks at her work. At her feet lay hundreds of unfired idols.... <br />
<br />
'Such a waste' she mutters to herself, 'all this work cast aside' <br />
<br />
She had not been fireing the idols, far too much trouble to bother with, and she had no idea what she would do with them all if she did. She looked at them again, ugly little idols covered the floor. Deep down she was glad her work was going to be destroyed, it had felt very wrong making idols representing the god Cazic Thule, but as a tradeskiller she sometimes had to make things that she didnt want to, just to futher her skill. <br />
<br />
At least the last batch had been a pleasure to make, idols of Tunare, she didnt mind making them. She often visited the Plane of Growth to walk amongst its trees and pools. She had even visited Tunare a few times, who was very nice, despite being an elf! <br />
<br />
A shiver broke her out of her daydreem, she loved the city of Thurgadin, so quiet, nobody bothered her when she was tradeskilling. But it was always so Cold! <br />
<br />
Packing away her tools and supplies, she dropped some components into the bank and sat to memorise Circle of Misty! <br />
<br />
'Home for a beer and a smoke' she tought, 'Perfect' <br />

Well last night i did my last run from 240 to 250 in Pottery!<br />
<br />
For those that are interested i kept data from 222 upwards. <br />
222 to 247 was Cazic Thule Idols (old world) <br />
247 to 250 Tunare Idols (old world) <br />
<br />
200 attempts - 222 to 230 (8 skillups) <br />
200 attempts - 230 to 237 (7) <br />
200 attempts - 237 to 240 (3) aargh <br />
200 attempts - 240 to 247 (7) <br />
changed to Tunare idols <br />
61 attempts - 247 to 250 (3) <br />
<br />
Works out to 30.75 combines per skill. <br />
<br />
COST: I just worked it out and appears cheaper than i thought it would be. 222 to 250 cost me just over 16k in raw components. I also threw 1k at my shammie friend each time he imbued 200 amber for me. <br />
So just over 20k. Not too bad if you ask me. <br />
<br />
All the mana vials and clay enchanting was done by myself on my bot chanter. <br />
<br />
I would like to give my thanks to my friendly Iksar Shaman who imbued all the amber for me. (I guess i will make him a faithstone as a gift for helping me out)<br />
Also thanks to the good people posting useful info here, from which i mapped out my skillup route.</div></div><hr />
