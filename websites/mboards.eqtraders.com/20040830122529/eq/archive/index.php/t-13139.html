<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Marteeny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking for a little help from someone who is able to dumb themselves down to my level.<br />
<br />
I am getting a new computer next week. YAY!!<br />
<br />
My problem is that I am 95% computer illterate. I understand that there is a way to copy my EQ settings over to my new computer.<br />
<br />
Can someone please tell me what I need to copy? Please keep it as simple as possible.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The file you want to copy over to your new computer is EQClient.INI<br />
<br />
Put it in the folder that you install Everquest to on the new machine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Look for any files that have your character name in them, as well, I should think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You could also just network your 2 computers together and just copy the entire contents from the one computer to the other.  Would be better to do than installing from scratch and doing a huge patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In order to copy all of your customized settings (text colors, Options, which character models are on, your customized UI, etc.) there are lots of things to copy over; <br />
<br />
 all files in your EQ directory ending in .ini<br />
 the contents of your UI Files directory<br />
 all the files in the EQ Directory ending in .opt<br />
<br />
<br />
The first time you start EQ on the new computer AFTER copying these files will ask you to reselect your video card, but after that, you should be ready to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Itek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/agree lothay<br />
<br />
but add<br />
<br />
all the contents of <br />
<br />
storyline<br />
<br />
maps<br />
<br />
(in case you have maps and storyline mods and don't want to re-install them)<br />
<br />
I recently had a hard drive melt down on me, it's a good idea for EVERYONE to back up those files. I wish I had. (I thought I had e-mailed most of them to my wife on a seperate computer. Either I didn't or they were deleted mysteriously.) I still have not fully recovered after over a month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Marteeny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the tips all! It went very smooth. <br />
<br />
It is truly unbelieveable what I was missing. I never knew how good everything looked with the clip plane on. I can see more than 20 ft in front of me! /boggle<br />
<br />
The game runs so fluidly now. When I move my mouse, it moves in sync on the screen. I am now not only lag free in regular zones, but I am running around the bazaar looking straight ahead and the clip plane at 100%. Yay!<br />
<br />
Heh, I never knew there were awnings over the bazaar stalls.:)</div></div><hr />
