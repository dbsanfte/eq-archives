<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Quillium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The whole sad tale of Brodder's Revenge makes me not even care. For months, we were treated to this and that and people tried. The combined this and that and we were told.. Brodder can give clues to lead you there, but in a lot of cases he flat out caused more harm than he did good. I.e. Hot Sauce. I guess that ended up being Brandy(Har Har). But at the same time, oh no.. we can't just tell you how to make it. Well, guess what.. the new expansion hits and they just tell you how to make it. Straight from the developers to you.. here is the recipe. Just go buy the expansion and we show you so you too can make Brodder's Revenge.. no muss, no fuss. Do I care about Lewena's Favorite Drink? Nope.. i'm sure it'll pop up in some UI later. Do I care about finding new recipes? Nope. They'll just pop up too. All of the things that people found fun about that part of tradeskills is over. You can kid yourself and keep trying recipes.. but really I think Sony has had the last word on the matter. Just wait for the recipes to pop and feel free to make. I guess this leaves us with playing the new progressive quests in the Abysmal Sea to see what Sony has in store, but between that and pounding out your next XX point, that's all we have.<br />
<br />
And btw, I do think EQTraders has some serious explaining to do and needs to come clean about how all that database information for GoD magically showed up the day of release. Was it accumulated during Beta? If so, how is that not a no-no? When a new expansion goes live, part of the fun is supposed to be the discovery of the recipes and quests put in the expansion. Sure, people post what they find to here and a database gets built. We've done that with pretty much all other expansions except this one. This one its like the person who just cheated on the test popped up with all the answers, and thats ten shades of wrong.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tingteng</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The new UI has nothing to do with the new expansion.<br />
And it was because of this that the recipe was found.<br />
<br />
So how does this new expansion have to do with the fact that many EQ quests are very poorly implemented?<br />
<br />
(well other than the fact that we probably have many new uncompleteable quests in the new expansion hehe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Quill, it is perfectly acceptable to take notes during a beta.  The NDA only requires you not to tell anyone until the NDA is lifted.  Once it is lifted you can post all your notes (recipes) on the internet and you aren't breaking any rules.  Many tradeskillers beta'd and started gathering info for us.  Thanks to them. :)</div></div><hr />

EQTraders does not need to explain anything to you.  It is perfectly acceptable to take notes during beta.  It happened for LoY and for Ldon, players in beta took notes and as soon as the NDA was lifted they posted their info.  I didn’t hear any objections then.  <br />
<br />
For GoD, nothing that was prepared from Beta notes was posted ahead of time, just ‘placeholder’ pages.  The database entries were only posted on  patch day, the NDA was not violated.  The mods who participated in Beta transcribed their notes into the database, in order to get a jump on the sheer insanity that always occurs around here with the release of a patch or expansion that is tradeskill-intensive.  These are the same people that input the player-submitted info into the database all the time.  Are they supposed to pretend they don’t know the recipes?  <br />
<br />
Furthermore, the information that was put up was the bare bones, we still need people to confirm stats on items, sources, trivial levels, etc  Plus, there are recipes that probably were missed or not discovered, as well.  Players can still contribute.<br />
<br />
You want the pleasure of discovering new recipes on your own?Don’t read Eqtraders then. Go out there, hunt for the meat, pelts, what have you, and start experimenting. Knock yourself out, we aren’t stopping you. Until you do it all yourself without help from any site like EQTC, Alla’s, etc, don’t come here and accuse people of cheating.<br />
<br />
:mad: <br />
<br />
Go read this post, as well Don't make me get the bucket! (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=14003)  (which was player-submitted, btw.) It has some good advice.</div></div><hr />

Yep, my husband is a Troll.  Well, all men are trolls (somewhat) but really, I mean it, literally.  Of course, as his wife, I guess that made me a Trollop. No one says it to my face though, being a wizard with the ability to burn people to a cinder might have something to do with it.  :D <br />
<br />
However, he abandoned me to marry someone else in a place he calls Real Life.  So I'm a widow, I guess. lol</div></div><hr />

:hug:  :rose: <br />
<br />
Your doing a great job here. While as a human I take slight offense to being called a troll... &lt;notices the burning corpses around Maev&gt;.. I mean I totally agree all men are trolls :D <br />
<br />
As for the rant... :steamed: Why did you search the UI to find out how to make Brodder's Revenge if you want to find out yourself? From what I gather we'd have never found out the recipe as it was too changed from what Brodder thought it was. :confused: <br />
<br />
You just can't please some people, I suggest shooting them :angel:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I can already guess that someone is going to take this the wrong way and jump all over me so have a pie.  Have more pie.  Have lots and lots of pie - and go sit down and get off your attitudes for a bit and eat all that pie.<br />
<br />
I can see Quillium's point.  Yep lots of data from the beta gets posted (and I know it doesn't violate anything.)  But the new UI eliminated a lot of the discovery that we had in new recipes AND the collaboration that I always looked forward to after a new expansion  is all but gone.  Because all the known beta recipes are just there, no one is answering any background questions at all.  There are also some mystery recipes that showed up in the database that have nothing to do with the NPC's or UI that anyone can explain the source to.  Previously the non-beta folks had a lot of fun looking for things and posting them into the frenzy of discovery.  Does anyone remember the fun of the original earring quest?  Sure it got named for Xanthe but it would have taken forever for one person to discover all the details without the collaboration of folks here, at the druid sites and other messageboards.  But that discovery is what made it fun for the tradeskillers.<br />
<br />
This is a frustrating expansion to quite a few people.  Just because a lot of people did a lot of work doesn't make it less frustrating.   I really appreciate all the work that people have done, but that doesn't mean that other people's frustrations aren't valid.  Marginalizing the folks who are disappointed or frustrated is just as destructive to the timbre of the messageboard as the rants from people.<br />
<br />
Have more pie and try to take a good look at what is going on from the viewpoint of someone you are trying to dismiss.<br />
<br />
And have some more pie.  <br />
<br />
And you don't want any more pie, try some soup.<br />
<br />
And before someone hits me with one of those pies, I don't think EQTraders owes anyone explanations.  Quillium probably could have expressed his frustration much better, but take it as face value that Quillium is frutsrated.  That said I think it is an extra responsibility of we volunteer moderators and messageboard regulars to try and help the dialogues and dismissive posts aren't really helpful either.   Maybe that is just me but I kind of look at moderators as having a responsibility to facilitate, if we are just monitors of the board maybe our title should be changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I could see his point too.  However, he is not seeing the whole picture, so it’s based on false or incomplete information.   It has been stated that there are   over 1500 new recipes, and apparently Maddoc has stated that there are 700 or so of them in smithing alone.  <br />
<br />
So 1500 may be a low estimate, actually.   And what was posted in the database so far certainly does not approach 1500 new recipes.  <br />
<br />
So the fun of discovery is still possible.<br />
<br />
Ok, now to what's really important......<br />
<br />
Mmmmm, pie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Phew - I was worried I stepped over a bad spot and offended.<br />

Glad ya like the pie :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
gm baker man.  what kind of pie?  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Trixzie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You forgot the new GoD pies En :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It has been stated that there are over 1500 new recipes, and apparently Maddoc has stated that there are 700 or so of them in smithing alone. <br />
<br />
Yeah, but how many of those recipes are of the: Make them once to get the recipe in the database, take one look at the stats, go ewwww. And never make again, variety?<br />
<br />
For example, the deathsteel, combine acrylia, and fiery weapons, or troll cultural. The best of them are marginally worse than the staple twinking weapons, that drop commonly off common mobs.<br />
<br />
Every now and then, I am pleasantly surprised by some new recipe, such as the BD cultural, Black acrylia, Tae Ew, pop armors (except for night terror) among other items, but generally, most tradeskilled stuff seems to be pretty much for skilling up and vendoring (or destroying, as some stuff even the vendors won't take).<br />
<br />
Particularly, it seems that there is some aversion to any smithed or tailored WEAPONS, that aren't subpar. No biggy, but I'm not holding my breath for anything spectacular from GoD.</div></div><hr />
