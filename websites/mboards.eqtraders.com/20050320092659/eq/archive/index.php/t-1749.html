Hotkeys should be the max length (5 lines) and can say whatever you'd like them to. Once both of you have your hotkeys setup rightclik the chat screen and switch into the language you wish to teach and have them switch into the language you wish to learn, then both of you just hit that hotkey repeatedly for about 20ish minutes. Then zone to check your skill list, if your not at master rinse and repeat :)<br />
<br />
For the special languages like dragon and such spend a few points with your trainer to build it then teach what you know to someone else, then have them teach you, then you teach them, zoneing in between. Since you can teach someone a language to one point better that what you know yourself you can use this tactic to raise your language skills (albeit slowly)</div></div><hr />
