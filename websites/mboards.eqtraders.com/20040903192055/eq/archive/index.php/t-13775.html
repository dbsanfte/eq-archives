Can someone let us know whether &quot;dark matter&quot; (used in most of the new tinkering recipes) is store bought or dropped. I am guessing it is a drop, but I can hope. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dark matter and infused dark matter are drops from somewhere in the new zones.  We're still waiting on drop information from the first intrepid hunters.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mendatenrognabs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Is the dark matter NO DROP? What about the battery casings?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Catath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dark Matter is droppable.  Not sure on the battery casings since I'm still in &quot;gather everything that drops&quot; mode and haven't started actual combines.  Pretty sure the battery casing is merchant sold and droppable, but can't be 100% sure right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grrumble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I saw battery casings on the tinkering merchants on the boat in Abysmal Sea. One for each of the 6 battery types IIRC.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>piting</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the feedback everyone!<br />
<br />
BTW, I believe the &quot;the giant turtle things&quot; are called &quot;a turepta cragwalker&quot;. The one I saw was dark-blue to me at 54.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rainingdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Someone told me today they had foraged some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yella</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I picked up something called &quot;raw dark matter&quot; in Natimbi today. Is this what you guys are talking about? If do, does it have to be converted first? The recipes say that dark matter is made from 5 grains of dark matter (somehow). Do the grains come form the raw form?</div></div><hr />

I've managed to complete most of the &quot;dark matter&quot; recipes and post them on the submission forum.  Havent found and &quot;infused dark matter&quot; yet to work with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wyclef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">dark matter comes from Raw Dark Matter..you need to do the quest in order to be able to personally work with it..once you are able to combine 1 raw dark matter in toolbox..it creates dark matter and adds the recipe to your new UI list..if you take 1 dark matter and combine it in toolbox it gives you 5 grain of dark matter..if you combine 5 non stacked grain of dark matter..it makes a dark matter from grain..all recipes added to your UI list..<br />
<br />
anyone know where or what the recipe is for infused dark matter?..or is it a drop?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fyrmana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">raw infused dark matter drops in the trials that are entered from the Kod'Taz zone. Will update later on trivial for making class 6 mana batteries and the assosiated combines for raw infused dark matter</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>gnormy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">pretty much from what I'm seeing is that there are two levels of tradeskills loot tables.  For lack of originality - we'll call them &quot;tier1&quot; and &quot;tier2&quot;.<br />
<br />
The tier1 table would include &quot;raw dark matter&quot; along all the other tradeskill drops for the lower trivial recipes (i.e. aligned ore).  Tier2 would include the upper end items like &quot;raw infused dark matter&quot; and other tradeskills with the higher trivials (i.e. shimmering ore)<br />
<br />
All mobs have a chance (a very tiny chance) to drop something from Teir1 table.<br />
<br />
Tier2 (from what i've read at least) is only dropping in advanced flagged zones.  <br />
<br />
My speculation as to why drop rates are so rare is that Gates was not intended to be &quot;farmed&quot; for parts.  Drops will occur if you kill lots of stuff.  But dont expect to be able to target X mob for Y tradeskill item and loot bags and bags of it.</div></div><hr />
