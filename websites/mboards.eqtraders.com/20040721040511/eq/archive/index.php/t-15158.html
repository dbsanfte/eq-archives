<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tegs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I logged my druid onto my second computer for a bit today and hit the forage button trying to get a few Justice Fruits to stock up on my pies for my cleric when lo and behold! they are no longer called Justice Fruit but Planar Fruit!<br />
<br />
I had several on me last night and I know for sure that they were Justice Fruit then so it appears the change happened last night with the patch.  I haven't tried to combine them in the old Justice Fruit Pie recipe so I'm not sure what kind of impact this change has made yet.  I'll be frightfully sad if I can't have Justice Fruit Pies anymore on my cleric, the added Dex was great for summoned hammer procs =/<br />
<br />
If anyone has tried the recipe since the patch let me know what's up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>tegs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">UPDATE:<br />
<br />
Justice Fruit Pies have been renamed Planar Fruit Pies, same stats.<br />
<br />
I didn't have a lot of time but it appears that the Planar Fruit is still only foragable in the Plane of Justice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tricsun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wonder if it had anything to do with justice fruit pies from a certain TV show.  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pondain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anyone verified if the Bristlebane's Party Platter recipe made it through the change ok?  Knew I should have made those combines last night... grrr...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I dont watch TV. Please enlighten us as to what youre referring to. =)<br />
<br />
And im pretty sure they just changed the name of the item, and not the ID code, which is the only thing that matters when doing combines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Within the cartoons of Genndy Taratovsky (sp?) like Dexter's Lab is a mock-commercial for Justice Fruit Pies.  Haven't seen it for awhile but it starts with the Mathemagician terrorizing the playground at Dexter's school with evil summoned numerals.  The Justice Friends (or maybe just Major Glory) comes and gives the Mathemagician a Justice Fruit Pie and he stops being evil because they are too good for him to be bad.  The kids also laugh at him a bit because he can't speak and eat his pie at the same time saying things like &quot;flustice fluit flies&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Why not just call them Hostess Fruit Pies and get it over with.  You know that's what they are.</div></div><hr />
