<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kesyn</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok... ive checked and rechecked and then checked again something in the F&amp;Q and either my brain is fried from one too many all nighters and hundreads of thousands of combines or the F&amp;Q is just wrong, can someone please clarify this..... <br />
<br />
F&amp;Q under general tradeskill questions says that while  using a geerlock (+5%) item your max modified skill = 252 an &quot;any skill ups past 242 would be meaningless&quot;<br />
<br />
well 242+(242*5%)=254 ( but your capped at 252 right???)<br />
<br />
and 240+(240*5%)=252<br />
<br />
so the question is this if you hit a skill level of 240 wouldnt any skill up's be meaningless past that if you are using a geerlock?<br />
<br />
F&amp;Q says any skill ups past 242 but that doesnt jive if you do the math.  I dinged smithing 240 tonight and would like to know if i slap on a geerlock that im max skill or if i need to keep going before i hit max skill.  If i need to keep going to 242 or higher can someone please explain to me why that is.  <br />
<br />
sorry if the post is confusing or my math is wrong could be because my brains fried from to much smithing.<br />
<br />
please advise.</div></div><hr />

I know the highest any skill can reach in game is 252, however for computations it is possible they allow the full byte to be used and go to 255.<br />
<br />
If its 252 capped, then 240 is sufficient.<br />
If its 255 capped, then 242/3 (depending on rounding) is required.</div></div><hr />

By the time you get to the 240's, you have reached the 95% success cap on items that still aren't trivial to you.  So, by the time you collect enough data to statistically verify whether the effective skill cap is 252 or 255, you've skilled up the two or three points to ensure that you'll never be able to collect that data yourself.<br />

The 252 cap is only because of storage issues in the character database. Then it all comes down to what cap they added when they included code for geerloks/trophies. Reports seems to exclude 264 (252+5%). Of course some programmers love the number 255, but personally I would guess 252.<br />

<br />
integer calculations produce rounding errors<br />
which produce a sporadic number line.<br />
<br />
i.e. lots of 95s and 97s but never any 96s<br />
<br />
From watching skillups and the RNG and the interesting<br />
skillup/combine charts, it much more matches the kinds<br />
of numbers that you get from integer calculations and<br />
not the smoothness you normally get from floating point<br />
opperations.<br />
<br />
But I must agree that there is no rounding error inside the<br />
processor, because the minimum size of an internal buffer<br />
on any processor I know is 32 bits.  This means no truncation<br />
error do to an intermidiate calculation needing 9 bits as apposed<br />
to the 8 bits of the stored number.<br />

<br />
At the point where you are doing combines at 240+ most of the items triv well over 250. It means that most combines you do at 240+ will yield success rates well below 95 percent. <br />
<br />
Another problem is that the triv levels of all things that triv over 250 cannot be pinned down. So unless we had someone that wanted to do hundreds and even thousands of combines on the same 250+ triv item we wouldn't get a good statistical sample. Also all those attempt would have to be done at exactly the same skill level without any skillups.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cantatus</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, at first we were told that geerlocks allowed you to get to 255, then we were told 252.  I think it went back and forth a few times to where our information is basically reliant on what they told us last.  At the last Fan Faire, they said it was 252.  I guess your data is correct and that 240 would get you to 252, the 242 number is based on getting to 252 and I guess was never changed.</div></div><hr />
