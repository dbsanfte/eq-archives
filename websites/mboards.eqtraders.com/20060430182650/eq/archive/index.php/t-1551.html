<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cerilin</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I have a question...I am farming most of the materials needed to get me from 188-243 and I am wondering which is the quickest way to go.  Farming acrylia or farming components for shawdowscream.  Now based on what I have been doing lately, the acrylia is really easy to come by, but I am having serious serious issues with finding windstones.  I farmed the grimling caves in TM, and I farmed elementals in TW for windstones for 3 hrs straight and got a total of 6 windstones.  They are rarely for sell in the bazaar or I would just go buy them and make this easy.  But since I have to farm, which would be better, to farm the components for shawdowscream? or to farm acrylia ore and windstones?  Also I may have been just reading something i was hoping for, but can acrylia armor be made without the temper? using water instead, just the armor doesn't have the stats? I really don't want to have to go throught the trouble of selling what I make, yet at least, I would much rahter just lose pp selling what I make back to vendors.  So which is the quickest farming route? shadowscream? acrylia? or another...bd is out tried farming essence of sunlight for armor for my warrior and it was pathetic.</div></div><hr />

I would also imagine that using alot of BLOCKS of acrylia would be a secondary pain.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most of the guides that I have read advise Shadowscream over the Acrylia.<br />

<br />
I have spent about 40 hours in the Grimling mines in T.M, and gotten about 80 windstones (and I am fairly sure 10 of those were from vendor buying or wandering Meeda Hunes).<br />
<br />
Windstones, as you noticed are the devil to collect in any great amount.  Go Shadowscream.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iwar_VZ</div><div class="date">12-28-2002, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do both, I farm shadowscream components. Meanwhile I bazaar-farm windstones and acrylia ore. Works pretty good actually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cerilin</div><div class="date">12-28-2002, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doing both sounds like the way to go, but bazaar farming on bristlebane isnt' a good idea, to many greedy people.  Cheapest I have seen a windstone is 200pp a piece the last few weeks.  That is just plain ridiculous and refuse to pay that price.  I only hope other smiths dont' buy it either so that we can drop the price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bennan</div><div class="date">12-28-2002, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I should of mentioned, that I do both.  Its just I concentrate on Shadowscream as the main skill up path.  For Acrylia I just go to T.M and kill Meeda Hunes for windstones and any other aliens for Acrylia when I want to unwind...<br />
<br />
I have about 40 odd crushed windstone in the bank now, thats 40 less attempts on Shadowscream...</div></div><hr />
