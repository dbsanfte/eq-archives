<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zebroxks</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 10:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Played velious then took a break for a year. LEft before lucin and PoP now i do have PoP and Lucin now. Am interested in getting my shawl trivials . The one i need is tailoring. But i also would like to GM this skill one day. Now Acrylia masks are what im going to do because sell back isnt really a problem. Anyways i do not wish to buy the compoents in the bazaar because it would cost too much. Where is a good place to farm acrylia? Im a level 61 druid. I used the search function both in smithing and this forum but came up with nothing. So if you could point me in the right direction i would greatly appreciate it.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

Farm Acrylia Caverns (slightly risky), or go through all of the Grimling Forest caves and single pull all of the miners for mindless farming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zebroxks</div><div class="date">01-18-2003, 12:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Went to Tenebrous mtns farmed both caves non stop for an hour and got one large brick. is this a bad streak or..? Ill try caverns also head there now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zebroxks</div><div class="date">01-20-2003, 12:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tryed caverns killed about 15 various ones and they were too much trouble for no drops. Is there anything else i can farm for this acrylia and supberb rockhopper pelts? I tryed Tenebrous for another 2 hours and got 2 bricks. IS this normal? dont think ill ever get enough to max out acrylia studded at this rate =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tweedledea</div><div class="date">01-20-2003, 02:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The mines outside AC are the best drop rate that I have found doable with my 57 druid. Kill all the miners, you should be able to avoid everything else. Sell all the runes too.<br />

And all in one convenient little tunnel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mnemosyne</div><div class="date">01-20-2003, 04:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Acrylia doesn't drop very commonly.  I have never been to AC or near it personally so i don't know what kind of drops you can get there. I farm in TM (usually the first cave ie not the laborer cave). I spent 3 to 4 hours there and usually come out with 4 or 5 bricks/blocks and a few pieces.  Stick with it though. Look for umbracite and luclinite, they are stones that sell for 114 pp and 80 pp respectively.  If you want to GM tailoring you're going to need the money.  All the other stones sell between 2 and 12 pp and windstones drop there rarely. You can sell those to blacksmithers for nice money.  The weapons that drop sell like fine steel and there is a rune that sells for 9pp.  I can make nearly 2k in just a few hours of farming.  If you are not KoS to Katta i suggest you bind yourself in one of the caves and use Egress to gate to Katta. Sell you crap and bank and gate back to the cave and do it all again.  You get acrylia and cash and hopefully your drop luck improves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shakoboy</div><div class="date">01-20-2003, 06:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I must have really good luck or something.  When I farm the cave with the Grimmling Laborer I can usually get away with 7 Blocks of Acrylia and a few small pieces an hour.  I also hit an Alien if theres one close to the entrance while I wait for re-pops.  I filled a whole mule with Acrylia in a few days doing this :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pockets FullOfGold</div><div class="date">01-20-2003, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As Mnemosyne has said Acrylia does not crop commonly.  Although 1 Brick in an hour or 2/3 bricks in 2 hours is a very bad rate.  I farm just like Mnemosyne and loot everything.  I end up destroying the Grimling Blood though.  In my experience of farming TM for Acrylia, I've found that you will get on average about 3 Bricks and 2 Pieces per hour.  There have been good runs and bad runs so stick with it.<br />
<br />
As for how much Plat I make while farming, I've made upwards of 1000 PP in about a 6 hour period of time.  It's a nice camp to make PP and gather Acrylia.  All this is done in the Grimling Caves in TM.  Preferably the Laborer Spawn cave.  The one closest to Katta is the Laborer Spawn cave.<br />
