In the viewable info in game it only says food, makes no mention of drinks.  But Caster's Realm says it works on both.  Can anyone confirm one way or the other from personal experience?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delfontes</div><div class="date">03-07-2003, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, forgive the immediate derail but...<br />
<br />
How many AA's do you have to be considering wasting a few to eat a bit more slowly?<br />
<br />
hehehe<br />
<br />
I'd say it was just a typo on their part and they meant eat/drink, but no personal experience with having AA's to waste myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verdandi</div><div class="date">03-07-2003, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe actually I don't have a single AA yet.  Just a couple days ago I dinged 61, scribed my 61 spells, suicided back to 60, got a clicky rez, and put myself on 100% AA.  Much better exp available for me that way, and I can still reding for the extra advantage when needed. :)  <br />
<br />
It'll be a while yet until I invest in this, going to do the usual Run 3 and mandatory-for-shamans routine to get Canni 5.  But I was considering this for after that, since my horse, uh, eats like a horse. :D  Anything to reduce my food consumption would be a great thing!<br />
<br />
Actually that leads to another question, does the metabolism AA also cut down on what a horse consumes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ceno65</div><div class="date">03-07-2003, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the aa metabolism skill is great, works with food and water<br />
<br />
if you always use stat food, id recomend this over 3 regen for your baron title<br />
<br />
horse doubles consumption of food .. only food not water<br />
so with the 3 meger points your back to normal consumtion rate while on a horse</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chenier</div><div class="date">03-07-2003, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes Dandi. But I would advise that if you're just starting out with AA's, do your run3 and regen3 (or whatever's required and canni5) and then use the next AA's for Arch.<br />
<br />
I know horsey eats a lot and yes metab. does help - but force feeding iron rations and fuzzlecutter's is much cheaper. =) Metab. is &quot;luxury&quot; AA's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maim, Lie, Cheat and steal to get it, hehe. It totally changes the Shaman I've seen, who never med at all anymore.  Just get to watch a crazy 2k hitpoints disapear on them, unbuffed (no ageo) it's pretty darn scary to watch the first few times, especially during a fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And just to clarify Chen, you're saying that metabolism cuts down on what horsey eats and drinks as well as what I do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chenier</div><div class="date">03-07-2003, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't think of you and your horse eating seperately - You add a horse &quot;buff&quot; (which is how the server sees it - gives you higher regen % and higher rate of eating), you eat more. Adding metabolish makes you eat less by a percentage - and that percentage applies whether you have a horse buff or not.</div></div><hr />

For a shaman though, I would say regen3 even before run3.  I love metab - my stat food lasts forever and regen would have been a waste for me.  Really depends on your class and where and how you usually play what would be best for you.<br />
<br />
To answer the original question, I think that it does work on drinks - they seem to last longer - but I've never timed it so can't be sure.  I do find that when I play Thera after Ari I'm shocked at how fast the food and drink goes so I think it must (same race which is why I didn't compare to Shaman who might consume faster).<br />
<br />
Attaching the sig I usually use on most boards.  Most people won't care but some might be curious about other peoples' AA choices.  :)<br />

<br />
The horse &quot;eats&quot; both your food and water.  Confirmed as a fact every time I have to summon up a new stack of food/water when I've been exping while on my horse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Run 3 I thought was a waste (wife is druid, I have JBoots, probably gonna get her JBoots for AE Dispel insurance...)<br />
<br />
Then I heard &quot;works indoors&quot; and &quot;almost a requirement for higher level raiding&quot; and &quot;saved my ass a few times&quot; ...<br />
<br />
Re-thinking the Run 3.<br />
<br />
Regen 3. .... Fungal Tunics sell for how much? <br />
<br />
My DE Enchanter gets 4 hp a tick. I have watched it and I'm sure. 4.<br />
<br />
Regen 3 .... 7 hp a tick.... Double my HP regen... worth EVERY PENNY.<br />
<br />
Craft Mastery. Buy it when XP is compared to level 51 not when it's compared to level 59/60. (brewing / jewelry for me, brewing / tailoring for her) Just one point. Brewing is the cheapest TST.<br />
<br />
DE Enc != Forage or Summon Food. .... Innate Metabo 3 = stuff Iron Rations and Water every 30 minutes = 1 misty picnic and 1 qeynos tea = +10 int FOREVER and less spaming my group.<br />
<br />
Druid = Forage = other places to spend AA. (as said in other threads the failure to forage at 200 skill is around 1%, I don't remember a single failure on either of our 200 skill druids since we hit 200.)</div></div><hr />

How often do you need to regen?  Offhand I'd say if you grab aggro you are getting healed, or you are dying.<br />

Craft Mastery. Buy it when XP is compared to level 51 not when it's compared to level 59/60. (brewing / jewelry for me, brewing / tailoring for her) Just one point. Brewing is the cheapest TST.<br />
<br />
1 AA is always equal to the same amount of exp, not sure what this means.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been looking at Metab as well ... would let me eat/drink stat foods with less worry (since I always forget to forcefeed), which results in better stats which results in a gameplay improvement :p<br />
<br />
I've got<br />
agi1<br />
run3<br />
regen2<br />
<br />
so far ... debating if I do regen3, metab 1, or sta1 next (I'm 52, so no arch/class for me for a while).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xaanru</div><div class="date">04-02-2003, 08:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as the regen vs run 3 debate, here is how I see it:<br />
<br />
Yes fungi tunic is expensive, however, there are several other regen items, that privide as much, or more regen than the AA ability.<br />
<br />
there also are items with clicky heals for some classes, and of course, regen spells.<br />
<br />
ALL of these work, in every zone, including dungeons.<br />
<br />
name ONE, any one item, that will allow you to have increases runspeed in dungeons where sow/jboots/bardsong won't work. To my knowledge there are none.<br />
<br />
My druid has 3 AA points. Not many, I know, but been kinda busy smithing with my cleric :)<br />
<br />
I allocated them as follows:<br />
point 1 - runspeed 1<br />
point 2 - runspeed 2<br />
point 3 - runspeed 3<br />
<br />
I could not find a single other thing in the general abilities that I wanted more (since my druid is not my tradeskiller). Everything else can be substituted for with spells and items. <br />
<br />
THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN DUPLICATE THE EFFECT OF RUN 3 IN A DUNGEON!!!!<br />
<br />
Not only that, but it sure is nice not to have that flashing boot mean &quot;you are about to die&quot; while kiting :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delfontes</div><div class="date">04-07-2003, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not only that, but it sure is nice not to have that flashing boot mean &quot;you are about to die&quot; while kiting <br />
<br />
/em hugs his J-boots tight.<br />
<br />
J-boots mean never having to say you're sorry... to the mob chasing your wizardly arse. <br />
<br />
Not once, not twice, but 3 times I've accidentially agroed a Cobalt Drake, and had J-boots Immediately dispelled... with their AE nuke, I would have been one dead wizard if I couldn't instantly put it back up.  Not that I haven't hunted them... but I do it on my terms, outside their range ;).<br />
<br />
My monk has 2 AA's, Run1 Run2 respectively.<br />
<br />
I think I'll be doing Regen 1, Run 1, regen 2-3, or something similar for my Wizard... as I have no way to heal myself.  I am unaware of an affordable way for a wizard not to have to sit at 50% health after bandaging.  I have to either start a quad at 50%, wait 15-20 minutes to have a bit more, or port to nexus and beg someone for a heal.  Hopefully regen will help that, if only a little.<br />
<br />
Most likely I'll be going straight leveling for the most part til 60+, as AA's aren't as good as new spells I get for leveling.<br />
<br />
P.S. Since this thread started my views on improved metab have changed a bit, I may get it sometime after I buy a horse, as I hear it helps tremendously.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You haven't lived until you've quadded through attrition though... first quad, lucky bastages got through my Rune, and 20% health...<br />
<br />
Next quad, small beach, tight turn, bam/stun, down to 60%...<br />
<br />
Go again... 20%, as they all 4 got me for full and had me stunned...bandage to 50... (at 100 bind wounds, highest i can wizardly go)<br />
<br />
Go again, had a lot of medding, and they missed me this time ;), 55% life for next quad.<br />
<br />
Weak druids with their regen can heal 'while' kiting, how cheap is that? ;)</div></div><hr />

Chanters having regen actually help a little, the occasional mob that eats through my bedlam before the tanks get aggro back don't cause enough to kill me, and it saves the healers mana for the melee.  I can regen the fight at 10 a tick(natural, 2 rings, regen 1), and come out sometimes not needing healing.  Puts a little less stress on healers, in some situations.. which is always good.  And yeh, it's nice for when i solo.</div></div><hr />
