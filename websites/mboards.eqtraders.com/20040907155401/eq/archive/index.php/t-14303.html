<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Damudge Deeler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was reading about skilling up, and I am a bit confused. <br />
<br />
If I start with the items to skill up in fletching, and say they all cost 1 silver, I can combine up until I get a trivial of XXX. <br />
<br />
So then I buy the same items, except for one that now costs 2 silver, and my trivial will go up? <br />
<br />
Thanks, I am a bit confused.<br />
<br />
Also, I wanted to add:<br />
<br />
Will I skill up faster if I use a trivial of up to like 20, then use a trivial of say 50, then 70, then 100? Or is it just as fast to use a recipe with a trivial of 135 and just use it from 1 until 135? <br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Greymantle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The trivial level of arrows is controlled by the componet that has the highest trivil associated with it. So yes, when one type of arrow goes trivial, to skill up you only have to change one of the four componts to get to the next level. There is a chart somewhere that shows what componet controls the levels, have a look around. If you are just fletching to skill then use the cheapest bits. If you plan on using them then it gets a bit more complicated as to best combo of dmg/range. As for faster skill up by doing ones further out of range, no you just get more fails that way, so increases your cost if you are selling back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vallorean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Here's a great guide for starters.<br />
Aoenla's Fletching Guide (http://mywebpages.comcast.net/aoenla/fletchguide/raising_skill.htm)<br />
<br />
As far as most people can tell, you don't gain any advantage for skillup by using harder components.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">look in the faq.  stickied at the top of the page.  it has the chart.<br />
<br />
the hardest peice determines how hard the arrow or bow is to make.  only 2 exceptions are sedgewood and shadewood bows that i know of.  they are screwy but otherwise the above statement is true.</div></div><hr />
