<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Milry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For all the fisherfolk who have pulled a saltwater sea weed out of Tim Deep and then struggled to find out what it's for (that was my experience anyway), it's for the Othmir Prexus Totem quest. Bloogy Shellcracker wants two of them as part of his receipe for Saucy Salted Seadragon Steak. My understanding is this is a treat he's going to make, not one that you can make. You just give him the ingredients. Now, my question is, since two of the items for this quest are items from the fishing table (the other are fish eggs from Thunder Salmon),it might be helpful to the EQTraders community to have this info in the Fishing pages and searchable. I understand that the database is enormous and will continue to bulge, but perhaps items like these which definately involve the trades should also be included even though they aren't actually part of regular tradeskill receipes. What do you think? Anyway, I'm glad to pass on this little bit of information about seaweed and eggs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Milry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I'll be jiggered...I see that &quot;seaweed&quot; is one word, and so all my search entries were misspelled &quot;sea weed&quot; so nothing came up. But I swear I went to Alla's and couldn't find it there either. Nothing loath, I'm still pleased that I was able to track it down at last, and offer my tiny mite of information beyond its use in brewing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Araon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My goodness, I didn't realize saltwater seaweed had any other use than making sea temper for human cultural (Freeport) smithing.   <br />
<br />
I have always thought it would make a good Baking recipe for something like a &quot;Seaweed Wrap&quot;, or perhaps a Fishing recipe for various varieties of sushi.</div></div><hr />
