<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When I hit 202, I tried to make a few Mithril Champion Arrows, and failed on 11 of 12 tries (no geerlok at the time b/c I wanted to max my wis).<br />
<br />
From this extremely small sample, I concluded the trivial was likely 300 or higher.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, my fletching is now 215 and I have added more wisdom to my skill suit, so I can add a geerlok and still stay at my 255 max.<br />
<br />
If 300 is the right number for the trivial, I would expect about 50% success rate at 215+geerlok.  Is this anywhere close to what I will really experience?  Has any work been done to guess at whether this is a tad above 250 or a ton above 250?<br />
<br />

Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NeedexForraves</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From 202 to around 240, I made shadow tipped acrylia arrows.  With 20 tries (1 stack), I failed somewhere between 40-60% of the time.  This is w/ wisdom of 320 and using a geerlok.<br />
<br />
I probably made around 100+ attempts at making Mithril champion arrows, from 240 on to GM fletching, and the failure rate was noticably larger.<br />
<br />
When I hit 250, my results, although minimal testing, confirmed that the acrylia arrows have a lower trivial than the mithril arrows.  1 stack of acrylia arrows yielded about 80% success while the mithril champion arrows was roughly 40-50%.<br />
<br />
The mithril arrow combine was more time consuming due to the fact that there's only 1 specific forge and one location to buy the mithril.  I don't expect you getting a 50% success rate unless you are effectively GM (252) in fletching.<br />

Just my 2cp,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If at 252, you experienced about 50% success, that would peg the trivial somewhere around 335.  If it was 40%, that's closer to 350.<br />
<br />
So then, at 215 with a geerlok (effectively 225 or so), I guess I could expect about 25% success (if it's 335) or 15% (if it's 350).<br />
<br />
I will take the time to build up the pre-combine supplies and then do a run of 100 combines, if I can.  While I hope my skill will go up during this run, I will keep track of my successes and see if 15-25% was a decent estimate.  I know 100 won't be enough  to rule out either one, but it will, at least, be data we can use to get a feel for the true trivial.</div></div><hr />
