<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rissenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">..is used to create &quot;Unfired planar stein's&quot;<br />
<br />
I have used these between 200-216, and noticed that I got skill-up's quite frequently. (Around 1 skillup per 15-20 combines)<br />
<br />
The recipe is also quite easy:<br />
<br />
Sculpting Tools                (1) Storebought  <br />
Water Flask                     (1) Dropped   Storebought   <br />
Tainted Planar Essence   (1) Dropped  <br />
Ceramic Lining Sketch      (1) Storebought  <br />
Block of Tanaan Clay        (1) Storebought  <br />
<br />
Combine in Pottery wheel. Trivial at 216<br />
<br />
If you farm your own TPE, this combine will cost you about 10.5pp which is pretty nice.<br />
<br />
TPE, I have found, is most easily farmed already at the entrance of Crypt of Decay. Bring a solid group and spend some time there, you will get frequent drops of TPE and also gems enough to do a split and have money left over for the clay. And the xp is decent as well.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LexBardMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did about 120 combines with this stuff and got one skill-up.  I dunno if it was bad luck or what but I probably won't mess with this again.  Also, from what I see people charge a mint for it in the bazaar so unless you can farm your own it's probably not even worth using for skill-ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">TPEs are all over the PoK vendors for 6 plat each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LexBardMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Must be nice.. first time I checked they were all 100 PP each.  I checked again and now there are a random few down to 70-80ish.  In the bazaar that is, haven't found a one on NPC vendors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>elty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did 7 stacks of planar essence... 1 skill up<br />
<br />
then 11 stacks of opal stein for just 5 skill up (i was thinking about donate them to tribute, but gfay so sux tribtue master, pottery wheel, bank and pottery vendor is all in different corners so finally after fill my mule I decide to just sell the fired one)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I went from 199 to 216 on Unfired Planar Steins (and boy did I litter).  Took me about 18 (maybe 19) stacks of TPE, most of it bought in bazaar for 10-20pp ea or ninja'd on raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It must be server specific.  On Bristlebane, tainted planar essences show up on PoK vendors constantly.  I did my run through planar steins before level 40, so I couldn't farm my own, but the only time I ever bought any in the Bazaar was when someone put 10 of them up for 3 pp each once.  Other than that, it was always 6pp off of PoK vendors.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I got about 1 skillup for 15-20 combines making them, but at the time I was paying more attention to successes than skillups.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tower</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I got around 10 stacks of the Tainted planar essence from the guild, the last 5 stacks (or so) i got from vendors in PoT and Pok, just look after a patch.<br />
<br />
Btw i used around 15 stacks of tainted planar essence to get from 199-216</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaaba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">People sell them to vendors a lot instead of bothering with bazaar selling them, so you can make a run around PoK and PoTranq and pick up quite a few.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aamdor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">On Morell-Thule I have noticed a significant falloff in availability of TPE on PoK vendors.  Used to be a lot of vendors would have them, now few do and, when they do, they have few for sale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jannelle Silverthorne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Absence of TPE on vendors is due to more people working on Aid Grimel and knowing that the TPE is a cheap skill up path. Same issue on Karana. Very little TPE making it to vendors and high cost in the bazaar. Average 30-50pp per TPE in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I finally sat down and did a price comparison between Unfired Planar Steins, Unfired Opal Encrusted Steins and Unfired Green Ceramic Bands. <br />
The comparison is not 100% accurate since it is geared for the skills I have easy access to.<br />
I valued Celestial Essence at 6pp which is a common selling price in Karana Bazaar. I won't make my own.<br />
I valued Tainted Planar Essence at 6.299pp which is cost to buy off NPC vendors. I farm or buy from NPC vendors.<br />
I did not include costs for enchanting services. I have two L65 enchanter friends.<br />
<br />
Unfired Planar Steins 16.861 pp per combine.<br />
Unfired Opal Encrusted Steins 24.157 pp per combine.<br />
Unfired Green Ceramic Bands 31.855 pp per combine.<br />
<br />
Considering the relatively small cost difference between Planar and Opal steins, I'm not sure that it's worth doing Planar steins to 216 unless you have easy access to supplies of TPE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>drtyaty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Last time I checked on D.Ro., couldn't find a single tainted planar essence.  GL.  I decided to make ecrusted star ruby steins because I made a lvl 8 chanter for this and for enchanting silver; who knows, perhaps I'll get him to raid lvl one of these days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is your highest attribute?  I would never start doing serious skill ups until I was able to have as high as possible.  I currently have 355 int and have no problem with skill ups.  I average under 20 combines for skill ups.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kaeyla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">30 Stacks (600 combines) at 335 Int took me from 193-201 using this method.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure wish the sculpting tools would have come back to the cursor first. *groan*<br />
<br />
Good luck on your last two imps Jann!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jannelle Silverthorne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thanks Wyst. <br />
Got my last two improvements with Wystler's leftovers and a few more stacks. 151 combines available, took 147 of them to get 2 skill ups from 214 to 216 with 300 wis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Milry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm just looking to skill up one more point from 199(casserole dishes) to 200. I can't go above 200 just now, and I'm not an enchanter, so I was advised to do that last point on unfired planar steins. I'm glad to see the essence might be available in Bazaar or on PoK NPCs. Can anyone think of any other possible item I could use for this one, littlebitty,skillup? Thanks for any ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jetfire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I did my push from 199 to 214 mainly on the TPE's. Farmed most of them in CoD while hunting there with some new friends (well friend, he was hydra'ing 3 characters in there). I had the chance to loot all the TPE's that dropped so I ended up with 30-40 stacks I think (didn't bother keeping track in the end). On average I think I ended up with a skillup every 2-3 stacks it seemed.<br />
<br />
It was worth it thouhg in the end; I made my Faithstone of Underfoot in only 3 attempts once my skill was up there. (After about 5-7 failures at the 199 level)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">TPEs are pretty rare on my server, never see more than 10 in the bazaar, and 3 at most on NPCs if the server has been up for a long time. I have had to skill up from 196 on with opal encrusted steins. 1200 combines later, I'm at 199 :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blue Ceramic Band if you can get the enchanted components -- it trivials at 202 so you'd likely have a few successes along the way. You can probably recoup some of the costs if you save a dozen or so to slowly sell back in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />
