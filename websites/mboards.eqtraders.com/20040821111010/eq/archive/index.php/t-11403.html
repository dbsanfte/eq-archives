<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaldiar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im at 182 44 spells went Trival then after the last patch now 49 level spells are trival at 182.<br />
Wasnt before or do they both go trival at the same time and i missed the no trival message?<br />
<br />
Knew others that said they made 49 level spells to get too 200 has that been changed?</div></div><hr />

As far as I know, level 49 spells always trivialed at aroun 182.<br />
<br />
The last 182 points were gotten from trainers, or not gotten at all.<br />
<br />
Now, of course, you can do new research from 182-200.<br />
<br />
182 + Geerlok = 191, and decent new research success.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">level 44 spells trivial lower.. in the 160-162 range as i remember (that may be off by 1 or 2 points..)<br />
<br />
49 spells have always trivialed at 182.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaldiar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You sure about always been trival at 182?<br />
<br />
I was doing 44 level spells too and getting skill ups until 182.<br />
Now 44 and 49 spells are trival.<br />
<br />
Wish i saved my logs to prove it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I researched my level 49 mage pets in december of 2000 and january of 2001. at that time, they were trivial at skill 182, which is all the points I could afford to buy at the time. Later on when I got a few more levels and a few more training points I spent them to hit 200 research, but i remained at 182 skill (and combining trivial level 49 pets) for a bit less than a year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaldiar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the feed back guys i was lucky and had 40 points i didnt relize i still had, to spent them on Research now need a gear lock and time to try new research woohoo.</div></div><hr />
