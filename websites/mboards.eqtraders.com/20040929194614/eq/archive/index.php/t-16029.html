<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Skeetus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Somehow I ended up with an absolute ton of Aligned Ore and Pale Nihilite after combining every one I got my hands on hoping for the NPC's claims of being able to refine more with experience would turn true. Well, I still only get 2 max back from a combine, and I ended up with a bank full of worthless junk.<br />
<br />
Before I continue, a little about me - I'm a cheapskate, and at the time I had about 20k to my name with plenty more tradeskills to work on, so I try to farm whatever I can. Unfortunately, at the time I was at 200 smithing, out of LDoN temper, and horribly sick of farming velium, so I decided to try out those junk Gates weapons for skillups.<br />
<br />
Pale Platinum Short Swords - requires a Reinforced Jewellery Kit, about 162 JC skill, (this is from memory, may not be accurate) 2 pale nihilite, 2 aligned ore, and... about 220-230p in vendor ingredients that must be purchased in Abysmal. A tad expensive, yes, especially with all the subcombines you can fail, but you make back a LOT when sold to a vendor. Including failures, I hardly lost any plat at all from 200-202, where the swords trivial. Unfortunately, don't count on selling them to players - the swords are absolute junk:<br />
<br />

<br />
Even without the recommended level they're crap. Fortunately they sell back for about 390p. Not very cost effective if you buy from the bazaar, at least on Vazaelle, people charge outrageous amounts for that garbage. But if you have plenty on hand from hunting Gates, might be a good way to get a few skill points from 188 to 202. I tried some of the next highest trivial (Pale Velium-Hilted Short Sword at 212) but while it still sells back for a small profit (assuming you farm your nihilite/steel) failures are much more costly, and needing to travel between Thurgadin and Abysmal is a pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thing thing to consider is that the velium items have 8 int and wis and selected ones are caster and priest usable.  I'm not sure what the market would look like, but I imagine it'd be possible to make a bit of cash selling them to the non-melee types.  The extra STR and AGI don't hurt either.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure, either, where you get that you need 220 PP worth of items purchased in the abysmal sea - the molds are 4 pp each (you need 6 per combine) - the bulk of the cost is the platinum which you can get anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Skeetus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Err, sorry, that was a bit of a misscommunication. The platinum bars can be purchased almost anywhere, yes, but you pretty much have to do the weapon combines in Abysmal due to each one requiring about 10+ unstackables that CAN only be purchased there. Since you can get plat bars there as well, you might as well do it all there.<br />
<br />
As for selling piercers/1hb to casters, remember that they're primary only due to no casting class having Dual Wield, and with no hp/mana plus a recommended level of 40, I really can't see anyone paying more than the 390p any vendor will give you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No caster with any degree of sense would buy one of those weapons for the cost. There are better and cheaper items rotting on bazaar traders. Overall, GoD tradeskill items are a colossal waste of database space and coding hours because the stats just flat out suck.<br />
<br />
It always amazes me how many tradeskillers have relatively very little idea of the comparative value of their product. I see all the time people saying &quot;hey, this 14 ac 2 str bp for 500pp isnt that bad!&quot; or what not. I'm not sure if its just cognitive dissonance kicking in, and them wanting to believe their wares arent vendor fodder, or if they really have no grasp on what gear is out there. For that matter, I wonder what the devs are thinking as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Roflmao! When I saw the subject line, I thought of Microsoft. I guess my indoctrination is complete...  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, I'll bite.  What can you buy that's better than a 8 wis/int/str/agi item for less than 550pp (which is cost for the velium items).<br />
<br />
The lack of HP does prevent these from becoming worthwhile (yes, these items are mostly a waste of database space), but I took a brief glance and for someone not capped on INT, there's not a lot of selection in the 1k-2k range with that level of INT.  I saw a GBS for 1k, nothing else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jarak_akn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Im on FV so your miles may vary but Stein of Moggok is always cheap / easy to get for +10Int (and not much else) <br />
<br />
You can pick a soucerous bowl for 500 ish Nyahlia's Nullifier and Gnoll Hide Tome are also under 1k<br />
But like you say not that many options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drawde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you're going to skill up using GoD drops, make cestus.  They have the same triv, but only use ONE of each of the components.  I'm going to do that myself, once I reach 212 (204 currently).</div></div><hr />
