<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Berserkerboy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I thought that we were supposed to be able to make charms. At least that what I understood when reading the LoY sales pitch before I bought it..<br />
<br />
here is a link and exerpt from the sony site<br />

<br />
A charm, for example, may have been created by a druid after a lifetime of battles with the forces of Blackburrow or the Coldpaw Clan. She may have imbued her charms with the power to grant strength to those that kill her lifelong enemies, and that strength may grow with the owner's dedication to the charm's cause. Or perhaps there is an ancient Dwarven charm, blessed by Brell, that grants a boon - but only to Dwarves.<br />
<br />
And of course there are rumors that some of these charms only work with arms or armor created by the same weapon or armor smith, and that their magic grows stronger with every piece of the armor set the owner wears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Player-crafted charms would be nice, but that quote doesn’t promise players could craft them, it’s just lore…read it this way:<br />

“A charm, for example, may have been created by a [NPC] druid after a lifetime of battles….”</div></div><hr />

The only one so far...</div></div><hr />
