<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been having the boards displaying the wrong time on me for a while now.  Pre time change they were 1 hour ahead of what they should be (I think, but brain could be a bit fuzzy about it), and now they're two hours ahead.  I tried changing the time zone to display time in from pacific to eastern and it's still giving me the wrong time of day, by the same amount.  Currently it's 7:17 eastern for me and the boards are displaying 9:15ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The server is in Texas... anyone know what time zone texas is?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Texas is central standard time but it may be possible the service did not change time last week when we did daylight savings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok I set the boards to central... it looks more like the service did not change it 2 months ago when the time changed :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks Ngreth! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There's still something funky with board times.  I live in GMT +4, but to make the boards show the right times, I have to set the time zone to GMT +1 -- that's three hours off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Must be the bopards then not the server.  And I did not code the boards so I have no clue :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Teedyo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">GMT -7:00 (MDT); currently 13:40 local time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">*hides* time seems to be off by an hour again.  It's currently 1:50 pm for me but this should be showing me posting at 12:51ish pm.  With my options set to eastern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hmm, nm, that showed correctly, but in the PM I just sent to someone it wasn't..or maybe I'm just confused now.</div></div><hr />
