<br />
How much should they sell for in the bazaar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wystie</div><div class="date">01-09-2003, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anything less than 26p should be appreciated as 26p is the very lowest you can get them from the NPC vendors.  I'd try 20p each and I wouldn't be surprised if you don't sell out right away! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angelsyn</div><div class="date">01-09-2003, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you offer them in the Tradeskill Channel for 20-25p, they'll sell.<br />
<br />
If you put them in the Bazaar for 25-30p, they'll probably sell.<br />
<br />
I had some left over from when I went to Thurgadin and bought 'em... put 'em up for 30p, they sold in two days. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have cream on me right now as well if it is needed.<br />
<br />
Might put the 2-3 velium rings I have on me up for sale when I go home for lunch.</div></div><hr />

I've got a ton from skilling up Keyne's Baking.</div></div><hr />

I'll just go on a killing spree and use the meat I get to skill up on fillets, then fillet in cream :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, really... I have boatloads of this stuff!<br />
<br />
If you want the Wolf Fillets, they're free... they didn't cost me anything to make, after all.<br />
<br />
Heck, I'm not really rushing to max out Baking, so if you'll get some use out of 'em you can have the Fillets in Cream too. ;)</div></div><hr />

If your interested in making tempers for 20pp each I could up front you the costs and pay you the profit on completion for a few stacks. Send me a tell in game.  I hate paying good money to that thurgadin vendor :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaeden</div><div class="date">01-14-2003, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, thanks to a nice person buying my essence of sunlight and a seb raid, I've got a little cash.<br />
<br />
Lacustris, let me know how many stacks you want made and I will see about getting them done.  <br />
<br />
Angel:  Thanks, after the abysmal success rate on fillet in cream, I might just take you up on those fillets in cream :)  Looks like I can't find a close trivial to step up to and will have to go straight to patty melts ;) How much you want for the fillet in cream?<br />
<br />
I'm going to see about some essence of sunlight tonight, so if anyone wants them, I might have a couple on my in the bazaar tomorrow.<br />
<br />
About to finish jumjum spiced beer and then do faydwer shakers which will give me the bottles for quite a few heady kiolas for cured silk :)<br />
<br />
Thanks all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angelsyn</div><div class="date">01-14-2003, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, I just want this stuff gone!<br />
<br />
I'm willing to take 1sp each on Fillets, 2sp each on Fillets in Cream.<br />
<br />
I only made the stuff to skill up on, after all. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaeden</div><div class="date">01-15-2003, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me finish the Coldain Tempers and I'll take some of them off your hands Angel :).<br />
<br />
I had internet problems last night so I couldn't get to the tempers.  I have a grizzly bear pouch full of allspice so I hope to have 8 stacks of temper or so ready to go after I do some combining tonight.  It will just take me a bit because I'm doing about 600 combines.<br />
<br />
Feel free to send me a tell in game.  If it's more convenient, I'll just put the tempers on me in the bazaar tomorrow morning when I head to work, or tonight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry for the delay.</div></div><hr />

Let me know what you need, and I'll scrape together what I can.</div></div><hr />

I have 2.75 stacks of temper, permafrost crystals(not for 150pp, just 75 and will drop them if requested), 2 velium rings and a couple other items.</div></div><hr />

I'm up for another two stacks of tempers if you get around to making them send me a tell in game.<br />

I was wondering if your still making these?  If so I'm interested in some more stacks.<br />
