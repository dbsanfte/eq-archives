Anizok's Bait Device - This is NOT a real item yet base prototype<br />
 gnomish bolts<br />
 static orb<br />
 class 6 mana battery<br />
 Cork<br />
 Spriket<br />
Recharged with class 1 mana battery<br />
<br />
This device would work the same as an Anizok's gauze press but would summon 20 stacks of Animated Bait. Since the resale price of Animated Bait is so low the recharge cost of a class 1 mana battery would not allow a user to make profit from this device.<br />
<br />
This is simple to place into the game. One new spell - Summon: Animated Bait<br />
 One new item - Anizok's Bait Device<br />
 NO new graphic -same as other Anizok items<br />
 New tradeskill recipe - see above<br />
 New tradeskill recipe - recharge same as Anizok's gauze pressNow for the good part... Fisherman's Companion<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I know this is rather well known here, but I do present it as it's possible that newer fisherbeings don't know about it yet.  Since Gunthak Mackerel can be made into five baits with a skinning knife, the fishing kit can be:<br />
<br />
Fisherman's Companion<br />
Skinning Knife<br />
Collapsed Tackle Box<br />
Stacks of Gunthak Mackerel<br />
<br />
Every stack of mackerel is (usually) 100 bait, so four or five stacks would keep you going for a long, long time.  In fact, for people doing monster fishing sessions, I usually recommend doing skillup runs in the Ocean of Tears, where you can catch Gunthak mackerel and then cut them into bait to keep going.<br />
<br />
Happy fishing, from every fisherman's dream girl (I can bake and brew and I love to fish!).<br />
