<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just tried at 150 pottery and failed first attempt.  Sorry I'm just doubting that the trival is less than 102.  I got the message that I lacked the skills... whatever just blew a lot of cash.  I know its completly my fault, but I would just like to plant a seed of doubt about the true trivial level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aethia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bad luck - the trivial is below 134.  I know this because I succeeded on my artisan seal and got the 'trivial message'.  <br />
<br />
Whenever you fail, regardless of your skill, you get the message that you received.  <br />
<br />
Some days the RNG is not nice - failed 2x on my trophies - so I'm 0/4.  Hang in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Exactly.<br />
<br />
No matter what your skill is, if you fail a combine, you get the &quot;Lack the skills&quot; message. A 250 potter can still fail the same combine, and get the &quot;Lack the skills&quot; message.<br />
<br />
I gotta say, that really sucked to blow the combine, but it's not the trivial, it's just a bad day with the RNG. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kahmon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At 250 skill I have never failed an unfired seal, but before they adjusted teh failure rate I actually failed firing one:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Befuddle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My pottery skill is exactly 102 - I made my first artisan seal today and got the trivial message - so I can once again confirm that the trivial is &lt;=102.<br />
<br />
Befuddle Confuzzle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I failed one in the kiln once too.  Was at 200 skill, I about cried.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sylphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just a note... my pottery skill is 244 and I failed firing something the other day.  The bit about not failing things 200 points trivial doesn't seem to apply to the kiln.</div></div><hr />
