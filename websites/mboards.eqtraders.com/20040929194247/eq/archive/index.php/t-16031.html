<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think I saw in the new 4/28 patch that the Ammo slot will now permit Mods to work. If that is correct, Busy Bee Flies and all those Mod baits will now work. Wooott, it may be time for me to tie flies. I love fishing in real life and tying my own flies made fishing in EQ a lot of fun, until I realized the Mod didn't work.<br />
Thank you Sony for finally doing something to correct an issue that has been around for ages. The Ammo slot was a waste this whole time. Geeez I had a throwing item that added strength that didn't even work.<br />
If someone gets in game first, can you test to see if Catch-A-Lot Baits really add the 2% Mod?<br />
(unfortunately this might decrease the price of components for the Fisherman Companion since that was the only Mod besides Blessed Rods)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think people got the fisherman's companion for the mod.  Most people got it for the &quot;never have to buy another pole&quot; aspect of the item.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Since mods still don't stack is it really such a big deal for fishermen?  <br />
<br />
Any fisherman worth his salt has the companion already.  How many cost effective baits have a larger mod than the summoned pole?<br />
<br />
Nice for roleplayers and people who like to tie flys but not really a big difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am happy that at least all aspects of the Fishing Skill work properly, whether one chooses to use them or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The foraged bait from Gunthak (Hermit Crabs I think?) is free to me, and I keep a stack on my person at all times. As it is  +5%, I would be keenly interested in using it over the +3% pole when doing combines for Blessed Fishing Rods. I realize it's not a huge difference, but if I can do anything to make the hours of farming required for that bloody pole to be more likely to pay off, then I'll do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Don't forget that your friendly neighberhood Tinker can craft a Collapsible Fishing Pole with a 5% fishing mod for you.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Woot....Just creat a level 1 Gnome. They have an automatic skill of 50 at Tinkering. Buy the inexpensive components needed to make the Collapsable Fishing Pole. This pole is Trivial at Tinkering Skill level 31.<br />
You will now have a +5% Mod to Fishing. The Fisherman's Companion takes up one slot, so does this. Fisherman's Companion is only +3%. The Blessed Fishing Rod is +5% BUT is expensive.<br />
So just create a lvl 1 Gnome and you have a +5% Mod Fishing Pole real cheap and easy.<br />
Why doesn't anyone take advantage of this??<br />
Thanks for the advice :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Easy answer is...<br />
<br />
Colapsable Poles break, thus making you make a new one, Summoned fishing pole can break, but is an easy summon.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ChaseFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Has anyone brought up to the Developers that the Collapsible Fishing Poles should work like the other Collapsible containers? I realize that the Fisherman's Companion has more-or-less the same effect, but from a consistency of item names vs. effects, it makes sense...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>escotor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The wonderful part here, of course, is that GM trophies will now give stats in the Ammo slot.  Bonus!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jarak_akn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Note Not stats Mods (and other non stacking benifits I think)<br />
<br />
So they wont give you +50 Cha but they will give +5% to your skill</div></div><hr />
