<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Turlo Lomon</div><div class="date">12-26-2002, 12:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Despite what some people believe, I recall a post by Verant from way back stating that the spell file people parse for information is not actually used by the system.  It is there for reference only. The spell processes are affected server side only.<br />
<br />
So...<br />
<br />
If we now have a 10 slot mortar and pestle, and possible hidden data on server side, that would mean we have possible recipes requiring more then 6 slots.  I suspect these are Tier III poisons.<br />
<br />
I would love to hear any theories, suggestions on testing, etc.</div></div><hr />

I mean feel free to try it but just think you would be wasting your time.</div></div><hr />
