Iksar are fragile, y'know! It's dangerous to raise our hopes like that, and then dash them!<br />

Seriously though... adding cultural recipes to auto-learn... pointless, m'kay?<br />

<br />
After working on fletching last night, not so easy.<br />
<br />
It took me 3 freaking hours or prep work to get 8 skill ups on 550+ arrow combines. Costing me something like 20kpp. So I'm 210 now in fletching, and saying &quot;screw this&quot; and just do vendor bows. 20 minutes and 12k later I'm at 235. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Keep in mind that this is a false hope for Karana followers, I am personally happy that someone gave them these recipes, so they can PL their smithing to 188 and then hit that huge brick wall that they face when they realize that they will NEVER hit 250 because they were fed the first half of smithing with a silver spoon!  I think it was Mithanial Marr that gave them the recipes so that I have someone to laugh at.<br />
<br />
As a side note...add this addendum. You will get NO SYMPATHY if you have trouble leveling smithing as a Karana follower, especially if you are complaining about the high cost of Fine Plate LOL...do some research random_karana_twit_01</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Er, technically, /bug is not necessarily your friend... it SHOULD be, but I suspect things get too easily overlooked...I would guess it depends on the complexity of the fix, whether the person who should fix it is readily available (or on vacation), whether related issues are also currently under work, etc etc.  On one occasion I found a spelling error on an item (the shaman spell was called Talisman of Epuration when you cast it but the scroll was called Spell: Talisman of Eupration) and /bugged it, and a couple weeks later when I looked it was fixed.  Maybe due to me, maybe not, doesn't really matter.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying it's good for /bug to be as uncertain as it is, but it definitely is not a black hole.  I always, always, always use that right away when I find anything, and then wait a patch or two before doing anything else.  Unless it's an emergency, an exploit or Very Bad Bug or something.  It's what they ask us to do first, so failing to do it really leaves us with no room to complain. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grimwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I /bugged the Spiderling Silk drop rate problem the same day of the patch that screwed it up.  Followed it up with similar information after each subsequent patch for a couple of months.  We all know how /bug is working out with -that- problem ;-).  (Just by coincidence I'd been farming Feerrott Spiderlings two days before the patch, and was back again the afternoon of the patch, so I had really good &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; numbers from two four-to-six hour sessions to put into explaining the bug.)  That was well over a year ago.<br />
<br />
Currently the /bug I am patiently pursuing isn't a Tradeskill thing, but it has similarly been ignored for the month or so I've been /bugging it on a patch-by-patch basis.  (Focus Effect Improved Healing IV is not working properly with the Druid &quot;Tunare's Healing&quot; spell, even though AA skills do work with this spell.)<br />
<br />
One &quot;success&quot; I may have had was with a /feedback asking that the size of the Friends list be increased from 10 or whatever it used to be.  A week later it was raised to 100.  Coincidence, or do they read /feedback ?  Hmmm. <br />
<br />
Bug and Feedback look like black holes because there is little or no information coming -back- to us.  Maybe they help, maybe they don't;  SoE may just be using these as a way of letting us blow off steam harmlessly.  I do hope /bug and /feedback go someplace besides the bit bucket because like many others here, I've devoted a lot of playing time to this way of improving the game. But we may never know for sure.<br />

Tunare's Renewal (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2179&amp;source=Live)?  That's a percentage heal (max 75%), and the healing foci (I,II,III, and IV) don't work on the &quot;Complete heal&quot; family (cleric CH + druid&amp;shm percentage heals).<br />
<br />
Or at least I've never heard of any of them working, and Lucy implies it shouldn't ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grimwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah, lol that's the one.... Looked it up to be sure I had the name right and still only got it close enough for government work, as they used to say.  I agree there's no reason to expect the 75% max to be exceeded with Improved Healing IV, but the 2925 HP max &quot;should&quot; be affected if the 75% cap is not exceeded.  I.e. from a roleplaying standpoint, Healing Adept 1 (AA skill) improves the max of this spell to 2983 points (if the 75% isn't exceeded).... likewise so should Improved Healing actually improve the healing here.  <br />
<br />
Whether this is a valid subject for /bug or should simply be /feedback is beside the point though, because it's just an example of things going into the black hole. Both /bug and /feedback are like writing notes in bottles.  We may hear back from some distant shore (or spoiler site ;-)) someday or we may not.  Probably not.<br />

Notice slot 1 of tunare's renewal and slot 8 of IH4.  It's not a bug.  I'm not sure if the AA should be working with it, but IH4 shouldn't be, and thus it not is as it should be.  Quit /bugging it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Inyidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The spell healing a maximum of 75% of targets HPs doesn't make it a percent heal, as I would understand it.  A percent heal would be something that heals 20% of targets HPs (for instance).  Or, at least, that's what makes sense to me.  Granted, I'm not a cleric and don't know much about their spell lines, so if I'm wrong, feel free to correct me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, it does.<br />
<br />
Think of it in the opposite way of which its stated.<br />
<br />
This spell heals 75% of your HP up to a maximum of 2925.<br />
Complete heal heals 100% of your Hp up to a maxumum of 7500.<br />
<br />
Spells like Greater Healing and Chloroblast do not have percentages stuck onto them. They will be affected by IH4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Complete heal heals 100% of your Hp up to a maxumum of 7500.<br />
<br />
Actually CH heals 7500 HP.  That's all, no percent anywhere.  Which is why you have lines 6 and 7 (the CH from the Trak BP).  CH will heal you from purple club to full HP.  Either druid CH or the shaman CH won't.</div></div><hr />

Its a completely different interpretation of &quot;percentage heal&quot;.  Yours is a logical definition (&quot;A 20% heal restores 20% of that persons HP&quot;,etc), but it is not the definition used by EQ.  Its more like<br />
<br />
&quot;Heal a person for <br />
 a) 500hp<br />
 b) their maxHp * 0.75<br />
whichever is smaller&quot;<br />
<br />
The &quot;percentage heal&quot; is a limitation placed on the spell, not a description of the spell's purpose.</div></div><hr />

SoE should be paying sites like EQTraders and Alla's/Lucy's;  without spoiler sites we'd never know there is really an odd sort of logic to some of their weirdness ;-).

Before I let Twee have her thread back (sorry ;-)-- Speaking of programmers, has anyone noticed what &quot;has&quot; to be a bit of an inside joke with one of the Mobs in the GoD zones?  <br />
<br />
&quot;The Noc Darklurch falls to the ground with a disinterested thud.&quot;  <br />
<br />
ISP's and other Internet-dependent companies commonly have a &quot;NOC&quot; which is their &quot;Network Operating Center&quot;, keeping them connected to the wide world.  The SoE programmers' Noc Mob looks great too, like the devil would look if he were a rat....<br />

The official spellbook description of this particular spell btw just says, &quot;Blesses your target with a healing touch, healing up to 2925 damage.&quot; Chuckle.That's a &quot;feature&quot; - you have to discover your world :p  But I agree, if you're not around when the patch in the feature and describe the functionality in the patch messages, there's no way to hear of a lot of things other than word-of-mouth &amp; spoiler sites.  Sometimes nowadays these big changes don't even get put in patch messages - just posts on relevant non-SOE boards - making it even harder to find out about them.<br />

How many people know about /safelock?  /hotbutton? /charinfo?<br />
A lot of people only learn about /tgb when they start raiding, and people complain at them about their buffing.<br />
I've run into a lot of 50s and 60s players who didn't know about /disc (/discipline) or had a clue what disciplines were. (pre the new combat system, obviously)<br />
And these people aren't idiots.  They just weren't playing (hadn't started or were on a break) when these features were introduced.</div></div><hr />

(/hotbutton seems kinda logical)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">/safelock is what prevents your cat from moving your bazaar mule out of the tents.  You type /safelock {password} and it locks the keyboard and mouse from moving or typing.  We use it *ALL* the time with a toddler running loose.  You can still open a couple windows like AAs listing, etc, but he cannot turn off vendor, nor can he walk the char around.

If &quot;Percentage heals&quot; are so wrong to describe them, what would you call these min(default_heal, percent*max_hp) heals instead?<br />
<br />
There's a difference, in my opinion, at least, between saying:<br />
<br />
This spell heals 50% of targets hitpoints up to a maximum of 2000 hitpoints.<br />
<br />
and:<br />
<br />
This spell heals 2000 hitpoints up to a maximum of 50% of targets hitpoints.<br />

The first example is what I would describe as a percentage heal, the second isn't.</div></div><hr />

Dunno.  Perhaps a percentage limited or percentage capped heal.  Not really sure.  I suppose it really doesn't matter as long as that's what the developers call it.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">It especially doesn't matter since those notes are NOT suposed to be seen by us, they are meant for the dev's. It just so happens that some people made programs that could parse those notes intended for the devs only and show them to the public. Since it is not intended for the public but not the devs, and the dev's know what it means... there is no reason for it to be more clear :)</div></div><hr />
