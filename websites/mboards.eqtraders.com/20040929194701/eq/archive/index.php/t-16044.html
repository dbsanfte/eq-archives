<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mjodvitnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings everyone,<br />
<br />
I was trying to setup a forage (legal) macro that would perform multiple forages last night. I had done something similar (awhile back) with cannidance such that I could get 2 &quot;dances&quot; for the price of 1 keystroke, and was trying to get something similar for forage.<br />
<br />
So I figured it would look something like this:<br />
<br />
/pause 10, /doability 1          -- forage, then pause for ~ 1 second<br />
/pause 1100, /autoinventory  -- autoinventory, then pause for ~ 110 seconds<br />
/pause 10, /doability 1<br />
/pause 1100, /autoinventory<br />
/doability 1<br />
<br />
What I found, using a stopwatch and the /say command, was that the /pause command was limited to approximately 60 seconds. So:<br />
<br />
/pause 600 was approximately 60 seconds<br />
/pause 800 was approximately 60 seconds<br />
/pause 1000 etc.<br />
<br />
This is a problem given that the recycle time for my forage ability is about 100 seconds.<br />
<br />
Is this time limit on /pause:<br />
a) a bug<br />
b) old news<br />
c) some mistake on my part<br />
<br />
or, for those few who prefer personal attacks<br />
d) you are unable to operate a stopwatch<br />
<br />
Comments appreciated,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cubwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">old news.<br />
<br />
/pause 600,/doability #(forage)<br />
/pause 400<br />
/autoinventory<br />
<br />
That's my forage macro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cantatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/pause 600,/doability #(forage)<br />
<br />
That's the important part.  The way the macros are set up, putting pause on a line with another ability tells it to pause after the ability, not before.  You'd have to put /pause on a seperate line before the /doa part if you wanted it to pause first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mjodvitnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ah ok... maybe I'll try something like this:<br />
<br />
/pause 400, /doability # (forage)<br />
/pause 600, /autoinventory<br />
/pause 400, /doability #<br />
/pause 600, /autoinventory<br />
/doability #<br />
<br />
If it works like I think it will (if being the operative term), then anything foraged will simply stay on the cursor for 40 seconds or so. And this will yield a solid 5 minutes of foraging. It's uses will be limited in scope, but when I am bound and determined to forage item x it may come in handy.<br />
<br />
Sorry to beat a dead horse, I searched for this information but was unable to find anything relevant...<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cubwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">without. also, the pause is put first, but is done AFTER.</div></div><hr />

So, which is it?The *only* time you can put more than one command on a line is with /pause, were you can put two.  If you're trying it with any other commands, it won't work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Search, author Itek, /pause in text should bring this up<br />
<br />
2) Romeo Tango ****** Mike ... the /pause 600 limit (60 seconds) is -clearly-spelled-out- in the EQ manual for socials on your hard drive. I promise you. Go forth and look.</div></div><hr />

I promise you. Go forth and look.oooh ya, that thing.  Forgot it even existed.  &quot;Revised May 7th, 2002&quot; - from the headings, looks like it was last updated around early SoL - if I remember right, launch day with adding in the AA description? But anyhow, it does have some decent descriptions.  The files are<br />
<br />
eqmanual_supplement.txt<br />
eqmanual_supplement.doc<br />
<br />
Choose whichever format you prefer to read, they should have the same actual content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mjodvitnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah, it appears my original search was hasty at best... I just found the &quot;3 forage&quot; macro that was posted about a year ago.<br />
<br />
The funny thing is that it never crossed my mind to check the manual! The last time I read the thing was during my raiding guild days back at the time of the Velious expansion. I'll have to check and see what is &quot;new&quot;, or what I've forgotten, as the case may be.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sylphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's old news.  However, the length of a pause varies from machine to machine, and even from zone to zone if some have more lag than others.  /pause 600 isn't necessarily 60 seconds.  This makes it hard to share macros with other players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Even on the same computer, macros won't necessarily time out the same. Back when you had to actually hit your sense heading to raise skill, I had a 5 sense heading macro on each of my characters. On some the pause was 15, on others, it was 17 or 18. Like Sylphan said, it depends on the zone and variables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>mrchaos101</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Bah you dont need to even do that much trouble bro. DO THIS<br />
<br />
/doability 1  (for forage)<br />
/pause 5 (to show you what you found)<br />
/autoinv  (to put it aut on your back.)<br />
<br />
Put it in the socials then DRAG it over to actions<br />
<br />
Then ALT - O  go to macro<br />
<br />
I use the  E key to walk forward.  SO I set alt HOT button alt to E on number 10.<br />
<br />
THUS<br />
<br />
Every time I press the E, I not only walk forward but it will run those 3 lines of code.  If forage hasn't recoverd it does nothing.  BUT once forage has recoverd it will forage when you take a step.<br />
<br />
Don't bother with the timers. Warring this macro is a pain in the butt on toons that cannot forage, as you will get all kinds of  bindwound msgs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Itek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">*sigh*<br />
<br />
I think, could be wrong but, that the question regards 'how can I forage multiple times with one keypress' rather than 'how can I save myself the tedium of pressing forage every single time' with the subtle difference.<br />
<br />
1) Most foragers either have, or at least know about, binding their movement keys to forage/track/sense heading/etc.<br />
<br />
2) Most people that want to forage up a ton of junk with one macro want to be able to ... oh say ... WALK AWAY FROM THE KEYBOARD for more than 100 seconds while they continue to forage. (for example when I want to go to the bathroom I like to give myself more than 100 seconds to do my business) So while you can't forage for hours in your sleep a quick little &quot;forage 2 times for me&quot; macro can give you 5 whole minutes to do your AFK business. (phone, spanking kids, doorbell, nuke cold pizza, beverage of choice from fridge, potty break, quick record setting on VCR, turn sprinklers on/off, whathave you)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mjodvitnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Actually, Itek, i think you are reading just a bit too much into it.<br />
<br />
I found the post explaining the macros useful. I had never bound a hotkey to say a movement key, and really wasn't aware of the possibility until recently. I really haven't played seriously since Velious, as I said before.<br />
<br />
As I write this, on my old computer, I am running what I call the 3*macro, on my new computer. I've got my timer going so I know when to hit the key again. After this I'll check my email, and do my Quicken stuff, heck, I may even level my guy later on!<br />
<br />
A long time ago, when I had chores to do, I used to go through the old cycle of:<br />
<br />
 kill-med-timer-chores-kill...<br />
<br />
I found it to be... stressful. Constantly up and down, and the chores seemed to take forever to get done. Some people probably will use it that way. I personally don't like to.<br />
<br />
I hope to master foraging at some point tonight. No tea leaves as of yet, but I've got a couple plains pebbles.<br />

No need for a timer then... he had it built in!  :)</div></div><hr />

This isn't much different from that dunking bird theory /chuckle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OMG hehe and  I thought binding my forage to a macro key was a good idea!<br />
<br />
I am off to Waly world to buy 2 sets ehehehh that is the best I idea I have heard yet!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Xanafeldier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've kept quiet about this for about 4 years now. In all that time I haven't seen anyone else mention it. Maybe I should go buy some Lego stock and post it everywhere. *cough*</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have four different computers that I run EQ on.<br />
Athlon 2000 XP+<br />
Athlon 1400<br />
Athlon 1800XP+<br />
Celeron 700<br />
<br />
I use:<br />
<br />
/sit<br />
/pause 3<br />
/afk<br />
/pause 1200<br />
/camp desktop<br />
<br />
<br />
I use this for all my caster toons when they're medding and I feel like just getting up and going to bed / bathroom / dinner without watching them log out.  It pauses 2 minutes before camping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Itek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">really?<br />
<br />
you are sure?<br />
<br />
are you including the 30 seconds of /camp?<br />
<br />
because the documentation says max pause is 600 period... (and it's serverside so you could be running a 486/33 and it'd take the same time)<br />
<br />
&quot;You may now enter pauses in social batches with the /pause command.  /pause takes an argument from 1 to 600 (600 = One minute), with the value being equal to the number of tenths of seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second pause).&quot; [eqmanual_supplement.txt your local eq directory 5/8/02]</div></div><hr />
