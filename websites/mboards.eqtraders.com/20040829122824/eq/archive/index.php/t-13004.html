<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krewt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had reached 191 on my alchemy skill today, and decided that now must be the time to get my GM Medicine Bag, so I could finally get rid of my old medicine bag and bearskin 10 slot potion bag, and just summon one common 10 slot bag when I wanted to.<br />
<br />
I didn't want to pay the high price of the focus potions, since the price for skilling up on normal success rate would exceed 4k for just 5 points, to the maximum on the trivial list: 196.<br />
<br />
On my 3rd failed attempt, at the price of 5k each, I joined the eqtraders channel, to talk to fellow tradeskillers. The talk fell on how many failures people got even with geerloks on, so I decided to check if a alchemy geerlok had been invented yet. Even though none had ever been sold in the bazaar I got lucky and a guildie had some lying around, and gave me one for free.<br />
<br />
It took me 2 more combines to finally get my GM Medicine Bag (At a total price of 25k), but when I unfolded it I discovered to my dissapointment that it didn't unfold a 10 shot potion bag, it unfolded a 10 slot regular backpack with 100% WGT Reduction on it instead.<br />
<br />
So in search for the unfoldable 10 shot potion bag, I again turned to my guildmates. This time I was told that also the unfoldable medicine bag could be bought cheap in the bazaar, and so I did (For 200pp). <br />
<br />
So instead of ending up with an unfoldable 10 shot medicine bag with 5% alchemy modifyer on, which I thought I would get, I ended up with a 100% WGT reduction backpack that cost me 25k to make. The 5% modifier that the GM medicine bag provides can also be achieved with the Geerlok alchemy set (Price less than 100pp) and the unfoldable medicine bag could be bought for 200pp.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, I was dissapointed, and wished that the effect &quot;Grandmaster\'s Satchel&quot; had been discribed on the alchemy skill page.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's a &quot;Trophy&quot;.  You put it on your mantle to show everyone how nifty you are that you &quot;beat&quot; something.  The stats and the bag are a bonus.  BTW you can turn 1 no rent bag into Jolum in bazaar for a permanent 100% WR bag.  And, in case you are wondering, I failed 7 trophies: 6 pottery and 1 brewing, before I got my 1 trophy.</div></div><hr />
