Before GoD, I was happy going to Lavastorm Mtns. and farming basilisk eggs for the decent yield they would give on recipes. Now that GoD came out, this is not an available option for the GoD recipes. Does anyone know if SoE is planning on altering the recipes in the future, so that other eggs may be used instead of only snake eggs?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any info you can give on this subject!</div></div><hr />

Maddoc indicated that they might do something about it.<br />

Since it's Test only for another 3 hours (assuming it's going in this patch), bye bye post.<br />

Lets just say that it looks like they put in a nice solution to the snake eggs issue.  I'll let ya'll figure it out or read it in the patch message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqNichola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That sounds like a good solution. However, please don't talk about Test-only recipes (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=10) :)</div></div><hr />
