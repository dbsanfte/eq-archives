<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Weberran</div><div class="date">01-15-2003, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking for someone capable of making the WE tunare armor (ranger one) and Tigerraptor armor.  I should be able to provide most if not all the parts needed. May take me a little bit (getting to WW to forage drake eggs for example).<br />
<br />
  But if there is someone doing combines and or/selling the parts let me know. I am going to have to do some comparisons between armors so not too sure yet what I am looking for (probably boots, cloak, gloves)...<br />
<br />
SO if want send an email or post here.</div></div><hr />

I go to SS to forage drake eggs and I get about a 12 or 13 an hour.  Wurm eggs too for baking.  And you no longer need the key to get in and out of SS so I find it far easier than hanging around WW.<br />
<br />
Look me up in about a week. I'm currently at 170 (178 with geerlok /shrug) but i'm gearing up for a 600 combine run of acrylia studded, solstice robes, arctic wyvern, cobalt drake, and tigerraptor.  I'm hoping this will push me up over 200 skill mark.  /em prays to Tunare er actually... prone on the ground begging Tunare to exert influence over the RNG...  :twisted: <br />

I am indifferent I think currently in SS, need to off a bunch of wolves and hit some more KAel raids i think. But good enough to zone in though.<br />
<br />
  Ill have to do some more research tonight on comparisons.  sabertooth hide from OT right&gt;? Ill have too look more, tigerraptor sorta cheap to make, tunare worse with the BD part needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway thanks for the reply and ill keep in touch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mnemosyne</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 04:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excellent Sabertooth hides are what is needed for the BD armor.  They have a chance to drop off any tiger on Kunark.  I've heard the best drops rates are in Traks Teeth.  I've never killed anything there except the mobs for my OS key so i dont know how well that zone solos or what not, however.<br />
