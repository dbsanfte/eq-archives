<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LeonneOfInny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would like to express my appreciation to EQ Traders.  I did not realize how much I use the site until it was not available.  I'm even doing a monitary contribution, I'm so appreciative.<br />
<br />
My husband and I paid for a subscription to Allakhazam's website a while ago.  So when EQ Traders was not available, I went browsing their site to see if it was useful.  Their lack of data on trade skills was not suprising, but they added a new feature that I thought was just grand.<br />
<br />
I was trying to type this in response to &quot;blodgruv&quot; post about Complete Recipe Listings.  I think his idea has some merit, but I can also see the limitations.  Therefore, I have a recommend.<br />
<br />
At Allakhazam's site, his search (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/recipesearch.html) has one option that I found very valuable.  It has your tradeskill ability and the range in the trade skill you are looking for.<br />
<br />
When I'm looking for something, I don't want to look at things that are too far off my ability.  I have a 211 smithing, I don't need to see any recipes under 200 (unless I'm working on an order, in which case I just look up the bloody name of the piece), and I don't need to see the recipes that are at 250.<br />
<br />
My proposal to house ogre:<br />
If you have to do the site over again (may the gods allow you don't), then perhaps on your search engine, you can include a range of trivials, as well as make your Advanced Search easier to access (or maybe I'll just bookmark that area, so I don't steal bandwidth browsing through pages I don't need).  I'm really just trying to come up with ways you can reduce your bandwidth and we can access the information we need easier.  I've never used your advanced search because it doesn't search for what I need.  If I need information on who can use what, I'll go to Allakhazam's site where I pay for the info.  What I need is a reliable search of a tradeskills range, and where the supplies are at.<br />
<br />
So that's my 2 cents worth.  Well, actually, $5 US worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">erm, my two tiny copper, superfast...<br />
<br />
it is a very interesting idea, just speaking from a fellow user's point of view. <br />
<br />
But with all the stuff that's happened recently, and the, erm, moods people have been in recently... and not without really good reason, either... <br />
<br />
Don't be too surprised and/or hurt if they (IE, House Ogre Sir in specific) come back and say, 'not now. later.' <br />
<br />
At the very least, I imagine they have to get things back to the way they were, before trying to go further. <br />
<br />

wishes she had spare money for EQTC too. /sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LeonneOfInny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That's understandable Sanna, I'm just saying on the off chance they have to redo the site, I saw something that might be improved.  I know it's not a great time for feedback, but after seeing how another site does it, wanted to write it down somewhere static (message board) before I forgot about it.<br />
<br />
I have to say, I would hate to be in Rack9's spot right now.  After realizing how much I use EQ Traders, I wanted to give something in the hopes they stay around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the sugguestion.  <br />
<br />
Again, we're just not up to taking any sugguestions right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Currently I am not ready to impliment a login system that would allow that.  It is just so &quot;intrusive&quot; to do so.  It may be something to do in the future, but I think there are other good ideas to deal with first.<br />
<br />
And the site itself is in no need of being redone.  Just maybe some data.  So all the code that makes the data viewable was fully up to date (it is on my personal computer)  it was just the DATA that is now out of date.</div></div><hr />
