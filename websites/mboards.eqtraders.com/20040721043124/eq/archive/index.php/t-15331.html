<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Some say the caves in JP, but I've had HORRIBLE luck there.  I got most of mine from Lavastorm.<br />
<br />
Helps though if you can track in lavastorm, or pbae the PHs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In Jaggedpine there are two cave systems - one is full of darkpaw gnolls (don't go there) and the other one has the good guy gnolls, the zone boundary to Nedaria's Landing, basilisks, and basilisk genitors.  The genitors drop eggs and usually drop a lot of them - I think I have had 5 drop at a time.  <br />
<br />
Those basilisks are a lot tougher than the others that drop eggs.  The ones in Lavastorm, Rathe, and Butcherblock are lower level - but if you can kill the ones in Jaggedpine (genitors and regulars) with no down time - go there.  You'll get stacks quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Liandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the basilisks in the brell gnoll caves in JP, as froni said, are the best ones to try.  if you cant find any genitors (the only ones to drop eggs) up just kill the normal ones.  there seems to be a 1 in 4 chance of the next pop being a genitor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lushissx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">fought in JP for about 2 hours last night, chain pulling with a group. Got 27 Basilisk eggs.  Now thats a lot of dough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Deedolith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">thanks for the answers, i don't think my level 65 enchater will have any troubles there )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I 3rd, 4th, whatever the vote for Jaggepine. I made 250 Baking there on the Casseroles using the Genitor Eggs exclusively. JP is a Druid Baker's paradise :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Trixzie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">True! JP caves &gt;anywhere else for the eggs :D</div></div><hr />

Lol. =) Or, drag a friendly forager to Western Wastes to forage for big eggs. One dragon egg got me through 200-250 doing picnics.<br />

One.</div></div><hr />

Not when making egg batter :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>myss miou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">if you have sense animal spell , lavastorm is a great place.<br />
<br />
with sense animal you target only 2 type of creature in the zone ( lava crawler and lava basilik). So you plow none stop and 50% of the time you kill a lava basilik , and they drop from 0 - 6 egg per kill. <br />
<br />
i got 21 egg in like 20ish minutes max (im a lv 65 beastlord)<br />
<br />
PS. a good tip is to kill any mob in your way to your target to help speed up repop ( since you kill them in like 2-5 sec).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lyinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you can track, or can use sense animals as someone suggested, then Lavastorm. It doesn't take my druid long at all to get a stack or two of eggs there for my necro, who is my baker.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I take my druid to lavastorm, charm the firescale, and track basilisks until I'm satisfied :) <br />
<br />
I did genitors for a while but the respawn time is boring even if they do drop a bunch at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kaaba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">They fixed the wurm/dragon/drake egg to batter conversion, one stack of any of those eggs will do a whole lot of GoD baking now.</div></div><hr />
