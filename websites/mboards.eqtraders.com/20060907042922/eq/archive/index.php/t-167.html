<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnexus</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 09:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, hardest part of that one minus actually getting the tailoring skill. Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Ladinea</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 02:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes they are no drop.  Though if you go to CS alot of times you will hear ones say that they are on the corpse's to go loot if you need them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saruton</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 03:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With a high enough MR i didnt had any problems with the Sirens and the drop rate was reasonable. Thou the Whiskers were a major pain to get. Had to kill about 250 Dire Wolfs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Craftah</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">High enough MR seems to be 110 or so, although with 150+ you can also survive when they tash you.<br />
<br />
Worst is when they tash you, and then start dispelling. I usually have 15 buffs up (enchanters can do this pretty easy) inlcuding both Enduring Breath (Everlasting Breath where are you?) and Illusion Water Elemental so if one drops the other is still there.<br />
<br />
I solod all the sirens for my 6 attempts at the sixth shawl as a 50/51 Enchanter with only a few deaths.</div></div><hr />

Since i could track and see cons, i just went after the green ones. Almost nothing they threw at me stuck, even while tashed. They did more damage to me melee, then with spells. and that was very little.<br />
Didnt take but about 20 kills to get enough for 2 attempts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've heard the sirens on the 2 ends of the zone have VERY different drop rates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chenier</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've hunted the ones by the SS tower and the ones near the tunnel to SG and have seen about the same drop rate.<br />
<br />
I prefer the ones by the SS tower just because there are more them (3 on the beach and 3 or 4 under water right there, 2 on the back side facing away from the bay).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niellya</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just stay away from the Enchantresses until you are at least 54 and you should be okay.  Of course that's from a wizard's (wizardess'?) viewpoint.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Woodeckt</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hunted them with a 56 Beastlord when I was 52. We had no problems and my resists were not close to 100 at all. <br />
<br />
The beastlord would go pull and I would root and dot while his pet whacked on them. I also have Shimmering Terror Hide Boots with extended range on them so I can fight casters at usually a greater range than they can cast on me. I did find out last night that the casters in Skyfire can reach me OUCH.</div></div><hr />

They beefed them up to keep quadding down - in theory limiting the number of shards entering for the cleric epic.  However, most quadders just quad around the chromas - and eventually have a zone with a LOT of chromas in it until a reset :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gummo</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried hunting some sirens last night (53 shaman) and took out one of the Enticers easily.  It didn't even land one spell on me with ~120MR.  Unfortunately, when I started moving toward where I assumed it died (I was hunting the ones near SS and stayed on the top of the cliff the whole fight) the Enchantress in the same camp proceded to do what Enchantresses do best (stun/charm/mez/nuke/dispell 8 of my junk buffs/etc...) and I was lucky to gate with 10% HP left.<br />
<br />
I'm already 54 and I'll probably wait untill 56 to try again, but I want to make sure next time goes a little smoother.  Does anyone have any tips on how to get the Enticers away from the camp before they die so I can actually loot the next one I kill?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inien of Vazaelle</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lvl 59 when I was killing them to get a walrus skin drum for a friend.<br />
<br />
I got the ones by Skyshrine while a group of friends tackled the ones by the Grotto zoneline.  I managed to loot about 8 spell scrolls, 3 horns, 5 necklaces, and a few gems, and one siren hair (I already had my 8th shawl at the time so I didn't need it, and noone else in the other group needed so I auctioned to the zone).  My friends killing by the Grotto zone got...nothing.   :mrgreen:  Drums must be insane rare.  I tend to think that the ones near Skyshrine drop stuff more often.  Besides, they're also lower level and an easier kill, so go pick on them anyway.   ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">llaffer</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've so far only hunted the ones by SG zone.  4-pop with 20 minute respawn time.<br />
<br />
The first time, it took 2 hours to get one hair to drop, and another hour for the 2nd.<br />
<br />
The 2nd time, one hair dropped on the first cycle, and one dropped on the 2nd cycle, so got both in 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
Both times, I had help, couldn't do them alone at L51 / L52.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the ones near the SS tower... have a druid pull em, chanter mez off, then druid snare, chanter fear... nuke till done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slimb hcarvul</div><div class="date">12-21-2002, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a 57 wizard - I'm hunting the ones near SS.  Sirens/Enticers/Enchantresses.   I generally resist all of their spells (even the enchantresses who still con dark blue) - once tashed they may get the occasional nuke on me, but otherwise I've been charmed once which immediately broke.  Still no hairs though after about 30 sirens, back to farming em some more :)  No whiskers after about 100 wolves either :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pulled them near SS tower to top with Snare, Best DoT while ascending, Root when at top and then back out of range while DoT works, move back in to recast and wait.<br />
<br />
MR of 110 or so I did get charmed once for a brief period but survived with Cleric backup - 2 hairs plus other assorted loot in &amp;lt;2 hours with decent xp as well.<br />
<br />
Combined 6th Shawl on first attempt - KEI, shaman DEX buff for kicks and Tailoring skill of 127 no Geerlok. I was as lucky with the combine as I was getting the parts.<br />

<br />
Sirens.. yeh.. takes a couple hours usually to get 2 hairs... unless you get lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cylestria</div><div class="date">12-28-2002, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a good group of guildies helping find the siren hairs (pally, chanter, ranger, druids, mostly 50+ etc), we hunted near Skyshrine, first pulling up to the tower near the ramp, but a group near there got mad saying we were pulling siren's through them.  <br />
<br />
So, we went down to the beach right there, which meant clearing some bultharks or whatever they are.  Still, it worked out pretty good; we picked up about 6 siren hairs in a fairly short amount of time.  We only were there for an hour or two, and only that long because we were dorking around a little. ;)  We were pulling lots of sirens fast, from the water, from the beach, and the ranger brought some in from further away.</div></div><hr />

At 54 I can get my MR in the 120ish range, but I don't want to bother the attempt if I am gonna have 4 of them jump me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seamus</div><div class="date">12-30-2002, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Started pulling the Sirens near SS within the last month after I dinged 52. I pull from both sides of the cliff, the ones above water as well as below. The enitcers are cake as was posted, while seductresses are a bit more difficult. Enchantresses I harmony and pull around them, I want nothing to do with these ladies.<br />
<br />
Light blues don't seem to add so I pull without worry most of the time. If I get a dark blue Seductress or an Enchantress I just harmony and keep pulling. I've gone through 4 hair drops and failed both times at 158 tailoring (just brought it to 162, hoping that will make a diff). MR is &amp;lt;100 with resist magic and I am prob due for some more but so far I resist more than not. On occasion I'll get charmed but my DoTs continue to do their work so in the end its no worry.<br />
<br />
For being casters they sure do hit hard...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harliquinn</div><div class="date">01-05-2003, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Siren's weren't bad for me either. The Wolf Whiskers those sucked :) Probably close to 100 wolf kills to get both of mine. Luckily at 158 skill on my first attempt I made Shawl 6. I was so happy!<br />
<br />
Did sorta discover a little secret, or at least a way to play the RNG game and win. I noticed that I would often get a skill up right after missing a note on my INT/WIS song. (To get maximum INT I have to start Amplification every 30 seconds and then play my INT/WIS song). So sometimes I would get a missed note and then hit combine and wham, skill up. So I figured, well the chance to fizzle is low (5%) and the chance for a skill up is low (5%ish), so...knowing the streakiness of teh RNG, I did it on purpose a few times. Happened 3 times skilling up....<br />
<br />
So when I went to make my shawl, I did the same thing (Knowing my skill was far below the trivial and I was in the 5% range). I started/stopped my song a few times until I missed a note, closed my eyes and hit combine...came away with a shawl. I hope this helps others in the same situation (Using fizzles for spellcasters instead of missed notes).<br />

I have failed the 6th shawl 5 times now with a 165 skill + greelock. I will try for 5 more points of skill then  go back to hunting wolves.<br />
<br />
Hopfuly you will be able to help me with my 8th shawl soon. I have most of the materials to smith armor just need to get past this last tough tailoring combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dulsin</div><div class="date">03-21-2003, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried it and it worked! Maybe it was coincidence but after five failed attempts anything is worth a try.<br />
<br />
Of course I was with a druid last night who completed the seventh shawl on his second attempt with only a 128 skill.   :roll:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pojodan</div><div class="date">03-21-2003, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">4th time's a charm... I... guess....<br />
<br />
Sirens where the tough part for me..<br />
<br />
Manicors are easy and their manes are common drop while also dropable.<br />
Wolf whiskers I just zoned into GD from EW, sence animal, run, kill, sence animal, run, kill, repeat ad nausium.<br />
Sirens.. bleh.. at 56 I could handle them no sweat once I got the camp broke at SG zone so long as I had Guard of Druzzil on, which pumped my MR to 160.. Once it was gone I was stuck at about 110 MR which would resist most things, but my pet got charmed twice, I got charmed and mezed, nuked, and such numerous times... This was at lvl 56.  Managed to gather 4 hairs and failed both attempts.<br />
<br />
Went back yesturday and rocked the 8 near the SS portal for 2 hours, got 4 more hairs, and succeeded on the second!<br />
