<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering what the normal success rate on Stonewood Compound bows and the other bows are? My first 3 attempts so far since I got 250 in fletching, using my grandmaster fletching knife and geerlock for any chance of extra boost, has been 0 for 3... am I having really back luck or what?<br />
<br />
Also my understanding is level and skill is the only thing that matters for a success on a combine.. I am level 65 with my skill maxed out.. i have heard stuff like Dex for fletching helps, STR for smithing etc... I was wondering if there are any stats I should max out before I try again? <br />
<br />
Thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">stats affect skill ups not success. The PoP bows run about a 50% chance of success. I made 2 out of 2 though :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can say for myself that I have gone 2/3 on the Stonewood bows. I did a lot of research before hand - and I can't say where it was - but I read Somewhere that it was thought that if you went Over your prime stat max (Wis, Int, or Dex) it would wrap around and bring you to a lower success rate spot - much like your stat was actually Lower than it was.<br />
<br />
For all three of my attempts - I set my gear up so that I had about a 253- 255 exactly for my Dex (my stat of choice). After my first two successes - I was convinced that it helps - especially since I'm lower level (made the bows at 52- 53rd level) and lower stat maximums.<br />
<br />
I have absolutely NO proof of this - just an observation I saw someone else make after a lot of searching - and tried it myself. It is certainly possible that the RNG was just nice to me and that the stat cap had nothing to do with it.<br />
<br />
For the sake of arguement - I was using a geerlok also, but have not made my GM knife yet.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps your skillup attempts!<br />

Modifiers do not stack, so wielding geerlok and trophy doesn't do you anything.  I was wondering about that and was hopeful that they would stack.<br />
Is there an original post of someone testing these?<br />
You would just think that having the trophy and then using a geerlok in a recipe would give you the double benefit...oh well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A L5 wet behind the ears naked ogre with 240 fletching skill + geerlock has as much chance of success as you do (L65, all skills maxed, 250 fletching skill, holding your lucky rabbits foot, doing combines on your birthday + geerlock &lt;Add any other thing you think affects combine success rates here&gt;).<br />
<br />
252 skill in fletching is the only thing that affects outcome. Anything else is myth.<br />
<br />
The stonewood combine (I got mine on the 3rd try) has a trivial of 300+ (maybe the new interface will list all true trivials over 250, until then we can only guess at the actual number). So expect to fail often.<br />
<br />
Stats class:<br />
at 50% success rate the chance of 3 consecutive fails is 12.5% (same chance as 3 consecitive successes)... BUT we dont know what the actual success rate is (it would require studding 1000's of combines)<br />
at 30% success rate the chance of 3 consecutive fails is 34%.<br />
<br />
blah.. blah.. blah etc. (I read a good thread on this some time ago that gave formulas.. I suggest you search for it and read it).</div></div><hr />

To save time in the future..come to THE tradeskill site.. and research here.  Your research here could start with the thread in the FAQ forum titled: Stats and Tradeskills<br />

<br />
No need to search past the thread in the FAQ forum that is titled: Skill modifying items (Geerlok, etc.)<br />
<br />
With the addition of several skill level restricted combines from Pop, it was proven that modiifyer items DO NOT stack.  Should you wish to disbelieve the FAQ stating this also, you can dig around in the Tailoring and Smithing forums to see how they determinied that... it was really easy.<br />
<br />
As for the the success rate? Well, 3 combines is not even the beggining of a scratch to find out the actual succes rate.  Jaasper's_Stat_Class_01 does a good job of explaining.</div></div><hr />

 I have no reason to disbelieve it...I totally respect the time and effort that others put in to finding out all the related issues on the trade skills.  I just basically like to read the &quot;stories&quot; of what people did to find things out and then use the result information to my benefit...like everyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>AbitooXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The other day, myself and another officer where going through our bags...  He is a 250 fletcher, I am 240.<br />
<br />
Combined, we went something like 5 of 7 on stonewood, 2 for 2 on airstrand, and 6 of 9 on obsidianwood.<br />
<br />
Overall, I think we hit a good seed on the random number generator, after watching all the successes, I was amazed to make the airstrand (was about the 8th bow in a row).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">this came up here not too long ago in one of the forums... bu ti don't remember the name of that thread.. the rest are probably buried back a year on the boards.<br />
<br />
The basic gist is... you have a couple combines restricted that require a modified 220 skill.<br />
<br />
at 210 natural skill, no mods.. the attempt cannot be made<br />
at 210 with a geerlok (5% - 10 points.. adjusted to be 220)... the attempt can be made<br />
at 208 with a geerlock (5% - 10 points.. adjusted to be 218).. the attempt cannot be made<br />
at 208 with a 10% modifying item, the combine can be made<br />
at 208 with a trophy and geerlok (5% on both).. the attempt cannot be made...<br />
<br />
so they don't stack....was really easy once the restricted combine were introduced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vallorean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">hehe  I feel bad to kind of high-jacking this thread to learn more on the modifier items, but thank you very much for the added info Moraganth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">thanks for the info everyone.. I am giving up on attempts, my next 3 attempts were failures also, I maxed out my Wis, Dex, Cha, had all my modifiers, even did a little prayer before each attempt, and no luck... 6 failures at 35K ea = one broke individual... hope others have better luck than me</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sadly, those two things are as useful (less) as the other.  PoP combines are exceptionally annoying when they fail.</div></div><hr />
