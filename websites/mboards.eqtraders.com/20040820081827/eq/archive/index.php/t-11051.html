<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>diverdwn030</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am having trouble leveling.  My current brewing skill is 190.  It has been stuck there for it seems like 1000 combines.  What am I doing wrong?  <br />
<br />
My Trade Skiller is a 41 Druid.  Her wiz is 210 without C3. (can’t get it any more since the nerf)  I used the Faydwire Shakers to get to 187 and then switched to Minitaurs Brew.  I have made stacks upon stacks of these things and have only advanced 3 levels.  It is getting quite frustrating!!  I have also made some Quenos Tea with a 75% success rate so I am creating things that are above my current Triv Level.  What am I doing wrong?   <br />
<br />
Any help would be most appreciated!</div></div><hr />

Zone to another brew barrell...<br />
<br />
Try recipes closer to your current skill level ... at 190, try Grobb's Liquidized Meat.. (Trivial 216)... Try Surefall Ranger's Trail Juice<br />
(Trivial 203)<br />
<br />
But most of all keep trying.<br />
<br />
In answer to the question:<br />
<br />
What am I doing wrong?<br />
<br />
You are doing nothing wrong. The RNG is just be extremely rude to you. Sorry... that is the way it is. Next batch you try will give you 3 skill ups in a row... then nothing for the next 40 combines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Might I also suggest you get your WIS up as close to 255 as possible? It really really does make a difference!<br />
<br />
I know it's expensive (2 WIS casters and 2 INT casters on my account), but it's necessary to lessen the pain of skilling up. Especially on MHB!!!!<br />
<br />
*rubs wrists for the millionth time*<br />
<br />
Get your Wisdom up as close to 255 as possible. You might also consider leveling to 46 for KEI as well. (My cleric is 41 also, so that's on my short list of to do's. :) )<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ziela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Every skill so far seems to hit a roadblock around 190 for me.  Just be glad you only need cheap vendor bought components, if I have to burn through as many tailoring combines at that level as brewing and pottery took I am NOT going to be happy:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It seems to be the case that the range from 188 to roughly 220 is the hardest for all skills, so if you are having trouble in the 190s, that's not surprising at all. <br />
<br />
It seems to vary from skill to skill slightly, but in general, 188 is the start of true &quot;hell levels&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arghargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Seems like 1000, or really is 1000?  Attempts per skill-up always go up as you appoach 200 in any trade skill.  I did nothing but minatour hero's brew from 186 to 200.<br />
<br />
Get your wisdom up is my best advice to you.<br />
