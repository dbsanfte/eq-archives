<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sanctu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone noticed an increase in zone specific fish while drinking?<br />
<br />
I've always wondered why the Brell's Fishing Pole would summon Ale, besides the obvious Brell reference?  And there are all those comments about spilling my beer... <br />
<br />
Then a concept entered my head.  &quot;Fish stories.&quot;  Maybe drinking actually influences they type of fish you get.  So, I started summoning ale and drinking it.  It seemed like i got more Storm Salmon that way, although lowering my Wis didn't do good things for my skill ups.  I didn't notice a big increase, and wasn't drinking that much, but it did seem to.<br />
<br />
Now, I do not keep careful track of such things.  I cannot tell you exactly how many casts I've done or how many fish I've caught.  But many of you seem to.  Have you noticed a difference?  Woudl you be interested in testing the theory?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zarevil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it is funny that you mention that, I was goofing off at end of night and kept myself at the &quot;you cannot consume any more&quot; with the summoned ale in PoS, ended up with a stack of storm salmon from 5 stacks of bait.  This is at 200 fishing.  I did seem to catch more of the Storm salmon when I started drinking.  <br />
