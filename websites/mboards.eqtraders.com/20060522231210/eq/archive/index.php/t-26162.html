Spent about 2 hours in twilight sea (vas ren area) and tenebreous mountains, and got a total of 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Orelli Virbonus</div><div class="date">04-22-2006, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Twilight Sea has the best drop rate in my experience, but I was there for the wind essence and the chunks of condensed ice were just a bonus. Do you need the ice specifically? Chunks of condensed shadow are a lot easier to come by in Shadeweaver's Thicket, and trivial the same as the other pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grolyn</div><div class="date">04-22-2006, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, shadow is better for fletching skillup.  Go to the cave area in shadeweaver and if the brown/grey men are up you should start killing them at about 5pm game time.  Any mob that pops after 7 pm game time will be the black ones that drop shadow (grey/brown don't drop any).  Any repops after 7 am game time will be back to grey/brown men.<br />
<br />
In between the spawn cycle, you can hit the forge there to convert the chunks to arrowhead and work on fletching if you brought the shafts and parts ahead of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gardeltron</div><div class="date">04-22-2006, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the help. Unfortunately I do need chunks of condensed ice for the barbarian expert cultural armor. I was hoping to skill up all the way doing cultural armor, but it looks like I'm going to have to switch to ornate chain for a while until I get to high enough to start working on master.</div></div><hr />
