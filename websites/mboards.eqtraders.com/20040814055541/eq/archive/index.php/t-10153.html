<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As most of you all know, the ground spawns in Kaladim yield uneven numbers of underfoot mushrooms (10) to strange dark fungus (7). Kaladim constitutionals require equal numbers of each, so there are 3 extra underfoot mushrooms per spawn cycle. I've been saving these all along, but they are quickly cluttering up my mule's bank account.<br />
<br />
According to the database, aside from Kaladim constitutionals, the only other recipe that uses underfoot mushrooms is underfoot brown (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=4959&amp;menustr=), which is useless to me for skilling up as I am already a GM 250 brewer.<br />
<br />
Are there any other uses for these extra underfoot mushrooms, or should I just toss them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Furyrpied</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No.. don't destroy them... just find some aspiring brewer and make their day!<br />

*just wish you where on my server*<br />
:(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, my brewer goes down there, pickes up 100 blue (70 red) mushrooms, then, as the respawn comes up, I just pick up the red ones till I get to 100 of them too. :)<br />
<br />
You don't HAVE to pick up more blue than you need. :)</div></div><hr />

Or, you can just stop picking up the extra blue ones when you get to the number you want!Yes, I am already well aware of that option. :) I'll most likely start doing that from now on, if in fact there is really no other use for the extra mushrooms. <br />
<br />
However, up to now I've been picking them up &quot;just in case&quot; they were useful for something else. Back then, the reverse recipe lookup database wasn't available, so it was hard to verify whether or not they could be used for other combines. I would have felt pretty silly if I had left them on the ground and it turned out later that I needed them for something else.<br />
<br />
Now that the database is live and I can see that they're only used for underfoot brown, I'll probably destroy (or give away, as suggested) my current stash. Before I do that, however, I just wanted to double check and make sure there is no other reason to keep them. I vaguely recall reading somewhere (maybe here?) someone said to hang on to the extra mushrooms for *something*, but I don't remember what that something was (maybe a quest?) nor can I find the original thread. If anyone remembers or knows what the person was referring to, that would be great.</div></div><hr />

Picked my first shrooms last night and had the same delema.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ChaseFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There is a quest in Katta Castellum to give these or boot beer to the Dwarven Shieldson brothers to increase various Katta factions (lowering various Seru factions).

There is a quest in Katta Castellum to give these or boot beer to the Dwarven Shieldson brothers to increase various Katta factions (lowering various Seru factions). No other known use for Underfoot Brown at this time.Thanks - that's what I was looking for. I'm not too familiar with the pros/cons of raising/lowering various Luclin factions, but I'll do some research to see if this is a quest I'd be interested in doing. Thanks again!</div></div><hr />

Beer for the Guards<br />
<br />
<br />
I have not looked into Luclin faction too much either...  from the comments below on alla's, it sounds like you raise SOME katta factions while lowering 'Nathyn' faction, and he lives IN katta... yeah, it's a little iffy. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you wanted to be nice, you could just brew up the underfoot brown and gift it to an aspiring 250 brewer.... well, they'd still need the other, but it's the thought that counts? or maybe just sell it cheap on a trader, maybe someone does want to do the Beer for the Guards quest....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Afierra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok i've been looking around kaladam for some time now and i cant find anything spawning on the ground..i've been alone in the zones for up to 1-1.5 hr's so no one else is getting them.  Anyone know any spots that seem to be &quot;hotspots&quot; for finding the underfoot mushrooms and fungus?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>merkell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Uhhh <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Afierra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Can ya try to explain where that is? lol, dont know the zone all that well..i've been running around expecting to see them laying on the path ways :P /bonk.
