<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ilona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, after getting 5/20 on solstice robes WITHOUT geerlok and thinking that was darned annoying, I decided I might as well try burning some BD's.  Results (225 skill + geerlok) were:<br />
1/2 Tunarean Soldier Sleeves<br />
1/1 Tunarean Soldier Tunic<br />
1/2 Tunarean Soldier Leggings<br />
<br />
Still want the cloak to complete, but let just say that Gwen is looking VERY pretty in green and gold ;)<br />
<br />
Decided then that tonight was the night for REALLY burning the BD's.<br />
Results (214 + geerlok) were:<br />
1/1 Blessed Mithril Bracer<br />
1/1 Blessed Mithril Boots<br />
0/5 Blessed Mithril Vambraces<br />
0/1 Blessed Mithril Bracer<br />
<br />
Results are firmly situated on Am's body, and won't be moving!<br />
<br />
Guess my luck ran out :D <br />
<br />
Still, all in all I'm very happy with the way things went - now I just need vambraces and greaves for Am, the green of the blessed mithril and the turquoise of the koada'dal just don't *quite* go :D</div></div><hr />

I'm 243 + geerlock and I was 0 for 4 last night.  I was 1 for 1 on BP and 1 for 1 on greaves.  It has been my experience that bracers are the most difficult piece of Blessed Mithril to make.<br />
