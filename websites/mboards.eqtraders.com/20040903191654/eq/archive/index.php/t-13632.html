<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aquila Swiftspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi Brewers,<br />
<br />
Well, today I went to lovely Halas to do some brewing, mino brews, to be precise.<br />
<br />
Being short on bag spaces/slots, I bought enough ingredients for a one stack run, sat down and brewed it up.  All good.<br />
<br />
But when I went back to the vendor with yeast, she showed yeast in her inventory, but said that the item I wanted was all sold out.<br />
<br />
I bopped to PoK, bought some... and since the Pok brew barrels were busy, eventually ended up in Halas...  where I bought a stack of yeast, and brewed...  and when I went back, she was out of stock again.<br />
<br />
Is this Sony's way of telling me I should spend my AAs on something other than tradeskills??<br />
<br />
I checked back through this MB area, but haven't found any info on this.  Has someone else experienced this problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dahna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, this happened to me a few time, I though it was a new system test to prevent too much macroing so i didnt /bug (there is no &quot;bug&quot;, the vendor is just answering the she is out of stock, like the supply quest). But as i noticed that the amount of yeast to buy until you get the message was random, I sent a small notice.<br />
<br />
If this system is spread to the entire vendor, it would add a bit of &quot;realism&quot;, but for sure it would screw a lot of tradeskillers.<br />
<br />
I think this was only applyied to this npc because of the MHB material location (all the npc are gathered in the same place).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aquila Swiftspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, the idea that they're trying to make things difficult for macro-ers makes some sense, Dahna.  I hadn't thought of that, really.<br />
<br />
I guess I'll just buy a couple stacks of yeast at a time, and hope that she's willing to sell me what I want when I want it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tradeskills in Halas have been buggy like that for me &amp; one other person that I know about. I don't recall exactly, but it was one of keep trying the vendor, or camping/zoning that reset them. For what it's worth, I trived MHB's tonight, 216 to 248 &amp; bought lots of yeast, so it's not a persistant problem.</div></div><hr />
