<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>FennyMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">lot of times i would like to just find out what new things have been added.  anyway to do this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not a mod or db person, but I imagine the easiest way for us to see new additions to the db would be to read the DB submissions forum of these boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Currently our database does not track -WHEN- an item or recipe is added. It might be reasonable to add a couple of fields...<br />
<br />
Entry Date<br />
Modified Date<br />
<br />
To the two primary tables... And from them build a couple of scripts that would generate lists of &quot;New&quot; and &quot;Updated&quot; items and recipes. <br />
<br />
Technically it is possible...<br />
<br />
Note however I said the two PRIMARY Tables. We have supporting tables... (Recipe Components, Recipe Alternate Successes, Recipe Alternate Failures,  etc) To be complete it would require each of these various tables to be also updated.<br />
<br />
On the surface it sounds simple.  But there are plenty of tricky things to consider beneath.<br />
<br />
And even if this is all implemented... then there is the consideration of the additional Bandwidth consumed by people browsing the &quot;new&quot; and &quot;Updated&quot; lists. <br />
<br />
The idea is not without merit. It is a GOOD idea. But I am still way behind in getting the GoD Items and Recipes added. <br />
<br />
And Ngreth I know is working on implmenting various fixes and truely small, but useful updates. I would not want to distract him to add this new functionality that could easily -break- the current data entry/edit forms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">And that brings up more questions.<br />
<br />
how LONG is something new?<br />
<br />
MUST the page show something, even if there has been nothing new for months?  (not likely but posible)<br />
<br />
AND would it be ok to take it down when  there is a new expansion? We have the POTENTIOAL for hundreds of new items in one day (or week) and it would just plain add too much bandwidth to the site.<br />
<br />
Curently I am looking at ways to reduce bandwidth... and curently that would INCREASE bandwidth... at times when we already have low bandwidth it would lower the bandwidth...</div></div><hr />
