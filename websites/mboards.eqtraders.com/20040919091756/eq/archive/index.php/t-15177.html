You can tinker any time you want, but you cannot gain any skill till 16+.<br />
<br />
Are you asking why 16, as opposed to 20?  Or 8?  Then I refer you to the other response, &quot;Why do snakes kick?&quot;<br />
<br />
Why can a level 16 gnome become a GM, but shaman's alchemy skill is level-limited?  I'd love to have a 16 shaman to make all the fun potions.  Or at least do the same with tinkering so there aren't any tinker-bots, which will make my level 65 GM Tinker mean more.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Be glad you're not a shaman attempting to master Alchemy.<br />
<br />
A shaman can't start Alchemy until 25th level.  And they're limited to a skill level of 5 at 25th level with a 5 point gain every level.<br />
<br />
So a shaman who wants to reach 200 Alchemy (maximum skill) has to wait until they reach 64th level.<br />
<br />
(And I think there's some kind of rule saying that they have to wear bear heads all the time.)</div></div><hr />

Basically wondering why you can't gain skill until level 16.  And same with alchemy and shamans being level restricted.  Does the same apply to rogues?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes rogues are level capped also though they get poison making much earlier than 25 so they can max out somewhere in their mid 50's.</div></div><hr />

Them's the rules. Might as well ask why the rose blooms, why the jasmine gives its scent, or why the bird flies.</div></div><hr />

Therefore, they added the (artificial) level 16 requirement for opening up the ability to raise skill.  Its there.  Accept it for what it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
back in the old days people used to keep lvl one characters as their money makers. some races were just better at tradeskilling because they had high cha and were smart so they learned faster. Thier main character might have been a melee...<br />
<br />
and so you can see where im going.<br />
<br />
anyway, god saw these lvl 1 200 skill characters and perceived it as bad. Alas he thus put a stop to it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
hope that apeases your young curious mind.<br />
<br />
have a nice day!</div></div><hr />

How hard would it be to nail jell-o to the wall?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Depends...is it regular jello or jigglers?!:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rerashyaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">less hard than you'd think, given the use of a nailgun that's been tweaked just right to allow firing from a distance, and maybe had the air pressure raised just a bit.<br />
<br />
Um.... I never lived on a construction site... no, really!<br />

<br />
BTW - What color Jello?<br />
<br />
Or, you could just nail the box (full) to the wall, that would work, too.  You didn't say it had to be made.  :D</div></div><hr />

Very easy &amp; simple answer,<br />
<br />
Why not?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Oooooh...... OK, I can't resist.<br />
<br />
You can't just nail frozen Jello either.<br />
<br />
In it's frozen form it would be too brittle and would shatter on the first blow. You need to drill a hole in the frozen jello then drive the nail (or preferably a wood screw) through the hole to prevent the Jello breaking into a thousand pieces. Remember not to put too much pressure on the drill bit as that too could cause a fracture. It's not neccesary to put pressure on the drill anyway since the heat generated melts the jello and the bit just slides through if you use a bit of patience.<br />
<br />
For my money, frozen nitrogen is the best freezing medium, none of this shove it the freezer overnight malarky. Of course that does mean you have to take extra precautions like wearing gauntlets. Try explaining why you have a block of supercooled jello stuck to your hands down the hospital.<br />
<br />
Ahhhhh the pleasure of tangental threads - you never know where they will end up.</div></div><hr />

I said semi-solid.  Not completely frozen, but frozen enough to hold itself.  :)</div></div><hr />
