<br />
consider your self lucky. you will reach skill levels where it may take hundreds of combines to get a skill up.</div></div><hr />

I wish I got skill ups like that. I'm over 300 skill up combines in blacksmithing at 201 with no increase. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
3 skillups per 10 combines, and something is wrong. Let me stop laughing and catch my breath.<br />
<br />
 lol</div></div><hr />

-Go to bed at a reasonable hour with a huge grin on my face...<br />
-Pinch myself repeatably until my arms were covered in bruises...<br />
-Temporarily cease breathing...<br />
-Break out in a cold sweat, fever and experience irregular heart-beat...<br />
-Come to enlightenment of the universe...<br />
<br />
Most likely all of these things would happen while i simultaneously won the state lottery and got hit by lightning twice in a row. <br />
<br />
I hope that illustrates how little you should worry. <br />
<br />
But seriously...Your skillup rate will steadily go down, most noticably around 180 or so from what I have read and experienced.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

After all who would/could complain about getting 3 skill ups in 10 combines...<br />
<br />
Assuming that is the case, Avarre what FS piece are you working on (how close to triv is what I am after)?  Is your Strength your highest stat here (i.e is it your main stat over int/wis).<br />
<br />
Also, assuming my assumption (err) was right, thats 33 to 40 combines per skill up.  While not outstanding, thats also not an unacceptable ratio with such a low smithing stat.<br />
<br />
When I took my Halfling Warrior to 175 ages ago, he had around 175 wis, and had the same kind of skill ups per combines.  When I then took my Dwarf Cleric to 175, the skill ups came very much quicker with a wis of 220ish.  That was both on banded, but I feel that they provide a good example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eumerin</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He's only at 144 skill level.  While my smithing skill ups were in the far, far distant past (and I didn't have any tradeskill gear at the time), my tailoring is currently at 126, with a wis of around 160 (can't remember off the top of my head), and 1 for 3 would be just about right (maybe a touch better than what I did).  With a slightly higher stat score, and a slightly higher skill level, I can see one for three on his part, particularly if he had a good run with the RNG.<br />
Just expect it all to go south REAL soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avarre</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay thank you everyone for the repl but you may want to notice my skill is like lvl 144 hehe?Also it's more like erm 3 skill ups in 40 plus combines,i was really tired yesterday so i remembered wrongly.<br />
<br />
Strength is my highest stat.So assuming from all the replies i received,this is nothing to worry about i guess hehe?This is the first time i'm attempting to lvl up a tradeskill and all i did was look up guides so i don't have that much on hands experience as yet.<br />
<br />
Would anyone care to advise me from their experience how to rise a lvl faster?I actually started smithing on the day i posted you see? =p<br />
<br />
In addition i smithed again today and got 29 skill ups in 119 combines so i am now siting at lvl 171,i'm pretty happy so far but me being a poor sob is quite low on cash now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArrakeenNaedShoj</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately the only way to increase your chances effectively for skillups is to increase your primary stat. Of course since you are using strength for yours you can do it the relatively cheap way of drunken smithing. With some minor strength gear, a buff from a shaman, and maybe a frost giant beard or potion, you should easily be able to get your strength to 255 using alchohol. <br />
<br />
Heck would give a little change of pace with the smithing, and it can give you the skill so you can make your own tempers when you get to where you need them.</div></div><hr />
