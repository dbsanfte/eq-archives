The Officer's Cloak is also 3% as is the Hero's Cloak, however the hero's cloak has Flowing Thought V, too, so I can't complain too much.<br />
<br />
Ive never heard of this cloak before. Ive seen some of the lower level ones, but FT 5?! Does anyone know where I can find information on this? I checked Allakhazam, and I either didnt look in the right spots, or its not there. <br />
<br />
P.S. The quote is in reguards to the Cat progresive quests.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cattywumpus</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The cloaks were extremely difficult to get due to the level of raid force needed.  I have never seen one myself although I have know of their existence since I started playing about a year ago.   <br />
<br />
The Garrison cloaks are still in the game and still have the tradeskill modifiers on them but the hero cloaks seem to have been removed (if any were ever completed).<br />
<br />
The officer's cloak is pretty nice and I intend to get mine as soon as I can catch the zone unconquered.</div></div><hr />
