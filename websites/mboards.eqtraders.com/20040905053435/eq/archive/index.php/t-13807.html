<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tashine2000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I opened the new tradeskill window for  Alchemy (using the collapsible bag) and first of all noticed many missing potion recipes. Not unexpected. However if I successfully make the recipes within the 'experiment' mode, they do not appear on the main new tradeskill listing, which is something I was expecting to happen.<br />
<br />
Another alchemist was having the same problem whilst online but different tradeskillers (such as a potter I think it was) confirmed that successful combines of unlisted recipes were resulting in those recipes being added to the new Tradeskill window listing.<br />
<br />
Does anyone else think this is a bug or have any helpful information please ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>unoeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes its bugged.  I tried it with several different potions.  Once again alchemy is poor red-headed step child of tradeskills. :(<br />
<br />
Maybe they'll fix it by the next expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>twylyght</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was so disappointed last night to open the window and only see 15 potions available to me.  Any ETA when they may have this fixed?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Belanar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You were using the default UI right? You could add recipies to other tradeskills?<br />
<br />
I've heard reports of new recipies not being added in custom UIs...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">See the sticky with the info from Tanker, the dev who designed the new UI:  here (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=13782).<br />
<br />
The most relevant part being: 4. Marking said recipes AutoLearn and CanLearn is a work in progress. A lot of recipes can (and probably will) get marked as one or the other in the near future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>unoeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, yes, they'll be marked in the future.<br />
<br />
It's still disapointing to find that you can't add ANY potions other than those already listed.  It's not just one or two, its all of them (tho admittedly I didn't try ALL of them, I did several of the most common including Blood of the Wolf, Kiva's Blistering Flesh, Ants Potion, ITU, etc.).  Anyone get one to work at all?<br />
<br />
Of all the potions you would think they would have got at least Blood of the Wolf right.<br />
<br />
I'm just feeling a wee bit left out; like everyone else got presents at Christmas except for Shaman.  On top of that, my shaman is a troll.  He doesn't even have a real city.  I still hate that Frog takeover thing. :/  Stupit frogs!  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Maddoc-the-Wayfarer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't feel too left out, all those with cultural skills didn't get flagged either.<br />
<br />
I was able to evaluate a large chunk of tradeskill products and assign &quot;CanLearn&quot; and &quot;AutoLearn&quot; flags to many of them. There are a bunch that have had flags added but weren't complete in time for data-lock for the Gates of Discord launch (shaman potions fall in this category). There are also some that I still have yet to evaluate (cultural falls into this category).<br />
<br />
You can expect another large chunk of changes to be made in the next live update -- Keep your eyes peeled on test as well, since the changes will make it there first.<br />

As always, feedback is good, keep it coming!<br />

<br />
Err... well... umm... heh... thanks Maddoc!  LOL, you gotta know misery loves company :)<br />
<br />
Any chance you can collapse Grobb on top of the frogs and make them move in with the Barbarians?  I figure then the Frogs would be just as miserable as the trolls!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Noooooo, please don't.  Not those slimy icky talking oversized bug control experiments that got out of control!  They'd get our nice clean snow all green and slimy!  But please feel free to collapse Grobb on top of the frogs and keel them all!!! Mwahaha!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rumluk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Speaking as one who has several Characters who all practice different Tradeskills. My Troll shaman has been unable to &quot;learn&quot; any recipes that I previously made lots of. Ant's Potions, Blood, Kilvas, Adrenaline Tap, none seem to be CanLearn marked. And no, it's not a UI bug. I too thought of that, and tried with the default. No go. Yet, my Wood Elf Ranger is capable of learning recipes not in his Fletching UI, same custom UI as the Shaman, and done on the same 'puter. Haven't tried any Cultural Fletching Recipes to see if they are learnable, but there are none listed in the UI for Wood Elf Fletching Containers. Here's hoping they get it fixed soon. I for one have been doing bug reports on all of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>unoeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Heh, check Maddok's reply Rumluk and note his title of &quot;Designer, EverQuest Live&quot;.<br />
<br />
That's why I was so surprised.  I don't think I've ever seen a designer respond on a msg board to a specific user.<br />
<br />
So as an afterthought, thanks Maddok for listening AND responding!  It truely does make me feel better knowing the reasons and when to expect a change.  It's nice to see the designers paying attention.  :)</div></div><hr />

Thank you, Maddoc.<br />
<br />
The only real issue I had was that the bearskin bag (the one that combines 5 and 10 charge potions) did not have the new interface at all.  Is that a bug?  Or did I mess up my UI somehow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Maddoc-the-Wayfarer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">That's a very good question, Tyck -- I'll have to look. I'll see what I can do to get that one to also work in the new UI.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Opiumn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ahh, good to see it isn't my UI.... again<br />
<br />
Guess I wait til next patch.... for the UI on my Shammy anyways...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gugek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've noticed that the store bought medicine bag and the foldable medicine bag sometimes can't learn the same recipes.  <br />
<br />
For example I can't get my foldable medicine bag to remember Blood of the Wolf (Trivial 37) while a store bought bag will remember learn the recipe no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>boojumhunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't think the bearskin bag needs a new interface.  It's pretty straightforward:  5 or 10 of the same item.<br />
<br />
It may be more clicks to use it with the new UI.  You'd have to close the medicine bag, open the bearskin bag (or close and reopen), select the right recipe... <br />
<br />
Now, I just move mine to the 1st inventory slot and when it's full, I click &quot;combine&quot; and stick the resulting multi-dose potion in a pack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>twistle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I made in experiment mode, and learnt, Blood of the wolf in my foldable med bag last night, and it was not showing up when searched for with &quot;wolf&quot; - this morning I discarded the foldable container and bought one from the store, and Blood of the Wolf is showing up as learnt. The characters seem to be flagged correctly, it is the container which is suffering from indigestion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>tashine2000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Using the store bought Medicine bag I was able to memorise all new recipes attempted (tried about 10 different potions so far and 100% of them were added to recipe list). Thanks for the info on this.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
Now what you probably haven't noticed... the new UI lets you do combines without having the old bag being empty.<br />
<br />
Yeahup.   You dont have to juggle stuff out of the bag.<br />
<br />
That is why I would like to have the new UI for it.   It's a pain in the neck emptying the 10 slots to just do a 5 potion combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>unoeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I agree Tyck.  It would be very handy.  Unloading the combine containers is a pain since I normally use them as one of the bags I carry stuff in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The collapsible/foldable containers do not seem to be able to actually learn recipes, I know that it did not work for my medicine bag, or for my spit.  I got the message that I learned the recipes, but, they were nowhere to be found.  Then, I bought a regular medicine bag, and lo and behold, the learned recipes were available.  Same with the spit, went to an oven, and there were my learned recipes.  There is most definitely a bug with the collapsible containers that has nothing at all to do with marking recipes as learnable.</div></div><hr />
