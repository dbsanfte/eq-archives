<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Silnyieni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya, folks. <br />
<br />
I asked Sil to post this for me since I don't have access to EQTraders for some reason. My ISP is goofing up bad. <br />
<br />
Well, folks, I have good news and bad news. The good news is that there's another way to get the Phylactery or Dark Phylactery. The bad news is that there's no tradeskills involved at all. <br />
<br />
While chatting with a friend about the Phylactery quest, I became convinced that we're missing something. Too many odds and ends just didn't stick. The quests known to come from Sir Ariam Arcanum in Befallen seemed incomplete somehow. There were too many untied loose ends. So I went back and investigated them. <br />
<br />
The Sir Ariam Arcanum quest led nowhere (other than to the free one-shot horse). I spent a lot of time trying to play around with the bridle and hand it to folks, to no avail. The Arrialla's Token quest, though, proved far more fruitful. Upon completing the quest, you get Arrialla's Token as a reward. It was believed to be the end of the quest. While playing around with this item, I tried handing it in to the Oracle; he returned it. <br />
<br />
Then, just for kicks, I gave it to the Guardian. He said, &quot;Thank you.&quot; At first I thought he just ate it. Then I noticed that he had handed me back the Phylactery. <br />
<br />
I'm still not entirely sure of the logical link between the two. If anyone wishes to investigate, they're welcome to try and find one. The quest text in the Alla's link above is complete, as far as I can tell. The best link I could come up with is that since the Token somehow preserved the life of Sir Ariam in Befallen, it acted kind of like the phylactery, which is why the Oracle (or more accurately, the Guardian) would want it. Another possibility is that Sir Ariam was entombed by the Burning Dead, who are lead by a dead sorceror named Marnek. I seem to remember the Oracle disliking Marnek, but I'm not sure. Finally, there could be some kind of relationship between the Guardian and Arrias Arcanum (Ariam's father) in Felwithe. <br />
<br />
What do you make of it? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hi, folks.<br />
<br />
I just want to verify that this is a legit post -- I was having trouble posting to EQTraders, so I asked Sil to post it for me.  I also ran the quest myself, so I can verify it works.  On Veeshan, there's already a 30-hour-plus waiting line for Sir Arrias in Felwithe, since he despawns on turn-in and has a three hour respawn time.<br />
<br />
Here are the relevant links to Alla's:<br />
<br />
The Sir Ariam Arcanum (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2172) quest <br />
<br />
The Arrialla's Token (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2180) quest<br />

<br />
<br />
This is true.  I personally verified it.<br />
<br />
I am now the owner of a phylactery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hehe.  i might get a phylactery now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's times like this that make me wish I hadn't completely totalled my Felwithe faction.<br />
<br />
Actually, no I don't. Every elf I killed was utterly worth it. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This doesn't have the sound of &quot;working as intended&quot; to me.  A word of caution: if something sounds like a bug but you do it anyway, it might be considered an exploit.  This method of getting the Phylactery is ridiculously easy compared to the previous method, enough to sound like a bug.  <br />
<br />
Just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>drakon87</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ashamed to admit but just did this. Feeling really stupid but yes it does work for now at least. Time to sit around and wait for a Gm to yell at me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">that might be but with a related reason for why it is working it might not be a bug.  i think they meant to include a non-ts way to get the phylactery.  this even sounds like it makes some rp sense.   :eek: didn't think they still had it in them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">While Verdandi makes a good point, I think I have to agree with eniamn - I do remember (although I could be remmebering wrong :P ) them saying there would be a non-tradeskill way to get the &quot;tradeskill reward&quot; part of the 'new' oracle quest.  This seems to fit that description.  It does seem far to easy comparatively, but seems a rather odd scenario for an accidental happening so, to me at least, it seems more likely to be legit than to be an exploit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I suppose my intent was to prevent people from saying &quot;I read it on EQ Traders so I figured it was okay&quot;.  I'd feel horrible if someone read it here, went and did it, and got in trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Dandi has a fair point, but I distinctly remember reading a comment by Sorcery, the screen name for the PR person at Swords and Sorcery (the publishers of the pen and paper EQ RPG), that there would be another way to get the Phylactery.<br />
<br />
Also, think about both the Phylacteries themselves and the effects on them.  We've always commented that they're nowhere near the reward they should be for the difficulty of getting them via the Grand Robe quest.  However, they're the perfect reward for a newbie quest -- the clickie is quite useful for a lower-level player. <br />
<br />
I am reasonably convinced that this method is supposed to exist -- but that's just my personal opinion.<br />
<br />
I just wish I could establish some kind of logical or in-game-text link between Sir Arrias and the Guardian of K'arnon.  Maybe I'll ask both of them about the other by name.  I didn't think of that at the time.  Since all these quests have a common source (the pen and paper RPG), maybe I should just spam the NPC's with questions about the other NPC's.  That is:<br />
<br />
/say Who is the Oracle of K'arnon?<br />
/say Who is the Guardian of K'arnon?<br />
/say Who is Arrias Arcanum?<br />
/say Who is Sir Arium Arcanum?<br />
etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Of course, having the phylactery/dark phylactery as a reward from a Befallen quest sort of implies that the mana crystals are used to upgrade it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dyllwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Haven't seen it mentioned, but I'm assuming you don't get the crystals doing the Befallen quest to get the Phylactery?<br />
<br />
So doing the combine is the only way to get the crystals, which in turn either upgrades the Phylactery, or allows us to make the Palatable Mana? Making the Palatable Mana would be the likely conclusion, they did include an entire line of spells for each type of mana vial, makes sense there's a way to make them and a use for each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>tnexus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Personally I wouldn't be surprised if somehow he's giving the wrong reward, and somehow he gives you something that if supposed to be with the phylactery and/or mana crystals. Definitely sounds like a glitch to me. That's one heck of a reward for no work. Keep in mind there are still 3 entries in Magelo in the middle of the Oracle quest numbers that have yet to be discovered that I'm 99.9% sure aren't for the one charge mana vials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aethia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Interesting - but as a necromancer, I'm hated in Felwithe and I don't recall any way of raising my faction (human necro), but I could have missed something.  I'll recheck Alla's on faction and see if I can even get into the Pally guild.<br />
<br />
Once servers come up I'll see if this still works or if SoE closed the loop hole. Seems a bit too easy way to get the phylacteries, but then again, I'm stuck on the ghoul for weeks now :(<br />
<br />
Edit: found various ways to increase the following factions:<br />
Anti-Mage<br />
Emerald Warriors<br />
King Tearris Thex<br />
Clerics of Tunare<br />
<br />
I hope this covers the people I may encounter on the way to the GM of the pally guild.  Yes, I can invis but I prefer walking through the front door as a welcome guest :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">To confirm, this new quest does not give you the mana crystals.  I still have no clue on those.<br />
<br />
Felwithe faction is indeed fixable, if somewhat tedious -- you have to stuff the dwarf Pandos in West Freeport with muffins.  Search Alla's for the Muffins for Pandos quest for more info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aethia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ok - Confirmed post patch, this alternate way still works.<br />
<br />
Edit - human female necromancer, threatingly con to Pandos.  It took 1700 muffins to go to ally.  He is on the Paladin/Cleric faction.  Guards conn'd dubious to me.<br />
<br />
Thanks to everyone here for working and solving the quest.  I'm still one book shy and one ghoul shy.  At least the pressure is off me to live in South Ro.  I'm tired of paranoid people thinking I'll take their AC &lt;sigh&gt;.<br />
<br />
Now for that last book, the robe and the REAL version of the phylactery :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sylphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Killing skeletal excavators spawns the skeletal foreman.  Once I spawned him right away after server-up, after killing only three excavators, but another time it took several hours after server-up.  The skeletal foreman does a zonewide message when he spawns.  Sir Ariam Arcanum spawns when the foreman dies.  Sir Ariam Arcanum stays up for a good long time -- 15 minutes or so.  Plenty of time for dozens of people to talk to him, and even to come running from PoK.<br />
<br />
However, if someone asks him about The Dead or the Knights of Truth he will give them a bridle and despawn.  Don't let anyone get the bridle if people are waiting to get an expended token!<br />
<br />
When you see Sir Ariam Arcanum you should say to him 'I will travel to Felwithe'.  You don't need to say anything else.  You should say it two or three times (or ten), because you'll want to do the quest several times so you can get both phylacteries.<br />
<br />
Arrias Arcanum is downstairs in the paladin guild in Felwithe, not in the room with the tailoring supplies, but in the other room.  He respawns in about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.  The necklace he gives you is a lore item, but if you turn in four expended tokens at once you get quadruple the xp and quadruple the faction hit.  This is why you might want to get 8 or more expended tokens from Sir Ariam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>tnexus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Figured I'd try it myself, but have killed numerous rounds of Excavators and haven't had any luck spawning him. Anyone know if he has a set spawn time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Narces</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Any word on them taking action on those that used to bug to get the Phylactery?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>drakon87</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Still think this is a bug but at this point there are at least a couple hundred people on every server that know about it and have done it.

<br />
Would require a decent amount of parsing, but no one is really sure on what information SOE/VI saves/saved. If they simply just recorded the semi-major changes to account at every save point, it would be simple to scan thru records real quick. Then again, im not SOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kaysha Soulsinger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Yesterday I logged to my Frog Warrior to make the ghost spawn. I did a few rounds and logged off between spawns, at the 3rd or so cycle I killed only one Excavator when the Foreman popped - the other three Excavators were still up. He did spawn on killing that one Excavator though, so it may be that he has a (small) chance to spawn on killing any of them.<br />
<br />
Regarding the Pally in Felwithe, after hunting a few times in Plane of Growth a couple of years back, I was pretty kill on sight to him with my Cleric. I was working on faction but still kos when I went to see him with a small group which included a chanter. She charmed the Pally after which I was able to make the turn-in and get the token needed for the Guardian. He despawned after giving him the expended token, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>escotor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Confirmed this again this evening with my Rogue.  Had an Arialla's Token from when I was hanging around in Befallen working pick locks.  The turn-in to the Guardian went just as described.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>GunnyBurlfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I can testify that the quest works just fine. However the paladin in the guild is not on a 2hour respawn time after you hand in the depleted token to him. Stayed until I had to go to bed, no Arias Arcanum in 2:45 after initial turn in. Not sure what his respawn time is</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kaysha Soulsinger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Initial reports I had was that he was on a 3-hour spawn timer. It seems fairly close - but not quite. Last weekend two guildies made a turn-in. One did at 4am and the other said he did at 5am (yes, they talked about the same time zone too). <br />
<br />
I believe that he has a spawn timer of around 3 hours, with a random time sooner or later than 3 hours. This makes it hard to get a fix on his timer.</div></div><hr />

it doesn't stack with bst so it might be appropriate and the tradeskill version not.  hoping the upgrae is something better.  remember when everyone was upset the phylactery took so much effort and was so horrid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Today at 7:50, I turned in and again at 10:50.  Dummy me, though forgot to go to OOT and turn in (oops) so if my druid wants to save a slot on regeneration, she'll need to go back and camp the foreman.<br />
<br />
Good thing you can get 2 of the tokens the first time around as they aren't lore.  Post turn in, they are.  Hope this helps.... now to figure out the mana crystals and I still want that ghoul!</div></div><hr />

It doesn't stack with the beastlord mana&amp;hp regen line?  I've never heard that before, and Lucy's guestimates didn't predict that.<br />

Has anyone heard of the validity of this quest/bug? Sounds like an huge bug if a lvl24 can go kill foreman and do the turn in for a +2hp/mana regen instant click item.<br />
<br />
The bit I was thinking about, its that a lvl 24 can get the tradeskill version too.  I get the impression most people buy at least /some/ of the books - a lower level could just buy /all/ the books (with plat earned from whatever, but with the bazaar plenty of avenues are realistically possible).  The Nodrop drops aren't particularly high level, probably could be killed by similar levels to those that can break&amp;hold befallen's entrance and kill the foreman.<br />
<br />
So this &quot;alternate&quot; method is easier, yes, but not necessarily much of a different potential level range.</div></div><hr />

All combines require 200+ skill, which would mean they need New Tanaan Crafting Mastery (lvl51 requirement.) to the fifth level (15AAs). Also need to camp rare mobs for drops to make those combines.<br />

~<br />
<br />
Also the quest is currently for good races only, a few people have checked in evil towns for a similar... quest. Does not exsist. So, unless you can charm Arrias, its beyond the reach of evil races. That is what leads me to believe it is a bug.<br />

<br />
Well, lets see... +2mana/tick and +7hp/tick. Hmm, Solstice earring is the cheapest ft item to get, and the rest are a bit more expensive. Boots of Flowing Slime (ft3) go for around 60-80k, and to get them requires a bit more work than.. oh.. I don't know.. doing a lvl20ish quest. <br />
<br />
Hell, I think that even if the item only gave +1hp/tick, but retained the instant click from inventory slot, that it would be overpowered.</div></div><hr />

Incorrect. It stacks just fine with BST buff. Wearing Spiritual Purity and Soul Clasp this very moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Islington</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I saw this last night and did it this morning.  Total time spent?  ~30 minutes.  Of that 30 minutes, 20 minutes were spent simply waiting on the boat from Freeport to Ocean of Tears.  I zoned into Befallen and got the Foreman to spawn out of the 2nd Excavator I killed.  I used my Faithstone to get to Felwithe and the Paladin was up.  I then gated to POK, booked to Freeport where I just missed the boat to OOT.  Waited for the next and did my final hand in.<br />
<br />
Later that day I helped a friend get her Phylactery.  It took her 3 or 4 clearings of the skeletons to get the Foreman.  The Paladin was up and then we went and did the turn in.  Took about an hour and a half to two hours for her.<br />
<br />
Right now, the Paladin in Felwithe is going to be the bottleneck if (or more accurately WHEN) news of this quest gets out.  I've heard on other servers that there are lines for him already and people camping him to turn their Token in.<br />
<br />
Now with all of that said, I'm firmly in the &quot;this is far too easy and absolutely, positively MUST be a bug&quot; camp.  I won't be surprised at all when the servers go down unannounced to fix this and I won't be surprised if all Phylacteries are changed so that only people who legitimately did the quest can use them.  Or SOE just might delete all the Phylacteries gained through this quest.  Either way, I don't think this was intentional and is only a matter of time before it's changed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is incorrect.  I finished this quest on both my WE Druid and DE SK.  For the DE SK I turned in 1700 muffins to Pandos in W. Freeport.  It was very tricky and didn't go very quick until a cleric friend came and paci'd Pandos for me(Share Wolf Form, Share Form of the Great Wolf and WE Illusion made no difference to Pandos, still KoS :().  Then I was able to stand at a distance and do turn-in's instead of hide/trade trick-fd when fail-headache.  You can buy muffins in W. Freeport, DE SK using Circlet of Deceit for WE illusion was able to buy with no problem.<br />
<br />
DE SK was still KoS to Felwithe guards and I believe the upstairs paladin mobs, but was ally to Arrias, who is alone in his own room.  So as long as you have invis, you're golden in Felwithe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Last I checked, the combines required effective skill of 165, which translates into 158+5% geerlok.  While the *trivials* may be over 200, that does not mean its unreasonable to attempt the combines before they're trivial.  Heh, one of the combines, enchanted velium bits, is considered a reasonable skill up path from the ~190s (second to LDoN armors), if not lower.<br />
<br />
Also need to camp rare mobs for drops to make those combines.<br />
The vampire blood and spiritual anchor would be fine to be obtained by lower level characters.  Mistmoore can be done in the 20s (even solo in some cases), and from what I've heard the ghoul of takish-hiz shouldn't be a difficult encounter for that level range, although naturally time-consuming.<br />
<br />
The other no drop items I could think of, Stone silk, phase spider silk, and precious garnet would be No Drop items that would present a challenge, I admit.  And that might be the ultimate flaw to the &quot;lowbies too&quot; theory, since those are unobtainable in the bazaar and 20s groups would have difficulty with that content without high level assistance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>fizzl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Weird. When you hail K`Arnon, all he says is:<br />
'Harm the oracle and die.  I have nothing else to say.'<br />
<br />
Which explicitly is intended to say 'I have no other purpose, so don't even try to interact with me'.<br />
<br />
Could it be that the developer responsible for the quest is in process of coding the whole script and forgot some of his own test code in place?<br />
<br />
Or, it could be that the quest is supposed to work this way, but there's some other NPC that should tell to give the thing to K`Arnon. Afterall, I say the reward is well worth the 24h gametime (mostly in line for the turn-in), but it's not overpowering.<br />

It's too complex to be completelly accidental. Or if they claim it is, it must be a rogue developer again putting some stuff in 'for his buddies'.<br />
<br />
Last night, while I was in queue for turn in, a GM popped in and apparently hovered upon us. I was asleep at that time, but I was told the GM just looked around and left without saying anything.<br />
The quest worked as expected even after that, so the GM did not 'fix' anything.<br />

<br />
Hum ... the info at Alla's (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=1087) suggests that Pandos is on Faydark Champions faction -- I believe that's the Elven rangers' guild.  Here's a list of ways (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=68) that you can raise (or lower) that faction.<br />
<br />
Pandos can be charmed, but as with all NPC's in the game, you don't get faction hits when turning in items to charmed NPC's.  Instead, have someone pacify him and try turning in muffins from max trade range.<br />
<br />
Sir Ariam in Befallen is on either Knights of Truth, Clerics of Truth, or Steel Warriors faction.  Those are, respectively, the paladins, clerics, and warriors of Freeport.  My personal guess is that he's on Knights of Truth faction.  This is odd, though, because in life, he was an elven paladin of Tunare, not Mithaniel Marr or Erollisi Marr.<br />
<br />
Knights of Truth is an easy enough faction to raise, without significant counter-hits; just slaughter orcs in the Commonlands.  If you want to raise your faction ASAP and don't mind becoming KOS to the Freeport Militia (the guards in East and West Freeport) and the Coalition of Tradesfolk Underground (Freeport rogues), kill Sir Lucan D'Lere a few times.  He gives a massive faction boost to all three factions.  Be aware that two or three kills will likely make you max KOS to the Militia and rogues, though.  And Freeport Miltia faction is one of the most irritating to raise.<br />
<br />
Sir Ariam is uncharmable, according to a friend.</div></div><hr />

Weird. When you hail K`Arnon, all he says is:<br />
'Harm the oracle and die.  I have nothing else to say.'<br />
<br />
Which explicitly is intended to say 'I have no other purpose, so don't even try to interact with me'. <br />
<br />
For those wondering, this text is from the Guardian of K'arnon.  He had it even before the Robe / Tunic / Phylactery quests went in.<br />
<br />
Random note of interest.  In the early days of the Robe quest, the turn-in was bugged, and you could get the wrong item (Robe instead of Tunic, or vice versa).  In his final text to you, Assistant Jayular says, &quot;If you are not satisfied with your robe or tunic, hand it to the Guardian of K'Arnon and he will exchange it for you.&quot;  You can swap your Robe or Tunic by handing it in to the Guardian; this was added to address the bug.  (This makes absolutely no sense from a role-playing perspective, since the Assistant just got through telling you how Raotin was able to make this single brand-new item, and here's the Guardian handing out Robes and Tunics willy-nilly! :) )<br />
<br />
This leads me to think that a great deal of functionality was added to the Guardian with these patches.  I still feel I'm missing a link somewhere between Arrias in Felwithe and the Guardian; the rest of this quest has a very strong role-playing aspect (barring the one hot-fix mentioned above), and this missing link kind of spoils that feeling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as I know, those three are all on the &quot;Oracle of Karnon&quot; faction, which starts out as indifferent to everyone.  I've only ever heard of people having trouble with the Oracle if they farmed his robe; obviously, killing him will lower your faction with him. :)  I have not heard of problems from any evil race doing the related turn-ins if they never killed the Oracle or Guardian.<br />
<br />
As a high elf, if you've never killed the Oracle or Guardian, you will have no faction problems with him whatsoever.</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing that's either the Guardian's aggro message (probably) or death message.  Probably from a GM despawning him, as I've seen the Guardian up every single time I've gone to that island (while camping the Oracle for pally epic, and when doing things related to this quest) so I doubt he despawns naturally.<br />
<br />
If I remember correctly, the Oracle himself is a 2-3 hour respawn.  I'd guess the Guardian is similar or shorter, but someone who actually had killed them would probably actually know ;)  This was probably a perma-kill though, making respawn timers irrelevant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He is uncharmable as of Friday night I believe. Not even DC works.  Apparently this was nerfed early no. You can't cast spells on him similar to the npcs in PoK.<br />
<br />
Sir Ariam is one of the above fractions.  They are all pretty much linked.  Sir Luclin is the best methd for the Knights of Truth and Priest of Marr. But Steel Warriors is the PITA.  Took like 2 and half days of fractioning ( don't ask me guessing 8+ hours) to up it for him(DE SK ).  The seamstress quest I believe he did mostly.  Was more than 10 runs--never said how much.  from North Qeynos to EK (unholy stead &gt;all).<br />

Its basically a buff-taking FT2 that doesn't contribute to the cap.  And look how much people value FT on droppable items - their price is INSAINE, especially ones hybrids can use.  They also tend to be some of the more prized nodrop loot by guilds gearing up in Velious-to-SoL era content.<br />

<br />
Well, not only is it +2 mana/hp, but it is insta-cast, castable from inventory, and yes, it takes a buff slot - which makes it valuable for junk-buffing when raiding dispelling mobs, even if the effect was crappy (which it isn't.)<br />
<br />
I fully intend on doing it the long way around (Grand Robe of the Oracle quest-I have 4 of 6 books plus my Sages Robe), I AM a tradeskill junkie!   <br />
<br />
But, I did this alternate version because the Phylacteries are nice items and I don't anticipate getting the Firebone notebook anytime soon.  Aramin &amp; Grummus are taken down pretty quickly, so my guild has only raided them once, and I didn't win the book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>GunnyBurlfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">To address the issue of it being so treasured as for them to nerf it, I got it for a junk buff that can also be a buff you don't mind keeping. Primarily to save myself 10k for a Gobby earring<br />
<br />
I'd have this up is when soloing, or junk buffing for dispelling mobs, but might not in a typical raid. I value buff slots highly, as each buff might enable me to take less dmg(resists), absorb more dmg(HP), or dish out more damage (Spell haste/mana regen)<br />
<br />
In a typical fight with a boss mob/raid, maximum time might be as long as 20 minutes. the HP you get from all the group buffs out there far outweighs the contribution of the regen part of this. It's still a nice buff, although on the high level forums in druidsgrove, they say it doesn't stack with any of the other clicky mana buffs, like Lunar Whispers.<br />
<br />
But whenever I raid, I find I have to take off buffs that are very useful to me just to get all the necessary buffs, and all the HP buffs.<br />
<br />
For example,<br />
<br />
1. Bot9<br />
2. Symbol of Kazad<br />
3. Protection of Seasons(FR/CR)/Circle of Hammers(PR/DR)<br />
4. Focus of the 7th<br />
5. Blessing of Replenishment<br />
6. VoQ<br />
7. Brell's Stalwart Shield<br />
8. Group Stamina<br />
9. Mask of the Forest (5m/tick self buff)<br />
10. Either FoE/horse <br />
11. Spirtual Dominion<br />
12. Blessing of Reverance<br />
13. Guard of Druzzil(MR)<br />
14. Mage DS (FR)<br />
15. reserved for HoT/SotW/EE/Paragon<br />
<br />
I'd love to have other buffs, such as group agility,  so my Lightning Reflexes would kick in more, but I can't keep that in the lineup in a non-dispelling raid fight.<br />
<br />
I have rarely run out of mana on a raid boss, but I have run out of HP many times. HP buffs &gt; all other buffs<br />
<br />
I click off the Mage DS unless we are fighting cold based creatures (which we usually are, for some reason) , because sometimes you have to have two slots open for an HoT AND one of the spam AAs to help you survive<br />
<br />
So my buff stack is always as full as it can be on raids. Now as far as the rest of the game, very nice :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, both of them stack. The examples I made about items that have FT on them makes the point that +2 mana regen IS important. Thus, a quest that easy was a bit OVERPOWERing. And, as far as duration is concerned, its instant cast from inventory, not hard.<br />
<br />
Please name some other &quot;Instant Cast from Inventory&quot; items with unlimited charges.. then start to list some with an effect this good. Then compare them to the difficulty level of the quest above.<br />
<br />
Guardian is despawned on all servers, it was a bug in the game, which obviously gave an overpowered item. Now, go sit in the corner and be quiet please.</div></div><hr />

But as to SoE nerfing those who obtained the phylacteries through this alternative route, I doubt it.  They didn't delete CVTs from people who went and 'bought' 100s of them when they were bugged for 0pp.<br />
<br />
And that is even more of an exploit then this was, as at most 8 people a day could obtain the phylactery.  And this quest was actively found a little over a week ago. So we are talking abou 8 people * 10 days or 80 people per server.  I suspect that more then 80 people per server took advantage of the CVTs selling for 0 pp.<br />
<br />
And there doesn't seem to be any difference between the tradeskill version and the quested version - so I doubt that they'll go through the logs and remove the phylacteries from those who quested it.  And they have yet to set any precedence of going through logs across all the servers to identify this small group of people.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Aethia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Adams, actually people have deleted the mana crystals. The 30 plus pages of posts on the Oracle Robe thread had at least one person has posted that they did the robe quest just for the robe.  They had no intentions of doing the tradeskill portion.  My boyfriend is another.  After seeing how many hours I have put into camping a STUPID green ghoul that never drops an anchor (and other can attest),  it would take SOE far too much time to determine the 80+ people that got their phylacteries the alternative way since now you are forcing them to go through at least a week of logs, if not more.  And on Stromm, most are just after the robe, and could care less about what is at this time useless mana crystals.  Established servers are different though.  Stromm is your kid brother or sister..... we are still trying to catch up to our big brothers/sisters.<br />
<br />
I did the alternative route for the phylacteries, because after countless hours of camping South Ro and Oasis and killing 2 ghouls (0 anchors), I wanted the phylacteries.  I have attempted Aramin 4 times now, with 6 people to raid force(30+).  And no notebook.  I have the other 5 books (first three turned in) but I love the phylacteries especially when grouped in LDONs and no druid.  I'm a necro, and that 5 hps/tick helps.  I have other insta clickies, but the phylacteries are items I can carry AND use all the time.  As opposed to taking up space of a 'just incase we raid&quot; time.<br />
<br />
Overall, if you are class that wants the phylacteries (and many on Stromm want them, they could care less about the robe, for whatever reason), the alternative was a way to get them. Now for me, I still have annoying camps in South Ro to get the ghoul and have to deal with paranoid AC campers when all I want is a stupid level 45 mob that drops something so useless to most people... :( that and Aramin - the wench must die! I plan on completing this quest.<br />
<br />
Now, in a previous post (different thread) I said that the loophole needs to be locked up.  I still stand by my statement.  I think this alternative way was a bit too easy.  Yet there still should be some way of obtaining those phylacteries.  Just a small sample on Stromm leads me to believe that there are several camps - robe only, phylactery only, robe and phylactery.  Out of those 3 possibilities, the phylacetery only route is NOW disregarded.  Going to Befallen, killing 4 mobs at entrance and camping in Felwith is not exactly challenging except for evil races and even then doable with some effort (1700 muffins ~ 1 hour).  <br />
<br />
However, I'm not as knowledge as many here on EQTraders and having watched and read 30 pages of trial and error on this quest (and others Broder's revenge....) I wonder when we'll figure this out. I have confidence that we will, but how long will it take? I'm running out of bank room :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Adams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">From my point of view, the alternative way to get the Phylactery is way too easy, considering I have spend countless amount of hours clicking, farming component and spent severals hundreds Kpp to raise all my trade skills to 250.  Add to this the 18 AA to raise trade skill cap above 200.<br />
<br />
I agree that an alternative way to get Phylactery should exist, I am just not sure if it's fair that a lev 30 solo can get the same reward in a few hours...<br />
<br />
Robe itself require 0 tradeskill, and can be done by a lev 1 as all the books are dropable.<br />
<br />
As for the mana Crystal, you get it only on the Final Trade in, at same time you recive the Phylactery.  ( So those doing robe only will never have the Mana crystal )<br />
<br />
Finaly, this items may look crapy at first sight, ( stats suks and only 2 mana/hp regen per tick is not that good ) but once you have reached your 15 FT cap, this is an extra 2 mana per tick, that stack with all other buff in game, can be insta-clicked from inventory.  ( Good in raid buff 1 st slot when Mobs dispel, and as it does not change your apparence, no need to reshrink ( AoN ))<br />
<br />
I totaly agree that Ghoul camp suks.  After 7 Ghoul, 0 drop, I did /bugreport the droprate.  Strangely, I got it next day.  Was probably lucky... who knows.</div></div><hr />

That's easy enough to manage; all six books are tradable, and the robe has no level requirements or recommendations.  If you want to twink out a caster alt, just make a level one toon and hand him or her the six books, then send your toon to Freeport or Neriak, then OoT.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Arrica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Just another update.  I did the alternate method on my wizzy about a week and a half ago, and now, when looking at the description for the Soul Clasp clicky, it now says regain 0 hit points and 2 mana every 6 seconds for 14 minutes.  I'm not 100% sure, but at least 95% certain, that until recently the description said 2 hit points and 2 mana.  I figure it's one of two things:  An actual change, and whoever changed the description was too lazy to remove the &quot;regain X hit points&quot; section and just changed the 2 to a 0.  OR.  It's just a display bug on the effect description.<br />
<br />
I'm not hugely disappointed if I've lost the HP regen, I mainly did it so I would have a small boost to mana regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Kaysha Soulsinger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">The spell database still lists it at +2 mana and +2 HP. Either you mis-read it, or they messed up the description.</div></div><hr />

I'm majorly kos to the Freeport Militia, due to killing the WC tollbooth guards several times in the mid-20's, and I've almost died a couple of times at the North Ro camp due to idiots training the guards there. <br />
<br />
*blink* Okay, I feel like an idiot, but North Ro has Freeport militia guards?  EC used to be the one famous for the guard trains, with Sgt. Slate getting brought to the auctioner-filled tunnel and killing hoards of people.  With the newbie revamp they added yet more guards to EC, and I'd admit I've had to train Slate twice when I was trying to get to the EC camp (although I took him to WC, not NRo).<br />
<br />
Where do the NRo guards come from, do you know?<br />

<br />
Ack.  You're right, I forgot that step.  The faction work required to get the Velious chest item makes it less likely a level 1 can get the Robe/Tunic, even if you MQ the Velious item turn-in.  I suppose it's still theoretically possible, but far less likely.</div></div><hr />

There are two guards at the door of the inn just outside Freeport in North Ro.  There's a third guard who stands near the end of the path from Freeport, shortly before it reaches the desert.  This latter guard, at least, is a &quot;gate guard&quot; -- pretty much immune to spells, massive HP regen, and hits like a truck.</div></div><hr />

Yep. He cons blue to me at lvl 51, but he's an undercon. I tried taking him with the 51 Earth pet, equipped with Phantom Plate and 2 Swords of Runes, with Burn Out III and the damage shield thrown on for good measure.<br />
<br />
The pet's Roots didn't seem to stick, and when my pet was at 50% health, the guard was at about 90%. <br />
<br />
Suffice it to say, I ended up gating. <br />
<br />
(I may try again later, using a SOW potion and Lev ring on myself and firing a couple of Bolt spells at him, then doing the old `pet chases mob while mob chases you' routine, and see how it goes.)</div></div><hr />

Btw, any 1 know if the &quot;alternative way to get Phylactery&quot;  was legit or if it was a bug?  And if it was a bug, did those who got it this way got their item removed?<br />
<br />
Just curious, I saw no more post on this thread in OOC.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Cerpicio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">Yesterday I logged on an alt right after the patch, in the Ocean of Tears. The Guardian was up again, but when I turned in the Token (not the expended one, but the real one), he just ate it. No text, no item returned (I checked my bags), no nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, just for fun, I just tried doing this.  I popped into Befallen, killed four excavator's and the foreman popped.  I killed him and Sir A. popped up.  I talke to him and got four expended tokens (someone else pointed out they were not lore, so I figured what the heck).<br />
<br />
I went to Felwithe and handed one to a guy in the Paladin guild, but he ate it and said they didn't like me enough.  Bah.  A quick cast of Collaboration and I was his best friend.  I handed him another and I got the real token.<br />
<br />
Then I went to OoT and tried to give it to the Oracle, but he didn't want it.  I gave it to the Guardian and he kept it, without saying a word (oh, and I cast Collaborate on them too, so I was amiable).<br />

Just thought I'd update this thread.<br />
