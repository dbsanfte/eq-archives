<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PaladinVivere</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My lvl 52 Paladin (Halfelf Tunare) would like to acquire some Blessed Full Mithril Plate armor.  Since he, and all 3 of my alts combined, have about 7Kp total, I am wanting to trade for the combines.  I can bring all of the components to the forge in Kelethin (at your convenience) and offer you plat or items (i.e. a stack of moonlight tempers or 3 stacks of leather padding) for you services.  I can easily work with a mid-level blacksmith for some of the lower combines and request a GM for the final combine.  If there is anything I can offer which will make this worth your while, please let me know.<br />
<br />
Much thanks<br />
