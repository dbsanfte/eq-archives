<br />
I'd like to gather materials to make some Hurricane Chain, but I'm finding the information very confusing.  Can someone please clarify:<br />
<br />
I need to combine Electrified Copper with distilled mana to make the Enchanted Electrified Copper?  Then combine this with Hurricane Temper and a file to make the rings?  Or do I even need to make the Enchanted Electrified Copper, or do I make the rings out of Unenchanted Electrified Copper?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help and I apologize if I have missed this information somewhere in my searching.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazick</div><div class="date">12-30-2002, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is somewhat complicated... and requires a whole series of steps. I will try and layout the sequence regardless of the metal used (will call it planar metal... substitute the proper type):<br />
<br />
1.  Planar Ore + Distilled (or Purified) Mana Vial = Enchanted Planar Ore [SMITHING]<br />
2.  Raw Diamond + &quot;Proper Liquid&quot; + &quot;Proper Imbue Spell (by caster)&quot; = Colored Diamond of ... [CAST BY CLASS 61-65 Level Spell]<br />
3.  Matching Imbued Diamond + Enchanted Planar Ore + Blank Emblem = Emblem of ... [JEWELRYCRAFT]<br />
4.  Planar Essence Components (several) = Planar Temper [BREWING]<br />
5.  Brick of Planar Ore + Planar Temper + File = Planar Rings [SMITHING]<br />
6.  Planar Rings + Planar Temper + Tanaan Smithing Hammer = Planar Chain Jointing [SMITHING]<br />
7.  Brick of Planar Ore [2] + Planar Temper + Tanaan Smithing Hammer = Sheet of Planar Ore [SMITHING]<br />
8.  Planar Rings [1-3]+ Chainmail Pattern + Planar Temper + Emblem of ... (step 3) + Tanaan Smithing Hammer = Planar Chain Mail [SMITHING]<br />
9.  Planar Chain Jointing + Sheet of Planar Ore [1-3] + Superb Leather Padding + Emblem of ... (step 3) + Planar Temper + Tanaan Smithing Hammer + Full Plate ... Mold = Planar Plate Mail [SMITHING]<br />
<br />
Emblems and Hammer returned on Failure. Emblem is consumed on Success.<br />
<br />
I don't have drop information... and haven't made any myself, but this is what I believe to be accurate. Did I miss anything?<br />
<br />
EDIT - Corrected Item 5. (no Hammer needed)</div></div><hr />

I can't confirm if they drop off forest or river giants as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buchalter</div><div class="date">12-30-2002, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for the info on the electrified copper drops.<br />
<br />
Since I'm only 54th level at the moment I've not had a chance to get in a group and get flagged for Plane of Storms.  So it seems I'll have to either be patient or break down and buy the materials.  I have not noticed a lot of folks on Vazaelle making the Hurricane Chain items yet.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for helping a confused tradeskiller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eleena Transient</div><div class="date">12-31-2002, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Slight correction, no hammer for making the rings.  Just metal + file + temper.<br />
<br />
Also of note, the emblem is not trivial at 250 JC (personal 83% at 250 +5%), and the final combine for armor is not trivial at 250 smithing (10 for 13 on nightmare chain tunic/legs).  All other steps were trivial.</div></div><hr />

0-2 on Chain Legs <br />
1-5 on Chain Arms<br />

Getting ready for another round... Hope it goes better  :)</div></div><hr />
