<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vegetasei</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was wondering how rare are the drops on the claws in PoWater? Does anyone exp in PoWater and can get them? Would it be possible to buy these? I really would like to get some to make those Bucket of Crab legs for the Bristlebane Party Platter.<br />
<br />
If it's not possible to buy the claws themselves, then I would still be really interesting in purchasing the Bucket of Crab legs to make the platter. Please let me know about rarity and chances of buying the Reruga claws and/or the Bucket of Crab legs. <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading :)</div></div><hr />

Maybe 1 in 3 will drop claws, but each time they will drop 2.  2 claws produced 4 regrua meat which produce 8 buckets without failures.  At 250 baking, I see about an 70% success rate with Claw to Bucket conversion.<br />
<br />
The problem is, these mobs hit for about the same damage as the Avatar of War, just with less hit points.  They are not the type of mob that is usually killed in a group.  The only claws we see is when we are going after a mini-boss or fighting our way to Coirnav.  And of course, lots of bakers ask for some to make for themselves (for platter) as well as for others in the guild.</div></div><hr />
