Me, most of my guild, and most of our apps are in the paebla tunnel, buffing up to kill Garzicor.<br />
It's been a grueling five months. Ive quested, ive smithed, ive quit the game (for all of a week), and I've finally amassed my forces... I go and spawn the ghostly presence, I hand him the blood... and Garzicor's Corpse spawns. I pull him to our tank, he gets aggro, we fight...<br />
And boom, down falls one and up pops Garzicor's Wraith. So we all hit our disciplines and start praying, and the fight begins. Garzicor gets to 95 health... and in come the spiders. Spiders? YES! 3 or 4 spiders, with reports of oddly named mobs (a phase laborer?) show up and proceed to port us around, effectivly wiping the raid. <br />
I, of course, am heartbroken. All that work down the drain... so our guild leader, a master monk, goes to drag bodies to zone line. He gets an invis and sneaks past the spiders... and up pops a dragon construct. And another dragon construct. And another dragon construct. And... guess what... ANOTHER dragon construct. Yes, without stepping on the bones, our guild leader has managed to spawn not one, but TWO dragon constructs at each of the two traps on the left side of the zone. <br />
Isn't only 1 construct supposed to spawn per trap you ask?<br />
Why yes, yes they are.<br />
So our monk dies.<br />
And we call in a few friends to help with the corpse run. They zone in, start fighting the two constructs who aggro, and the other two aggro. Boom, our rescue crew is dead.<br />
Fast forward 2 hours, 57 minutes and 41 seconds (according the the rez timer of our first dead player) the corpse run is completed. We all agree that, even taking bad fear raids into account, this has been the worse corpserun EVER. So you know what? I petition. Yes, for the loss of my blood to a bug that everyone is sure happened but we're sure we wont be able to reproduce because, yknow, that just doesnt happen when you want it to, I petition.<br />
And then i log off, rezzed thrice and exhausted.<br />
Picture it: the next day. I log in, petition, and am grouped in disease. I get a tell from a guide who says that, while she is pretty sure im not lying, it shard to verify this stuff and, even though she'll tell a gm about it, theres really no chance I'll get my stuff returned. Five months. Five months down the drain. FIVE LOUSY-<br />
GM_01 tells you: &quot;1 vial of blood coming right up!&quot;<br />
You tell GM_01 &quot;I love you, you know that, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, folks, the story has a happy ending. After much death, destruction, and general unpleasentness, the GMs came through and gave me another shot at the quest! Of course, odds are we'll run into the same bugs and everythign will be all unhappiness and doom and stuff, but for this shining, glorious moment, the GM did something right! (not to dis gms, but the day before the patch that fixed it, a GM wouldnt reset my rez timer after I'd logged off and it had kept ticking.Why? That was the way it was supposed to happen...) <br />
Now folks, I am again exhausted and rezzed (bad pull</div></div><hr />
