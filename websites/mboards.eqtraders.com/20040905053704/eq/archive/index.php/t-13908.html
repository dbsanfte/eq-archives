<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">And it only took 2 days (suprised it took that long).<br />
<br />
The popular item tradeskill market has crashed, prices has plumeted.<br />
<br />
My skillup item of choice now (224) are MIsty PIcnics.  While some people were overcharging 30-60PP each, I kepy mt pices at 20PP each, still high, but reasonable.<br />
<br />
Now, I see roughly 360 at 15 (few traders) 540 at 14 (one trader) 19 at 13pp each, and ine, 12.5PP each.<br />
<br />
I think even at 10PP each its a huge profit margin, but I'm glad to see it's down now, guild raids can pick up a few stacks of these for a raid, great bribe equipment etc..<br />
<br />
But popular skillup paths, such as acrylic armor, has also dropped,. making skillup paths either not profittable, or you have to find alternate routs (ahem, ribbons).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">heh, my sales have been high today, and since it's after the Tribute Masters have been down for a while, I'm assuming it has nothing to do with them.<br />
<br />
My favorite was finally selling a Brellium Platemail Breastplate for 11kpp :)  Underfoot BPs have been going for around 6-9kpp, so 11kpp seemed rather outrageous, but it finally sold!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aethia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ouch! 30 - 60?  I thought Stromm was crazy but the market had been constant at 20, now it's between 9 - 18.  <br />
<br />
when the market was at 20, I couldn't keep them in stock.  And it got to be annoying for me to spend say 1 hour making subcombines and MTPs just to have them sell out in no time flat.  So I stopped making them for sale, and made them for myself and friends.<br />
<br />
Now with the new UI, I'm making them again.  With the time savings, I will sell half and keep half.  Part of me is bummed at the price drop, but I'm sure the consumers are ecstatic.<br />
<br />
It'll be interesting to see what happens.  Currently handmade backpack are at least 50 and the price just seems to be going up.  Regardless, I'm having fun and enjoying tradeskilling once again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personaly, I've been trying to force the average prices on some raw components.<br />
<br />
Enchanted silver -- people are charging 15-20PP EACH for them.  Sorry, I have about 100 on my trader for 2PP each, it's insane to have a 95%-99% profit margin, esp with something so low on the scale.<br />
<br />
Magic Clay - some people charging 40-50PP each.  So I dump 160 on my trader for 5PP each, still a high profit margin (what's the price of a large block of clay? A few old?).<br />
<br />
I haven't tested the enchanted electrum market, yet (Chanty is only 17), but seems to be steady at a reasonable 5PP - 10PP.<br />
<br />
Mistys, though, I feel area huge rip off at the high prices people have been charging.  I had mine doen to 12.5 PP each, which at 250PP per stack, it isn't easy for a lowbie get get it, but for a guild raid or some people who want an extra boost, that's not a bad price.  If the market drops below 5PP each, then I'll stop selling them and donate all of them to my guild.<br />
<br />
The thing that gives me the most pride is that my baking has gone form 205 to 224 in two nights (roughly 5 hours?).  I've made over 300 Mistys, kept 40, donated about 50 to the guild, gave a stack to a friend of mine for help, and I'm selling the rest (more baking tonight!).  What I really like is that they're inexpensive, yet make a nice addition to any arsenal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">mpts have been 10pp on luclin forever.  haven't checked since new ui though.  halas pies were 2pp when i was making them so never bothered making them for profit.  <br />
250 with spoon the slightly old way (had pok and control click and misty's to power through).  my brewing and fletching are both 200 now because of the new ui though.  i can just get the combines done now.  it took so much longer without it.  :D</div></div><hr />

Why?  Misty picnics are a HUGE profit, even including time, at 10PP-15PP each.<br />
<br />
While I also don't mind making tons of plat, I just think it's unethical and very greedy to charge over 20PP, even how some people charge as much as 60PP each (and that IMO is a rip off).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">On Xegony, MTP's sell for 6-8 plat. if you're lucky.<br />
<br />
And that's still a good profit margin. *shrug*<br />
<br />
I see no reason to jack it higher than 10 tops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Silound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At 20-30 each, there will be lots of 200+ bakers after a good period of time. Considering baking is all of 3 recipies to GM, and one of those 3 is MTP, thus is why high prices aren't going to last forever. I put up 1000 MTP's at 10 each (average price over the past months is 10, right now they're on a high at 15) over Friday  and all day Saturaday, and I was sold out this morning when I looked. One buyer was one of my competitiors, he bought 300ish and put them back for 14 each, still hasn't sold  more than 100, or else he restocked recently. Otherwise, it was penny-nickle-dime purchases over a night by nearly 50 different people. Some bought a few stacks, some only bought one. Price fixing so that the market doesnt crash out is reasonable imo.</div></div><hr />

I just think it's unethical and very greedy...  <br />
<br />
<br />
You may be half right...<br />
<br />
First, it's not unethical, it's capitalism and free market trade. The market price is determined by supply and demand. I someone will buy my picnics at 20pp each, they are satisfied, and so am I. Making a profit, no matter how big that profit, isn't unethical if both the seller and is willing to sell and the buyer is willing to buy. It's a contract. Both are willing participants, and it is worth the price to the buyer. If the buyer doesn't like the price, he or she can skill up baking or do without.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to the second point. It may be greedy, but I don't think so. We've worked on tradeskills, and worked a lot. Say what you want about tradeskills being too easy now, etc., but the fact of the matter is it takes a lot of time to GM a tradeskill, even if the clicks are now fewer. They want picnics? They can pay me for my time and energy.<br />
