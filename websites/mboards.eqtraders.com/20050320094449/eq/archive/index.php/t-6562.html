<br />
We are talking the first 1000...<br />
<br />
Of those, maybe 50 are still active characters.  Maybe less, considering that even people that started on day one may have changed mains and not have that char still active.  <br />
<br />
Of the 50 people still playing after 4 years, I doubt any of them would be the type to have a name of Hotchick.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galathnor</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;In appreciation for those that have been EverQuest players from the very beginning, this server will be named after one of these long-standing player's characters. SOE will randomly pick 8 of the first 1,000 players who subscribed to EverQuest and who are still playing and then SOE will select one character name from each account. Current EverQuest players will be allowed to vote on which one of those names should be used for the new server. &quot; End Quote from SOE Live Site.<br />
<br />
I might be reading this wrong, but doesn't this mean that they will take the first 1000 accounts that are still active, and then choose the 8 from them? So like out of the first 10,000 accounts maybe there are 1,000 still active and they will choose from that 1,000? Or maybe it is just out of the first 1,000 accounts period?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delfontes</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way I interpret that is 8 of the first 1,000 and are still playing... so if 100 of the first 1000 subscribers are still active, 8 of those...<br />
<br />
That is just how I read it, it may also mean 8 of the 1000 oldest active accounts... <br />
<br />
Doesn't really matter ;), we still get to vote on the 8 they choose.</div></div><hr />

Hey, a necro can dream &lt;img src=http://www.boomspeed.com/sinuuyanea/feliciachaorazz.gif alt=&quot;And it's going to stay a dream...&quot;&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't think of many people who have contributed as much to the game as she has.  This site and the work she has done has greatly enhanced my enjoyment of the game in ways I can't begin to thank her enough for.<br />
<br />
She deserves all the recognition she can get as far as I'm concerned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galathnor</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here Here !!! I totally agree. Nominate the DenMom )))</div></div><hr />

<br />
I read a post somewhere by some guy saying he knew he was in the first 1000, how?<br />
<br />
I do think that The Aandaie Gurglebrook Server, or perhaps just Gurglebrook, are tame and vanilla enough to make fine server names. Yes indeed!</div></div><hr />

Second that! Would go great with the guild &quot;Denmom's Children&quot;  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delfontes</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe<br />
<br />
It would go great...<br />
<br />
What makes you guys think that she was among the first 1000 though?<br />
<br />
I don't think anyone can honestly know for sure, it had to be within the first hours of release... heck maybe even earlier if people working at stores etc. were able to pick up a copy the night before and get registered.</div></div><hr />

Lots of the original players have given up in disgust and moved on.... or moved on for other reasons. Im with Lilosh, Niami Denmom for server! :D</div></div><hr />
