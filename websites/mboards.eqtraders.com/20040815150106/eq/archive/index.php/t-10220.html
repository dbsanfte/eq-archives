<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bebinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">mythiran.allakhazam.com will answer all the questions you have about research in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>salomeasillverfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Better yet go to www.castersrealm.com<br />
or www.graffe.com<br />
you simply need to get the lexicon and the right runes and start combining. I used most of my exp points towards this also. Sal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What is research used for?  <br />
<br />
1. Some of your spells spells are research-only<br />
<br />
2. Some of your spells or priest-class spells are obtainable by mob drops but very rare, and this is an additional way to get those spells.  Example:  componentless Levitation(51)  drops off only ONE mob (unless that has recently changed?), but there are 3 different recipes Wizard, Enchanter and Druid/Shaman, and the spell scroll produced by any of these recipes is scribable by all 4 classes.  The components (runes, dew clover, etc) are rare, but easier to obtain than the mob-dropped spell.  Of course, when it comes to spells like Garrison's Superior Sundering (GSS - level 60 - drops off mobs like the Emperor in SSRA or in Vex Thal) the runes are as rare as the dropped spell, /sigh.<br />
<br />
3. The LoY expansion introduced some nice robes that can be made by any races that have INT casters, which use Research-made swatches in the recipes.<br />
<br />
<br />
My wizard's strategy for skilling up Spell Research (assuming you don't have loads of unused training points and lots of platinum):<br />
<br />
1. First of all, if you haven’t already done this, at level 20 put 1 training point into research.  this will get you a starting skill of 20 in research.  If you are higher in level and never trained research, you will start with a skill equal to your character’s level  (thus a level 60 character putting a training point into Spell Research for the first time would start with a skill of 60.  But you wouldn’t be able to research any of your spells until you did this :/.)  You could buy your research skill all the way to 200, but that can get expensive, better to combine your way up to about 168-180 and then use training points for the last 20-40.<br />
<br />
2.Get your Lexicon, the “old” one that is good up to level 49 spells, and then the new one available near the lighthouse in Gunthak (obtainable once you have attained skill 101.)<br />
<br />
3.Buy a research geerlock (Automated quill) – won’t affect skill ups, but when you are ready to make a spell combine for a needed spell, it will help your chances of success.<br />
<br />
4.If you already have a skill of 101 &amp; your ‘new’ lexicon, you can start by making the swatches for the LoY robes.  Concentrate on the ones where the spell research components are plentiful and cheap  (example: Concussion runed swatch… Concussion runes drop like candy in a lot of zones, therefore you will see a lot on merchants, AND they sell for only a bit over 2p.  This swatch trivials at 132! or the Scent-etched swatch, made with vendor purchasable Scent of Marr, which trivials at 122.)  You may even be able to use these swatches to skill up in tailoring, or sell them to non-caster tailors who need them to make the robes but can’t make the swatches themselves.  Don’t forget you need a parchment + research component to make the swatches.<br />
<br />
5.If you don't have a skill of 101 (or don't have LoY) and thus just have the ‘old’ lexicon (pre-Loy), you can carry it with you and combine as you go, or collect the runes you need for later.  When I was skilling up (pre-Loy) I collected runes &amp; sorted them later.  I usually had 2 (sometimes 3) 10-slot containers of various runes in the bank and every time I leveled I would combine, combine, combine until I got my 5 points and hit my cap.<br />
<br />
NOTE: research skill is level–restricted, so once you reach the max skill for your level, STOP COMBINING (or you will waste components for nothing.)  The formula for the cap on research is 5 * (Your level - 15). At 16, you can only have 5 points in it. At 19, the skill cap is 20. This is why it is generally recommended that even though you can train research at level 16, you wait and put a point into research only at level 20, since you will automatically get a skill of 20 and can still skillup to 25 (skill cap at level 20.)<br />
<br />
6.  Making Practice Runes (what you read on the &quot;Learn  Spell Research&quot; page) is another alternative if spell research components are few &amp; far between, but it is more complicated than straight combining of runes, as you have to collect multiple components.<br />

<br />
Hmm, they must have changed it (good!)...I forget the name but it used to drop only off of only one Luclin boss, I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It drops off the Deranged Underbulk in The Deep.<br />
<br />
Not really a boss but not particularly easy to get to either.<br />
<br />
Thats why its rare and expensive.</div></div><hr />
