<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>xarkorrn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
  I've been using this site for info for a long time, but now I feel the need to ask some questions. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I've been looking at the baking guides, and looking over the posts on the baking boards, and I've read many opinions about skill ups... I know there is alot of info here, I just wanted to get some opinions on my personal situation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay. Currently I sit at 191 after making patty melts. I'm looking to get to 250 and I'm wondering what the best fit for skill ups would be.<br />
<br />
I have started raising fishing, which I enjoy, so I would like to, if at all possible, use some of the GoD recipes because I've spent this morning getting tuna and crab meat. :) <br />
<br />
Also, I'm poor, so I'm looking more towards things that can be semi-cost effective, and I don't mind farming (for eggs, etc).<br />
<br />
If it involves other trade skills that would make it cheaper/more vendor accessible, then that's fine too.<br />
<br />
Again, I know that the raw info is here, but I'm asking if I could get a few opinions for my situation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You left out some important pieces of info - can you forage or know any friendly foragers and what level are ya?<br />
<br />
If you can forage, Ohabah Truffles or Candied Cockroaches are a nice way to 202.  There are some nice easy recipes using some of the planar fish, but I made beer battered cragbeast and hynid steaks to 222 and then mostly MTP's to 250.  A few other things in there but that was a relatively cheap path for me as a forager.<br />
<br />
The GoD fish are handy but I think the beer-battered crab/tuna cakes, pies and souffles all require foraged vegetables - so many that it is easier to make MTP's.<br />
<br />
Good luck - other folks will have other recommendations but give us an idea of your character for more specific recommendations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>xarkorrn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sorry about that.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was rushing out of work and quite tired.<br />
<br />
Even more so now. :)<br />
<br />
In any event. I figured that either way there would be significant farming involved.  I'd rather do alot of it myself.<br />
<br />
So, here is a little more info.  My tradeskill character is a 53 Iksar Shaman, so no real forage (let's not entertain the thought of iksar forage. :P). However, I DO have a 33 ranger.  Problem is, I never did raise his foraging much.<br />
<br />
So, my main question now is, let's say I max my rangers foraging, which should end up at 170(?), is that acceptable to depend on for foraging baking items? Vegetables and the GoD items?  Because if so, I'd be more than happy to use him to farm eggs and raise his foraging in the process.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps a little?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">get to 207 on BeerBattered (i think) Tuna.<br />
<br />
all store bought appart from tuna.<br />
<br />
I then went to 222 on Beer Braised Hynid/Cragbeast Steak<br />
<br />
But you need to forage the meats from Natimbi.<br />
<br />
You should be able to find some Crab recipies to go higher than 207 but you may well find yourself needing a lot of veggies.<br />
<br />
Note - Basalisk eggs give 15 dough or 15 of the other egg flour combine thing needed in GOD recipies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Foraging skill just governs the number of times that you get &quot;something&quot; as opposed to failures, or at least I've never seen anything to the contrary (I welcome corrections on this).<br />
<br />
If it's something as simple as a percentage (just guessing, I don't know) then at 170 you would have an 85% chance of getting something on each attempt, rares included; at 200 I never fail to get something.<br />
<br />
Jaggedpine is slow, depending on your class, but I did 250 there on Casseroles; but I'm a Druid, that zone was made for us and Rangers :)  ymmv.</div></div><hr />
