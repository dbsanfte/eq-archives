<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jpathomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm glad you mentioned this, because I noticed that celestial essance is no longer made in a morter eather. Now it uses the mixing bowl. When I first enountered this a few days ago I thought my memory must be playing tricks on me, the last time I made CEs I did about 500, so it's been a little while. Good to know I'm not losing my mind already.<br />
