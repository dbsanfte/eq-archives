<br />
This has been a long road for me which started in June ( or was it july  :oops:  ) of 2001 *omg.. i was'nt off by a month, i was off by a year. BWG the druid came into being 2000* when Beechwoodgrey the warrior became BWG the druid. Back than the only craft of choice to grandmaster was Jewelcraft, if i remember right flecthing could go as far as 215, pottery 188, tailoring 115 or so til wu's than 158, think brewing was 168, baking 162, smithing at 248 was a diff story but at the time jewel craft was actually useful..smithing not.<br />
<br />
Anyways..it's kinna a hollow victory for me now that we have the ability to raise all our skills to 250 i guess i should consider this a half way mark  ;)  <br />
<br />
Thanks for listening to me blow my own horn /hugs<br />

I keep watching those numbers of yours climb as you approach and hit 250 on more trades and just don't know how you do it.  Was enough of a struggle for me to get pottery to 250 and most of the others to 200, but smithing and tailoring are still far beyond me.<br />
<br />
Wow...<br />
