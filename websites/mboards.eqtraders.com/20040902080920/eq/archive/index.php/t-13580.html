<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tineras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been trying to forage some yew leaves with my druid...<br />
200 foraging.  I've gone 3 different days for over an hour each day (the first day quaded black panthers and got 13 skins) but no yew leaves.  Second day I got 1 yew leaf and today I've only gotten 2 for a couple hours foraging...<br />
<br />
I already know the RNG hates me, but this seems a bit much.   Did they nerf the yew leaf foraging rate? <br />
I've never ever seen a yew leaf ground spawn, do they really ground spawn there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>naura</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">just my experience.... i foraged two while we &quot;tried&quot; to kill the corrupted unicorn for my boyfriend's nature's defender drop.  it was a pretty short fight : P (maybe 10~15 minutes at most while we burned all our disc) i don't know if i was just lucky.... but if you're on luclin... you can have em : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Britneyy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ground spawns are the best very hard to see being a Neon Green but easiest to get i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think these are like Misty Acorns, extremely rare to forage. If you can stand the time to look up ground spawns, that can help, but I rarely have the patience for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yew leaves are sickenly rare...I remember I spent nearly a week straight in WL hunting for haze panthers and I foraged like 2...ground spawn (or the Bazzar!) are unfotunately the way to go.<br />
<br />
(and no, I've never found a grown spawn either)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Remi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In the time it's taken me to get over 200 panther skins,  I've foraged 6 yew leaves.  :(  <br />
<br />
Part of the problem is they only come from one zone, and there are soooo many other possible forages there.  But, still, the forage rate is rare.  It makes me wish there was an AA to filter forages.<br />
<br />
I've yet to see the ground spawn, but then, it's prolly a green leaf against the green leafy ground background.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aquila Swiftspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've never actually seen a ground spawn of them, and they're rare forages INDEED!<br />
<br />
BUT, I'm wondering...  are ground spawns always stable spawns, or sometimes not?<br />
<br />
For example, in Steamfont, the groundspawn for Iron and Russet Oxides are stable.  Everytime I have ever found them, they're in the same spot.  They may already have been collected, but it's easy to tell.  Similarly, the farm in Kaladim has a stable spawn.<br />
<br />
In contrast, I went through Innothule one day and systematically criss-crossed the zone.  (I know, I have no life!)  I used the in game standard map and compass and walked north and south, moving a few numbers across when I hit the northern/southern zone wall.  I picked up every ground spawn I saw, and used the map function to put the location on the map.<br />
<br />
I've been back several times, and never found ground spawn in one of those places again, not one!  (I have found other ground spawn in Innothule, however.)<br />
<br />
I recall seeing a ground spawn map for Butcherblock.  Does anyone have a link for it, by chance?<br />
<br />
If we work together, and the yew leaves are stable ground spawns, we SHOULD be able to put together a list of locs, which would benefit us all a LOT.</div></div><hr />

Yay, someone hosted that oak bark map somewheres...lemme see if I can find it...if not, I'll email it to you (I think I still have your email addy somewheres)...<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
Found it! (http://www-personal.umich.edu/~buzz/eq/BBoakbarkmap.html)  Much thanks to Kentarre for hosting!<br />
<br />
I think I'll actually just add it to my sig so I don't have to find it again...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>scaevola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">any one have a copy of eq atlas edited map that shows the spawn on yew leaves..I've spent a lot of time looking and never found one...Its depressing ..and about 12 hours on my druid forager(ubah 27 foraging) ..has yielded one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The only person I've ever heard having a successful time finding yew leaf ground spawns was being a bad boy using counter-EULA software. :rolleyes: Not cool.<br />
<br />
I think they are too random - I've never seen one on the ground. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>tibbwini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just a FYI, the changes they're making to the new graphics engine make ground spawns a LOT easier to spot. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kiatek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Does anyone know the spawn time on ground spawns?  short or long?  Probably long, but just thought I would ask :)  I know iron oxide was supposedly a long ground spawn, but what about yew leaves and oak bark and others?<br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />

However, even after dropping a yew leaf on the ground so I was confident of what I was looking for, and after spending 2 days trolling the specific areas for yew leaf ground spawn, I still wasn't able to find one.  :p<br />
<br />
Approximately 30 hours of foraging, 9 yew leaves.  bleh!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lanalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah, same thing with me Remi.<br />
<br />
I spent roughly an hour and a half the other day in WL running around looking for yew leaves, and I got two. When I found the yew leaves, I thought, &quot;these things are so obnoxiously bright green against the dark green floor, how can I NOT see them?&quot; but lo and behold, I still can't find them easily!<br />
<br />
On a side note, a guildmate is constantly in WL farming for haze panther eyes, and he gives me all his yew leaves and pantherskins. :D</div></div><hr />

&quot;Is there a map like that for Misty Acorn ground spawns?&quot;<br />
<br />
There isn't really a map, but there is a secret, that I'll share with you since you know the super secret &quot;true tradeskiller's handshake&quot;.  If you look at a map of the Misty Thicket, you'll see that it's split east and west by the Wall.  Draw a second imaginary line across the middle to split it north and south as well, and you'll find that there are four ground spawns, one in each of the four quadrants.  That said, I find acorns more often near the big hill just south of the PoK book in the southeast quadrant, and among the goblin camps south of the Runnyeye entrance in the southwest quadrant.  For the northern ones, I haven't noticed any particular place that's better than any other, so you'll need to canvass, but at least if you find a spawn, you can skip the rest of whatever quadrant you're currently in.<br />

I'd go ahead Kyte and hopefully someone will have info on the creater...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>storywalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I kept the original map, too.  I have it in my EQ photo album.  The link can be fickle, so if you want the map, I would recommend printing or downloading it.  Plus, that saves my bandwidth a bit.  I did make sure to cite the original creator...Wyrdlan.  <br />

Whenever I look for Yew Leaves (never any more) I get wasted.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>lilleighofpovar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I have been a 250 tailoror for over a year and a half now and can share some info on this.<br />
I have spent countless hours foraging and getting ground spawns of both of these items. <br />
With the acorns I can say that i have found them everywhere in the zone but the best places are near the little noobie camps past the wall. The goblins, orcs etc and the valleys in between.<br />
For both leaves I have had alot better luck finding these at nite.<br />
As for the yew leaves, I started marking where I find them on my map since the in-game mapping started. I counted about 60 leaves that I have gotten since then. <br />
I also have used that map of hotspots for leaves and mave found most my leaves in the lower east section there. <br />
They are a real pain in the butt to find. Example: this week ive spent about 4 hrs or so here and there looking for them at nitetime in game and killin panthers at nite, found (4) leaves on ground and foraged (1). Crappy I know.................<br />
Hope this helps someone, was looking to see if anyone had cracked this thing, I also knew a guy that could get about 15-20 of them an hour. He used to supply me way back when, yet to figure out where/how he did it less he did a cheat.<br />
