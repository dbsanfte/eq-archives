<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gamaddor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I read the same thing.  I haven't seen hundreds listed yet, or even ONE hundred yet, but there are more items listed as tradeskill that I have yet to see recipes for here or in game.  For example, Lemming Fur, Nightshade, Egg Sack Cocoon (or something like that).  They all say they are used in tradeskills in the stat window, but there are no recipes for them in the lost dungeons tradeskill books in game found on the merchants in the wayfarer's camps.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have extra info on those items or any of the unposted recipes yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are easily over 100 recipes in smithing alone.<br />
<br />
2 types of armor (ring and plate) x 5 themes x 12 pieces per set = 120 recipes.<br />
<br />
Add to that five tempers (brewing) and right there you have 125 recipes.<br />
<br />
Don't know if the other added recipes bring it up to over 200, which would justify their claim of &quot;hundreds,&quot; though.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Whoops!  Hang on, there are three sizes of each armor.  So, 120 recipes x 3 sizes = 360, and we're home free. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gamaddor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You got me there, smithing got hooked up with 5 new tempers and of course with 3 sizes that's lots of new recipes.  Happy day for smithies.  While brewers get maybe 10 recipes and bakers get 5-10 also.  No new tailoring that I saw.  Fletchers get one new item that creates about 15 new recipes, when you account for optional cams and tools in the combine.  Alchemists get maybe a dozen new recipes.  No poison book, though the Nightshade sounds like it would belong there.  And of course jewelers get 3 new gems to play with, creating 15 new recipes.<br />
<br />
All bow down to getting technical about it, you're right, there have to be at least 200 new recipes.  All in all though it seems this expansion doesn't offer much to the tradeskillers' market.  Not a lot of the end products are very desirable.  On the other hand, that point is debateable and everyone is entitled to their opinion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For those interested in Lemming Fur backpacks here’s a thread and some stats: <br />
<br />
http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=10822<br />
<br />
Lemming Fur Backpack<br />
Container: CLOSED.<br />
LORE ITEM <br />
WT: 3.0   Weight Reduction: 25%<br />
Capacity: 10   Size Capacity: GIANT<br />
<br />
Tailoring Components: backpack pattern, embroidering needle, lemming fur(2), platinum thread<br />
Trivial at: 150<br />
<br />
The platinum thread runs about 210pp so this isn’t the cheapest bag to make and its lore so you can have only one.  The only thing that makes this better than a deluxe toolbox is the 25% weight reduction and you’ll be paying over 200pp for it.  Personally I’d be more excited about it if it wasn’t lore and if it used a cheaper thread.  Or if it was 50% or more weight reduction.  But it does give you another option if you want another weight reduction bag.</div></div><hr />
