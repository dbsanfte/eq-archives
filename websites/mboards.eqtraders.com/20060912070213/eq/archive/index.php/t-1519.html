But if you need oak bark, youll have a LOT more success foraging them. Theyre HARD to find, look like a little light green leaf, almost impossible to see. Try to drop a yew leaf or oak bark on the ground and see how it look. Basically spending 20 min each time youre in BB to try and check, and MAYBE finding 1 or 2 once in a a while arent worth it, faster to go sit and forage in Kith.</div></div><hr />

There were many threads on this (from yew leaf discussions) before the switch to the new board but I cant seem to find the posts.</div></div><hr />

Goodluck</div></div><hr />

And don't forget to check the inzone merchs, and sometimes the ones right off the zone.</div></div><hr />

I got over 10 Oak Barks, but I was only in there half a day(dont want to be in there at night) for 3 EQ days. If you have a second computer/account, or just alot of spare time, you chould get alot of oak bark just sitting in Kith.</div></div><hr />

I am sorry, but this is the second stupid post i read from rassy.  If you dont know for sure what you are talking about...please, for the love of Norrath....dont post a answer.<br />
<br />
Oak bark, if droped by a player still looks like a tiny green diamond..just as it does when its a ground spawn.  NOT a baggie!<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh..if you are wondering what the other post was, Rassy posted that you can go to the Nexus and the Bazaar even if you DO NOT have Luclin.  Sometimes I wonder about people.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the singled out flame, it wont happen again...... :roll:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rassy fleetfoot</div><div class="date">12-29-2002, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i dont consider it a flame to correct someone. If dropping a normally ground spawn item makes it look like that spawn again, i didnt know they changed that and i apologise..it hasnt always been like that, or maybe i've just never been goofy enough to go dropping things im trying to collect :) everything else looks like a baggie..cept weapons. <br />
<br />
As far as the bazaar, i know they changed the nexus so anyone could use it, and i thought the bazaar was the same way, i could be wrong. in any case, it probably WILL be that way soon enough, as the only thing that stopped bazaar use (as a trader) that i knew of, was the UI which was luclin only. the old UI is going away soon, so anyone can use new UI, hence anyone can use the bazaar..if they can get there..<br />
<br />
sue me (or correct me) if i'm wrong, but please, for the childrens sake, keep the attitude to yourself.</div></div><hr />
