Now there is already a thread on morning dew, but, the fact is it strays way off the topic of what class farms better.  No help. What I want to know is does anybody have the locs of the ground spawn of morning dew?  I seen one post stating that one was close to MM, but it looks like this person doesnt want to share this info. why?  It only benefits us all to know where the ground spawns are.  So I guess to get down to it, If you know the locs, share the info.  Meanwhile, I am gonna risk running amuk Lfay for these locs, and when I find them they will be posted.<br />

I don't have location coordinates, and I haven't been back to Lfay since my last post in this subject. The one ground spawn I saw there was right in front of the MM zone by the ruins where the butterflies are.<br />
As to what class farms best/better there, I can only surmise that many should be able to and levels matter in determining the best class.<br />
Being a 63 shaman, I can only say that I farm LFay very easy. I was there to specifically get Brownie parts and while I waited for them to respawn, I would kill Fairies and butterflies and pretty much anything else.  I got a good number of Dews from the fairies, and foraged a few, although being an iksar my foraging is sporadic at best.<br />
I hope this satisfies your concerns.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elawen</div><div class="date">12-30-2002, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its ok =) I think that thru trial and error I have found that the ground spawn is random thru out the zone.  Two locs I have found so far are -887, +3116 with no respawn after over two hours of checking and no one else in the zone, and -704, + 2992.  ground spawn looks lighter green in color than the actual ground color.  May need to see one to know what you are looking for though as if you got sow and running fast you can easily pass right by it. more info to come as I continue to forage/look for ground spawn.<br />

I do not have spawn points for them. This was a VERY long time ago(before the @#$^@$# Undead Unicorn was added). All of them were on different game days, and all of them spawned between the game hours of 4am and 9am(I started searching at midnight gametime, and went to noon, only one in the zone and never caught any outside of these times). <br />
<br />
All in all it WAS NOT worth it at the time. Especially considering the sheer number needed. <br />
<br />
This of course could have changed and i hope it did.<br />

Now to my point....  My druid sits in Lfay near the zone to SF right next to the tree that is near the tunnel to SF and forages for the dew.  Yesterday I considered it to be a lucky day.  He foraged 16 morning dews in a 5 hour period.  On two seperate occassions he foraged 2 in a row then 3 in row.  That is the most I have ever foraged in that amount of time.  Maybe that is the spot to be in, dunno.  I have never gone looking for the ground spawns as I am on my other account with my paly killing for pelts in EK or my ranger in Feerott for the spiderling silks.<br />

Hope this helps some of you out there.<br />

Well, actualy they must die because they have a fairly good drop rate for morning dew. It's not exactly a common drop but the 3 brownies in the brownie village uncommon drop morning dew. This basicaly doubled my foraging (200 foraging skill) yeld. I haven't tried mass slaughtering other sylvan creatures yet (pixies are so cute!   :oops: Brownies on the other hand...). Kill the guards, if you can manage to do that the brownies and brownie farmer are way green and should single pull no matter what you do. I left the merchants alone (they should poof like every other merchant in the game, I didn't feel a need to test this.) Also, if your looking for brownie parts to do the newbie armor quest I found that the brownie guards have the best drop rate, though the lesser brownies can drop them as well (how in the world is a lvl 16 wizard suppose to kill a brownie in Lfay anyways?).  :? <br />
Currently, I don't belive Brownie Scouts drop morning dew. If they do, someone please correct me. I didn't hunt them myself but a group was keeping the zone clear for the 2 hours I was there and they reported no morning dew from the scouts. Maybe I'll have to take my own reven...er...samples to find out for sure. :twisted:</div></div><hr />

Also if you come out of MM through the ruins the little hill right there on the MM side two spots one to right end and one to left end.  Also if you come out of MM and turn to left right away there is a little depression in the ground right there and I found one in the bottom.  If you come out of MM and turn right on the wall right behind the tree there near the MM tunnel entrance.<br />
<br />
It would be pretty easy software-wise for them to make it truly random or put them in random spots in a small area.  I doubt they are in exact points at common intervals.<br />

<br />
will have to try the brownies i guess, i tried foraging with 3 people there all foraging..and got like 5 in an hour..that SUCKS! moonlight essense was easier to get..sheesh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corii</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only ground spawns I found in the fairy village were sarcospha (sp?) and jack-o-lantern fungus.<br />
<br />
If you are foraging for dew you can do the Katta quest for a Foraging Machete (10% forage mod) to help you forage the goodies faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morani</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only time I've found a GS dew was heading out of G-Fey into L-Fey. Out of the &quot;tunnel&quot; and immediately left at the corner of the &quot;tunnel&quot; into the actual zone. I'm pretty sure I've seen GP there before but it's been a long time since I've paid attention. <br />
<br />
As for class, if you are foraging I don't think there is a difference between the classes; just the skill level. Also, I recommend questing the Foraging Machete: adds % to your forage skill. That and make friends with the new Wood Elf Rangers and Druids too; you can buy the occasional odd one they foraged off them right away. (and yes, you CAN forage them as a new/lowbie; by the time I hit 25th level I had collected 4 stacks of them and 5 stacks of Cinnamon Sticks. I made a dwarf VERY happy went I decided to sell them.)<br />
<br />
I've not tried this myself, but it might help to try foraging in zones that either have less competition on the zone specific forage list (I.E. Kedge Keep has a total of SEVEN zone specifics) or also offer a forgeable that is desirable (I.E. Cinnamon Sticks in G-Fey). Felwithe, Kaladim, Ak'Anon, Castle Mistmoore, Crushbone, &amp; Estate of Unrest all seem to only have Morning Dews as zone specific.<br />
<br />
Hope I've help answer your question.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rassy fleetfoot</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 10:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can forage dew in MM and unrest? thought they were only in greater and lesser..good to know :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArrakeenNaedShoj</div><div class="date">01-04-2003, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unless they have changed something without telling us, the only two zones you can forage Morning Dew in is Greater and Lesser Faydark. While it is true that the &quot;rare&quot; forage table is smaller in Lfay than Gfay, and you will therefore forage more MD yourself if you are foraging there, you can however buy dews off of newbies(if you can afford it) in Gfay, and you can always sell the cinnie sticks to make a profit to turn around and buy more of them. I used to do my foraging sessions in 2 hour blocks, and I consistently foraged more in Lfay than Gfay, but usually ended up with more in Gfay offering SoWs/DS' and cash for them and trading/selling cinnie sticks for them.<br />
<br />
Lfay has been empty on my server since they added the @#$%@ undead unicorn, except the occasional high level caster camping the brownies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trethyl</div><div class="date">01-05-2003, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I be a 55 druid, to verify for my self the info about the drops, i went to the dreaded faerie village home of the vile and malicious gearheart, the cold hearted automaton and his minions the wicked faeries.<br />
<br />
yes faeries do drop morning dew. i ran around and agroed every fearie in the place including the odd roamer and then upheavaled. was about 15 to 20 fearies soon as they was down i mena litterally as soon as they was down there was like another 8 up. killed them waited a bit liek a minute and the original crop was up i knew was oriiginal run cause the guards were up i did this about 4 times so thats 23 to 28 fearies ever liek 15 minutes or so. i foraged 6 dews in that time and i looted 1 dew.<br />
<br />
hehe i belive that is on purpose actually or else peeps like me would be farming them like candy, like putting acrylia ore on lvl 10 to 20 mobs hehe would be a disaster, if the drop rate was not reduced insanely. so i figure like someone mentioned earlier the higher lvl mobs liek the brownie guards and outcasts prob have a better drop rate.<br />
<br />
as an aside note for you jade imbuers and ivory imbuers them jade/ivory drop farily regularly at the fearies</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanana</div><div class="date">01-06-2003, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Decent drop rate off of Brownie guards, brownies, and the brownie farmer. Also dropped off Faerie, Faerie guard, and Faerie maiden. Attempted to try pixies but didnt have any luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rassy fleetfoot</div><div class="date">01-07-2003, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">tried the brownie guards last night..those guys are MEAN! but yeah they do drop dew..i wouldnt say its a common drop..i ended up with 20 brownie parts and 10 dews (some of those were foraged)..killed everything but the merchants. long boring spawn i tell ya..but you can forage while waiting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morani</div><div class="date">01-09-2003, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Morning Dew might NOT be forgeable outside L-Fay and G-Fay. I read the forge tables at: www.eqtraders.com/location/foraged.htm and might have miss read them. The top of the table for Feydwer lists Morning Dew as being forgeable in &quot;All Feydarks&quot;.  I think I read that as &quot;All Feydwer&quot;.   :oops: <br />
<br />
Sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meirril</div><div class="date">01-13-2003, 09:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having foraged long and hard in almos all of fadark, I can guarentee it only forages in Gfay and Lfay. It certainly dose NOT forage in MM or Unrest (where I have spent sever hours hunting, PL'ing, and eventualy farming Moonlight Temper. I love unrest, but dislike MM. Good thing I know how to climb trees or collecting Moonlight Essence in MM would be difficult!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rassy fleetfoot</div><div class="date">01-14-2003, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">an aside..contrary to how it might seem, i seemed i may have been able to forage more in gfay than in lesser. While it seems silly, due to the addition of cinn sticks to the 'rare forage' table, i got a ton less water and roots in greater and left with 17 dew total after about 2 hours, as opposed to the 4 i got in lesser. also had 22 cinn sticks which my baker friend will be thrilled with im sure.</div></div><hr />
