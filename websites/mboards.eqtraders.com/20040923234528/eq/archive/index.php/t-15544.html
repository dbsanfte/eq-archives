<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nex Alacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently at 185 or 186 tailoring and am still working on ribbons and Acrylia studded.  I am not too terribly concerned with skilling up super fast, but would just like to get to 240 someday.  My plan was to use a few Solstice combines to mebbe 200... possibly 210, but I dread how many combines I would have to do from 188 to get there, and I am not that big on just sitting and doing combines.  I also wanted to do a wide variety of Velious armors as they still sell fairly well on Stromm and I don't mind farming while waiting for groups.<br />
<br />
Anyways, to my question... I had recently considered doing some Haversack combines in there on the way to 240 and I was curious to what level they will start to appear yellow in the UI?<br />
<br />
The reason I ask is I usually have pretty good success rates on yellow things, at least success rates that warrant combines, and figured I could get some extra plat out of the Haversacks I do make.  I don't feel like wasting the BDs on red combines, and don't even want to make one attempt to find out what level they will be yellow.  I will be using a geerlok too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>borblefoot furtoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You actually have fairly decent success rates as low as the 190's, maybe even lower, you'll have to ask around a bit. The trivial is only 251 and by the time you are in the lower 200 unless you get bitten by the RNG you will seldom fail. I did a run of 45 bags the other day with only 2 fails on final combines with my skill in the mid 230's and that is fairly typical<br />
<br />
Once your skill is over 200 you will find you fail more often on the BD subcombines than on the final haversack combines itself. Unless your smithing , potting and brewing are all already over 200 as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Silound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I do backpacks myself, and have been since the 170's. I've maintained about a 4/5 average on successes the whole way. I don't plan on attempting any haversacks till I hit around 215 though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Try some haversacks... especially if the 185-6 doesn't include geerlok %. <br />
<br />
I had a good success rate from the about 190ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Emron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm at 196 without the geerlok equipped, and it would be safe to try some haversacks?<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With a skill of 200ish you will probably make about 50% of your attempts. I made them off and on from 190-250 skill. Around 200ish I made about half.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Emron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Excellent, thanks for the info Renjah!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Durgle Fogstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">at 194 tailoring i've been 7/11 8 slot bags, and 1/6 10 slot bags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Remember that you'll also need access to pottery, brewing, and smithing at as high a level you can manage, in order to minimize blue diamond losses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dyllwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Remember that you'll also need access to pottery, brewing, and smithing at as high a level you can manage, in order to minimize blue diamond losses.<br />
<br />
That's the real trick to Haversacks. While it's painful to fail the final combine, most of the cost of failures once you get a high enough skill comes from the subcombines. You have 9 chances to lose a single Blue Diamond, and 1 chance to lose 3 of them at once. You have 3 chances to lose a single Platinum thread and one chance to lose 3 at once. If your pottery, brewing and smithing aren't up high enough above the trivials for those combines you will lose a ton of plat.<br />
<br />
Don't sweat the tailoring combines on the bags until you can reliably make the infused threads :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>scarbrowed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I did not keep track of my success rate in the 180's. But I know that buying tufts at 50pp each, and BD's at vendor prices, I was doing better than breaking even selling Haversacks at 5500pp or so each.  If your server market supports a good price, you should even be able to make a little extra money to buy other skillup tailoring supplies. <br />
<br />
Of course, I hear some servers are down to 3k or so. At that price, I would probably make cultural masks with my acorns instead for faster skillups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mahlig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I started making the Haversacks at 185 skill.  Like you, I am meandering to 200+ instead of sprinting there.  I made 5 of 6 on my first run.  That was a misrepresentation of what my eventual success rate would be, but sadly, I got overzealous.  My skill is now 191ish (all skillups on haversacks) and I have a bit over 50% success rate, but not much over.  I never made backpacks because I don't think it is a cost efficient use of the tufts.  I got 10k for a Haversack last week.  Yeah, I charge a lot, but I don't think there is a lot of competition.  Then again, no one hunts in Velious either, so no tufts for sale.</div></div><hr />
