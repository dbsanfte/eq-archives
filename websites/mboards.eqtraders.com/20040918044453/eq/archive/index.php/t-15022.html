<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Windru Peacekeaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering why I couldn't make the GoD fishy baking Cakes combines...until I found the new recipe for egg batter ...<br />
<br />
(does a happy dance)<br />
<br />
But I first wondered why cakes would use Vegetables in the first place...I don't know about you, but I like my cakes with chocolate.  <br />
<br />
Yes, I know there are some of you who like Carrot Cake, but I still have reservations about Veggie Cake...<br />
<br />
This is just my 1 copper piece observation...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">chocolate covered fish and crab cakes?? :boggled:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Windru Peacekeaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hehe..<br />
<br />
I didn't think about it that way Tinile :) <br />
<br />
I guess I'm just an old fashioned chocolate cake kinda guy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">RL crab cakes are not made with chocolate ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We used to buy chocolate-covered ants and bumble bees (no joke), so why not veggies in a cake? <br />
<br />
Just think, an Artichoke and Avacado pound cake covered in picante and chocolate! {be still my beating heart...} :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Crab cakes with a nice mole sauce might actually work (mole as in the Mexican sauce based on chocolate and peppers and many different spices not like the critters that burrow around eating roots.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The ingredients are 'caked' together, so are a cake :)<br />
<br />
You have fishcakes, right? :) Poached fish, mashed potato, parsley, breadcrumbs... mmmm....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cinaed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sure, I used to go to Rocky Point in Rhode Island every year for all you can eat clam cakes and chowder.  That's the sort of cake they're talkin about here.<br />
<br />
My puzzlement comes from these souffles with barbecued crab and tuna in them..aroo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There are lots of souffles that aren't sweet.   A souffle is just a puffy baked item that uses egg whites to give it a light texture.  They can be made from sweet stuff like chocolate and fruit to savory things like cheese, spinach, and I guess even cragbeast.  The trick is to get the things cooked and served before the thing collapses into something that may taste good but looks kind of depressing.  That is mostly done by beating the egg whites without any sort of oils or fats present and then folding quickly into the rest of the premixed ingredients and baking ASAP.  You need to serve it ASAP too or it will fall.  The fat content destabilizes the egg white foam meaning that all souffles will collapse (or they were something someone just called a souffle in the first place to make it sound more chic.)  :)</div></div><hr />
