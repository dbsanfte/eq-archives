<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, let's get the obvious stuff out of the way first:<br />
<br />
1.  Are you using the [u]advanced[/i] research container for your class (chanter, mage, necro, wiz) obtained from Researcher Alviarik in Gunthak (phantasmal tome, arch magus grimoire, warlock's book of binding, sorcerer's lexicon) ?<br />
<br />
2.  Are you sure it was a quill and not your Research geerlock ?(been there, done that, it's why I ask :p)<br />
<br />
3.  Are you POSITIVE you were using Yaeth's 61 RIGHT and not the left side?<br />
<br />
<br />
If the answer to all of these is yes, then we'll have to look the recipe up in the in-game book, which I can't remember where to buy, for priest spells anyways...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Winter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hi Maevenniia, and yes to all questions i am useing right book, right page and  the correct rune and before i do any combine i ALWAYS check to be sure its a quill and not my geerlok in book ( lol i have done that too) my skill is at 189 atm so  by that u can see i been doing this awhile. when they first made it so could do the other spells i had trouble with the shammy spell  Malosini (words of Anniihilation,words of Virtue, parch, quill&lt;is what is on print out&gt;) so it lacked words of Recall . i am wondering if this is same so was in hopes someone out there  had made this or knows what it lacks.<br />
          thanks again,<br />
               Wintersune<br />
<br />
p.s. i went to gunthak thinking maybe book to buy was there all they have are for  reg casters classes ( mage,necro,wizzy,chanter) i looked in my home town but found nothing there so no clue where to look now. :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Inien of Vazaelle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The caster guild halls in PoK.  The druid recipe books are in the good town area to the north I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>JMorgana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Also, not to state the obvious but healer classes cannot research spells...I'm guessing you're a druid, which may be why it's not working...if you take the components to any INT caster with a high enough research skill, they can do it for you.  They may request a donation or a flat fee for doing this though.</div></div><hr />

Seeing as she stated she was using the newer 8 slot containers for combination and that priests can not get those containers, I would have to assume she is using an INT caster to do this combine.  :)   She also stated research skill of 189, which I doubt is on her druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Winter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">lol i am a wizzy so yes i can make these if i have the right combine info.<br />
            thanks so much for posts folks,<br />
                    Winter<br />
 Heading Pok to look around will let u know what i find out :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bregalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Couple days ago, I combined two copies of ISC.   Yaeth 61 right and Rune of Synergy - combined with no probs.</div></div><hr />
