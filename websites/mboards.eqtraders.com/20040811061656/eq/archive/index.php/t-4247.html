<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In the &quot;for what it's worth&quot; department, as I am trying to squeak 2 points out of the platinum ribbons, I am putting the successes on my mule at roughly cost.  If you are working on the robes, these might save you a trip and some time.  I've got 3 different flavors already available.<br />
<br />
And, for those of you who were around for my dye pricing tirade, you'll find about 5 kinds of dye, with more coming, at a much more reasonable cost than the competition has been listing for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>lonewylfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dye, Zabu, dye!!!!  :D <br />
sorry, couldn't resist the pun ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
And to think I was going to share the spoils of my raid on the Ak 'Anon merchants with you.  I had all the spring water I needed, and another stack set aside for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>lonewylfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Awww, no need to set aside spring water for me, my farming (or attempt) of micro servos has yielded more than I ever wanted o_O<br />
I'm honored though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">OK, the number of platinum ribbons on my mule seems to be increasing almost as quickly as my bank account is decreasing.  If I don't do something  soon, I will have to file for bankruptcy.  (Anyone know a good lawyer in PoK?)<br />
<br />
Currently I have about:<br />
<br />
  Platinum Black Ribbon(DE) (22)<br />
  Platinum Forestgreen Ribbon(HIE) (8)<br />
  Platinum Indigo Ribbon(IKS) (1)<br />
  Platinum Blue Ribbon(ERU) (1)<br />
  Platinum Beige Ribbon(ERU) (7)<br />
<br />
I've seen no other ribbons in the bazaar to date.  Also, except for the people that think they can get 250p for a vial of cultural dye, I have seen no other robe components, especially the research swatches.<br />
<br />
Since I was able to make 187 using the ribbons (2 points, 39 combines) I've set aside a handful of each of the human cultural dyes.  I'm not sure which swatches I'm going to be able to get my hands on, if any, so I don't want to turn them into ribbons just yet.  (My poor Necro needs 6 levels before she can even request the advanced research container.)<br />
<br />
Is anyone else working on these robes in piecemeal fashion?  Perhaps we can begin to co-op these sub-combined results to everyone's benefit.  Why risk failure on a trivial combine (unless your goal is to corner the robe market for a given race.)<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I've got all of the ribbons up for sale at 110p each to cover my cost of the platinum ribbon and the foraged dye component.  I've also got about half a dozen or so different types of dye made up and on Euell for ribbon attempts when he finally finishes Wu's (132-144 the other night in roughly 35 attempts.  It won't be long now.)  If you really need some of a particular kind, we can likely work something out.  As a halfling, he can't make a finished product, so the flavor of the ribbons he skills up on is pretty much moot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>lonewylfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That's why I asked if the ribbons were no drop the other night, still haven't seen any in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I do think it's insane that people are taking a foraged/dropped component, combining it with a 1sp (is it even that?) flask of water, and selling it for 250pp. Then again, that would nicely pad my bank (if anybody actually buys them that high).  :? <br />
<br />
I'll only be working on ribbons, if that. I don't think I've seen any research components drop yet, I'll have to go print out a list of them.<br />
<br />
If anybody needs any of the foraged stuff (other than plant shoots) just lemme know...seem to always get a ton of it...though I do love selling to Zabu :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just make sure to alternate my buying between Zabu and Euell, so that you feel like you've been really, really busy!   :D</div></div><hr />

I still haven't  put any of the dye up, as I have stalled in getting Euell trivial with Wu's (darn RL...)  I sat yesterday morning and tossed 9 stacks of poison vials.  Now to fire, buy pearls, hand them all off to Sprowt to enchant....<br />
<br />
Hmmm...actually beginning to look forward to the yard work today!  Gotta love springtime in Florida.  /em dons his shades   8)</div></div><hr />

BTW I'm looking for a DE Tailor to make the top DE robe. Am searching for ingredients. Anyone know of a 220ish skilled one?<br />

<br />
If you can't use them, give me a yell when you see me online and I'll kick you a refund.  This bit with the research components needed to make the swatches is making these robes damn near impossible. :cry:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">my guess you should work on getting swatches completed first.. then you can make the dye, ribbon, needle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">my guess you should work on getting swatches completed first.. then you can make the dye, ribbon, needle.<br />
<br />
That would make the most sense, and I am holding off combining any (more) of the human ribbons until I see what swatches I can get my hands on.  I've got a list of the research components next to my keyboard so I don't inadvertantly sell one, and I may start a merchant mining operation specifically targetting those items to hopefully kickstart things along.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, with no researchers in my stable with any hope of making these combines anytime in the forseeable future, I am at the mercy of the market.  So far, I have not seen a single swatch for sale, which doesn't surprise me in the least.<br />
<br />
So, ribbons for tailoring points, embroidery needles for smithing points, cultural needles for even more smithing points; Euell is going to be a busy little Hobbit.  I guess it's better than nothing.  <br />
<br />
Then I can start scurrying around for HQ brute hides and acorns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">im farming LOY components now for some of the new tailoring, smithing, and tinkering items... to determine if its worth it for skilling up.<br />
<br />
tinkering drops: 1 or 2 drops clearing the ENTIRE beach spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">tinkering drops: 1 or 2 drops clearing the ENTIRE beach spawns.<br />
<br />
I've been stockpiling the ones I find when I go after ribbons.  I think I have about half a dozen quills, one or two maneater roots, and one waterlogged thingie.  <br />
<br />
I think I got Sprowt up to about 115 before I ran out of PMBs, but I picked him up another 10 or 12 this weekend.  I want to get his skill up a bit more before I start blowing thru the LOY drops and the coiled springs.<br />
<br />
I took out about half the beach with Zabu, and had not one single drop.  Nada.  I took Euell there, and everything was still blue, so I put him in the far corner by the water and kept the area clear until KEI ran out, and I got basically crap and one set of cracked finger bones.  <br />
<br />
So much for farming the tinkering drops.  If you hadn't said you got a couple of items, I would have suspected the TLC was on in that zone.<br />
<br />
I gave up and took Zabu back to the village, where at least some of the mobs were light blue, and made about 100p selling all the strange new weapons that dropped.<br />
<br />
But, I digress...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Veldin Darkfire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Zabu i apprecite the offer of a refund but don't want to put you out and they were not badly price...just taking up precious bank space :) <br />

<br />
Not putting me out in the least, and the offer still stands.  Completely up to you.<br />
<br />
I'll also be putting up some of the gold ribbons that Euell made last night.  At least one Golden Black Ribbon (DE) as well as about half a dozen or so of the Golden White Ribbon(GNM).<br />
<br />
162 and climbing fast!</div></div><hr />
