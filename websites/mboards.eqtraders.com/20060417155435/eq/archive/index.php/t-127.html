<br />
Is there a width height guidline rule for avatar. For example a width of 500 pixels would probably ruin the view.<br />
<br />
What is the bytes limit on sig files ?<br />
<br />
If I am just a poor searcher simpy point me in the right direction.<br />
Thanks[/img]</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lothay</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As yet, EQ Traders does not have an offical policy on .sig file size.  Please do be considereate of others when constructing your .sig. <br />
<br />
Some guidelines are in the FAQ on this topic, and I'm quoting them here. <br />
<br />
Rules for using Signatures <br />
<br />
Don't over-use your signature file. If the signature is bigger than your post, don't use it. <br />
<br />
Keep your signature file small. Some people, believe it or not, still pay for internet information by the amount of bits sent/recieved, and some pay for things by time used. Not everyone has flat-rate high-speed connectivity. Be considerate. No one wants to pay to see your signature a zillion times. <br />
<br />
Keep the signature in good taste, or at least self-moderate. If you would feel uncomfortable explaining your signature to your mother, or a small child, then it doesn't belong in something you will attach to all your posts. <br />

<br />
Looks like your Sig is incomplete?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fuudce</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats one of the good things about phpbb's. it automatically cuts your sig from every post other than the 1st you do in a specific thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ngreth Thergn</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 11:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will raise the Avatar size to 100X100 max.<br />
<br />
I will not raise the byte limit though.  We only have so much HDD space.<br />
<br />
I also enabled Remote avatar's.<br />
<br />
Note.  We do have access to delete/unlink your avatar if it gets out of hand.<br />
<br />
There is just a character limit of 2000 on your .sig.  At this time I have no plans to change that.<br />
<br />
If those get out of hand, we can also delete those if we find a need.<br />
<br />
We will use this if we must :)</div></div><hr />

Haven't dared to test the waters on more serious stuff yet, but all those fishies are making me get the urge ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Knek</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 01:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Silly Niami. You should never eat storebought sushi. Not only does it taste icky, but it's probably been sitting around for a few hours, if not days, and fish doesn't keep very well. Drag the ogre down to your nearest sushi bar and treat thyselves to some Rainbow Rolls and salmon nigiri. And a few bottles of sake :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cause mine is slightly larger than 6k ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Should make a new one anyway.. thats an old pic, just when the new models came out ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kehvrynne</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 09:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll toss out a combined avatar and sig size limit of 15KB.  This is the limit imposed at The Safehouse, and I think it works very well.  The idea is not so much that your avatar is sucking up disk space on our server (though it may be).  Rather, it's to optimize the page load time for ALL users.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that this is merely a suggested limitation at this point.  As alwys, Ngreth and Niami have the final say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Knek</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 12:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I'll be keeping my 15kb remotely linked animated gif avatar, since I don't carry a .sig file at all. It should all even out in the end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fear my total of 11 k! ;)<br />
<br />
Sqooshed that puppy down!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ngreth Thergn</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well.<br />
<br />
Having an overall limit is cool... But I am not sure there is a PHPBB mod that does that :)<br />
<br />
We will jsut keep an eye out for maniacs and kill their sigs (Woot Niami and I can edit people's sigs and avatars!!) if they are too big :)<br />
<br />
I did increase avatar to 8k :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Knek</div><div class="date">12-07-2002, 01:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But I need 15k to be able to show the cake and the skewer and all those other cool baking things. :)<br />
<br />
It's externally linked, but if it's a problem let me know and I'll see if I can trim the fat (haha).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haawk Wolfheart</div><div class="date">12-07-2002, 08:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for bumping up the avatar. I hadn't realized it, but the avatar I was using on EzBoards was 20k (ack!!!). I'd just found it somewhere, liked it and started using it. :oops: But I was easily able to trim it down to 7k without any noticable diff in the animation (for both EzBoard and here ;)), but below 6k and the anim has noticablely lost something.</div></div><hr />
