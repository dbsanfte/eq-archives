<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eleena Transient</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Something I been pondering that I think would help with the rarity of some research parts.  What if we could 'reverse'' research?  Pop a spell  + parchment + quill in a tome, click combine, and out pops the parts it takes to research it.  Give it, at best, a 50% chance of success.<br />
<br />
(going to use Dead Men Floating as my example)<br />
<br />
The way I visualize research is the student sit down with &quot;Words of Asylum&quot; and &quot;Words of Agony&quot;, studies them, and draws up a plan to cast Dead Men Floating.  <br />
<br />
The same student could sit down with &quot;Words of Agony&quot;, &quot;Words of Obliteration&quot;, and 'Rune of Divergence&quot; and devise a druid &quot;Banishment&quot; scroll.  <br />
<br />
Similarly the student could analyze &quot;Words of Asylum&quot; and &quot;Toharon's Thesis pg 18 right&quot; and come up with a cleric's &quot;Death Pact&quot;.<br />
<br />
So, stands to reason that &quot;Banishment&quot; shares a little with DMF, and &quot;Death Pact&quot; has the other parts.  So why can't our necro student deconstruct &quot;Banishment&quot; and &quot;Death Pact&quot; into its elemental parts, take what he needs, and make the spell he desires?<br />
<br />
The success rate for reversing should be very low, as its much more dificult to unravel something without destroying it.  But this would be a boon to researchers.  Particuar to spells that require an element used in many recipes (like Dew Clover).  Would also help a great deal with the LoY tailored robes (deconstruct a 'color slant' spell for Keri's 5 and make a 'robe of slant').  Instead of selling those 10 copies of Circle of Seasons you looted, convert them into a few Rune of Tempest, Comglomeration, and Etched Signets.<br />
<br />
The real rare spells still have unique parts, like Rune of Scintilation for GSS and Rune of Zephyr (only used on 3 lvl 60 spells).  So you won't have a flood of the Real rare spells, but it'll help get the 'common' parts of the way<br />
<br />
Whatcha think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gnormy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">would be nice but its better to think of it as like baking.<br />
Once you mix and cook the ingredients, you cant get them back.<br />
sugar + eggs + other crap = cookies<br />
but <br />
Cookies can't be reversed into eggs.<br />
<br />
good try tho.</div></div><hr />
