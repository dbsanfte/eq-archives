<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kuliddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...i would like to know if the following has occured to others.<br />
<br />
New tradeskill box (which shows automatically receipes) during gameplay are really a cool feature. However, for some reason, my ranger's fletching kit doesn't open the tradeskill window. I only get &quot;the box&quot; opened to combine my stuff and that's all. I don't get it, my warrior has one and the tradeskill window opens fine.<br />
<br />
Has this happened to anyone here? Is it just a toggle that I have to activate (if so I missed it).<br />
<br />
Thanks all :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Press (ctrl+right click) to get into the new tradeskill window if the toggle is off.</div></div><hr />
