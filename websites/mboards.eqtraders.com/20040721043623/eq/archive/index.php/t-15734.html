<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Whazy Weemage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I noticed that there is a cultural forge in Ak'Anon, centrally located for easy access.<br />
<br />
I have yet to stumble upon any recipies for this particular forge.  Are there any Gnomish Smithing Recipies that require use of the Gnomish Cultural Forge?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cubwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">there's a FAQ for a reason.<br />
Heck, it was easy to find using Search.<br />
<br />
&gt;Q: Wait! I've seen cultural forges in other towns too, what are those for?<br />
&gt;A: Erudites, Halflings and Wood Elves all have cultural forges in their towns, but they are primarily used for tailoring to make things like studs, boning and even their cultural sewing kits. Ak`Anon's cultural forge currently sits cold as there is no known use for it at this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frerin the Smith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In the general forge UI, there is an entry for &quot;lubricous bits&quot;.  Lubricous ore is an oily metal ore by definition and is listed as an ingrediant for &quot;lubricous bits&quot;.  I have not found any information from many EQ websites about &quot;lubricous ore&quot;, but thinking that gnomes deal with grease and oil, I have an idea that the old, cold Ak'anon forge might have something to do with this mystery.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any ideas or more information about this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmmm, I always thought that forge was there for Ogres to make Gnome Kabobs on....</div></div><hr />

Gnomish Cultural Forge - it where gnomes are foraged, culturally. /shifty eyes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Delores Mulva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nobody has found a use yet for Drop of Grease, a random tradeskill-tagged drop off clockworks in Steamfront. By looking at comments on Allakhazam's, they've been in game at least since Feb. 2002 and have no known use. That's old enough, IIRC, to make it a possible cultural item. Has anyone tried turning the Drops into a temper, using a recipe similar to the dwarven one (two Drops, one Gnomish Spirits)? Does anyone have any emulator info as to what is listed near Drop of Grease?<br />
<br />
EDIT: I'm using Lucy, and incrementing the item ID number. Right before Drop of Grease is Essence of Sunlight and Griffene Blood, and three after it is Frost Temper. It is a cultural drop, I'd bet my beard on it. Interestingly enough, Lucy does not have the two items that come after the Drop of Grease in their database. That emulator info could really come in handy right about now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The difficulty is that gnomes already have a cultural temper; metallic temper which is minotuar blood, firewater and gnomish spirits and is used in our cultural armour, clockwork armour. The fact that it is tinkered rather than smithed means that the Ak'Anon Forge is most likely a mistake, a forgotten addition from before the dev's changed their mind and made our armour tinkered rather than smithed and was never removed. I can't see us gnomes being allowed to have two cultural armours.</div></div><hr />

Unless there is cultural tailoring which you need to make studs in the forge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well that is a thought....... but which class would they be for? We don't have any shaman, druids, beastlords or monks the normal wearers of studded or reinforced clothing. (Although personally I quite fancy the idea of a gnome beastlord, maybe with a pet rat?)</div></div><hr />

22530,Tinker Temper,Tinker Temper</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Delores Mulva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There it is. I imagine the slime was never pushed Live but the drops of grease were by accident. It's too bad - I always thought that the drops were part of the unsolved cargo clockwork quest, and not just unfinished content.</div></div><hr />

Blasphemy! A gnome beastlord who didn't have a clockwork as a pet would be an abomination! It makes perfect sense. Where as the other races are in tune with nature and have tamed the wild beasts of their homeland to serve by their side the gnomes just cut straight to the chase and made theirs. Lets face it, Ak'anon is not exactly an animal friendly place. The gnomes would have made their own pets. For one thing, no sheding or messy animal leavings. And it's not like any oil leaks are going to look out of place in a city of machines.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/emphatically agree<br />
<br />
A clockwork spider for a gnome beastlord warder would be way too cool.<br />
<br />
And what about us gnome clerics and Bashy-Poof, Our Flying Hammer of Doom?  It would be just too appropriate if it were a CLOCKWORK hammer.<br />
<br />
