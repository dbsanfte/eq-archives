Hello. I am new to the game of EQ. A friend of mine got me to finally start playing. I am very limited to the time I can play, as my family and jobs take up most of my time. He told me that I could come here to find information and get help regarding the game. So, I thought I would come and introduce myself, and see what tips and advice I could get from people here. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />

There are many helpful threads and guides to help even the most casual of tradeskillers. But be warned, once you have begun upon the path of tradeskilling, it is hard to leave it! Bwuhahahahahahahahahaha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rewde</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow.  thanks for the information Lilosh.  I did not realize that there was soooo much involved in this game.  I got it because a friend recommended it to me as I like fantasy type games and such.<br />
Hopefully I will get a lot of use from this, and those other sites.</div></div><hr />

Hehe, I don't think I'm the only one with an assortment of binders full of hundreds and hundreds of pages of information on quests, spells, factions, equipment, recipes, maps, and more.  Don't panic, that's by no means necessary.  But there's a lot of information out there if you want to use it.  One more like I'd add to Lilosh's very good list:www.eqdruids.com.  Go there for any information to do with your class, be it spells or recommended hunting grounds, etc.  I haven't been there much, being a shaman, but they've been around a long time and have an excellent reputation.<br />

Welcome to EQ :)</div></div><hr />

Binders? Did he say binders? Hehehehehehe, yes, my precious, he said binders, Lots of binders. Pretty ones full of spells and recipes, yessss.....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morani</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;snicker&gt; I have over 300 files stored on my computer totaling nearly 20 megs of just Word and Excel files. Over 100 of them are just for game lore. Next to my computer, I have a 2-inch tall stack of paper I've printed with info for just this game.  :D  Yes, there is a LOT to it. <br />
<br />
Well, there CAN be a lot to it. If you are not interested in the depth of the game then it doesn't have to be that complicated. Most of the people here though really like the depth and getting into it up to their elbows (at LEAST). <br />
<br />
Some more links to the list: <br />
Caster's Realm (http://eq.crgaming.com/)<br />
Despite it's name, it deals with every class and the skills as well as spells for them. When I just started the game, the layout and information on Caster's Realm site helped a LOT. <br />
<br />
EverQuest Glossary (http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqglossary.htm)<br />
A list of nearly 650 abbreviations, acronyms, and &quot;slang&quot; for the game; making it the most complete list I've ever seen. For some reason, EQ users LOVE to shorten the names for things more than any other group I've seen. It's not unusual for entire conversations to go on with only a dozen or so FULL words being used. (Fortunately, it's not COMMON either).</div></div><hr />

Doh! A thousand pardons, Milady!  :oops:</div></div><hr />

EQ has a lot but they have yet to beat out the Department of Defense.</div></div><hr />

If EQ called a sword a &quot;Multi-edge Capable Soldier Portable Hacking Tool&quot; I'd abbreviate it too! Fortunately, they just call it a sword. :D</div></div><hr />

You might also check out websites targeted to your class, druid. I would humbly suggest http://pub149.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove - especially the Help! forum. It's targeted for new folks who may have questions they just can't find the answer for.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

Moonlilly - Try working for a Salt Lake City music manufacturing based company with the name of DOD Electronics.  Sheesh, did I get a lot of phone calls asking if they were talking to a Dept. of Defense operator.  :D <br />

This game will suck you in, take what little sleep, free time, and RL time you thought you had and generally suck your life essence from you. You will quickly become addicted as the rest of us.<br />
<br />
If you get into trade skills be prepared to start going to the doctor for corporal tunnel, back pains, and general bad attitudes. Also get your kneepads ready for the praying to the God of your choice and sacrificing hard fought/found items just to make trivial combines.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, welcome to the game.<br />
<br />
Also, y'all forgot the best site to kill the pain http://www.gucomics.com/<br />
You should start the comic from the very beginning though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Read it :) i love it</div></div><hr />
