<br />
My main Barbarian Warrior 'Ceduna' character is almost 3 years old and was inspired into taking up the smithing challenge to be able to make his own set of Cultural.<br />
<br />
This I have done and am proud of it.<br />
<br />
Imagine my dissapointment when I see a fellow Barbarian warrior smith obsessed with maintaining a monopoly, claiming to have already made over 5 million plat.<br />
<br />
I am not driven by greed, and think that players wanting to protect a race/skill monopoly is strange indeed.  What do people think?<br />

<br />
Do Smithing or any tradeskill for the Pride of doing it, not for the fact that you will compete on the market over some kind of product !! or you should sale stock Market too btw !!<br />
<br />
Have Fun, EQ is not under Law of Competition...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I took up crafts long ago for fun and to get my coldain shawl. I am having fun in crafts still, and always willing to combine for free or a modest fee. <br />
<br />
*shivers when thinking about monopolists in EQ*<br />
<br />
I think we should have fun in crafts, and if we can make some money selling finished products its great. <br />
