I really am wondering if SoE has played with the RNG lately. Prior to and just after the launch of GoD I always made more than 200 MTP's from a run of 100 combines. Since the large patch a while ago my yeilds have dropped. At first I thought it was just a few bad runs. In 9 runs I've been as low as 172 and only 2 times have made more than 200. Average seems to be around low 190's.. <br />
