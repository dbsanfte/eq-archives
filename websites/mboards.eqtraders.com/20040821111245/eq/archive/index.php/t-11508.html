<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ashgorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried to make the fletcher's trophy twice already, and failed on both attempts.<br />
<br />
First try: 231 skill ---&gt; failure (with 285 dex)<br />
2 nd try: 250 skill ---&gt; failure (with 295 dex)<br />
<br />
If you ever tried this combine and succeeded or failed, i'm interested to know your stats : how many attemts you needed to succeed, what was your skill at each attempt, what was your dex...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Osprey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It has been confirmed by Sony that stats has absolutely no effect on your chance of success. It only affects your chance of a skill up. Therefore people's dex is really not relevant.<br />
<br />
I tried twice at 250 skill. Got it on the second try</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dorfsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Failed 3 times...before makin it on my 4th try.<br />
<br />
1st three were with a 244+5%<br />
4th attempt(Success) was at 250+5%.<br />
All my stats were 305 save Cha and int.<br />
<br />
Its just one of the trophies that is harder to make.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ranger_Lahru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Made it on my 2nd attempt ... 1st .. was about 206 failed .. 2nd was at about 222 and succeeded ... had a geerlok both times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darkedge Thornblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've failed 9 times at 240+5%, guess im not very lucky</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>iandidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I waited till I had 250+5% to make my first attempt....success on the first try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nimphe Wildwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">First attempt at 250 w/ Geerlok.  <br />
Second and a success at 250 w/ Geerlok.</div></div><hr />

I was feeling gutsy one night so I said, what the hell. Turns out to have been a good gamble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kelador Stormwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Failed 3 trophy attempts (with Geerlok) at 250 skill before finally succeeding on the 4th one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>centxrz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">just succeeded on my trophy on first try with a skill of 240 + geerlok. /cheer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Berusa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Somehow, every trophy i have been trying for has taken 2 attempts, even at 250+5% geerlok. Every one.. including fletching. And i never really boost my stats as it is proven that stats has no effect in the actual chance to succseed, but to get a skillup, the dex is a priority, but im not really going for the skillup am i? :)</div></div><hr />

Got mine tonight...197 + Geerlok.  Had about 5k burning a hole in my pocket so I threw everything together and popped it in my fletching kit, closed my eyes and hit combine.  I skilled up to 200 shortly there after.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I was lucky enough to succeed on the first try, which I made at 241 with a geerlok in hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>darksisco007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">from what i can tell from lots of gms, the fletching trophy has one of the highest fail rates of them all<br />
failed 5 times here</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Fisrt try, 250 skill.<br />
<br />
With the failure rate, Trophies are worthless imho.<br />
<br />
Buy 2 tink bags/haversacks and 2 25CHA mugs and save yourself a lot of hassle.</div></div><hr />
