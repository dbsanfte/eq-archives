<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">EDIT: Dec 5, thanks to jawn there's a whole lot more data than there was before. Re-uploaded. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The piece of conversation in serverwide.eqtraders that finally prompted me to actually post this also prompted me to put this in General, not merely Research forum. <br />
<br />
<br />
What this is not: <br />
This is not a tradeskill UI mod or storywindow file. This does not have to only concern people with characters who research. <br />
This is also not meant to replace the current pages on the site. There are other plans for those. This is my little project. <br />
(WHY am I starting another 'little project'?? heheh.)<br />
<br />
<br />
What this is:<br />
This is an enhanced remake of the Old World and Loy Research Drops pages found on EQTC. <br />
<br />
<br />
Why? <br />
When the site actually died, the second time it went down and was due to faulty HD, I realized there was a good chance my favorite pages weren't coming back. So I set out to remake them, and yes, by hand. Luckily for me the real pages came back around the time I was in the Salil's. This just made what I was doing easier; I could C+P the massive majority of the data. <br />
<br />
<br />
What's in here: <br />
The pages are a huge long table: a column for Drop, a column for CE (does it make a Celestial Essence or does it not), a column for what Spell it makes, a column for what Loy Robe Swatch it makes (plus a little code to tell you which race can make the corresponding robe, and what metal thread and what dye can be used to make robe, and the appropriate trivial), and a column for Vendor Sell and Vendor Buy prices. <br />
<br />

<br />
Ignore the quotations around the pricing data; that's gonna stay there for a little while, and for these intents and purposes isn't important to anyone but me, really. <br />
<br />
Yes, I have gathered all the marked pricing data by myself, by hand. Why? ... good question. It's unknown data, and it's easy to find; you just pay attention to what else is on the vendor as you mine.  Yes, the Loy table is exceedingly sparse, but it will get there, it'll just take a bit of time. <br />
<br />
<br />
Why I link them now: <br />
someone in channel asked if anyone cared about research pricing data, and lo and behold, I did. He had a couple pieces of data I did not, so I stuck em in the table. And if it weren't 2 am, I'd probably remember his name. ^_^. A lot has been found, a lot is left to be found. Even so, this is not a call for help. If you wanna help, that would rock and I would not deny it. This is mostly here for the people who do just want the end result; a table with a concisely listed display of vendor pricing data. <br />
<br />
Who knows, maybe just the 2 of us care. Maybe more. Guess I'm gonna find out. ^_^  Enjoy, all. <br />
<br />

Oh give me a home<br />
Where the rockhoppers roam<br />
And the sky always blows east to west. <br />
Where seldom is heard<br />
A correctly spelled word<br />
And the Time-flagged guilds think they're the best. <br />
HOOOME, home in EQ!<br />
'Cause I don't wanna think about school. <br />
Later you can find me<br />
O'er on EQTC<br />
But for now I'm just camping a ghoul.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just because this could be useful to non-researchers does not mean that it involves anything other than research.  A non-smith looking for information on cultural armor to decide if they should buy it intact or try to find someone to do a combine for them is still going to look in the smithing forum.  I think that non-researchers looking for information about research drops are still going to find it in Research. ;)</div></div><hr />

And SO SORRY Kentarre! /ducks. But there are your links. ^_^ thanks for helping. <br />

if homework were this much fun, I might do it more...<br />

(Edit: hahahahhaha, the filters caught the Japanese verb and thought it was a swear word!! hm.... it's gramatically incorrect, but I'll use a dash... less startling to have letters than astericks...)</div></div><hr />
