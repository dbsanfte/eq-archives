<br />
You put the items in the Glaze Mortar, and click combine and nothing happens, no message at all, items don't combine, etc. <br />
<br />
Had 2 other people on 7Th hammer try the combine same result... /sniff<br />
<br />
Bug reported it from 7th hammer. If you have Kunzar Glue, Sarcosypha Fungus and 2 Opal powders, feel free to /bug report it as well once you can't make the Misty Glazing...<br />
<br />
Catastrophie auctions, ' WTS 40 unfired crucibles of escape, pst  ' <br />
<br />
It's the recipie and not the container, as I could made Crystalline Valor Glaze in the same Glaze Mortar today.<br />
<br />
So cancel your plans for fishin in sebilis until further notice ;)<br />

   Hours of work getting to a fishing spot in old Seb, 4 stacks of Kunzar Koi just incase, 36 Opal powders (2 failures), and the deaths of hundreds of the mushrooms in innothule...only to have the glaze mortar not combine them. It does complain if you put the wrong number in, but nothing when you hit the combine. I am going back to submit a /bug on Fennin Ro. Thankfully I only have 16 unfired  crucibles of escape cluttering my bank up...<br />
<br />
  I might have missed it in a post or 2, but the glaze Mortar does not open up in the new interface, only the old one, for me.<br />
<br />
  Think I will go back to brewing and alcohol tolerance increases..:D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caprich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well at least its not only me. Maybe it will get fixed soon. <br />
<br />
The glaze mortar only opens old interface for me too.<br />
<br />
I have about 10 stacks of kunzar glue and 10 stacks of fungus and only made about 6 stacks of opal powder, before I found out I couldnt glaze.<br />
<br />
If its any comfort, my cleric is now running off of 6 slots LOL.</div></div><hr />

&quot; Hours of work getting to a fishing spot in old Seb...&quot;<br />
<br />
I saw this and it made my foot hair tingle.  In case you're referring to finding a fishing spot once you zone in, and not actually getting there, there's a wonderful spot very near the zonein.  If you can't port yourself out, take a gate potion of some kind, though, since you'll be a long way from any exit when you're done.<br />
<br />
Right after you zone in, follow the tunnel through the long hallway down to the bridge.  Face due south from the tunnel, and jump off the bridge, like you're going to the lower levels.  Once you're in the water, though, swim straight south to the other side of the waterway, and climb out on the sloped ledge right there.  In this spot, you're too far down to agro the frogloks above you (although you'll hear the progress of any battles that happen up there) and the ones below you are in water, and won't bother you.  I've fished this spot since level 32 (yes, I got a Sebilis key at level 32) and I have never agroed anything accidentally.  Getting to the bridge can be a chore if you're alone, but when I was younger I simply waited at the zonein for a group, and followed them in.  Once you're in your spot, you can fish unmolested for hours if you choose.  it's quite peaceful, aside from the occasional screams from the adventurers being butchered above.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Caprich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just bring a friend who wants to kill at the camp above there for a few minutes while I fish... You can even get exp if your grouped on the ledge and theyre hunting above you.<br />
<br />
And the fishing ledge below the second bridge is very safe :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Goldenly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Howdy all :)<br />
<br />
  Back in the old days when Old Seb was the place to be, I was too low to really get a group there so I stayed away. Now, I actually had the entire zone to myself for hours at a time. <br />
  Unfortuantely, my ability to kill is limited to mana, my Virtue (hps variety:D ) and the size of the train I cause before I fail to get a gate off...<br />
   This worked out to the 3 in front, and the next two that attacked together. By the time the old KEI had gotten me enough mana to fight, and my regrowth enough hps, the ones in the front were due to spawn again.<br />
<br />
  Finally a lvl 65 SK felt sorry for me, (and my ability to use track to look for rares), and took me to a place described above as a shelf down near the water. The fishing part was anticlimatic, at least till I ran out of bait and did a bind. I guess its fortunate that it failed saying something about &quot;find a city&quot; or such :) Although the visions of stacks and stacks of Kunzer Koi going for outrages PP in the bazaar lingered a bit or at least until the first combine failed...<br />
<br />
Thankx for the encouragement though :)<br />

PS.<br />
  All things being equal, a Cleric only ever needs 6 slots:<br />
1 for water, 1 for food, 2 for peridots, 1 for loot, and one for a stack of bandages to hand out to the ranger to make a point... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caprich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Um I wish my cleric only needed 6 slots LOL.<br />
<br />
Usually I master loot when I play her, otherwise at the end of a Saturday i'm down 1k pp or so in peridot costs.. *sigh*<br />
<br />
Oh and I keep 4 stacks of dots on me at a time, and yes I do run out ;)<br />
<br />
Cause exp groups don't want to pay for peridots used.. So your only chance is keeping enough cash lewt to cover your costs and splitting all the rest.<br />
<br />
Hopefully the glaze will be fixed next patch and my trader will be the only one swimming in stuff :)<br />
<br />
The main forum link from the home page makes me hopeful that this issue may be fixed next patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gennoa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I went to do these last night and found them to be bugged also.<br />
