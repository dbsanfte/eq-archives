<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>WildAngel7</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know that EQTC has done their best, but I know of 2 recipies that are currently missing from the lists. I know the names, but not all of the ingredients for Poached Chub and Glazed Carp. Does anyone else know these recipies??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe both recipes were in prior to the db's meltdown a few weeks ago.  They will be put back as soon as they can, it's quite busy for them to redo so many recipes. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">OK... now that I was reminded these were &quot;missing&quot;... I found prior posts with the recipes and trivials and added them back in.</div></div><hr />
