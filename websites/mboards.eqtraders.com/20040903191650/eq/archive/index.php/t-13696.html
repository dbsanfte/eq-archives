<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dalur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering if anybody else is having issues with farming acrylia.<br />
<br />
I tried in one of the caves - nearest to Katta (I think that's the name of the city right?) in Tenebrous Mts - did AEs of the whole cave and not 1 drop of Acrylia.  Repeated the AE once and once again, no acrylia.<br />
<br />
Then I headed off to Hollowshade moor, but somebody was doing the war trying to get the wolves to take over so they could farm for smithing parts, i didn't want to mess with their fun, so I left and went to Acrylia caverns.<br />
<br />
After several hours I managed to fill 3 10 slot backpacks with various blocks and pieces of acrylia.<br />
<br />
Thinking that was way too slow, I headed out to Dawnshroud peaks and proceeded to walk up and down the tunnels killing Sambatas and managed to get about 3 or 4 bricks and about 5 small pieces.<br />
<br />
Is this a normal thing?  Or am I just unusually unlucky?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From all the other posts on gathering acrylia, and from doing it repeatedly myself, yes this is normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Optimum1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">On my way to 250 I had wicked-good luck setting up the Hollowshade War. Get Grimlings into the bear caves  and camp the first real room in on the left. Unless they've changed/fixed it, the grimlings repop about 20 seconds after their death. It worked out so that the room repopped just faster than my pet could keep the room clean and left me to loot loot loot. This camp, in fact, prompted me to buy 3 tink bags to handle all the weight. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Deedolith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Best place to farm acrylia is definetly acrylia caverns. It can be slow solo, but if you get a grp and wander deeper (AKA inner acrylia), you'll be amazed by the drop rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dalur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well did the Hollowshade war today, got the grimlings into the eastern cave and tried to kill a few near the back corner and spent almost hour and half and not 1 drop of acrylia.<br />
<br />
Went to the caves in Tenebrous mts and aed the caves and managed to get a few pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've only farmed Acrylia in Dawnshroud, so I can't comment on the other zones, but it sounds like you got a fair amount for that zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kelador Stormwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you have tracking skill then another option in Tenebrous Mountains is to track down Grol Baku soldiers who will drop bricks.  Like everywhere else the drop rate seems to fluctuate wildly.  I've filled 3 bags in 90 minutes on one occasion and another time had no luck at all in an hour there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you have tracking skill then another option in Tenebrous Mountains is to track down Grol Baku soldiers who will drop bricks. <br />
<br />
I've found the Baku Soldiers are about the best drop rate out of any of the other MOBs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xcile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hi I am about to start out and try and get at least 6 stacks of this stuff. I was hoping to get this done in about 5 hours or 2x 5 hours farming sessions.<br />
<br />
I am not too sure about the drop rates so I thought I would have a look around here.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions on where would be the best place to farm in the ratio I am suggesting? or am i aiming too high?<br />
<br />
I have spent some time as a lowbie in dawn and I got to say I didn't see a whole lot of this stuff there.<br />
<br />
thanx in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dvinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Head to Acrylia caverns and farm the grimlings near the portal to inner acrylia.  They are light blue at 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As I mentioned above the best drop rate is off the Grol Baku Soldiers. Granted the drop rate may vary, however some days I can get a 10 slot full in 35mins, other times just 4 in an hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Meirril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think I've hunted acrylia just about everywhere it drops. <br />
Acrylia Caverns has a very good drop rate. I actualy perfer the easier mobs in the hallway into AC near the entrance for acrylia drops. Easier to kill them by the truck load. <br />
I also liked killing the scouts in Maiden's Eye. I was shard hunting at the time but their drop rate of acrylia is respectable (about 1 in 3 for a peice or the occasional block). Good Luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Benthair Dunthat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Agree with the others that Acrylia Caverns is the way to go. I have been farming those grimlings near the entrance for the last several nites with high rate of success. Been duoing 58 Druid / 65 monk with no problem. I can usually fill 5 tink bags with acrylia in 3-5 hours. As a plus, the Grimling ritualist spawns in one of the side caves right near the entrance, drops the Grimling Skin Mask, 15-20k in baz - I got 2 in one nite. These guys also drop a ton of Acrylia Etched runes, these are vt selling for 2-5pp each, so pick up an extra 400-500pp there. GL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Id regularly come out with 1-2k in junk from Acrylia caverns in about 2 hours of farming acrylia with me and my 65 sham.<br />
<br />
Its a fun place to group and people come there all teh time headed to Inner Acrylia for Vex Thal Shards. Just group with them and you rake in the acrylia and they can have the shards. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>xanrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'll put in my pitch for AC as well. I used my 65 necro to farm and cleared the front entryway and the Primalist's room. I sat my poor 52 druid on acct 2 at the zone line and to help hold and carry the stuff. Each session yielded about 1kpp in runes (some sell for 90pp per stack) and 2kpp in weps (they sell for about 140pp each) and about 4 or 5 bags of verious amounts of acryla, plus the rare pop of the primalist for a nice twink mask or BP. Oh, and my druid is almost to lvl 57 now. Not bad for being a mule.</div></div><hr />
