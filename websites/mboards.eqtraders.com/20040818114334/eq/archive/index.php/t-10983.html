<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>yawp64</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Howdy, Fellow Fletchers,<br />
<br />
I've been silently lurking on the EQ Trader Fletching boards for a long time because my skill level is so low (109) that I haven't had anything to add to the informative discussions that flow over these pages.<br />
<br />
Today, though, I saw something that just about broke my poor arrow-making and bow-carving heart. Have you seen the stats on the Rujarkian Short Bow that's available from the LDoN adventure merchant for a mere 20 adventure points? <br />
<br />
Damage = 20<br />
Delay = 45<br />
Range = 75<br />
STR + 4<br />
DEX +4<br />
Slot 1 = type1<br />
Slot 2 = type 4<br />
<br />
For comparison, here are the stats for 1-Cam Shaped Darkwood Bow with Silk String (which trivials at 215):<br />
<br />
Damage = 20<br />
Delay = 46<br />
Range = 150<br />
Slot 1 = type 4<br />
<br />
Wow. It takes hundreds and hundreds of combines and an amount of platinum that I don't want to count for a fletcher to raise his/her skill to level 215. At that point, you can start making yourself some pretty cool equipment. <br />
<br />
Or, in the upper 30's of your character's development, you can go out and win 7 LDoN adventures, gain exp towards your next level, accumulate hundreds of platinum in loot, perhaps pick up some augments, and then just buy yourself a bow that's inferior only in range to a high-end fletched bow.<br />
<br />
I know it's old hat to rant about how the game designers have been systematically marginalizing trade skills, but this one just killed me when I saw it. I couldn't bring myself to look at what you might be able to buy with, oh, 100 adventure points.<br />
<br />
I'm going to keep fletching because I think it's cool. I love to tell the mages in my group that &quot;I don't need no stinkin' summoned arrows.&quot; However, some of the excitement I was feeling about someday making myself an awesome bow is a bit diminished. What do I do now? Am I fool if I pour all that time into the skill-ups when I can simply buy something that's patently better? Or is the work worth the intense personal satisfaction I will enjoy when I am a master craftsman who creates utility and beauty out of a bunch of disparate junk?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>sansaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personally, I'd never waste the ap on that rujarkian bow... the range sucks big time. I'm hoping that others out there see it too... of course, the main reason I fletch is to make my own arrows... something satisfying about reaching out and keeling a mob with your own handmade arrows. :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Emeraldeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In my opinion I wouldn't touch it, there are better things to spend my points on and besides I would much rather have the range. I prefer rooting a mob an turning him into a pincushion. The farther away I can shoot the better because when that root breaks he isn't gonna be happy with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aerinha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Most of the people that I know that actually shoot their bows(as opposed to those who want a nice stat item for their range slot) would pick the bow with the longer range. I agree, I think there are much better items to spend points on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">that bow wont help you towards the shawl quest.  just had to add that.<br />
<br />
anyway at 215 you aren't that far away from 235 which is the shaped darkwood 2 cam bow.  with geerlock you are probably at a pretty good succes rate even.  there are also cultural/diety bows and pop recipies you could buy the stuff for in the bazaar if you can't get it yourself.  agree with the range.  my range alt is still tiny but i LOVE range.  working him up well but my wizard main is going to beat him in flecthing.  plan on 1750 for the wiz someday and shawl pretty soon so at least 170's flecth.  <br />
<br />
on a side note.  215 seems to be the triv for the sedge 2 cam bow.  not sure why but that branch is screwy.  just fyi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">215 imho is not considered 'high end fletching'.<br />
Elemental bows, Thunderbolts etc.. stuff that fails 50% of the time at 250+trophy/geerlok is high end.<br />
Buy the components and put em in a fletching kit. OOC for a 220+ fletcher to press combine for ya. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>yawp64</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree with all of you that the fletched bow's range makes it superior to the bow you get with LDoN adventure points. No question. I use a 150 range bow for pulling that I made with my own two half-elven hands, thank-you-very-much, and darn proud I am of it! :-D<br />
<br />
But, that wasn't really the point of why I was calling that LDoN bow to your attention. I haven't bought it and I have no interest in owning it. I just wanted to make the observation that you have to love what you're doing to continue with trade skill advancement in this game.<br />
