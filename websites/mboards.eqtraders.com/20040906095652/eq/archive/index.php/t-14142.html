<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Towd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just started reading these forums last week while out of town on business (needed some EQ related material.)<br />
<br />
It seems I saw at least two references to getting 2 skill levels for free in the 210-220 range.  Since I'm at 205 this was good news. <br />
<br />
Since I've been home I've gone thru all the forums again and can't find what I remember seeing. Perhaps I was dreaming. <br />
<br />
Anyone have any idea what I might have seen?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Suutar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cured Ethereal Energy trivials at 212 but you have to have an effective skill of 220 to try it. If you have 210 and a geerlock your effective skill is 220.5, so you can do the combine, and still maybe get the skill points 211 and 212. (If you have a higher modifier, you can start earlier, of course :) Akhevan Shadow Shears are sadly hard to come by, though.<br />
<br />
[edit - took another look... the ethereal silk swatch used in the recipe for Cured Ethereal Energy is likewise a 220 required, 212 trivial.]</div></div><hr />
