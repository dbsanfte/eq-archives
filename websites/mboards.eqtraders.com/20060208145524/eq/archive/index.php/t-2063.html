<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">delirium</div><div class="date">01-09-2003, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hiya all,<br />
   I know some of the really really old timers might remember Jinjin and Rumpa (fearless humie monk and his ogre shaman sidekick buddy)...  We /movelogged to AB long long time ago and basically hated it there (lags more than the american servers, even for a euro... guess that's what you get when you buy bandwidth from the iksar mafia...).  We took a break from EQ for a while to remodel our house.. and I did some 'minor' stuff like graduating from medical school  :D  <br />
Eventually we started on Kane Bayle when it went live, and when all our friends buggered back off KB to tholuxe... we decided we'd come full circle and went back to Inny last week.<br />
   I've started a kitty beastlord (my very first melee in 4 years of EQ =) named Pusen, and Øystein (jinjin) started a kitty shaman called (of course) Jinjin.<br />
<br />
Shoot me a tell in game if anyone who remembers us is still around... I have Vats and Amotd and co. still on my friends list but haven't seen any of the old school around yet... Hooked back up with some of our Coinfist and Avanguardia friends... but basically just wanted to say hiyas!<br />
<br />
(Lyttle's on AB still as are Rumpa and Jin-1st so I am just now restarting tradeskilling... have Pusen's tailoring into the evil wu's level... 149 and Jinjin's brewing and baking are around 150 now... we're mostly just levelling up atm but would love to chat with our old friends again =)<br />
<br />
Best wishes and hugs from Bergen,<br />
<br />
Annie (Pusen) and Øystein (Jinjin)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amotd</div><div class="date">01-13-2003, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great to have you back.  I'm still around but very rarely over the last couple of months.  Vats is still out there also but more likely to find her on as Mayana her warrior.  Hope to see you in game and give a tell anytime you see me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hjalmarr</div><div class="date">01-19-2003, 12:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey there!<br />
<br />
I don't know if we every talked much, but we certainly ran with the same crowd.<br />
<br />
Like Amotd said, I see Vats online occasionally.  Cheliance is still on all the time and trying to GM all skills.  Temar is on as one of his alts, and get this, I actually caught MORGRIST on line the other day.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I try to stay logged in as Hjalmarr on EQIM all day from work.  I lurk in both the innoruuk.eqtraders chat channel and the serverwide.eqtraders chat channel.  If it's feasable, I think everyone should start frequenting the innoruuk.eqtraders room (trust me, it's pretty dead in there) and we can chat some.  Granted, I still have to work while I chat, but....<br />
