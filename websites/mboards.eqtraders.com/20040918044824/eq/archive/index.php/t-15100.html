<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gwyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
Been lurking on these boards for about 3 years now, but I recenty made a tinker (yes hes a Tinker Bot) to be used for EP cams and general guild use. After about 3 weeks of Tinker PL I dinged 202 last night and thought I'd relate some of my experiences.<br />
<br />
I used the standard path from 50 to 122, It only took a few hours, My main (65 druid on 1 account and a 65 BST on another) has 240 in fletching so I used catapults to get to 135, again it did not take too long.<br />
<br />
From then it became alot harder to choose a skill up path, I read these boards and others intently and decided on the 215 trivial Geerlocks.<br />
<br />
On geerlocks and farming.<br />
<br />
Went off to Neth Lair to farm the Blocks for the Brewing GL, All I can say is the drop rate is poor, on a full clearing I'd be lucky to get 4 blocks usually only 1 to 2, so i gave up on this, as getting decent quantity was going to be a long process.<br />
<br />
So tried the Smithing GL, Acrylia should be a bit more common, and it was. Went to Acrylia Caverns (inner) and got some Xp and some Acrylia, the drop rate is up and down here, sometimes I'd walk out with 3 Back packs full other times 1.<br />
<br />
Next was PC for some varity, the lenses for the JC GL are not common off the mushrooms, the fungus belts are slightly more common but have the big advantage of the a lot more of these mobs and their repawn rate ben very fast (in the order of 7 mins).<br />
<br />
So with a major combo of Smithing and Fletching GLs with a  few JC and Brewing thrown in I got my tinker bot to 185 skill.<br />
<br />
I looked around in my search recipe list and found the antigravity device trivial at 202. Looking closer at the ingrediants they were all store borught by 3 vendor about 20 feet apart in POK. So i tried 6 to see what the buying VS sell back price was.<br />
<br />
Dont have the exact figures in front of me, but the Buy price for 1 combine was in the 380p range and sell back at about 341p.<br />
<br />
So at 185 skill and with a losse of 380 for a failed and 40 for a success I decided to put a few K plat at it, about 3 hours later and about 20k plat less I dinged 202, for me using the store brought parts was not a bad option a quick and easy way to get through the 180 &amp; 190 hells with little fuss. I was generally getting about 3 skill up per stack of 20 (NB I dinged 191, 192 and 193 in 3 attempts) So far the RNG seems to like my Gnome, although 202 took about 50 attempts. The success rate at 185 was not too bad at abut 1 failure in 10, which get better as my skill approached 202.<br />
<br />
Back to farming Acrylia and Belts for the next 13 skills, then off to LoY for some beach fun.<br />
<br />
Gwyn<br />
<br />
PS if anyone knows of a good place for Acrylia drops I'd be keen to know, going to try TM next.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the reduction in the Flame Bolt's trivial, the anti-grav unit is an expensive alternative, but it will help bridge the gap that exists from about 148 to 200.<br />
<br />
i tend to recommend to folks that they make Aqualungs until 148 and then do rebreathers with those Aqualungs, but once that is done it leave you short of the Rebreather Trivial and the question of making more Aqualungs just for rebreahters is a tougher one.<br />
<br />
So while this path is not for the poor, it might be a decent option for the well-to-do tinker about town.</div></div><hr />
