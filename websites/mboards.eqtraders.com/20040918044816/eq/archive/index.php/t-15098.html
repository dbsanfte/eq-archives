<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>liannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have noticed that the following tradeskill items no longer are listed at a 250 trivial:<br />
<br />
ceremonial solstice robe<br />
gem studded chain<br />
golden idol of tunare<br />
mistletoe cutting sickle<br />
misty thicket picnic<br />
unfired star ruby encrusted stein<br />
some stormreaper boned armor<br />
and more<br />
<br />
Has the trivial actually increased? Or was the trivial previously listed at &lt;250 and we now know that the official trivial is 335?<br />
<br />
I hope it has not been increased, it will be real hard to get tailoring up if it is.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I don't think they've changed. :)</div></div><hr />

I don't think they've changed, I just think we now know exactly why the success rates are so low.<br />

<br />
So, when you saw a trivial listed as being &gt;250, this meant we knew the trivial was greater than 250.<br />
<br />
This occurred when a person with a skill of 250 would make the combination and not receive a message stating that the combination was trivial at that person's skill level.<br />
<br />
There is a FAQ on the use of the &gt; and &lt; symbols in the Frequently Asked Questions (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=12) forum.</div></div><hr />
