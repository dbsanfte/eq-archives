<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vile</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I know this has been discussed many times before but I just had to post my findings.<br />
<br />
After rearching the many ways to go after WU`s I decided as money is not a major problem that I would go for solstice robes.<br />
<br />
Now lucky enough I have a GM jeweler so the first thing I did was make the gem studded chains. In 10 attempts I managed to make 6. I thought that was poor....but I was wrong. On my next attempt I managed to make 1 chain in 10 attempts :( that chain cost me nearly 3K. What is the usally number of chains I can expect with a GM jeweler ?<br />
<br />
Robe skill ups. Im guessing this was a really bad run but Im not too sure. I attempted 80 robes and got 4 skills gains - from 159 to 163 :( ok Ogre SK`s are not the brightest but I did have 198 intelligence. After that run I was thinking that I may as well give up now if gains are so slow when Im not even into the 190`s.  Anyway today I thought I would do a smaller run - 30 robes. Before I started this run I got hold of a pair of GEB`s to take my intelligence to 207. Now I dont know if breaking the 200 intelligence barrier had anything to do with it but I got some great gains. In 30 combines I went from 163 to 171. So my question is what can I expect ? Was I unlucky on my first run or just plain lucky on the second ? Did the extra intelligence make the difference ?</div></div><hr />

I did so much at only 180 int, I kick myself now.  The 2 bags of gear just for tradeskills is a pain, but its needed for some of us to get int/wis up.</div></div><hr />

You sir, are one lucky SOB.  The RNG was overly kind to you that day. Grats!</div></div><hr />

They have made skilling up easier but that is a unheard of 8 in 30.  I did get 3(199-201) in 23 the other night and I considered my self lucky as heck  :D .<br />

Making nightmare bow stirngs for a guildy he wanted me to atempt 20 of them.  I had enough to do another 3 and I went from 156 to 162 which they are trivial now. and got 22 of the 23 :).  Was ironic that the only one I failed on was the one right after they went trivial.</div></div><hr />

I started a little session with enough sacred silk for 35 combines on Solstice Robes, with 4 gem studded chains, and with maxed WIS of 265 (level 62). My skill was 160. However, after 23 combines, I had gained 6 skill points and successfully combined 4 solstice robes, and so had to stop, with no enchanter immediately available to make more chains. Making the robes was not part of the plan, I would add, though I managed to sell three of them in the Bazaar later. Anyway, I think this was a freakily good session; I had another little run of 15 combines yesterday, 15 fails, 1 skill point, now 167. Ho hum, it is a long long road.<br />

Then you get through 150 sacred tunare silks and the end result is 2 robes and 2 skill points - wow that was a fun weekend....hours of hitting the combine key and Ive gone from 174-176 ! <br />
<br />
Are there any GM tailors out there who dont see that combine key in their dreams ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiatek</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been doing lots of various combines trying to raise tailoring lately.  I did some sessions of solstice robes in the past few weeks, some sessions of velious wyvern, and a few odd and ends acrylia.  <br />
<br />
overall my skill up  rate average has been approximately 1 skill up per 15-16 combines (skill of 179 now-65 combines in now).  I have had some REALLY bad sessions where i did 50+ combines of various stuff, with no skill up at all.  Then I have had some really great ones, where I get 1 skill up per 3 or 4 combines.  Just very streaky sometimes.<br />
<br />
Good luck with the new obsession :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
80 Solstice robe combines (240 tunare silk):<br />
4 Skill ups from 176 to 180<br />
4 Robes<br />
<br />
I was`nt to happy with that so...<br />
<br />
30 Acrylia Masks<br />
5 Skill ups from 180 to 185<br />
<br />
Much happier ;-)<br />
<br />
Now was this luck or was it because the mask are nearly trival ? Intelligence was 236 with KEI.</div></div><hr />

Nope, they are not near trivial since that wont ever happen.  Trivial &gt; 250</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiatek</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">nice skill ups :)<br />
<br />
personally i am now 72 combines into 179 and holding :(<br />
<br />
I just had to take a break after that, will resume over the weekend.<br />
<br />
btw are you just buying silks or farming?  if farming, dang i need your luck, takes me soooo long to farm them lately :P<br />
<br />
bleh edit 72 not 62...</div></div><hr />

Acrylia Masks Triv at 188, and he got to 185 on them.<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont understand your basis for your statement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vile</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been buying the silks rather than farming. Generally I pay 10pp a silk on Brell and most days I can pick up a 100 or so at that price. Some insane sellers ask more but Im ****ed if Im gonna pay more than 10pp. <br />
<br />
The main problem for me is the imbued emeralds I need for the Blessed Dust. I dont have an alt who can imbued them and there never too many for sale in Bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bana-zir</div><div class="date">12-19-2002, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did solstice robes from 161 to 250 with slightly more than 3200 robe combines at 255 wis.<br />
<br />
Here is what you can expect:<br />
1) Expect 50 percent with a GM jeweler with geerlok on the gsc.<br />
2) Expect 87 percent more skill ups with 255 wis compared to 100 wis (not my number, but that is the number others have produced).  So I would say 255 is 20 or 30 percent better than 200?<br />
3) Expect to make about 400 ceremonial solstice robes.  This will cost about 210k pp to get an enchanter to make the 400 Gem Studded Chains.  This is considering you have an enchanter or the enchanter does not charge for his services (just does free combines). <br />
4) Expect to only make 1 robe per 20 combines pre 200 skill.<br />
5) Pray for low success after 200 skill, but sometimes you will just succeed 10 or 20 times in a row and it will greatly frustrate you.<br />
6) Expect to keep KEI on your level 29 emerald imbued you created and PL to level 29 for the purpose of imbuing.  Buy her a horse, a blackened alloy neck (mana pres II), an iksar hide cap (reagent conserve III), and a djarn amethyst ring (spell haste II).  Also find as much plus mana items and you can find or plus wis if you can find wis*10&gt;mana items.  Expect to use around 2 million points of mana.  This is roughly 21 hours of constant spell casting to make the needed 9600 emeralds (I did them in 8 hour batches and stored on mules).  I never verified the iksar hide cap worked, but I believe it did (only 10 percent anyway I think.)<br />
7) Expect to pay about 1 million pp for the 3200 combines if you buy silk swatches at 20 pp (400 pp a stack) and get the emeralds done for free.<br />
8) That puts the approx cost per robe at around 3000, sell most of your robes for this price and you will come out clean with no cost.  However this is very difficult to do since most people on the server that are already 250 make robes for profit (I succeed about 30 percent of the time it seems at 250 skill and GM tool and sell for 1k each), so you may have to price yours at 1k or so to be able to sell.  Sometimes for less than 1k.  This means that 1.2 million pp will be spent and you will get back about 400,000, so you will lose 800,000 million pp.<br />
9) Expect to get pottery to at least 160 or 200 for less fails on the blessed dust.<br />
<br />
I was lucky and was able to sell the vast majority of my robes for 2600 pp.<br />
<br />
All in all, this is the best tailoring skill up route for these reasons:<br />
<br />
1) You can sit down and buy 3200 silk swatches in a week.  You can not do this with ANY OTHER tailoring skill up path in game.<br />
2) You can buy from a store and make the remaining items.<br />
3) The robes have an infinite market and will never end any time soon, so you will never run out of market.  This works best if you don't NEED the money for more skill ups and you can be patient to let others who sell for 600pp on the robes sell out so that your robe for 2600 is the only one on the market (and thus the one people buy.)<br />
4) They are tedious but painless.<br />
<br />
I think they should be nerfed, because everyone and their brother will have 250 tailoring in 6 months because of the robes, but hey, maybe that isn't a bad idea and I really shouldn't consider it that way.  I only managed from 158 to 161 before the robes were introduced.  I just simply could not BUY and would not FARM the combine parts fast enough.  Also the things I made didn't sell well.<br />

<br />
<br />
I understand all of this except 2 things.<br />
<br />
1) Why a horse?  Wont she just be sitting in the Bazaar/SH/Wherever when she enchants?  Horses are good for Mana Regen when you are running and moving, but why would a Imbuebot need one?<br />
<br />
2) The Reagent Conservation DOES NOT work for Imbues and Enchanting and MAna Vials.   It did for about a before an emergency patch fixed that (To the best of my knowledge).<br />
<br />
3) (Edited In)  The best advice I ever heard was to level the ImbueBot to 30.  Specialize in whatever Spell Skill the Imbuing uses.   The Mana saved by specializing more then makes up for the addition time spent in HHK.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiatek</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">FINALLY broke down and couldn't stand being at 179 anymore--took another 17 combines but I made it-total of 89 combines bleh.  Then saw the rarest of the rare-back to back to back skill ups :)  yes three in a row!  Guess the 89 combines was made up for with that.  <br />
<br />
I know this is better results than before, when it took me probably a hundred combines each to get from 158 to 165 back last year just frustrating to blow 5 or 6 K with nothing to show for your time or money (no skill ups or successes)  That was the main reason I stopped doing tailoring a year ago just before my extended hiatus.<br />
<br />
BTW I am not doing just robe combines.  I recently spend about 6 hours getting 43 arctic wyvern combines ready and took the 3K loss that I incurred from those combines.  I also have been working on acrylia-so I am not just using robes.<br />
<br />
I would agree with Lilosh that getting to 30 and using spec will help LOADS with mana conservation.<br />
<br />
I don't know that the robe market is endless however.  There will come a time when the majority of ppl that want an earring have one and only the occasional person will still want one or someone that JUST made a twink.  But as more ppl get higher in skill, more robes will be available, dropping prices, etc.  <br />
<br />
Personally I am not about making money off robes at this point.  Just financing my tailoring and trying to recoup some of my PP that gets blown away on combine tries is all I am aiming for.  I don't have endless pockets :(<br />
<br />
I have been farming my own silk and imbuing myself.  Takes about 5 to 6 hours per 50-53 combines of robes.  Takes LONGER (for me anyway) for 40ish wyvern combines (I don't do othmir-poor little weasles get killed so much).<br />
<br />
Get any more skill ups lately Vile?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorvari</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason for the horse is that they give you sitting level mana regen as long as you are standing still....EVEN WHEN CASTING!!  So this way the ImbueBot will regen mana and make the overall imbueing sessions shorter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
long way to go yet and after 60 combines and no skill ups (at 193 ) its time for a bit more farming.....</div></div><hr />

WIS was 270 for all of these. Not too bad a rate, given what I was expecting beforehand.<br />
