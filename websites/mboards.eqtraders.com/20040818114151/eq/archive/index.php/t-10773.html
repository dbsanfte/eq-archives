<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ceggon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I finally have most of the flags for Aid Grimmel and am working on polishing off pottery and smithing.  <br />
<br />
Until last night I had NO idea how bad the adjustment to pottery skillups had been. /sigh<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if someone with more time than plat might be interested in working up several hundred (300-500) ceramic linings for me that I could buy. <br />
<br />
I'm willing to work out a fair price for your time, I also have a BUNCH of high end baking bits that could be part of any compensation package if you are interested. <br />
<br />
If you are interested, leave a post here or look for me in game<br />
<br />
Hope to find something that works out well for all involved =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'll see what I can come up with.<br />
<br />
Have to drag Angelsyn out of Gunthak anyway. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ceggon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I polished off 100 combines I had mostly set to go earlier today, got a whole 3 skillups. I suppose I should be happy though =)<br />
<br />
I have 5 points to max out casserole dishes, I figure 200ish linings should (hopefully) do it.<br />
<br />
If you do have the time Angel, that would be great. I think you were still looking for baking bits too so its could work out really well. <br />
<br />
Lemme know</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Khaarq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I suppose I could toss my hat into this offer too. I'll look for you in game to make sure Angelsyn hasn't covered your needs before I get started. Skill ups have kind of been running cold for me, maybe a few hundred trivial combines will break the monotony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Go for it Khaarq.<br />
<br />
I just haven't had the free time lately. :mad:</div></div><hr />
