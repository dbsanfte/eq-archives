<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>subzero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">making leather  padding is a nightmare...<br />
could anyone tell me where is the good place to gain animal skin and spiderling silk?<br />
i think both are hard to get...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">for quality pelts (low, medium, high)...consider Nedaria's Landing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Or Maru Sera for lq hopper hides, then shades or worms in shadeweaver's for the silk parts. I prefer the lucin made since I don't have to hunt for the spiderlings with all their quest junk and get swirling shadows for my future smithing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aandaie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Best I've found is NPC vendors, with places like EC and Neriak having a lot.<br />
<br />
I found far more quicker on vendors than I ever have by killing things.<br />
<br />
I'd get a bunch and make like 12 stacks of leather paddings, then sell them since I had given up on tradeskilling at the time. Both my accounts are cancelled now, which is sad since I may have done it with the new tradeskill UI. My carpal tunnelly feelings just got too bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Feodor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Two suggestions:<br />
<br />
1) Spiderling silks   everyone's fave spot -- around the druid circle in the Feerott.  (Not too far from Ogguk stone/book.)  Both jungle spiderlings and jungle spiders drop spiderling silk.<br />
<br />
2)  Skins:  if you're 50 or above, the cats in Stonebrunt Mountains near the Kejek fort.  About 75% they drop a LQ/MQ/HQ skin, sometimes 2.  Very easy hunting at 65, with the chance of an occasional titan.  I get 40-60 skins per hour there.  (Yeah, I could be making more plat to BUY leather paddings, but I prefer to do-it-myself...)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Meirril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have to give a big Aye to Nerria's landing for hides. <br />
The cats and wolves drop hide about 2/3rds of the time. Low to high quality. Wolves also very rarely drop a quest turn in peice that is a non-stacking hide. Ignore that, the quest requires 3 and gives you less than 7pp, no faction, and a bit of story that you could live without knowing (I'm saying this and I love quests, its a waste of time and inventory space). I can't vouch for the bears in the zone but I would imagine that they drop pelts just as well. All the animals are in the 30's range. Just avoid the Griffin, their annoying and attack on sight. If your in your 60's they arn't dangerous individualy, but if you get 2 or three...<br />
<br />
As for spiderling silk...there is no good place anymore. Try Feerot around druid ring, Halas newbie pathing (only newbie zone not ruined for spiderling silk drops), and Innothule just outside of Gukta/Grobb. Realy, SOE should make this stuff store bought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>munwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can try Field of Bones for Spiderling Silks also. There is a cave (crypt) thats packed with them. Takes a couple min to clear everything out. Good place to go when your trying to do something else...clear 5 min...go vacume house, come back clear 5 min...go wash windows.. you get the idea.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There are two routes I've found to approach this.  First, if you need it fast, go with the above suggestions for hunting spiderlings, which will be the limiting factor for paddings since you can use three different qualities of three different kinds of pelts, but only one kind of spirderling silk (and you need two of those).  Once you have a stack or two of silk threads, take your skinning knife, sewing kit and silk thread and go pelt hunting, making paddings as you proceed.  Set aside HQ bear and cat pelts, but skin down the rest and you'll be done in a flash.<br />
<br />
For the pelts run, I suggest Eastern Karana.  There are lots of living pelts running around, and if you can use area-effect spells you can gather a bunch of spider silks at the same time.  As I said, take your kit and silk thread, and stop farming when you run out of thread, since that's going to be your limiter and stockpiling pelts is heavy.<br />
<br />
Also, don't overlook the Luclin suggestion above, especially if your server's spiderling farms are very busy.  Go to Marus Seru and do battle with greyhoppers there, gathering both the greyhopper hides and LQ rockhopper hides.  The greyhopper hides make an amazingly fast skill path to 95 (greyhopper hide and boot pattern) so you can skill up or sell them to an aspiring tailor.  Then go hunt Shadeweaver's Thicket for shadeling silks and you'll have your padding fast, plus if you're up to the task, you can start stockpiling components for shadowscream.<br />
<br />
For the slower route, start in East Karana, and when you're done hunting, find another hunter and trade spider silks for spiderling silks.  You'd think this would be tough, but I have always found it surprisingly easy to trade spider silks for spiderling, since so many people need silk swatches.  So take your spider silks to the Bazaar and announce your willingness to trade, and you'll get some takers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The biggest problem I had when making padding was getting enough silks.  I always had more than enough pelts.  I found that Shadeweavers was a good zone, because it drops shadeling silks and rockhopper hides.  They make leather padding too.  Marus Seru is also a good zone for rockhopper hides.  I'm glad I'm done with leather paddings, but if I needed any more, I'd be in Shadeweavers for sure.  An added bonus is that the hoppers there drop HQ pelts, which can be used to make backpacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xenephex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Stonebrunt used to be the best place for quality old world pelts, especially for trackers,  but I believe that Nedaria's is clearly better now, especially for non-trackers.  I took my 62 warrior there just to look around.  Stopped to look at a map and when I looked up again, I was being attacked by 6 bears and cats, all of whom aggroed me even though they were way green to me.  That helps a lot. Plus, most of them dropped quality pelts (no ruined, btw). <br />
<br />
For spiderling silks - if you have a tracker, I would recommend trying Western Karanas.  The bad news is there's not a lot of spiderlings there and they are pretty spread out.  The good news is that it's the only zone I'm aware of where the rate of silk drops has not been nerfed due to newbie quest items.  They can drop up to a few silks each if you have the patience to track and run them down.  Don't even think about it if you're a non-tracker, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fwene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There are 3 static spawn spiderlings in LFay at the brownie fort that have a good drop rate, the only real dowside is that thre are only 3 of them and i think the respawn is either 3 or 6 minutes (its about half the fort rate).  but it you need brownie parts or morning dew its a decent spot to take care of several items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>branagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I got a lot of skins killing the poachers in Jaggedpine.  Camp there with maybe 10-12 poachers, and they drop a pelt or two almost every kill.   All of them low quality or above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Yanari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Maru Sera for lq hopper hides, then shades or worms in shadeweaver's for the silk parts <br />
<br />
You meant Marus Seru. :cool:<br />
<br />
This is the fastest way to amass leather padding ingredients.  The other suggestions are also correct, but in my opinion, take more time.  Lesser Shades and Xakra Silkworms spawn quickly in well defined areas.  They often drop 3 shadeling silks each.<br />
<br />
Greyhoppers are quite generous with their skin drops.<br />
<br />
The swirling shadows dropped by the lesser shades sell in the bazaar for 40-50pp each, which is quite a nice bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mendan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I find that the area outside Gukta is great for spiderling silk, just be aware that mobs sometimes get stuck under the world at the NPC corpses that lie nearby.  Any class that can cast a PBAoE can use their lowest level spell and kill all the mobs at once.  Once dead the mobs will pop up above ground so you can loot.  I've killed about 50 mobs at once this way, with about half being spiderlings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>illovich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">When LoY came out, I bought (not an exaggeration) over 48 stacks of spiderling silk from the Gukta area vendors in the first couple days. I know this because two days ago I logged in my wife's retired druid and boggled at how much silk thread was on her druid, and how much I still had to combine (well, I needed SOMEWHERE to put it all). <br />
<br />
I'm thinking that statements like the above may actually constitute tradeskill porn. <br />
<br />
Maybe check Halas &amp; Shar Val? Lots of people are starting Berserkers and not looting what they kill... free silk!</div></div><hr />
