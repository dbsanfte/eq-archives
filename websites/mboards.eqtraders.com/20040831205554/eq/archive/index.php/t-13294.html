<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ryougo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there I'm wondering if some of you could spare your experiences with making platinum ribbons versus solstice robes post golden ribbons.<br />
<br />
I'm not exactly overflowing with the rarer words so I assume the ribbons will virtually be a complete lost.<br />
<br />
I'm aware of the logic that solstice robes are less likely to lose the chain to success at lower level and also the idea that you're more likely to get skill ups closer to the trivial<br />
<br />
So all in assuming equal difficulty in getting 3 swatchs to a dye which is the more economical option, keeping in mind I'm just as unlikely to find buyers for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did platinum ribbons until 187 when they trivialled.  I found the skill ups fast and refreshing.  They may have slowed down since, I did them just after LoY came out and was at about 163 when I started.  As a wood elf, I cannot say anything about making the robes afterwards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Platinum ribbon is way easier IMO.  Since it closer to trivial, successful combine makes it much lower cost than Solstice robe.  Not to mention you have more requirement to do solstice robe efficiently (namely 250 JC, someone to enchant silver and imbue emeralds).<br />
<br />
For the platinum ribbons, I simply sell back all the successful combines to vendor and take the lost.  Its still cheaper than any other combines out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just did gold + plat ribbons from 131-187 yesterday. I started with 168 steamfont dyes, and 59 jaggedpine dyes. 131-162 cost me 117 steamfont dyes, 163-182 used up another 40 steam dyes plus 8 jaggedpine ones. 183-187 took just over two stacks of jp dyes, 41 in total. It left me with 8 steams and 10 jp's if my figures are correct.<br />
<br />
Total cost was just under 12k including ribon sell backs. They were about 16pp cost per golds and 87 pp for plats. I'd gladly sink another 20-30k if I could do this past 200, 210, etc. Ribbons were by far the fastest imp route for me to take. I've done wu's 5 times previous (shawl8's) and wasn't touching that crap again.<br />
<br />
So far with robes it's 6 imps from 187-193 on 93 combines, 4 successes &gt;&lt; @ 305 dex 264 wis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tudamorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Take it from someone who did robes 187-250:  Cherish those times when all you have to make is platinum ribbons.  They are so much easier than robes, it's not even funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When I was making platinum ribbons I though it was too expensive. Then I went to 227 on robes and wished I could go back and do ribbons.<br />
<br />
Moral?  Do the ribbons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cragzop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have limited experience with ribbons - 175 to 187 and robes 165 to 175 and 187 to 195.<br />
<br />
So far robes I'm averaging about 1 skillup in 25 or so combines. Ribbons were about 1 in 17.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>drtyaty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Definately do ribbons.  Find someone who two-boxes in our guild who wouldn't mind setting up one of their foragers in a zone that has your ribbon components (can't remember your race) and have them hit the forage button while we raid or while they are exping.<br />
<br />
Then use the ribbons you make for cultural robes; that is if you are a race that has cultural robes, since I cannot remember (DE I believe, which I think get cultural robes).  <br />
<br />
I am sure someone in the guild will be more than happy to do this for you, and you will save a lot of time and money this way.  If you do not do ribbons you are going to waste alot of money and components on &lt; 187 combines that you want to spend on 187+ combines.<br />
<br />
Realize tailoring is going to take a lot of time and that you cannot purchase your way to 250.  See my post here: http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=13359<br />
<br />
Oh, and read up on the boards.  Almost all the questions you will have will already be contained in these threads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ChaseFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">*nod* Platinum ribbons are worth the expense:<br />
<br />
57 combines 171 - 180. All on Jaggedpine Dye. Currently gathering more shoots for the run to 187. My apologies to avid bakers...</div></div><hr />
