Akephalos was the one who mentioned there were new recipes at the brew barrel for cinnamon something or other, so I just took that ball and ran like hell!  Thanks Akephalos :)<br />

BIG Congrats!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Akephalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I never did get high elf parts :(<br />
<br />
I'm still going to finish this thing though! :D <br />
<br />
Did the note say anything?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The note is the recipe, the link is below the screenshot. I left it as a link and not a picture in case people wanted to find out for themselves :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Akephalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh, so you're saying maybe I should read? :(<br />
<br />
Haha :) Interesting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm already speculating about the two odd ingredients LOL, I tried the plain versions but got a DNC in a brew barrel, so maybe it's another subcombine thing with item #3 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sylphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The two odd ingredients aren't so odd.  The normal versions worked for me.  She gives a recipe for a drink we already knew of... do you recognize it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmmm I guess maybe I had the wrong egg, because what I tried gave a DNC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xerelise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Rofl she gives recipe to broder's revenge!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Kind of funny the new UI gave us the answers for both Lewena's drink and Brodder's Revenge...<br />
<br />
but we did it backwards LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Iilane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Confirmed, Cinnamon-Spiced Elven Tea is the secret drink that Lewena's looking for :)<br />
<br />
Cinnamon-Spiced Elven Tea = Spiced Cinnamon Powder + Elven Spirits (Brew Barrel)<br />
Elven Spirits = Gnomish Spirits + Morning Dew (Brew Barrel)<br />
Spiced Cinnamon Powder = Cinnamon Sticks + High Elf Parts + Elf Leaf (Mixing Bowl)<br />
<br />
I found it kinda ironic that the recipe involves high elf parts... its like Lewena's a cannibal drinking her own kind!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mdh2112</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Now, for the HARD part of the quest... What's the source for the elven tea recipe - in game lore?<br />

you've got to be kidding....<br />
<br />
oh well, grats to you for solving it, at least now we can all move on...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Good point, Maevenniia, It's time to find another annoying, unsolved tradeskill-related quest with an awful reward at the end of it.<br />
<br />
I nominate the Whisperling shield quest in Shadeweavers/Shar Vahl. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Now we know why Brodder was so hot to have us solve this quest! =)<br />
<br />
You have to admit, though, that the recipe was so insanely obscure that it's all but impossible for us to have stumbled across it by accident as were were muddling our way through the quest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">So Lewena and Brodder's Revenge were connected somehow after all!<br />
<br />
Once again, Tradeskill UI &gt; IG clues.<br />
<br />
So, what's the triv on this recipie?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Parts triv at 62, final combine trivs at 82<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Great job!! :)<br />
<br />
Now the question is: Why?!  There's got to be more lore behind it than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brodder FoamyMugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">That's very very odd... the elf parts should just be spices...<br />

 gnomish spirits shoulda been superior gnomish spirits...<br />

<br />
It does seem kind of odd that this would have high elf parts in it, but there's no accounting for taste, after all :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Oh, I dunno, I think the High Elf Parts would make it a really good drink.  Then again, I am an Iksar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I would expect an iksar to have some kind of elf meat in a drink ;) However Lewena is a wood elf, with apparently cannibalistic tendencies :)</div></div><hr />

Great job!! :)<br />
<br />
Now the question is: Why?!  There's got to be more lore behind it than that.  <br />
<br />
Where did the recepie come from? Where was it found? No one has said anything about that yet.<br />
<br />
A not-possible to find recepie for a quest that gives you a recepie for another item... that does nothing... Thats a pretty lame quest.<br />
<br />
No faction hits?<br />
<br />
How good is the XP at lvl 1?<br />
<br />
Whats the point of this stupid quest?<br />
<br />
We tore our hair out for however long Luclin has been out (2 years) on an unsolvable quest... and when its finally figured out, theres no real reward and the people who solved it wont tell us how they did it?<br />
<br />
I ******* give up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>mdh2112</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Actually, &quot;they&quot; did say. It was a new recipe noticed in the tradeskill UI. There is still no word on any in-game-lore leads that would have even hinted at the answer, though.<br />

<br />
High Elf parts don't make much sense, I agree. It's an easy enough fix, however...<br />
<br />
See they change things on us years after... <br />
<br />
Is completely untrue. The quest recipe has remained unchanged (bug and all), with the exception of it mysteriously showing up in the tradeskill window, since you guys first got hung up on the text. :angel: <br />

I did some vendor searching and looked in the bazaar, but didn't see any around.  Where can I farm some?  Dulak?  Or do I have to blow my faction fighting in Felwithe?<br />

The only place to get them is crushbone off the slaves, plus crazed slave in torg mines (wherever that is LOL)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Cerpicio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Cool, thanks!  I didn't realize they were so rare.<br />
<br />
I did a search for them, but didn't find anything.  Maybe I searched for &quot;meat&quot; instead of &quot;parts.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />
-- C.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Cubwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">the high elf parts are pretty rare off of slaves in crushbone. When I'm bored, I'll farm them for a few hours, and I might get 3-4 for a 2 hour stint. Entirely too rare. (they should make racial meats drop from all guards)<br />
<br />
If you want to get the best bang for your racial meat/blood buck, kill the fantastic four in Dagnor's Cauldron. The high elf will rarely drop high elf parts, the wood elf will drop wood elf parts and elven blood, the dwarf will drop dwarf meat and dwarven blood, and the gnome will drop gnome meat. The spawn is quick, and with the exception of the high elf parts, the drops are relatively common.<br />

<br />
 Der were several written up as semi racial quests too...<br />
 One was a Elf/Dark elf recipe... for elfs it was to discover a spy in the council under a high illusion (Dark Elf) Breaking the illusion would trigger guards and agro in area just fine (with you ie turn in person) as main agro...<br />
 Think it was Elven wine + Pixie dust + Fizzlepop + something else...maybe honeycomb...a sparkly bubbly beverage that would make elf's feel good and happy and well bubbly...<br />
 To the dark elf it would be a test of hate to imbibe this...then they'd get a recipe to turn the beverage into a cursed version that would make the elf drinking it go on a hate filled rampage...(add high elf wood elf blood, some ichor of a beast of the underworld or a vile evil beast of somesort then bury it in a box (box combine) at a location at night and meditate on it. (done by clicking box and having a long timer (4-5 minutes in game) and then getting the cursed bottle should their faith and hate be strong enough...<br />
<br />
 Going by memory the bottle would have to be blessed (cursed) by the necros/sk guild or the clerics in DE town for the DE part of the quest...and buried in Faydwer at the DE camp on way to mistmoor on the zone wall...<br />
<br />
<br />
 There was a Belch potion that would stun you and your current target if in range...<br />
<br />
 There was Catbik's Pirate's Punch- Yak nixed it but thought the write up was hilarious as did Sam (think he was the item guy then)...<br />
<br />
 There were versions of common recipes that used Veluious versions of the same ingredients to make Coldain versions of beverages.<br />
<br />
 There was a Giant beverage called Panther errr...piddle (was again a funny write up and story!) based on giants trying to outbrew the dwarfs and then giving it to them only to watch them react negatively. (something humorous about giving dwarfs a good smelling brew that tasted like panther piddle).<br />
 Since dwarfs attack giants on sight it was to give folks on giant faction a chance to get the bartender's faction up in the giant haven to get access to their recipes... (Time prevented these from going in I think- enough of my ideas/recipes/diaries were in with velious already)...<br />
<br />
 Ahh well<br />
<br />
<br />
 PC with all that stuff is dead...buried and scattered...(thank Hurricane last year for that) so recovery of that data is near impossible on my end...</div></div><hr />

If they're actually in game, then yeah, they would. If not, then probably not, since I don't have any of that documentation.  :o<br />
