I have a couple of questions for you.  I've been stocking up on blue diamonds for Tunarean tailoring and was just wondering what items seem to sell the most.  I've only seen 1 piece ever sold on my server (bracer) so I really have no clue what I should try to make.  And also, what lvl should I be before even trying to attempt it?  Currently I'm at 232 with a geerlok.  No trophy yet =(.<br />
Thank you for any help you can offer!!<br />

If that level of risk is comfortable to you vis a vis the ease at which you can get more components should you fail. Then by all means go ahead. <br />
<br />
Of course even with max skill, again if its the same as smithing, you will never have higher than a 50% average success rate. So is the 20% improvement of chance or so worth the wait to you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wiggume</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">id say your success will be 40-50% over a long enough span. If you wait till 242 or 243 your success will be maxxed and you should see 60-65% success.<br />
<br />
I dont know what the ranger market for tunarean is, for stormreaper its pretty sucky. But I would start with belts and wristbands. Those sell pretty decent and will give you more attempts thus helping insure a short unlucky streak doesnt wipe out all chances of profit (if you started with tunics/legs).<br />
<br />
Personally if im having good success I swith to 1 or 2 diamond pieces, if im having bad success I switch over to tunics/cloaks/legs. My theory is that by the time i realize i am on a good or bad streak, the streak is almost over and about to change =) Works pretty well. Pure randomness would say my theory is like trying to predict roulette based on previous outcomes but in EQ I sense there is more going on lol. of course it helps that in sitting next to my lucky tree when doing comines...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Serill</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After 65+ combines (100k is BDs) at Tunarean Soldier Stuff, my success rate is a bit above 40 percent (worst streak was 0 in 6, good thing it was on bracers and not tunics).  This is with maxed skill, so not sure where 60-65% comes from. My guess is its 50 percent and I've just been a bit unlucky.<br />
<br />
So skill:<br />
232= ~30% success rate<br />
242= ~40%<br />
252= ~50%<br />
<br />
Stuff I've sold so far:<br />
Tunic:2<br />
Pants:5<br />
Belt:2<br />
Bracer:5<br />
<br />
Basically calculate you costs (mostly Blue Diamond cost) and factor in your average success rate, then see if you have any chance of making a profit.  If no one else on server is selling stuff you need to compare to other items (i.e Belts compare to Cobalt Drake Belt - can get about 3 times as much for a tunarean one I think, etc.).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wiggume</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">its coming from my experience =) i average 2/3 success at 250 skill and have done hundreds of combines. I stock constantly all 3 sets of the stormreaper armor which is 39 pieces, have been since september. I sold a full set of paladin armor last week, 3 pieces of the ranger armor just last night. Paladin armor is the most popular, Ive sold full sets to a single customer 4 or 5 times. Ive sold too many to count 'full visable' sets of both paladin and druid armor. Maybe stormreaper is easier than tunarean :) but i dont see why it would have been made that way.</div></div><hr />
