<br />
http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/PoP_stats.htm<br />
<br />
You a 250 tailor, or very very close friends with one, and want some nice new threads?<br />
<br />
Well, here is the hard part.  Getting the raw, dropped, materials.<br />
<br />
For Nightmare Silk armor, you need:<br />
<br />
Nightmare Arachnid Silk (pretty easy to get, people camp these for the spells, but mobs are mostly L 60+).  2 to 6 per attempt.<br />
Nightmarewood Sap (hard to get, doesn't drop commonly, mobs are under L 53 which helps).  3 per attempt.<br />
Nightmare Memphit Blood (1/2 hour to crawl to, not that casually hunted, common drop) 1 per insignia.<br />
Nightmare Iron (1/2 hour to crawl to, not that casually hunted, common drop)  1 per insignia.<br />
Raw Diamond (easiest part, can often find them on vendors)  1 per insignia.<br />
<br />
The insignias are made by a JCer.  Once made, you don't lose them on failed silk armor combines.<br />
<br />
Nightmare can be zoned into at L 46, so you can always /auc inzone for the stuff.  This place is dangerous at L 46, so be careful.<br />
<br />
Stormweave silks are similar:<br />
<br />
Storm Volass Hair (Hard to get.  These guys all seem to be bald, given their drop rates) 2 to 6 per attempt<br />
Storm Ent Sap (not as hard as the hair, but annoying) 3 per attempt<br />
Stormrider Blood (highly camped, and not that rare of a drop) 1 per insignia<br />
Raw Diamond (easy) 1 per insignia<br />
Electrified Copper (common drop, might not show up on vendors however) 1 per insignia<br />
<br />
The biggest problem with PoS drops is that not many folk hunt in Storms, and those that do often don't sell the junk to vendors.  They know the real trick to cash in PoP (sell non-stacking loot).<br />
<br />
So, for Storms drop, find that pseudo-uber guild friends of yours, and get them to stock up on the items needed.  The Hair is much harder than the rest, so stress how much you love people who bring you hairy largess.<br />
<br />
Look below at the replies for some hunting tips, if you are going to hunt for them yourself.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jhavon</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your info is *slightly* misleading, as you combine the emblem materials in with the final product.  While it's true you need all that for one combine, if it's a failure, you don't need all that again, as the emblem is returned upon failures.<br />
<br />
Ore/Raw Diamond/Blood is only used up in the Emblem combines, which you only &quot;use up&quot; on a successful combine of a final product.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Nightmare Iron is fairly common drop if you hunts to get your mephit blood, they drop from the Gobs before the Mephits.<br />
<br />
Getting Mephit blood or Iron would be easy if you have a group that have a long time to hunt for some XP and they are disciplined(not running around like a starving dog in search of food) or if the mezer is good if the group lack and run much around.<br />
<br />
Both are fairly common drops, just that the mephit blood is deeper then the Iron.<br />
<br />
Since the NDT and the IMP nerf, getting there required only a group that have a few hours otherwise you wasting your time.<br />
<br />
30 minutes to make a group, 30 minutes to get there, if they are raids junkies that will answer any raid call, get someone else, you can't afford changing members all the time.  Or at least pick 1 guild only, not 5 differents guilds, you are pretty much doomed with 5 differents! :P</div></div><hr />
