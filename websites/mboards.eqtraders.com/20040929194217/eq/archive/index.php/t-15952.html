Lupos Quick Guide to Cash <br />
<br />
1. Stock up fridge on beer and smokes close by <br />
<br />
2. Catch your kids doing something bad even if its something you forgot to punish them for from months ago !! If that dont work , break a basement window and ask them wich one did it ,they will use thier same always answer I didnt do it , I didnt do it !!! When they say that just say your all grounded and doing TS skills for me till you admit wich one of ya did it !!! <br />
<br />
3. Dish out punishments by the hour , didnt make bed = 2 hours TS smithing. Dropped ice while coming to restock dads Cooler = 2 hours JC combines. <br />
<br />
4. Set up cooler beside reclining chair have remote handy !! I use an electric reclining chair i find it best becuase after 6 to 7 hours your legs go numb and its easier to push a button , and the recliner i have lifts you right up to a standing position . <br />
<br />
5. Have long stick to prod kids from reclining chair when they get caught slacking off ! You can always use a tac in end of stick also if thier really slacking , or what i like to do is use a old car antenae and hook it up to a old 24 volt car battery i got and zap em with that , really puts a spark into thier movement. <br />
<br />
6. Especially dont let wife catch you doing this to your kids , Threaten kids with ill only feed you rice all week as your moms working if you tell her . <br />
<br />
7. Once all your TS skills are maxed , send them out foraging and gathering supplies for TSing . Best times to have them do this is summer leave X Mas and march break as you can have them pretty well doing this for 24/7 as i have 3 kids and can make them work in 8 hour shift changes. <br />
<br />
8. Now Once this is all done. This is when you start playing your toon again doing all the final High End Combines and sell them in Bazaar for Big Mullaahh , and just let the cash roll in !!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />
<br />
So thiers my Quick Cash Guide, so i hope you all run out pop out some puppies and then when they grow up to about 4 years old they can start on your TS skills for ya and watch the monies come in . <br />
<br />
Hope this helped ya all if your having cash flow problems !<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">evil!<br />
 :d</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Turlo Lomon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mmm... I have two kids... and one does play EQ (as well as a 3 year old can... she did make it to 3rd level somehow). <br />
<br />
This is definitely an interesting idea....<br />
<br />
/plot<br />
<br />
Luckily my wife doesn't visit this board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Heartsong_Steelsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bleh.  If you can't write something funny, at least write it with good grammar.<br />
<br />
(just expressing my opinion!  Others are allowed to think it's funny. :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Anyone know how to train a dog to play EQ?  They are Belgian malinios and a rough collie.  Both very intelligent breeds.<br />
<br />
If I can just get one to be able to forage for me while I'm at work (hide &amp; sneak, then just keep spamming the FORAGE button) I'd be rolling in it!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shingen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What about hotkeys? You could use one a them drinking things ala Homer Simpson<br />
<br />
dunno what the command'd be but<br />
<br />
/ability blah (forage)<br />
/autoinventory<br />
<br />
...would work nicely, just set up with eight empty 10slots with a stack of fuzzlecutter and fish rolls in the first two slots of the first bag, bingo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Set up a feeder unit so that in order to get any food or drink they have to press a pad or big button that links to a simple device that can be constructed from as simple materials as legos that hits the forage key when the big ground unit is pressed. Combined with a timelock that triggers the opening only after the forage timer has reset since the last press and you'll miss no foraging opertunities!<br />
<br />
I could just picture trying to explain it to a GM though if the dog found a way to control the EQ char &quot;Sorry about that raid getting trained but it wasn't me! See, my dog was playing that char at the time&quot;.  :D</div></div><hr />
