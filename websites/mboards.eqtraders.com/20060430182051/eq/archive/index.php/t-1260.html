GREAT, no more paying a ton to foraging classes.  I'll just go wipe out Lfay and get my own, then go to MM next door and get my moonlight essense.<br />
<br />
Well after ONE HOUR of killing everything in my path, I had ONE morning dew drop from a fairie.  I killed pixies, faires, brownies, whatever I happend to see really.<br />
<br />
Now since I need 1 stack per week at least to do my smithing, I'd have to spend 20 hours farming morning dews.<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />

They seem to be a rare drop.  If I spend a full night there though I can end up with the same amount foraged as looted by nights end.  Just need to have the time to hunt there.<br />
<br />
As for the other mobs.  I have not been lucky enough to see any drop from them.  So I stopped killing them.</div></div><hr />

Hands down the best farmers are the folks that can use a mega damaging 2H slasher - at 47 level my buddy's troll SK can kill most old world fur and silk dropping critters in a single swat with a wieghted axe.</div></div><hr />

Pet kills, mage loots.  No mana involved.  Beastlord is close, as is necro, though those 100% weight reducing bags are super for farming.<br />
<br />
Worst farmer... cleric.  Dps sucks AND it requires mana.  If it's really low level, (spiderlings), I can solo ae.  Otherwise, it's melee time.  /sigh.  If my 33 beastlord can't farm it, my 64 cleric won't be able to either.<br />

Tracking, high powered range attacks, manaless damage, wolf form, Snare, lev, enough strength to carry large loads. I would imagine bards would be pretty good farmers too. But I wouldn't trade my hubby's ranger for any other class. Rangers make perfect tradeskill/farming partners.  :mrgreen:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Between the drops (she claims they are dropping 1 out of 4 on avg - not a precise figure), and her foraging (she's Iksar), I now have 3 stacks of Morning Dew.<br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm that the dew drops off the Faeries?<br />
<br />
Since my faerie faction is slaughtered  ;) ... might as well sweep through them a few times to find out...   :twisted:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit:<br />
Dew off of Pixies also, and the one spawn I saw was in front of MM zone by ruins.<br />
<br />
Sorry I said &quot;various locations&quot; previously, seemed to touch a nerve with some that I was witholding info.</div></div><hr />

The only one that comes close to us is the Qeynos temper, none of the Elven smithing items (aside from Mithrial) are store bought. <br />
<br />
Elven smithing uses Foraged or Farmed items for all subcombines and for the Temper, Qeynos cultural uses flasks of water for the subcombines. <br />
<br />
I know this may belong more in the primal scream room AND I know that this dropping of morning dew makes it slightly better than before but I cannot help but wonder why the elven races did not get to use Elven wine.<br />

OK I am done now.<br />

Main reason why the other cultural recipees are easier is that they were implmented way after Evlish cultural was. If I'm remembering correctly (and feel free to correct me) Evlish and Dwarvish cultural smithing were around and fairly popular before the big changes were made in cultural smithing that introduced all the recipees using blue diamonds. Elvish smithed items were actualy good enough to use, while the other races cultural armors were generaly considered sub standard to available dropped and tradeable armors. (honestly, elvish armors arn't that good, but chain on a wizard dose have a certain appeal, and the plate armor have a very unique tint to it.) The thing that made elvish cultural superior to the other cultural armors (and still makes it desirable to make now) it the step between chain and plate. You could reasonably move from banded armor to the elvish chain and continue working towards fine steel and then eventualy back to elvish plate to get to 250. Now of course the trivials on everything have changed but the lower grade elvish cultural still has some nice trivial ranges. Now if they would only put morning dew on a vendor somewhere...<br />
anyways getting back to the main point (sorry about the wandering). Elvish cultural was amongst the first and they came up with this idea of elves using morning dew instead of water. Very good from a role playing stand point, nightmarish from a realistic standpoint. They learned their lesson and haven't repeated that mistake (which they didn't make with any other cultural smithing or tailoring, thankfully.), but that dosen't mean they are going to change what they have already established. And so, while high elves get possibly the best cultural armor to skill up on (trivial wise), they also get majorly shafted on the availability of water/morning dew to make all their combines.<br />
<br />
hehe, gratz to anyone that actualy made it this far. That's got to be booring long winded stuff up above.</div></div><hr />

If you cannot farm greenies with your cleric better then anyone, you are nuts.  Get a kei, load up upheaval and unspoken word and rumble.<br />
<br />
Bash and swing at mobs running around like mad.  Gather up 30 or 40 of them, AOE em down.  Faster then you can imagine....<br />
<br />
I never run out of mana and can clear most of EK myself using this method.  The thing that slows me down is running up to mobs and targeting, the rest is cake.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EanMoonshadow</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've not visited these boards much in the past 6 months or so, so hello again my fellow trade-skillers.  I'd like to add a few things about high elven smithing, beleive me I know a thing or two, lol.  I started making Koda and Elven chain under the old trivials and after last May's smithing nurf haven't tried to advance my skill.<br />
<br />
Fist let me clarify that most cultural smithing (i'm not refering to the new blue diamond stuff) goes back to original everquest.  Elven, Dwarven, Dark Elven, Ogre, Halfling, and Human anr unquetioniably that old, and are the same age.  When I first made Koada it was the holy grail of smithing. The 3 sheet items were triv 250 plus.<br />
<br />
High Elven cultural is harder then almost any other old world cultural due to moring dew, it is imballanced and VI has been made aware of this many many times.<br />
<br />
Morning dew is a pain.  It was always a ground spawn in Lfay.  The fact that is drops off Fae in Lfay is relativly new news, and a source of concern.  VI has screwed the game up again.  Now elves have to kill fae to make their cultural!  Knowing more then a little bit about Faery Lore I find this disgusting.   Elves would not kill other Fae unless it was a matter of self defense.  The game designers need to stop moving away from the role play aspects of EQ and made decisions that fit the story line.  Next thing you know we will be expected to kill Felwither guards and hunt in PoG.  A workiable solution needs implemented, this isn't one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meirril</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I whole heartly agree with Eanamdar, elves killing Fay dosen't make any sense. Then again, my halfling druid dosen't have any quams about killing brownies. (ya grow up chasing Nillipus out of the Jum Jum ya don't feel too bad stomping on brownies. They also make a tasty desert!) He dose have reservations about killing fairies though (their just so cute! Though they do remind him a little bit of Bixies...evil bixies...)<br />
<br />
Probably a better solution would of been adding morning dew to the drop table of spider mobs (morning dew stuck in their webbing, at least it has a visual appeal) and the new plant mobs in Gfay (it makes a little RP sense). Make it a rare drop (as rare as the newbie quest items) and you've got a secondary cash crop for new players, while being slighly more common than morning dew is now from brownies (I get brownie legs all of the time in Lfey off of the brownie guards). While this would make Gfey a better farming spot than Lfey (more possible mobs, lower level) I think it would be a better change over all.<br />
<br />
Either that or introduce a quest similar to the HQ ore Vender in the Bazaar. Bring him a single drop of pure rain and he'll have stacks of morning dew for sale at reasonable prices. (trading in a very valuable TS component for alot of another valuable TS component seems reasonable, considering how hard both are to obtain. 1 for 1 is rediculous as a drop of pure rain is a rare drop from BoT though.)</div></div><hr />

There are about 10 fairys in the camp (roamers) that respawn 30 seconds after they are killed.  I never run out of mana and constantly kill.  I used to destroy thousands of copper and silver there a night hehe</div></div><hr />

<br />
So we high elves get to scrape a beg from our cousins the wood elves just to skill up .. but once we make 240+ skill we have only minimal use for the stuff.</div></div><hr />
