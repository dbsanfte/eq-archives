So far I feel confident I can supply large orders of these:<br />
<br />
Velium Studs: 80p each<br />
Velium Boning: 50p each<br />
Velium Ring: 50p each<br />
Folded Sheet of Velium: 100p each<br />
Celestial Essence:5p/each (1-100), 4p/each (101-*)<br />
<br />
<br />
Place your order below, PM me, or /t Catx and I will give you a tell ingame as to when I expect to have your goods.<br />
<br />
PS. If you need other goods farmed, I would probably be willing, detail what I would have to do and what it'd be worth to you, and if I am confident I can do it, I will respond with whether or not I feel it would be worth my time.<br />

Matteo- your secondorder of celestial essence is waiting in my bank /t me and I will hook you up with it.<br />

Anyone else?  I honestly am getting a little frustrated with some of the responses I have been getting to my offers of goods.  Trivial subcombine components,  yes I know if you were to take the time to do all this yourself you could do it for less.  But you dont have to, you could help a fledgeling tradeskiller, and get something out of it.  The prices I ask are generally less than you would find in the bazaar, I am doing what I can do to help myself by helping others... not many seem to value my time though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure this is brought on, in part at least, by my comments about your pricing of velium studs on Sunday.  We did the calculations &quot;aloud&quot; to demonstrate that the price you were asking (100p / stud) was not nearly bargain enough to convince most tradeskillers to subcontract these trivial combines to you, unless they had more or less unlimited plat an no patience for the combines.  (Even buying the velium at 10p per piece, rather than farming them, and brewing the tempers brings in 2 studs at just around 112p.  Farming the velium makes it more like 52p / 2 studs.)<br />
<br />
I don't think it is a matter of people not valuing your time as much as it is  them not placing the SAME value that you feel your time is worth.  Simply put, many of us have more time than money, and aren't likely to pay nearly twice what it costs us to make the items, especially when then become so pricey.  <br />
<br />
Everyone has their concept of what is fair to them.  I have spent two days doing nothing but foraging dye components (and tormenting green mobs to kill time) in trade for some research combines that Veldin considers trivial and of no consequence.  However, having no time or possibly no means to forage these items, he places a higher value on them.  <br />
<br />
Meanwhile on the other side of the world, a very kind druid stopped farming the silks she needed in EK and imbued 5 stacks of emeralds for me, for which I gladly repaid her with 5 stacks of silk swatches.  The imbues were done in a matter of hours for her while she was attending to other matters, and likewise, the silks were just sitting in the bank collecting dust and had no real value to me.<br />
<br />
If you had been available when I was brewing coldain tempers and realized that I had miscalculated my need for CE by 25%, you would have had all the business you could have handled.  Now, however, knowing that I am going to need 8 stacks for a holy cake run, another 20 stacks or so for more tempers, etc, etc, I am budgeting my time a little more wisely and taking stacks of ingredients with me to combine while camping mobs.<br />
<br />
Sometimes timing is everything.  The long and the short of it is, don't get too bent out of shape about it, and by no means should you take it personally.</div></div><hr />

Some people prefer to do the subcombines themselves.  Up until about a month ago I farmed everything myself and did all my own subcombines.  Just don't have the time anymore but still want to work on tradeskills.</div></div><hr />

You know, I still farmed more silk after that, must've been crazy that day. Actually, I think I'm crazy skilling up two characters at once, too bad I can't merge them temporarily ;)<br />
<br />
Bar, I might be able to get condensed and shadows for you, but no acrylia..having a hard enough time getting it myself.</div></div><hr />

actually.. i got another 100 combines worth of acrylia ready, just a tad shy of the condensed stuff.  bazaar + personal farming seems to work but only in getting one or the other.. not both  :?</div></div><hr />

<br />
73 (ish) tempers on one trader last night for 25p, just under retail if I recall correctly.  I need about 200 studs myself, so I decided to just wait and make them myself.  <br />
<br />
Sigh....200 studs....400 tempers....400 heaters....1600 CE....plus the 10 stacks of cod oil, and lest I forget, the days of velium gathering....<br />
<br />
Oh, well, at 197 I have plenty of time.  Bank space, however....</div></div><hr />

As I type this, three traders have CVTs at 25p, one has 77, one has 53 and the other only has 1 now.  <br />

<br />
Hmmm...I've already done about 5 stacks of heaters, with about 3 stacks of algae on stand-by.  I was holding off since I didn't need the studs for a while, but if I do them now and sell them to you, I can make twice as many for myself later.    :idea: <br />
<br />
After dropping 5k on my new weapon this weekend, I could really use some quick cash.  I think I'll be in touch...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had a serious bout of the drowsies while making the CE's with Euell last night (he already had a crapload of components), and fell about 6 stacks short.  I should be able to whip through them and get the lot transferred over to Zabu for the actual brewing during/after dinner (higher skill, and a gearlok).  <br />
<br />
If I get started early enough, I may have the brewing done by late evening.  If not, a grind opportunity is supposed to present itself, in which case I will try to finish up Thursday.</div></div><hr />
