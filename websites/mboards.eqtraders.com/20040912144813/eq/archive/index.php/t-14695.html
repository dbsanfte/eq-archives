<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm getting closer, but I still need...<br />
<br />
From Earth:<br />
1 Liquedized Earth (more if possible, in case of failures).<br />
<br />
From Fire:<br />
4 Metallic Substances (more if possible, in case of failures).<br />
<br />
I could use a few spares on the temper components, just in case of failures... but they're not vital.<br />
<br />
Edited to update quantities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Okay, got the Chips of Granite...<br />
<br />
Of course, this all becomes moot if I spend all my pennies on an Ornate Boot Mold. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krowdd Xegony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Look me up when you see me on sometime, and I'll take care of your vials.  Which and how many do you need?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Vials?<br />
<br />
Don't need any vials...  I do need 1 Imbue Fire and 1 Imbue Earth done though...  Then the Jewelcraft combines for the Emblem of Earth and Emblem of Fire.  I'll be honest, these things are going to be a pain for me and I'd really like someone with JCM 3 doing the combines.<br />
<br />
What I really need are the drops from PoF &amp; PoE.  The Metallic Substances would be great, since I could work on making the Inferno Plate Vambraces (that nobody has made yet... not on Lucy, Magelo, Alla's or here).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks to some sales of Blessed Full Mithril and a lucky purchase of an Ornate Boot Mold...<br />
<br />
I'm ready to Smith!<br />
<br />
Well, not quite.  Still need the Emblems made, and I'd like another Liquefied Earth so I can make Livestone Chain Leggings at the same time.<br />
<br />
Metallic Substances still aren't showing up in the Bazaar though... I'm really chomping at the bit to try those Inferno Plate Vambraces!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wystie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You're probably not seeing those in the bazaar because they're insanely rare.  I don't know how long I spent farming PoF and never saw even one.  I've made ~3 of the Improved Damage Ceramic pottery thingies -- and those drops are rare too -- to give you an idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well...<br />
<br />
I tried making Livestone Chain Sleeves... and failed. :(  So I've used up all but one Planar Rings and an Emblem of Earth.<br />
<br />
Still praying for some Metallic Substances.<br />
<br />
Can anyone (in an Elemental+ Guild) ask their Guild Banker if it's possible to buy them?  I'm willing to go 9k each and buy up to 10 of them. ;)<br />
<br />
I know if I get really lucky making the first set of Vambs, I'd love to try a second set. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hathelsay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I may have one substance in the bank. Will check tonight. But Wyst is right those things are stupid rare. Plus most people dont exp off them much anyway.</div></div><hr />
