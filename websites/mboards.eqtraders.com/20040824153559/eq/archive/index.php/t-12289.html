<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>hyelaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
I just started tinkering and was wondering where I could find the Tattered Gnomish Cloaks.  The main site does not list a source or recipe.  Also, I did find one in the bazaar selling for 50pp, is this a good price?  I didn't buy it because I wasn't sure if that was outrageously inflated or a steal.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>astianax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">gimble's right. seem to drop off goblin drunkard, goblin high shaman, and goblin king, all fairly rarely</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>QuteCleric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Did they change this? I seem to recall being confused as to why we had to kill gnomes for a gnomish recipe...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>hyelaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, I don't like this zone.  Everytime I go there I fall into the lava.  Managed to kill myself twice now, either by gobbies agro'ing on me, or managing to find a zone to sol b and having the kobolds attack...  Has anyone ever farmed these things before?  Any suggestions?  Since I'm already really poor, I'd rather farm then buy them for an outrageous amount in the bazaar.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zallarenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did a few thermal cloak combines when I was a young tinker, but I didn't &quot;farm&quot; them. When I did Sol A for experience or quests (or my friends did), I asked for the cloaks and did the combines. The drops are rare enough that I wouldn't suggest farming them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As best I can tell, the tattered gnomish cloak can drop in place of any of the &quot;good&quot; loot from goblins in Sol A.  When I was there trying to get (then really nice) Foreman's Tunics and such, it was the drop that pissed me off.  I'd guess they dropped 1-in-8 from any of the named goblins.<br />
<br />
It's been a looong time, so I don't recall which clockworks or gnomes might drop them.  Might've been the same deal, replacement for &quot;good&quot; loot from named gnomes/clockworks, but I'm not sure.</div></div><hr />
