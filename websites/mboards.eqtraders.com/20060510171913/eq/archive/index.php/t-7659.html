<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haphern</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From checking the forum here and the recipe/stats page, Inferno plate is the one with large amounts of mana, making it of dubious interest for plate melee classes but bards and clerics might like it.<br />
<br />
As it would translate to BB, there may be a market for it, if you can judge the price correctly against other comparable items (other ele plate and the ornate plate molds). If you have the pieces littering up your bank and want to try, the items reported are below:-<br />
<br />
inferno plate bracer AC 27, DEX 7, STA 2, WIS 5, INT 5, AGI 7, HP 25, mana 70, sv cold 10, wt 3.0, medium <br />
inferno plate greaves AC 43, DEX 10, STA 4, WIS 8, INT 8, AGI 10, HP 40, mana 100, sv cold 20, wt 6.5, medium <br />
inferno plate breastplate AC 65, DEX 12, STA 5, WIS 10, INT 10, AGI 12, HP 50, mana 120, sv cold 25, wt 8.0, medium<br />
<br />
Reading between the lines, for me, there are better things to do with the ingredients than make plate, but I'd ask some clerics what they think and get them to put a price range on the items, not too up on cleric fashion these days ;).</div></div><hr />
