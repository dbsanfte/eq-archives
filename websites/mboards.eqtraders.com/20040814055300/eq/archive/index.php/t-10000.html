<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kallell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, As you can see from my topic, i havnt played eq in like 8 months or so, but i have still been trollling the boards and such periodically.   I stumbled upon some eq site that stated that from now on, there is no fletching item that will return more money than what you put into it.  My question is this true?  Is it going to cost me crap loads of plat just to raise my skill to 250???<br />
<br />
<br />
-thanks,<br />

<br />
For the most part anytime a recipe returns an item that can sell to NPC vendors more than the cost of buying the components from a NPC vendor, it has been adjusted.<br />
<br />
IE... If I could buy a stack of Arrowheads, Arrowshafts, Fletches and Nocks, for a total of say 10 Plat... and make 100 Arrows (5 per combine) and then sell those 100 Arrows for 1 plat each, bring in 100 Plat... that is something I could do to make 90 Plat per Stack of combines.<br />
<br />
And that is what Sony tries to eliminate. <br />
<br />
Why? Because this sort of thing has been discovered in other tradeskills... and people have abused it to get plat. They would sit for hours making Cheese ... at no risk... and gauranteed profit.<br />
<br />
Where they don't adjust it, if the amount of profit is on the order of 1 plat or so per stack... say you sell those 100 Arrows back for a total of 11 Plat... then with the inbred chance of failure on each combine... you won't make a profit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Doebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This only applies to selling back to an NPC. On at least some servers, there is still money to be made selling arrows in the bazaar to other players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aerinha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you get buyers that buy more than just one. <br />
I am looking forward to having endless quiver, but customers that buy just one arrow are annoying. LOL. I think it may be one reason I like making and selling the fishbone darts.; at least when the darts sell, they sell in stacks!</div></div><hr />
