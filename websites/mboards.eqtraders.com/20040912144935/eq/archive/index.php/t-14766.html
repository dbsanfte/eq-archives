<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was curious if any non-Shaman created a Shaman and Powerlevelled him to lvl 25 to do Alchemy?<br />
I wanted to know if Alchemy was hard to Master?<br />
Is it hard to find the components? Are the skill-ups slow going?<br />
I love buying potions of all kinds for my main druid.....i figured I might as make it myself with a Shaman alt.<br />
I had asked about creating a Gnome for tinkering....but I realize the Shaman would serve a better purpose.<br />
So how difficult is Alchemy, to get to the point of making good potions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Learn Alchemy (http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g6&amp;menustr=040010000000)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just found on another thread that Alchemy is level specific unlike other Tradeskills.<br />
So if I am lvl 25 I cannot get to the point of making Gate Potions, etc? Is this true? They said Shaman and Rogues class specific skills can only go as high as the characters level.......is this verified? So then it would be a waste if I left character at that lvl 25 right?<br />
I wonder why Gnomes can Master at lvl 16 then, if Shaman and Rogues cannot master at lvl 25 and 20 respectively?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just found my answer....there go my plans for making the Shaman.<br />
By the time I would get him high enough to Master Alchemy....EQ will be long gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I disagree.  EQ will be around for several more years, at least.  They are about to roll out a major upgrade to the graphics engine, and have at least two more expansions on the drawing boards (one must be nearly finished by now, because it would come out in the summer, if they kept to the every 6 months timeframe they've had recently.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aethn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not anymore.  Skilling up is a breeze to 200, easier then any tradeskill out there todate, even pottery.<br />
<br />
Up until Gates came out you could spend 100-200k pp getting from 170 to 200 in skill.  As of the release of Gates of Discord, you can now use a 8pp recipe to cruise your way to 200.  <br />
<br />
A  friend of mine just skilled his Alchemy from 25 - 200 in one night for 70k pp.  Pre Gates it took me 4 years and 450kpp to hit 200.  I started back before the cool Alchemy recipes were out, and the prices were cut in half for herbs later too.  So I spent a little over 250kpp to get from 25 to 150ish.<br />

By the time I would get him high enough to Master Alchemy....EQ will be long gone. <br />

EQ1 will be around for the next 10 years at a minimum.  If UO can stillturn a profit with top-down two dimensional graphics and cartoon like characters, Everquest 1 will be around until Al Gore decides to invent a new kind of internet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ledce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Alchemy used to be a difficult and expensive skill to raise.  As it stands it is one of the simplest and cheapest.  65 is not difficult to obtain either.  It takes less than a week for most to get level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No, it does not take less than a week for most to get level 65.  It takes less than a week for a seriously powerlevelled person to hit 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kungloa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">actually since they changed the trivial ont he snare potions I'm not sure how cheap it will be to get 200 ... I got my gm status luckily b4 they dropped the triv on the snare potions to 111 from 227<br />
