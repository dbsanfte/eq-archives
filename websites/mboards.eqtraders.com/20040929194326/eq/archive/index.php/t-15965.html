How do you make hash brown?  (I don't mean the country hash fries potato cube thingys.) I've experimented a few different ways and could only come up with some browned gray pancake-looking things.<br />
<br />
I shred the raw-peeled potates, drain/spin/squeeze the water out.  Medium heat oil in the frying pan, scattter the potato shreds in, salt.  I can't do high heat because the outside burns.  If I use anything medium and lower, the middle is always gray and greasy.<br />
<br />
Should I cooked the potato first?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frerin the Smith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are using too much oil.  Just a thin layer, and get it hot to scorch the potatoes.  Using your spatula, keep flipping the potatoes in sections every 15 to 20 seconds.  Should serve when you have a good mix of white and tender, and brown and cripsy potatoes.<br />
<br />
Using clean oil will provide a more potato'y taste, but using bacon or sausage grease will provide a better &quot;breakfast&quot; flavor in my opinion.  But remember, the oil needs to be only enough to fry the spuds, not deep fry them.<br />
<br />
The shredded variety is the hardest to get right.  Cubed is easier, but if you are really having problems, just use 1/4 inch slices and have &quot;fried potatoes&quot; instead of hash browns.  It's good practice for learning how to make hash browns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have always used Butter instead of oil. But yes, essentially less is more for getting them crisp and not greasy</div></div><hr />

I used butter, too.  I'll also add in some spices, depending on what I was in the mood for.  Sometimes, I'd cook the hash browns, then put them in the plat, then throw some scrambled eggs into the pan right after, came out great.  <br />
<br />
MMMMMMMMMM<br />
<br />
I'm hungry now.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I love Hash Browns... but I hate the kind you get in resturants where the middle is all gooshy-white.<br />
<br />
Mash 'em flatter &amp; cook 'em well.  They should all be yellow to brown!<br />
<br />
Of course, I don't like &quot;country fries&quot; either... and I love the super-thin french fries you sometimes get when you order fries at fast-food places.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Trash browns = yummy<br />
<br />
Hashed browns, cooked and fried up crisp.  Add in an whisked egg, peppers, onions, sauteed mushrooms, crisp bacon crumbled and mix together well.  When almost done, add big moundfuls of cheese and move to plate and tummy... YUMMY!</div></div><hr />
