<br />
If not, does anyone know where I may find a dropped one??</div></div><hr />

Only races that can be pure casters (Necro, Wizard, Chanter, Mage) have robe grapics, which are High Elfs, Iksar, Erudites, Humans, and Gnomes.  All other races it will appear as though you're naked.</div></div><hr />

At least, it did look that way before the new graphics.</div></div><hr />

I can't think of a white tailored item, but there is a white robe that drops in the game.  If i remember right its called *somebody's* nighty or nightgown.  First time I saw it, it was on a pally and I almost died laughing :D  Unfortunately for you, it would still only show up as a tunic, but at least it's white.<br />

But the are very rare I'm afraid.  :( <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cendorly</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are two white robes in the game.  The first one is Shania's Nightie (not sure on spelling).  Shania is the vah shir in Shar Vhal that walks around trying to deliver buttons for her daddy.  It's actually a newbie quest, and she can usually be found near the rogue guild or one of the huts where her father works tailoring the suits for the guards.  To get the robe, you have to *gasps and cries* kill Shania!! Not sure what level she is, but I know she's killable by someone 55+ and her nightie is all/all.<br />
<br />
A Gossamer Robe, which is another all white robe, drops off one of the orcs (I think) in crushbone near the slave pits.  My memory is REAL foggy here, since it was a long, long time that I did that camp.  Since then, I've seen that robe drop several times off the king goblin (sorry, I'm bad with names today) in Permafrost.  Just go to the main room, right before the Giants and the way to Vox where all the named goblins are.  Kill the King goblin a few times and you'll eventually get the robe.  I've seen it drop about 2-3 times while farming permafrost crystals there a while back.  I'm not sure who can wear a Gossamer robe, it may be limited to pure casters (ench/necro/wiz/mage) only.<br />
<br />
As everyone else said, however, being a wood elf, if you wear the robe, it will not show up, since Wood Elves have no robe graphic.  However, any other race that has a robe graphic, regardless of class, can wear the all/all robes.</div></div><hr />
