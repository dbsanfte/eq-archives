<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heronmarked</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">G'day all.<br />
<br />
I've been pondering on where and how to post this over the past couple of days, and have finally decided to go ahead and put it in this forum. If I accidentally posted it in the wrong place, don't be too harsh on me, please? I read as many forum-rules and guidelines as I could find and the amount of forums is a tad daunting for someone new to the boards like me.<br />
<br />
Anyways, on to the meat of my post: My request for help. As you can see in my sig I have been playing around with a Kitty bard. Not having twinked him in the slightest, but secretly supplying him with some coin every now and then to up his tradeskills, I have decided to try and tackle the Sonic Bane Weapon quest.<br />
<br />
I am at this point in time right at the point where I would start to hunt in Hollowshade full-time to get my one-fifth of the Sonic Bane weapon. I need a couple of levels on me before I can safely do this, but I figured there is no harm in trying to get a group together in the meanwhile.<br />
<br />
As most of you might know, the Sonic Bane weapon requires five components, all these components made by the different Vah Shir classes. No other races or classes can make these components. This is the tricky part. My partner plays a kitty Beastlord, so that bit I will probably have covered.. However, the other three classes aren't so certain. Two mates of mine have kitty chars now as well, but neither have worked on their tradeskills, though they said they would (perhaps something good will come from it later. :)).  They are playing a warrior and a Rogue. Now, for the Shaman piece, I have no idea how to get it. <br />
<br />
So here is my request.. Would any kitty character that plays on Druzzil Ro who has involved him/herself with the tradeskilling parts of the newbiequest and who is interested in finishing the Sonic Bane quest please respond here? I am hoping to get a band of kitties together to hunt for components / exchange parts with and perhaps even make friends with.<br />
<br />
Remember.. Bettik is counting on y'all! ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niami DenMother</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd recommend that you post in the Marketplace section of these boards, in the Druzzil Ro forum, and see if you can get some folks willing to collaborate on this quest. Folks on other servers have done such initiatives in the past, and it seems to work best in the server-specific forum, so you can trade skills, components, etc. without it getting lost in more general &quot;noise&quot;.<br />
<br />
If you want, we can move this post down to that forum for you -- just let me know if you want it moved, or want to make a fresh post down in that forum.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't need to be a kitty to do the quests. Anyone can become a citizen if they obtain their own plaque (MQ with soon to be deleted new character).  Might help you find someone faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heronmarked</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would appreciate it if you could move the thread for me, Denmom. :)<br />
<br />
And Turlo Lomon, thanks for the tip.. I'm doing the quest mostly out of a sense of roleplaying and questing fun more than wanting to attain a brutal weapon though, so that'd kindda defeat the point... However, I might just wanna do it.<br />
<br />
Though I've been thinking about levelling up 3 more kittens too if noone'd care to help me out. :)<br />
<br />
Anyways, hoping for input still, thanks for the tips and help so far. :)</div></div><hr />

A barbarian shaman can do the shaman class quest for the sealant soak piece)<br />
<br />
The real reward for the Sonic Wolf bane quest is not the weapons themselves, but the AC9 30hp+stats Garrison cloak, and the very nice AC12 50hp+stats Officer cloak upgrades to the newbie cloaks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harvyst</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did this quest. <br />
<br />
In the end, I managed to find two rogues, a warrior, three beastlords and myself (shaman) to help.<br />
<br />
The dupes were because I had to do the quest twice. I never found a bard. I ended up dragging a level 2 kitty alt through the bard bit.<br />
<br />
One of them I found by posting on the rogue's board under the rodcet nife (my server)'s section. I did post on the warrior, beastlord bard boards but no response. I posted here, no response. I posted on rodcet nife's board, no response.<br />
<br />
The others I found by doing who 20-65 vah warrior, tell &amp;lt;x&gt; Excuse me, have you done the vah shir sonic weapon quest?<br />
<br />
Repeat.<br />
<br />
Took three weeks to get the needed help.<br />
<br />
The cloak is nice though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">absinthe</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the URL of the druzzil board:<br />
<br />
http://www.druzzilro.com/board/<br />
<br />
You may also be able to find help there.   :idea:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heronmarked</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, thanks a lot for that link! Will check it out and post there as well. :D</div></div><hr />
