<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azirux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Correct me if I'm wrong, but as a shaman, we don't have any throw skill. It would be a waste for a shaman to use them. Give/sell them to rangers, rogues, etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maddoc-the-Wayfarer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A couple notes:<br />
<br />
1. These are meant for everyone, not just the soloing shaman. Rogues, Berserkers, and other classes able to throw well will likely want these. <br />
<br />
2. Stackability is not currently an available option for thrown items with effects.<br />
<br />
5. Not sure what you mean -- As with most other poitions, the amount of snare that it gives off is largely dependent on your level. I'll look at this and see if there's a bug somewhere with it. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Note: I haven't yet played around with these myself. But a few questions I've had.<br />
<br />
Do they currently auto-feed from inventory like arrows or other thrown weapons?  If not is it possible to make them do so?  Also, as of the last time I looked the different levels of the snare potion had the same spell description on lucy.  Is this a bug or do the higher level snare potions just cast the snare at a higher player-level equivalent?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">By Lucy, the 1, 2, and 3 levels of Ensnaring Concoction (the spells) are identical (other than the names).   The lvl 1 and 3 potions are identical as well (the lvl 2 potion hasn't been collected yet).<br />
<br />
Unless there's some new twist Lucy is configured to display yet, there's no benefit of the level 3 over the level 1.  They both scale from 1-65 as far as the snare spell seems to be concerned.  The potions are labelled as &quot;effect level 0&quot; by lucy, which in the past has translated into using the casting player's level for the effect, IIRC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They don't stack in inventory/feed out from ammo, etc...<br />
<br />
<br />
I realize these aren't specifically for shaman (I'm aware we're not the only potion users on the planet just seems that way sometimes :angel: ) but mostly it was driven by them simply not working.<br />
<br />
As for level and such, 65 shaman here.  I specifically chose an uber low level target mostly because a length test is best on those (resists are minimal, if it wears off I don't get my face beat in, etc..).  If  they'd actually snared the mob (which they did not, I bugged this as well as /petitioned because I wanted attention brought to it as alchemy has always seemed like the redheaded stepchild of tradeskills with the high buying price, low resell price to vendors of completed materials, kudos for remedying that to a point) I probably wouldn't have been so annoyed.<br />
<br />
If you don't know what I mean (and I'm not being sarcastic in ANY way in saying this) it really DOESN&quot;T snare the mob.  0 reduction in mob movement.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KanadWinterstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I looked at these on lucy this morning and laughed to myself... if I wanted to use a short duration snare I'd crunch things with my Hammer of Leg-Crunching (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10400). A 3 tick snare vs a 5 tick snare is negligible, and the range you need to stand to throw these precludes their use on any mob that could seriously damage me.<br />
<br />
I appreciate the effort to give alchemy new abilities Maddoc, and I'm sure these will be nice for low level melee to toss and keep a mob from running... that is if they haven't already bought a Glaive of Marltek (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26033) (which is a 4 min snare by comparison to what I get with my CT drop hammer). These are a step in the right direction but it's nothing there will be any great market for.<br />
<br />
Why not a right click charged item, that is targettable and has effect snare? Or is that not possible for potions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Maddoc-the-Wayfarer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">and I'm sure these will be nice for low level melee to toss and keep a mob from running...  <br />
<br />
Completely ignoring, for a moment, the fact that this is a completely new skill-progression path that doesn't cost you a fortune and sells back for nearly what you pay for it, you have just hit on the precise reason why they were implemented. <br />
<br />
Unlike a proc, these items are nearly guaranteed to go off each time you throw them and, in addition to that, they all have a resist modifier on them, which means they're going to land more often than a standard snare-proc-ing weapon. This essentially gives most players a snare that's basically castable on demand, that lasts for 30 seconds. <br />
<br />
The potions aren't intended to be anything outstandingly unbalancing for any class, and used situationally, could be a great tool for groups of all levels. The same applies to the stun potions, which will likely prove to be handy to have around for gating mobs, even if only in limited quantities. They should be cheap enough to warrant carrying a couple around at least, for those situations that could go bad. <br />
<br />
Why not a right click charged item, that is targettable and has effect snare? Or is that not possible for potions? <br />
<br />
If all classes were meant to have snare, they would, but that delves too deep into game-balancing issues, which isn't really the point. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>KanadWinterstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sorry if my post sounded sarcastic or ungrateful Maddoc, you're completely right that these are situational items and that they are useful for those situations. I just was hoping for an alternative to farming for Swollen Fungusbeast Glands (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7603) or tarballs as I've found myself doing when I wanted to be able to snare an enemy.<br />
<br />
even a low level can get a Ball of Burlap Yarn (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6574) (I've affectionately dubbed them 'tarballs') from the stonebrunt quest, I've gone through many going from 40-65 myself. I guess I was just expecting something similar when I saw a snare potion... all/all, cost a bit high for use all the time but less than gate potions, effect: snare (4min).</div></div><hr />

Maddoc, it's AWESOME to hear that you're introducing new ways to skill up expensive skills.  <br />
<br />
It's AWESOME to hear that you're also not objected to tradeskilled-results selling back for just under the cost of the components.<br />
<br />
I'm quite encouraged to hear this.  I just hope it spreads from Alchemy, and into other skills as well.  <br />
<br />
....<br />
On a similar note, (and I'm VERY sorry for the hijack),  was the reduction of the Flame Bolt (tinkering recipe) trivial by 100 intentional?  Seems like it might have been a nice skillup path, but with the last patch, it's been knocked down by a hundred.<br />

I'm going to take a look at the prices on these things too - Someone mentioned they were 11p to make, which wasn't the intent.<br />
<br />
They're supposed to be closer to 1-5p (depending on the tier), so that they're actually cost-effective to use as well.<br />
<br />
-- Maddoc <br />
<br />
While this is truely a wonderful new item type you have designed, if these are really supposed to cost 1-5p, and people are actually supposed to be able to purchase them from their local shaman, then it is recommended that they become stackable like Quintessence of Knowledge or other craftable items.  This is because the oportunity cost of selling a 5p potion for even 25p or 50p is to high when you consider the markup and profit margins on other potions.  The selling of even one 10-dose gate potion could easily compete with the profits of selling 80 of these new potions which would take up every vendor slot compared to the one slot needed for the gate potion.  The ability to stack these in lots of 20 would facilitate the needs of the marketplace so that the product would become desireable not only to the client but to the manufacturer as well.<br />
<br />
There are also added benifits to the end user, should these be made stackable, that would promote the use of this new and inventive type of item.  End users would be able to place stacks of them in the ranged slot allowing for increased space management and weight reduction due to the effects of weight based on stacking.  Additionally a stack in the ranged slot would allow the person using the potions to execute subsequent tosses without the combersome task of manipulating inventory screens while in the midst of combat.  I'm sure that you can agree it would be distracting and dangerous to run from a mob while attempting to execute an item transfer from inventory.  This hazard alone is compelling enough to many people who currently disregard the creation of these unique items that they would otherwise be using them.<br />
<br />
While I am certain that my views on making all potions into single dose stackable items would be frowned upon by some people.  In the case of these new potions; however, which you have put so much effort into developing, I can't forsee an plausable arguement against the change that is not easily countered.<br />
<br />
Do consider changing them.<br />
Thanks.<br />

<br />
Thank you for the new UI to help reduce wrist strain.  It was so much easier to just buy the components, not have to worry about which container they were in and click the combine button.<br />
<br />
I had been dreading what to do for skill ups and this was a GREAT solution.  The blow-up rate was a bit high, but then, I was trying to make something 60 points above my skill when I started so I can't complain.  Well, I could complain, but it wouldn't do any good and would only give the flea orchestra a chance to practice. :cool: <br />
<br />
I don't know if there are similar plans for the other tradeskills about the costs for skill ups at the higher skill levels, but I love the one done for alchemy.  This makes me a lot more willing to brew up the other more expensive potions since I made it to my level cap.<br />

Also, the unfinished Tribunal Initiate quest gave as its first (and only) item a necklace that summoned throwing hammers.<br />
<br />
One of the shamans on the Crucible said that to use the potions they had to have an empty ammo slot and then equip the potion in the range slot.  I haven't experimented with it myself.<br />
<br />
It would be very helpful for shamans, as well as other casting classes that might want to use these potions, to be allowed to train their throwing skill up to some low cap, say 100, so that the potions could be used.  Rogues wouldn't really need the potions I wouldn't think because they have a snare poison don't they?<br />

May I reiterate that in order to really make these potions viable to all classes, that somehow they be coded to be stackable in the manner which other thrown items are.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Cleat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Yes..A shaman can throw...load the potion into ur range slot and click on the actions hotkeys and you will see a 'range attack' there and you will throw it if you press that key. But of course, if your a great shaman you have some really  nice item in that slot. Also when I shaman throws these potions, their range is almost at melee agro. Point here is I think these potions aren't ment for us shamans, but made for those wonderful zerkers to throw. I wish they stacked, but I did make a few of them and gave them to my new zerker and they worked great. Whem my shaman threw them, the snare and the stun didnt work, but when my zerker threw them, they did work /shrug!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, berserkers already have axes that they acquire in tomes that snare and have similar effects.  I really don't think that the developers intended them to replicate effects that berserkers already have.<br />
<br />
Note that Maddoc posted this above: &quot;1. These are meant for everyone, not just the soloing shaman . Rogues, Berserkers, and other classes able to throw well will likely want these.&quot; (italics added for emphasis)  To me this means that they are intended for all classes, including shamans.  They were meant to be a nice, marketable item that has a useful effect for casters and melees alike.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the problem is that the potions were coded to work like  berserker axes, but the coding for berserker throwing is different from that for other classes due to the central role that axe throwing plays in defining their abilities.  If this is so, the solution might have something to do with recoding the throwing algorithms of all classes to be consistent with that of berserkers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Verileah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Hi all, this is my first post but I've been lurking for a bit :).<br />
<br />
I'm excited about these new potions and pleased with how they're coming along. Frankly, I was kind of unimpressed with GoD until I heard shamans could now make grenades! It's what sold me on buying the expansion :).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I had an idea to put on the table and wanted to hear your opinions on it. <br />
<br />
Many posters have already mentioned that they would like to see the potions stack. It's my opinion, and I get the impression that the devs agree with me here, that stacking would make them a bit overpowering, and I think it takes away from the intention of these potions. My suggestion to solve the unwanted &quot;side effects&quot; of unstackable thrown potions is to have a range slot item designed specifically for thrown potions; sort of a grenade launcher. A basic launcher could be made by tailoring, say a five or ten slot container that launches the potions when you hit the range hotkey. Nicer launchers with stats could be made by more advanced tailors or through a combination of tailoring and alchemy. Super duper launchers could be dropped by raid-level mobs. The super duper ones could have a throwing skill mod and excellent stats.<br />
<br />
I'd really like to know what y'all think of this :). This would help solve the problem of not having sufficient room for potions and take away some of the tedium of having to reload your range slot every time you would like to use a potion.<br />
<br />
Oh, and of course I don't think it should be called a launcher ;). That was just the first name I thought of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Tinkers make a catapult, yes?<br />
<br />
My idea, to expand on the aboive 'launcher':   combine catapult + 5 snare potions in a bearskin bag (or toolbox) to great a 5-charge expendable snare item (range/ammo slot - must equip to use)<br />
<br />
This will enhance the market for the snare potions, and create a market for the catapults - since the catapults will poof after the last charge is used, it’s yet another consumable.<br />
<br />
Just a thought, anyways.</div></div><hr />

If you are able to throw them let me know what you doing and I will try it, but if you just saying you can and haven't tried then don't post.  :)  As far as I know right now shamans can't use this yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>ZealSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">what is range? if distance is like some of the throwing weapons with 45 feet, which is just outside melee but too close to shoot a bow, that explains range difficulty. a ranged snare item that cost 1-5pp would be really useful in pvp, especially for melee classes that are at a disadvantage at lower levels.  I'm wondering if my paladin can use these, and if he can what is the chance of the potion hitting an enemy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Iboric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Maddoc is there any plan on giving throwing to some of the classes now that don't have it?  I imagine Mages got it so they could throw the items they summoned..  Now that shamans can make items that require throwing to work is it the Dev's plan to let us and other classes use the skill.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Maddoc, I know what his problem is with the range item.  He has a non-throwing item in the ammo slot still.  I get this problem when I try to throw my daggers when I still have my Gauze Press in ammo slot.  If he clears out the ammo slot and puts the potion in range, it will throw just fine.<br />
<br />
But this brings up yet another issue.  Who, in there right mind, is going to have the time to swap out their range item for a potion, clear the ammo slot, then click THROW when a mob is running?  This little tidbit makes these potions **useless** as a situational tool.  They don't stack.  They don't autofeed.  They are junk.  Pure, simple junk and atm only serve as a skill-up path.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Iboric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Well I must assume that your a mage or a class with throwing..  Becasue you say in the above you have daggers..  We us shamans dont have that skill..  I have never tried to throw anything in my life but do know yes it has to be in the ammo slot and yes you have to click the ranged attack button..  I know how to play my char and many others and I know this doesnt work..  I have tied it with a cleric also..  If you class has throwing you can use it..  If you think what I am saying is wrong try it..  make a level 1 character that doesnt have throwing and I bet it never works..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Iboric, the potion needs to be in your *RANGE* slot to throw.  Wether you have the skill or not means bupkiss, all it means is that you will most likely never hit.  Now,  if you have a non-autofeed item in range slot, your *AMMO* slot needs to be empty.<br />
<br />
Yes, I have a rogue.  I throw stuff.  Wanna know what?  If I put one of these snare potions in range and leave my gauze press in ammo slot, I get the ***EXACT SAME MESSAGES*** you get, either to close or to far, no matter the range.  Try it, put a potion in range, empty the ammo slot.  You will be able to throw it.<br />
<br />
If you think what I am saying is wrong try it.. make a level 1 character that doesnt have throwing and I bet it never works.. <br />
<br />
My god, wonder of wonders.  I did indeed try it.  Made a level 1 barbie shaman.  Gave her some Sambata Boulders.  Equiped one in range slot.  Put a fishing bait in the ammo slot.  &quot;You are to far away&quot; followed by &quot;You are to close&quot;...  But lo and behold, as soon as I took the bait out of the ammo slot, it worked!  (and I imediatly got pummeled by the guard I clonked with the rock)  You are the one that might want to test more before griping and trying to call someone out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Iboric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Slippyblade, I would first like to say I am sorry..  I didn't see the part of your post that said to remove the item from the AMMO slot.  You are in fact 150% right!!  Once I removed the two items I had in my AMMO and RANGE slots I was able to put the potion in my RANGE slot and throw it.  I totally 100% agree with you..  If we have to remove TWO items just to throw this one potion I don't think they will be used at all.  Maybe a low level char could snare or nuke a mob but I am sure there is something in the code to prevent that.   <br />
<br />
Maddoc, as Silppyblade said I above I don't think anyone will use these other than for skill ups..  I was really happy that we got new potions but don't think anyone would want to use these..  Please try to make them more player friendly..  Maybe a special bag that could auto feed them or something..  If you have heard of anything that might be in the works please let us know. <br />
<br />
Again Silppyblade I am sorry your all over this problem and Maddoc thanks for posting.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Iboric, sorry for my venom, I spend a lot of time on the Newbie Zone forums and get very jaded and tend to respond to everything as if it were a flame.

<br />
These potions do need some tweaking though to be useful.  Some suggestions are as follows.<br />
<br />
 Autofeed from inventory like daggers/arrows<br />
 Autofeed from ammo (though, with recent investigation in the fishing forums, ammo slot seems WAY more bugged than we ever thought.)<br />
 Short duration buff, ala rogue poisons, that affect the range slot<br />
 Or, at the least, make them stackable in the range slot.<br />
 <br />
<br />
I nearly wet myself when I first saw these potions.  Then tried played around with them in the Deep.  In the incarnation they are now, they are useless and will NEVER have a market.  There is simply to much effort involved to use one.  My only feasible option to use them practically is to sacrifice my GM Assassin's Seal permanently from my range slot and to leave my ammo slot empty, forgoing quick access to my proc poisons.  Never gonna happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Just another comment.  I used the snare 3 potion in LDoN (Everfrost) and Plane of Fire last night.  First problem was resists, I had 40% resist rate even after Malos.  Second problem was duration.  The effect wore off after of few ticks.  The longest I remember seeing was one that lasted almost a minute.<br />
<br />
Also, the snare potions I made could not be equipped in the ammo slot.  I could throw potions fine if my ammo slot was empty, or if I had a bola equipped in the ammo slot.  I'm assuming that any throwing item equipped in the ammo slot would work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Wyloc Wormwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">nice idea, but the way they are atm not stacking i wouldnt buy/use them as a rogue. even made into bolas they still wont stack (as standard bolas dont stack) so id have to dedicate a lot of bagspace for it.<br />
if they were made via makepoison then it would be of use, as rogues could make them while on the move, but ya know poisons never sell to players only vendors(theres a reason for it)<br />

anyway grats shammys on a great new skill up path, well done Madd.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">A couple notes:<br />
<br />
1. These are meant for everyone, not just the soloing shaman. Rogues, Berserkers, and other classes able to throw well will likely want these. <br />
<br />
2. Stackability is not currently an available option for thrown items with effects.<br />
<br />
5. Not sure what you mean -- As with most other poitions, the amount of snare that it gives off is largely dependent on your level. I'll look at this and see if there's a bug somewhere with it. <br />
<br />
-- Maddoc<br />
<br />
1) Of the throwing classes mentioned, a level 10 Berserker has a snare that uses 1 stackable axe directly from inventory.  Rangers can cast snare.  Is the market dependent on soloing rogues?  ARE there any soloing rogues? <br />
<br />
2) No doubt technically correct - but Berzerkers can stack the axes they need for their snare.  And rangers don't need regents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Aerinha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Well, it looks like I will be finally trying to make the snare potions with my shaman, for my rogue to try. <br />
This week my rogue was in a LDoN with two snaring classes...and the mobs were still running (I am too spoiled with having a main that is a ranger; the mobs shouldn't run, they should stand there and let you pound on them! ). The group in question had many problems:we were all cursed within 5 min of going in as the bard and cleric both would not leave the boxes alone, the bard and the cleric made the chanter so mad he gated half an hour in, and as I said before, neither the bard, nor the other possible snarer were doing so(Tak dungeon. We didn't wipe, amazingly, though the bard got stomped once). We did fail the mission with 5 more to go.<br />
Anyways...the lack of snare was so frustrating, in addition to everything else, that having a way to deal with at least that part would be nice(even if it does take up too much bag space. I don't generally ML for the groups). Unfortunately, there is no way for me to fix the other problems...the problem children will either learn, or not.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Hail Maddoc,<br />
<br />
Anything being worked on to fix the problems mentioned?  It has been over 2 months since the last reply to this thread, and almost 5 months since your last post on the subject.  :( <br />
<br />
We have stackability concerns (for both Trader inventory and bag space in the field), utility concerns (have to remove both range AND ammo slot items to toss one concoction), and price concerns (you said they should be cheaper to manufacture, around 1-5pp instead of up to 11pp).  Additionally, the lack of an auto-feed capability makes these extremely cumbersome to use in combat, ESPECIALLY if the thrower has a capped skill of ONE and will likely miss with their first shot.<br />
<br />
Instead of just griping, I'd like to offer some recommendations.<br />
<br />
1.  Copy the code from the berserker's level 10 snare effect throwing axe.  Then give the item a potion graphic, and make it all/all.  This should take the least amount of programmer work I'd imagine instead of rewriting the existing concoction code into something that works.  This would also solve the stackability &amp; auto-feed issues I believe, knocking out 4 birds with one stone (sic ;) ), making the potions functional, marketable, and usable.<br />
<br />
2.  Talk to the other Devs and see about giving all classes that don't already have decent throwing skill a new level cap of 75.  If you want to adjust the skill by race/class/etc, I think that would be fine.  I can't imagine a barbarian throwing worse than a high-elf from a roleplaying perspective, but it really wouldn't bother me if everyone currently capped at 1 could toss these with a max 75 throwing skill.<br />
<br />
3.  You mentioned the prices may not be correct.  Maybe look into that. :D <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>The Judge, Alchem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">IMO these potions were not intended on being used for just throwing.  We, as Shamans, do not make the Berserker, we make the Berserker better.<br />
<br />
Introduce: Concussive Bola (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=11681&amp;menustr=080110230000)<br />
<br />
Now after looking at this recipe I have got curious about Ensnaring Bolas and if they exist.  With this potion line I think we were able to &quot;beef&quot; up the legitimacy of the Berserker as a utility in a group.  The ability to be able to max throwing skill beyond the expectations of other classes will of course introduce new damage capabilities.  There are no recipes for an Ensnaring Bola but I will try on MT tonight to experiment.<br />
<br />
I can think of a few scenarios where these would be helpful, not realistically tide-turning material, but usefull none the less.<br />
<br />
Example:  Ranger and Berserker in group.  Berserker has taken a range approach to the group damage output.  Ranger doesn't get Snare off and Berserker throws these in his ammo slot and wails one to stop it from going into oncoming traffic.  It either stuns long enough to burn it down or Ensnares it  to stop forward motion.  <br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">I think there's some confusion as to how the berzerker snare works here. It's not the item. He's not lying when he's saying it's impossible to add effects to stacked items. Rogues have been asking to be able to throw poisoned daggers for a long time and it's still as impossible now as it was then. The reason berzerkers can snare is because it's a combat ability that uses a normal axe that has no procs as a reagent much as a peridot can be used for rune or virtue. Just the same as a spell, if the berzerker doesn't hit the snare attack button it doesn't matter how much he hits the mob with his axes, it won't snare.<br />
<br />
That being said, these items aren't of much use as they are. I appreciate the intent behind them, it's much appreciated. But the implementation leaves both this and bolas as little more than toys for my rogue. Nothing stacks, nor can any of these items summon the non-stacking items when and as they are needed and the duration is quite short on the snare potions. It's easier and more reliable to just carry a snare proc weapon and swap it in when needed.</div></div><hr />
