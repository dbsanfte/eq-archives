<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taushar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is not crying nerf but wanted to ask others about recent experience I had. I have been fishing for Cobalt Cods for a while doing tailoring. I go to CS bring a bunch of baits, usually minimun of 7-8 stacks and fish. I am 200 in fishing and have 3% mod fishing rod. <br />
<br />
Usually when I do it, I get about even number of the following: junk/fish scale, fresh fish, Dragon Bay Snapper and Cobalt Cods. I mean I would bring 8 stacks of bait and I would leave with 2 stacks each. Last time I went a few days ago, I ended up with only 15 Cobalt Cods. The rest were divided evenly. While I would think this is random occurance, I am not sure. Since there are two unique catched in CS, Dragon Bay Snapper and Cobalt Cod, I would have thought that both would be about even. I ended up with about 28 DBS and only 15 CC. Kind of made me think if they changed the rate on one of recent patches. I will have to go back and try again. <br />
<br />
I do realize that it's a small sample but has anyone else seen this change? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bearcaller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I never kept exact numbers but I've fished A LOT of cod out of the waters in CC (did tailoring wyvern hides).  It seems to me like you were having better than average luck before as my split for a stack of bait was usually (and these are averages)<br />
<br />
13 sandals/daggers/fresh fish/lost bait<br />
4-5 snapper<br />
2-3 cod</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>data9724</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I always had around 30% more snappers than cods, and more fresh fish and scales than fresh fish, so you just been lucky i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, I have fished in CS until my butt went numb. I usually end up with about twice as many snapper then cod. If they did change the mix on it, then it happened quite a while ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taushar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, thanks for the responses. I have been fishing a bit in CS, probably not as extensively as you guys, but I always had good ration on Cobalt Cods. I guess I was lucky in the past. I am going to have to adjust to the new ratio then. Thanks again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jora_Delossian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have always had an average of about 3-4 cods and twice as many snappers per stack of bait, with 200 fishing skill.<br />
<br />
I've never kept track, but I'd say I've burned through several thousand stacks of bait easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Solarax_Manastorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">im still new to fishing so i have like a 130 or so and i did all my fishing in CS and so far i have gotten about twice as many cod as snapper which im really happy about as my goal is wyvern masks.<br />
i think it all depends on the luck of the draw because i see people posting both ways.<br />
<br />
it goes up pretty quick so far . will it slow down tremendously like other trade skills once it hits the 183-188 mark?</div></div><hr />
