<br />
Not sure I can be of much help, but if you expect 1 skillup every 30-40 combines, then it should get you to about 230-240 skill.<br />
<br />
I did the road from 177-250 entirely on solstice robes, until at 249 when I ran out of supplies.  Did 3 combines of arctic masks to get the final point.<br />
I got to 225 before the &quot;slightly easier&quot; patch, but it seems that after that patch, I was getting 2 or 3 skillups in a run, but you could also attribute this to the fact that I was succeeding a lot.<br />
<br />
So I would say go for it, see how far you get, and then farm some more :)  You could get lucky and go all the way :) Rootin for ya!</div></div><hr />

I agree with Alyxia, use that stuff up and see where you are before you invest much time or money in getting more attempts.  That should get you close :)<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

got from 211 - 218 : ( man am I depressed<br />
<br />
and to make it worse i have a but load of crappy robes i cant even give away :(<br />
<br />

Good luck for your next lot of combines and if you need any help just send me a tell.<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alkee</div><div class="date">02-12-2003, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally decided to go for it as no room left in bank.<br />
Had a total of 867 combines on arctic wyvern masks.<br />
Wisdom 252.<br />
Raised tailoring from 206 to 224<br />
Only made 5 masks!!!!  Weird.<br />
Not as high as I would have like, but are getting closer to 250. Looks like I'm going to have to do about the same amount of combines again :(<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verdandi</div><div class="date">02-12-2003, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gah!!<br />
<br />
Remind me to leave tailoring last on my list for taking to 250...*shudders*</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's like almost 50 combines per point...ouch!<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm glad I took tailoring to 250 first, but I'm suffering the pain that smithing brings :)  It will be the last skill I take to 250 :)<br />
<br />
But I do remember tailoring being painful.<br />
<br />
Keep your eyes focussed on the goal, and you'll get there soon!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alkee</div><div class="date">02-13-2003, 06:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your support, I won't be giving up anytime soon. I will be getting my fishermans companion next before I hit Cobalt Scar again, so I don't have to take any more fishing poles and will have extra room for bait.<br />
It will take me a while as I have to farm everything myself due to no cash.<br />
So probably in about 6 months I will have enough combines to hit 250.<br />
I have a great deal of respect for any 250 tailors out there, its a long hard road.<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />
