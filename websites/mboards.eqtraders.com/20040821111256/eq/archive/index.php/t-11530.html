<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>YurienStonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok i got impatient and went and bought every brewing book i could find on the site. made for a good read while selling halas pies in the baz. anyways a couple observations and questions.<br />
<br />
Brodder this is a question only you can answer i hope. in your third book you list the recipe for the underfoot brown. my question is you lsit the recipe as &quot; four ripe udnerfoot mushrooms )as grown in our farms in kaladim) bottle short beer (starter) , water, malt, and a CASK. Makes an Earthy brew loved by dwarves and halfling&quot; what exactly do you mean by a starter?<br />
<br />
<br />
ok now for the observations:<br />
<br />
one of your best friends is mentioned in the books although i couldn't find him on this site nor alla/illia, Catbink Tinkerton. thought maybe he could help. if he is hiding somewhere can you tell us where.  <br />
<br />
we don't need an aged oaken cask since you said dwarves liek to reuse them.  <br />
<br />
you also mention the use of fizzlepop which i can only find one recipe for yet you say it has many uses. <br />
<br />
so far it seems like the drink we need is : fizzlepop, aviak eggs, a garnish, a mug/container, hot sauce.<br />
<br />
<br />
now this is jsut what i ahve gathered from your diaries and from on the board. i also made a lsit of various things i could find for garnish both rl and in game :<br />
<br />
sage leaf<br />
allspice<br />
euclutpys leaf<br />
clover<br />
fruit<br />
emerald orange<br />
orange juice<br />
balm leaf<br />
lemon<br />
lime<br />
olive<br />
onion<br />
cherry<br />
celery<br />
mint<br />
pineapple<br />
nutmeg<br />
<br />
you also avoided a lot of cities (or near by). i noticed you didn't mention cabalis, erudin, halas, paineel, rivervale, and thurg. you diary starts in ak`anon with Catbink then goes to felwithe,kelethin, and kaladaim then back to ak`anon. you traverse to lavastorm (neriak) , grobb, oggork.  i'm guessing that book two has a couple of these cities, i would venture to guess it would prolly be rivervale because of you mention the aged oaken casks and going from grobb-oggork-neriak-rivervale-fp-kelethin-felwithe-ak`anon-kaladim.<br />
<br />
<br />
with my luck i'm prolly wrong on everything but this is jsut what i've tried to decipher so far. so how right/wrong am i? :&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is &quot;garnish&quot; in game for sale on baking vendors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>YurienStonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i did a search for that a few minutes after i made the post and got garnish and kelp garnish heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What he means by 'starter' is a base to get the fermenting/brewing going again.  I get the distinct impression that Brodder has done some brewing in RL at some point.  Historically, it was common prectice to use the &quot;muck&quot; from prior brewing batches to get a new batch started.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yogurt as example<br />
the starter is a culture of the bacteria you want to grow often some older yogurt.  the reason is the bacteria will change the yogurt into something that wont spoil before the other bacteria spoil it.  lactobacili are lactose fermenting bacteria that make yogurt acidic and give it the sour taste unsweeetend.  bad bacteria dont grow well in acid so giving a good plop of good bacteria to make it acidic quickly will ensure that it doesn't spoil on you.  yogurt is rotten food. it just rotted the right way. :D i love yogurt.  microbiolgy 313ish i think for you.</div></div><hr />
