While it's probably not even 1% of your issues, I can't tell you how much of a pain it is to be known as one of the high end tradeskillers on my server... I get tells from a zillion ppl asking me for recipies all the time, or what skillup path they should take, or what good +Stat items they should get to tradeskill with, or.. or. .. or... so I can definately sympathize, even if only from a very relatively minor similar experience.</div></div><hr />
