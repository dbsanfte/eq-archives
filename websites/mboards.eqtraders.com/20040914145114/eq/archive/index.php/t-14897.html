<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>oakwood moonblaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is touched on in the FAQ, but I want to make sure I got it right.  When checking for skill ups, if my strength is higher than my wis/int, then the system totally ignores my wis/int?  I'll get the same results with str 200 &amp; int 195 as str 200 and int 55?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As far as I know, that is correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Some skills now make use of one of three stats, in the case of smithing it is EITHER Str, Wis, or Int what ever is highest. This number is only checked to manipulate the chance of getting a skill up. <br />
<br />
I think that Poison making, Fletching and Tailoring were all targeted to take advantage of Dex or Agil as well as Wis or Int but not sure if this ever went live.<br />
<br />
So yes if your Str is 255 and you Int is 3 you should see the same results as if your Str is 255 and your int is 178.</div></div><hr />
