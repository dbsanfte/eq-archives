<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>JMorgana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As I have just dinged the magical 210 smithing, I am now in the market for mass quantities of Bricks of Ethereal Energy.  If you have even a couple you'd like to toss my way, look me up.  Most of my play toons are Jmor-SOMETHING on Xegony.  I'm usually on between about 5:30 and midnight EST during the week and pretty much any time on the weekends.<br />

Thanks for everyone's help!!!</div></div><hr />
