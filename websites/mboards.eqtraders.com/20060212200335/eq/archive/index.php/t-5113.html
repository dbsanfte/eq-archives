The day finally came.  I soooo wanted to sleep last nite when I hit 1748, but my friend said 'GO FOR IT!!! I have 2k for you if you need it!&quot; heh<br />

Date 1750 Achieved: March 19, 2003 -- 23:40:58 PST <br />

That's not the end of the tradeskilling road for me :)  Still need to get 2 toons to 60, start tinkering with Gnomie Mage, maybe create a shammy and play her a bit to do Alchemy.  But Poison Making? Sorry, I'll leave that to the rogues...I can't do melee...I just can't :)<br />
<br />
P.S.  My guild is small, so I didn't ask them for any sponsorship at all.  I knew I could do it, and I know you all can too! :)  My guild and alliance thinks I'm crazy.  But who do they call when they need something? YUP! MEEEE! :D<br />

It's really cool to see people so excited about trade skills.<br />
<br />
And yes, I also think you're crazy.  :D <br />
I have know Physt since before Physt was born, and I told him he was crazy too! Although he was gracious enough to make a tailored-made straight jacket for me, so I won't catch the madness!<br />

Perhaps something best appreciated by fellow tradeskillers.  Congrats!<br />
