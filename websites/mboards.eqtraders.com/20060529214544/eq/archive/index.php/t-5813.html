<br />
Being my main tradeskiller a druid, is easy to have my WIS maxed for combines, in order to make the skill-ups more frequent. But my rogue is not a WIS or INT caster and i was wondering if i should invest in WIS or INT gear to make te combines for skill ups or if is there another STAT used instead of WIS or INT to check skill-ups.<br />
<br />
Any help would be aprecieted  :D <br />
<br />
P.S.: And forgive my english, I have it at 120 or so atm  :D</div></div><hr />

That being said, IMO it is easier to suit up for WIS, at least for me , for a couple of reasons.<br />
1. My Rog...err Scout &amp;lt;hehe&gt; is a Wood Elf, and as such,already had a higher WIS than INT.<br />
2. For example take player made stat rings, a velium amber ring is +7 wis, while a velium rose, &lt;star rose&gt;, is +5 int. Switching out WIS rings as compared to INT rings gives you 4 more points.<br />
<br />
This is all new too me, my Scout is wee as of yet, but I have been wondering these same things myself, if you or anyone else has more info I would like to hear that as well.<br />
<br />
Good luck and watch your back hehe,<br />

Whether it made much difference I have no idea.<br />
<br />
I, too, have heard that DEX is a secondary stat for Make Poison but I'm not in a position to confirm that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">04-08-2003, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wis is much easier to raise, so unless your race heavily favors int (gnomes start out about 40 points ahead in int, for instance), go with that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arcturos</div><div class="date">04-09-2003, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find that I have much better skill up rates with my DEX at 154 than without it.  As a HE rogue WIS and INT are entirely gimped (80 or less).  But for Poison Making I keep a DEX suit.  I went from 146 to 170 on a total of roghly 100 combines.  That is roughly 1 skill up per 4 combines.  <br />
<br />
Compared to Pottery going from 187 to 188 took over 80 combines with INT 75 and WIS 80.</div></div><hr />

DEX is a primary stat here, not a secondary like for tailoring.<br />
<br />
Which stat you prefere is your own choice. I don't go for DEX as I need INT or WIS for the other tradeskills anyway. In the WIS vs. INT question I went for INT, since I think it's more fun to play a rogue with more INT than some wizzes or chanters ;o)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gargazon</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 05:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not all trade skills use int or wisdom, smithing uses int, wisdom OR str for example. Whichever is highest, and I think fletching uses dex the same way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">splunge</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because rogues are a chain class, and the other 2 chain classes are WIS based (Ranger and Shaman) there is far more armor out there for rogues with WIS then INT on it. <br />
Rogues: go WIS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tokensmoke</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can assure U that dex has nothin to do with poison making..I thought so one day too.  Very nice dex (217 without buffs).  I tried to make poisons without my wis gear and i failed soo many times.  Threw my wis gear back on and got a C3, and I was combining Advances poisons 75% of the time.  Also, my MP skill is 247 with 5% ontop of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niech</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 01:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So it sounds like the higher WIS helped with Success rate, but does that mean it will help with Skill Ups too?  Or does the higher Dex help with Skill Ups?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is incorrect.   Urban-EQ-Legend.  False. <br />
<br />
Stats never determined success-rate.  Only skill.   I don't want to seem harsh, but this is the kind of thing that leads people to endless gnashing of teeth and frustration. <br />
<br />
The link I posted above is correct. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GremlinClr</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, Im stubborn and since Im building a dex suit for fletching anyway, Im not gonna invest in a wis suit as well.  ;) <br />
<br />
How bad could it be? :shock:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daareon Ravenstar</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 01:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I struggled with PM for some time. Couldnt get nearly high enough Wisdom with Wis gear and KEI and spent a long time grinding through 180-190 (no skill points to spend)<br />
<br />
Instead I moved to Dex gear, Got a bunch of Dex buffs off friendly shamans and saw an imediate improvement in my rate of skillup.<br />
<br />
Some people may poo-poo Dex, but from my own experience it has had a significant impact on the number of combines per skillup. Perhaps as high as 15% when jumping from 150 to 255 and combining SoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GremlinClr</div><div class="date">07-20-2003, 01:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As we all know, SOE has updated the character creation pages so newbies know what stat does what. This is straight from the horses(SOEs) mouth under the DEX attribute:<br />
<br />
Tradeskills: If your dexterity is higher than your intelligence or wisdom, it determines how quickly you gain skill in Fletching and Make Poison.<br />
<br />
So there ya go, no more arguing about it. The matter is closed.  :D</div></div><hr />

They just might get me back if they keep this stuff up.... ;)</div></div><hr />
