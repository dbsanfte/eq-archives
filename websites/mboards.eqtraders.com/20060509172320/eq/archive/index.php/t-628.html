<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sennes</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 05:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nabren's Novelties has a long standing tradition of many mechanical marvels. First to bring collapsed tradeskill containers to the bazaar, first to bring Anizok devices to the bazaar, the only tinker with a  complete supply of geerloks at all times, the only tinker to stock mechanical lock picks and fishing poles.<br />
<br />
Nabren's Novelties is your one stop shop for all your tinkering needs. If Nabren doesn't have it, he'll go make it at once. No mucking about with tink twinks and guild traders that don't know their gears from their cogs, but instant expert customer service.<br />
<br />
Don't settle for anything less than a product of Nabren's Novelties. There be many second rate tinkers about these days, selling many second rate clunkers that don't work half the time and blow up in your face. But a product from Nabren is product for life.<br />
<br />
Visit Nabren's Novelties just outside the stables or contact Nabren directly.</div></div><hr />
