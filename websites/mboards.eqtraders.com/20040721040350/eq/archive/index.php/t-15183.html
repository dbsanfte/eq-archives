<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have 70 Training points in my pool. If I work on Tailoring and Pottery (and yes Fishing to make Blessed Fishing Poles)......at which point should I add 20 Training Points to Tailoring and Pottery. I dont want to waste them.<br />
At which point did all of you add the points?<br />
My Forage is only at 101 and I am a Wood Elf Druid......I was considering adding all 70 points to Forage so I could be more self sufficient in obtaining Foraged items needed for tradeskills.<br />
At lvl 55 I should have a higher Forage.....so do you think I should add all 70 to Forage instead?<br />
Are Foraged items needed for most Trade Skills?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Annalina Romanov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">With the seven standard tradeskills, you cannot use Training Points to advance the skill higher than 20. If your rating in a tradeskill is 21 or higher, you're going to need to do &quot;skill-ups&quot; like the rest of us.<br />
<br />
Trust me . . . I would have had maxed out Blacksmithing a looooooooong time ago if I could use Training Points to get up there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mewkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Regarding tailoring, I wouldn't bother putting training points into it till you're done with making silk swatches. Those are NoFail combines and will get your skill up to 15 and you're gonna need a bunch of them, so you might as well get skill ups on them while you can. If you don't want to waste your training points, then I probably wouldn't bother spending them on tradeskills. The cost to skill your way up to 20 (which is the highest you can use your points to get to as Annalina said) is so minimal that it doesn't make it worth it to spend the points. I'd recommend saving those training points for one of your other skills where you can spend it to top them off instead of just starting them off like with tradeskills. Later in life it can get risky to try to build up your defensive skill.</div></div><hr />

I think we'd all be 1750 / 2000 / 2255 club members if we could.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Since you're not an Int caster, I'd suggest that you split them between Fishing and other tradeskills you want to do in the future than aren't already 20 or higher. Or Fishing and different languages, maybe.<br />
<br />
(If you were an Int caster, I'd recommend going 20 Fishing/50 Research)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think I will add my 70 available Training points to Foraging.<br />
I am lvl 55 Wood Elf Druid and I am embarrassed to admit my Forage Skill is only 101.<br />
Since this skill moves so slowly for me and I need Foraged items for Tradeskills.......................I figure I could be at Skill 178 within a few minutes.<br />
Does anyone think this is a good idea? How expensive would that be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cinaed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Man, wouldn't that be nice..bein able to blow some of those practice points I have no use for on tradeskills after 21.  *drool*  You'd think that Verant would come up with /some/ way to use those, lord knows after like..level 35 or so, most people don't use 'em.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't waste them on Forage though, since it's a skill you can use so often, my wood elf druid maxed his out without me even concentrating on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>vovinit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have over 70 points banked. you know what would be a good idea is to say be able to exchange those points for leadership points.. like 10 points for 1 leadership point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Save em for something useful. The first 20 points in any tradeskill take very little time or plat... its not worth wasting them lik that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Solarax_Manastorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">save em for something else and dont put them in fishing either as fishing is soooo easy to skill up .<br />
if you want to skill up fishing and your not kos dragon or if you can invis ad get a tl to CS do your skill ups there and save the cobalt cod you catch ( make sure your food is the first slot and not the cod because it is edible )<br />
<br />
the cod are great for later on when you want to do wyvern masks</div></div><hr />

I very strongly disagree with this.  Forage can go up very quickly.  Do you have it hot keyed and mapped to one of your movement keys?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I will try the Forage on my own as advised.........any idea what I could use the 70 Training points for?<br />
Do most of you have lots of Training points saved with no current use for them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">After a while, you do tend to end up with more training points than you can use.  My ranger (level 55), however, has 0 ATM.  His archery was lagging behind a bit, and I dumped the last 5 I had into it.  On the other hand, my mage has more than you can shake a brance of sylvan oak at.<br />
<br />
Be sure to map the forage to one of your arrow keys.  This way, you'll forage ever time you turn left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dalur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Like other said, don't waste your points on foraging.<br />
<br />
IF you really want to get a bonus for foraging, do the foraging machete quest.  Only takes a few hours - http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7936<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Benthair Dunthat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">For intelligence casters, the guys that can do research, use those points to max out research skill. To the best of my knowledge, research is the only &quot;skill&quot; that allows you to use points through the 250 level. So do combines up to a point then dump your training points in to max out. Went from 219 to 250 in minutes that way with my chanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">However, do put one point in each. But otherwise, save'em. The first 20 points in any TS is too easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Galain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The first 52 (or is it 54) points in any tradeskill are now free with GoD.  Just do the combine quests in Abysmal to get thos free skill ups.  Just remember to not hand in the 4th set of combines until you hit the trivial.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Isn't the limit 200 on Research skill? I know I couldn't get my 57 chanter higher than that when buying skill-ups for Research at the GM...</div></div><hr />

the other day, a friend and I both put 1 point into Elder Dragon lang.<br />
<br />
we grouped, created hotkeys that used all 5 lines, (i'm a bard, ok, i can't edit my sig to update it), i sang a song that add +13 wis/int, and we spammed eachother for about 20-30 minutes. We both now have 100 elder dragon, and i only spent 1 point into it.</div></div><hr />

There you go.<br />

Rather easy and quick - as a side effect you can work your own taelosian rocks too (think I butchered the spelling!)</div></div><hr />

Hmmmmm great idea!<br />
<br />
I always wanted to speak Elder Dragon... heheheh<br />
<br />
I wasn't aware that you could teach other folks above what your skill was.  But, meh, if this works, cool!<br />
<br />
Time to hit the :bookworm: <br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>vizzie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You can teach someone in a language to 1 point higher than your skill. So, once someone equals your skill level, you can learn another point from them, and so on.<br />
<br />
It used to be you had to zone after each point to &quot;register&quot; the change and let you proceed, but now you can do it all without zoning.</div></div><hr />

Actually you can put as many points into Fletching as you like. As far as I know this is the only tradeskill you can put points into above 21</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you can, it's a bug, and a recent one at that.  You can put training points into Research and Fishing all the way up, I have not tested Alchemy or Poison Making.</div></div><hr />

This worked as recently as last month and as far back as two and a half years that i am personally aware of.</div></div><hr />
