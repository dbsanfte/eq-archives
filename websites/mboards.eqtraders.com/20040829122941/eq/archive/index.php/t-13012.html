<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kingpen036</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seems like a waste of money and time to master fletching to 250 since it is very hard to find the main components used to make the bow strings.. Fletching is alot of work and costly and I think the string components should be more readily available.  :steamed:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I presume you are talking about the components for high-end PoP bows?  In that case, for ANY tradeskill there are darn-near-impossible-to-find components required to make the 'good' PoP items.<br />
<br />
I think EQ intended it that way so that the items don't become so common they end up being a dime a dozen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well the other &quot;good&quot; bows are karana or tunare restriction bd cultural.  just as available as other bd cultural meaning a pain in the butt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kingpen036</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't want to see the PoP bows &quot; a dime a dozen&quot; either. But don't you think 90-120k for an Obsidianwood on Karana server is a bit ridiculous? It's because of the rarity of the bow string componenets that keeps the price driven that high. If I spent all this time fletching and spending 80k+ to get my skill up, I want to be able to make something descent myself. Otherwise your forced to raid a zone to (hopefully) get a bow string component to drop. A person of lower levels shouldn't be penalized for mastering their tradeskill. I'm 65 and it's still a pain.:hyper:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>FentFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">All of the higher end POP bows have a required level of 61 on them anyway.</div></div><hr />
