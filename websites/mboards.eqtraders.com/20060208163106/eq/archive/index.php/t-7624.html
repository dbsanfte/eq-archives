just wanted to post here that swirling shadows on Saryrn are way overpriced most of the time...<br />
Everyone knows (or may know...) that these are used just for skill ups in smithing...<br />
<br />
In average, every smith needs about 20 combines to get 1 skill up.<br />
You need 2 swirling shadows (at least) for each combine. So you need 40 swirling shadows for each skill up (if you're not too unlucky with RNG).<br />
<br />
Prices are now going from 60pp to 150pp per swirling shadow!!!<br />
60x40=2400!<br />
150x40=6000! , yes 6000pp for 1skill up!!!<br />
<br />
Now imagine a smith wanting to skill up through shadowscream armor from skill 188 to skill 240... You need 52 skill ups...<br />
6000x52=312000 pp!!! Ouch!!!<br />
<br />
Seeing people selling 200+ swirling shadows at 150pp each is just, well, a waste of ingredients...<br />
<br />
Maybe when i get close to 240 skill, i'll be ready to pay like 1k pp per skill up.... nothing more than that...<br />
If swirling shadows were sold 25pp each, you could start making money...<br />
