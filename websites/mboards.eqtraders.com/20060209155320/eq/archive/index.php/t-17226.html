<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chip194</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 03:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My server in the past month has had a total of only 2 (!) faithstones (one of which is my diety and I would like it for my 51+ cleric) at 20k each.  Needless to say, neither has sold.<br />
<br />
I have a 0 skill in pottery, however from what I've gathered (going back several pages on this forum), I could dump some 500p+ to raise pottery to 200. Grab a gearlock. And I have perhaps a 1 in 10 chance at successfully creating a faithstone, at some 300pp+ a pop. (This is based on a 200 skill doing 2 faithstones in 14 tries, I'm aware this doesnt mean an average, your thoughts on the reality of this happening??) <br />
<br />
Understandably theres a bit of time involved skilling up, and obtaining (that which cant be found in the bazaar) some items, however even at a 1 in 30 chance at 200+gearlock skill I'd save half (from the bazaar price of 20k).<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what my question is, other then I seek re-assuredness of what else if anything I am overlooking.  Thanks for any input, I'm not new to eq, but totally new to eq crafting.<br />
<br />
A personal Faithstone is my goal. And I cant help but think I'm overwhelming defying the odds and saving myself a lot of dough by crafting it and not spending 20k in bazaar.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any tips/insight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maisie</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what server are you on?<br />
<br />
if mine, I would gladly make you one for cost.<br />
<br />
would be easier on you, I honestly wouldnt recommend doing pottery for just a faithstone, if you want to do it cause you like crafting sure but for just a faithstone, I say go to the marketplace forum for your server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Obina</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 08:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't suggest skilling up for one item, nor trying hard items at low skills.  The RNG may be in a real bad mood.  (But pottery is lovely so I encourage you to learn the art)<br />
<br />
I make and sell faithstones/spiritstones all the time on my server (for 1.4k).  But I never keep them in stock.  There are too many.  I just make to order.<br />
<br />
I suggest you either /auc in POK for a GM potter to do a combine (have the raws ready especially the zone essence).  Or ask any of the traders in the bazaar selling e.g Golden Idol of Tunare or Star Ruby Encrusted stein if they are GM potter who will do the combine.<br />
<br />
You could also look on your server area on this board to see if there is a GM potter looking for work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chip194</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the replies both of you.<br />
<br />
I'm on Morden Rasp, so prices and hi level crafters seem a bit out of whack.<br />
<br />
My server board on eqtraders is a bit barren, but I'll advertise there as well as in pok and bazaar.  <br />
<br />
Re-studying, there really is a ton of faithstones, and it didnt really occur to me most potters would probably make them on a per order basis and not just chuck up random ones on their /trader.  Still. It seems like theres good profit potention for these.  But I'll auction for a GM potters help, I'll definitely grab a few zone essences first.</div></div><hr />

I'm also on MR.  In my guild there are a few GM potters (I am not one yet).  One person you can send a tell to that will make one for you for a very good price is Faendrill.  I can't speak for him but I know his prices are very reasonable.<br />
<br />
I'll tell him to expect the tell.  He normally plays in the early evening till when ever.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zephaus</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 07:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only Dwarf, High Elf, Dark Elf, and Mith Marr stones sell regularly.  Gnome ones may sell over time.  And strange human or erudite dieties almost never sell.  That's why you don't see many stocked :)</div></div><hr />

Typically ones that I think are more likely to sell.  But I occasionally get tells to my trader asking for another deity and I'm happy to make those to order.<br />
<br />
I sell mine for 1.5K each.  I can't imagine trying to sell one from 20K!  :boggled:</div></div><hr />

<br />
How many sets of materials do you need? What I've studied its about a 40 to 45% chance of success at skill 250. (I figured 3 sets?)<br />
<br />
Also do you have a brewer? The zone essence requires some 122 trivial brewing skill.  If not, I'll take care of that beforehand. Thanks again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lothay</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Moved to the appropriate server forum. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">YurienStonebow</div><div class="date">07-18-2004, 02:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">jsut curious....looking at what they do and what they cost, is there any real need for one with pok books being near every zone and most anybody can find a gg/tl to whereever? jsut seems like a lot of money to spend on something that isn't needed that much especially for gate type classes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maisie</div><div class="date">07-18-2004, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a cleric and I can give you my example of why they are great. <br />
<br />
Say you are raiding in an out of the way place, for example a Mistmoore LDON way in Lfay. And you bind outside so in the case of wipes, you can run back in and rez. You spend the evening doing your thing, you get a TL to bind woot everythings great. all are back at thier bind point, which is for you, two steps away.<br />
<br />
NP you have your faithstone, use it to gate back to &lt; Rivervale in my case&gt; hop skip and jump to PoK book and a rebind spot.<br />
<br />
Having a faith/spiritstone gives you TWO bind locations, which can be very very useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">YurienStonebow</div><div class="date">07-18-2004, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 bind points....ok i can maybe see the benefit. are the amterials worth attempting to make a constant supply or is it jsut one in a million shot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Obina</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is a spell it has unlimited charges if that is your question.<br />
<br />
The materials are not that hard to get, but cost the 2 sapph mana vial, so it is not worth trying until quite skilled (240+ GL is ideal) if that is your question. <br />
<br />
I can tell you as a cleric faithstone is my single favourite item in game.  Now I always bind at the fight.  Sure there is often a TP home.  But not always.  Last night I was bound at Sebalis zone point.  No porter in group.  At end of session I faithstone it back to Erudin.  The tanks are hoofing it.  The wizzy and shammy (poor thing, no spirtitstone) gate back to PoK - they did not bind at zone because they knew I was there to rez them back if the worst happened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">YurienStonebow</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 02:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok so which ones should be made? never see any on my server for sale. the race/god combo would determine which has to be sold the most of since it would be a popular combo right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Obina</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I only make to order since they are slow sellers.  Since many cleric/shaman have not even heard of them, I sell them most when I /auc a description in trader mode.<br />
<br />
My top 3 sellers if you want to pre make are 1) HE/Tunare 2) Dwarf/Brell 3) Barbarian.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chip194</div><div class="date">08-03-2004, 03:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally got my Brell Faithstone a week or so ago.<br />
<br />
Everything was buyable in the /baz short of the zone essence. I just needed to fish for an hour (wanted extra incase of failures).<br />
<br />
Cost?  2k.<br />
<br />
I auctioned for a potter. Had enough for 4 tries. he was some 248 skill. He made it on the 2nd try. I let him keep the other 2 supplies for attempts and I tipped him 2k.  Total cost 4k.  <br />
<br />
Brell Faithstone still in /bazaar as of tonight. Still at 20k.  lol lord.</div></div><hr />
