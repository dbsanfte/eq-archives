<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ranvarin</div><div class="date">01-20-2003, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi I have been working on trying to make some leather padding but I have run in to the problem that it seems the silk to make the padding is a real pain to make. I have tried many zones and it seems as though I cant get a zone with very consistent drops in it. It feels as though I have tried every possible zone in the game. I see more beetles and snakes then I do spiderlings. So does anyone have any advice for me on a decent place to get the silks I need? Thanks for all the help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username"></div><div class="date">01-20-2003, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on your level....<br />
<br />
If you are over level 40, bazaar is by far the best place.  Usually 3pp for spiderling silk or so, and available in massive quantities.<br />
<br />
If you just need a few, I go to NRO zoneline (right by a wizzie spire), simply because no newbies ever seem to be there, so I don't feel like I am stealing their kills.<br />
<br />
Also still can /ooc WTB spiderling silk 20pp a stack and get hits in newbie zones, 20pp is a lot of money to someone under level 10 :).</div></div><hr />

Get a tracker and you can usually get a stack every 10 minutes.  Unless you are competing for spiderlings of course.  :)</div></div><hr />

Have you tried Everfrost, just at the entrance of Halas?<br />
I may be wrong, but it seems to me that it is by far the best place to make leather padding.<br />
Hords of spiderling and bears are literally flung to you.<br />
<br />
Take care</div></div><hr />

I will have to try the feerrott I have been spending some time in the bazaar and I have noticed that it will prolly be easier for me to just get them from there. The prices seem to range from 1pp-5pp each which is not bad. Thanks for all the help everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Araon</div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One zone has it all:  Shadeweaver's Thicket.<br />
<br />
Shadeling silk from the Xakra Silkworms and Lesser Shades which wander the low level areas and it sometimes also drops from the higher level Shak Dratha (mobs which mostly drop the unrelated Shade Silk).  The Xakra tend to spawn in waves, so sometimes there are a ton of them wandering around and sometimes none.<br />
<br />
All of the various hoppers throughout the zone drop rockhopper hides of varying quality, including high quality, even the needle claw hoppers which are quite low level.<br />
<br />
Kill the chitterlings as a bonus and make a tinkerer happy - the chitterling barbs are used in making tailoring geerloks and aren't easy to come by due to the relative scarcity of the mob.</div></div><hr />

Druids in wolf form are not bothered by the bouncers.  Bouncer Hurd was very helpful to my druid in her 20's when she would accidently pull too many Tae Ew lizards on the temple island.  She would run to Hurd and he would quickly smash the bad lizards.<br />
<br />
You can also mine the vendors as a wolf.  When my druid needs spiderling silk, she ports to the Feerott druid circle and casts Greater Wolf Form.  Then she runs to the northeast corner and kills everything.  She can get four or more stacks of silk in about an hour.  She finishes up with a quick visit to the merchants for pelts, etc.  If she's feeling lazy, she uses the PoK portal book near the vendors to return to the PoK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zardon</div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In shade weaver thicket the worm spawn cycle is 30 mins. It goes worm for 30 mins then beetles for 30, repeat cycle. Tiny hoppers are always there and can be placeholders for both cycles and provide lq/hq hides as well. Just park yourself there and smack away. Also, and this has been a well guarded secret since I rarely find people here, the north east section of the zone has the undead spawn camp for the lesser shades/skellies. The shades drop shadeling silks, swirling shadows and the xakra kel armor parts. Skellies drop bone chips and crap weapons and some cash. Hunting there for the swirling shadows yielded me 8 stacks of silks and 4-5 stacks of bone chips in very little time. The shades and skellies spawn in the same points so kill them all and remember to loot the bodies. Have noticed that if you leave bodies they still count as a place holder until they have rotted away and spawn timer does not seem to start until they are gone so clearing bodies keeps the spawns happening faster. I stay busy killing and looting the entire time for my supplies. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pojodan</div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 09:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My leather padding supply has been such:<br />
Mons letalis for hides.  the Mature and Adult rockhoppers hides drop a pelt most of the time, damaged are no more common than all the other types, LQ, MQ, HQ, SQ, FQ.  The Superb and Flawless go to the bank, the HQ goes to the bazaar, some sold for about 30pp each, others /auctioned for Tailored bags (The market for which has pretty much fallen out).  The MQ I convert to LQ.<br />
<br />
Then I head to shadeweavers and wait for the larve to spawn and then slaughten them in droves, warder and myself kill in one hit most of the time.  Doesn't take too long to get a good supply of threads.  The needleclawed hoppers have a pittifully low drop rate and the majority of their drops are quest peices and chunks of meat so I rarely bother looting them (Though I gleefully sic my pet on everything that moves)<br />
<br />
So far I've got 60 paddings in the bank for when I get arround to getting my smithing up.</div></div><hr />

Really good place today on my server :D . Saved lots of pp, cause was buying them at the bazaar for 3pp for each shadeling silk...</div></div><hr />

There's a merchant outside of Gukta?  Odd, I've never found him / her / it.  Can you give us a loc or approximate location?<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Come out, turn left.  Cross some water (not a lot) and he's there next to the leanto.  There's a guard that stands the other side of the lean-to, as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelanthor</div><div class="date">03-16-2003, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Not sure about pelts/hides, but the previous few correspondents have it right for the silks - Innothule is the place to go! You can buy the many stacks that are sold to Raela (the Froglok merchant just outside the path to Gukta) or go and kill the crab spiderlings. Masses of spawns, and these little suckers sometimes drop 4 silks each! Never seen that drop rate on the spiderlings elsewhere, but this may have been a universal thing in the LoY patch. Comments anyone? Drop rates increased elsewhere too? I got 2 stacks by hunting spiderlings for about 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
Good luck with the tailoring  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The froggie newbie zone is THE best place to hunt spiderling silk.  I&#8217;ve yet to do it, except for my level 4 froggie, because I don&#8217;t like taking kills from the newbies.  But I was amazed at the stacks of silks my little frog paladin gathered in the short time he was hunting.  I&#8217;m not surprised that the vendors have stacks and stacks on them.<br />
<br />
As for the drop rate, I&#8217;ve gotten 0 to 4 silks from spiderlings for as long as I can remember.  I used to hunt them and sell their silks in the bazaar when it first opened.  And before the bazaar I used them in my tailoring.  They were dropping up to 4 silks in both East Commons and the Feerrott for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lupoman</div><div class="date">03-19-2003, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">shadeweavers thicket is a great spot for 2 reasons:<br />
<br />
1. 350 shadeling silks from the lesser shades in a lil less than an hour<br />
<br />
2. the lesser shades also drop swirling shadows.(smithing component for shadowscream). Either bank them or sell in the bazaar. I have paid 250pp a stack, would even pay more but have only seen for sale that one time and got lucky. The guy said he jus turned on the trader 2min before and wasn't sure how those would sell. Told him DONT EVER sell them there again till he sends me a tell first lol.<br />
<br />
nice side income for you tailors. I cant think of anything off the other mobs mentioned above that would sell as much.<br />
<br />
Best place for the lesser shades is above the paludal caverns tunnel. <br />
<br />
Also there are skeletal hunters there that drop bone chips that are place holders for the shades. I also sell the bonechips on my trader.<br />
<br />
Edit: one more thing- the lesser shades spawn in the area above paludal, hang out there for a bit, then begin to wander. Kill all the ones you see on the way from shar val and end your trek at paludal cave entrance. Kill everything that moves here, they are all placeholders. Dont worry all mobs are lvl 15 or less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Perseverence Rewarded</div><div class="date">03-19-2003, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nobody mentioned Marus Seru for LQ hopper hides.<br />
These Grey Rockhoppers drop a pelt 95% of the time. The ratio appears to be about 1 Grey Hopper Hide per 3 LQ Rockhopper Hide. Fast and easy if you aren't KOS to the Recuso's or Stonegrabbers. I pull with a bow. Agro 5 or 6 and then hack and slash for a minute and loot, loot, loot :) <br />
And it's easy to scrape off adds at the Recusso camps if those pesky Lightcrawlers and Zelniaks agro you.<br />
Doh! The thread is about silks not hides.  :oops:</div></div><hr />
