<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fundin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After a terrible struggle to get my tailoring up for the Coldain Shawls, failing the 6th 3 times, then succeeding on it, the 7th and the (mostly) work on the 8th, I have put my sewing kit in the closet.<br />
<br />
I was at 161 the other day, spent hours trying to get dye components - foraging/hunting in lavastorm/dagnors with my 25 druid - all to get 4 items. farmed the bazaar and guildies and ended up with about a stack. 20 combines later I am at 163 and so frustrated. My kind guild leader gives me 13 velium hound furs, I grab a KEI and pray. 9 combines later I have 8 soft fur padding, 1 failure and 166 tailoring. Yes, 3 skillups on 9 combines!<br />
<br />
My hats off to anyone who has GM'd tailoring. I have all my tradeskills over 160 and by far, by a mile - tailoring is the hardest.<br />
<br />
As a side note - all 8 of the smithing combines went well, I need gems and then its the 8th shawl fights for me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good luck with your Shawl!<br />
<br />
I dont blame you for putting tailoring asside for a while.  You can always come back to it later.....  It is hard and take so much time.<br />
<br />
I myself have 223ed Smithing and 250ed every other skill during the various times i have put tailoring asside to take a break.<br />
<br />
But now with smithing 'kind of' maxed (i have 15% hammer) i have nothing else to do to avoid tailoring.  Currently 224 and I am collecting velium to make studs to go with the 400+ Wyvern hides i have collected over the years.  Then i am gonna have to fish for a few weeks solid in CS and see if i can snag the 26 points i need to GM the hardest skill out there.</div></div><hr />
