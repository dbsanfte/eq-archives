In the bazaar on Maelin Starpyre right now, a few idiots have them priced at 8, 9 and 10k which is too much if you ask me. I was kind of happy with the 4.5k one's i had purchased a few days ago. But lately people have been greedy on my server. What prices are you guys fetching (or gouging) for your CDD?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grolyn</div><div class="date">04-09-2006, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">9k-10k on (heh) Maelin.<br />
<br />
this is despite the increased drop rate with the release of PoR.  What I think happened is that many people have bought out the cheaper CDD and leaving the more expensive CDD sitting there so it might seems like price gouging.  Just need to wait for more CDD to show up on cheaper sellers. Or on vendor if you're lucky.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Master's Chest/Leg Augs sell for ~9k, so it's still generally profitable.</div></div><hr />

If you watch them over time you'll see they never sell, and generally never lower their prices hoping for that desperate person with too much plat.<br />
<br />
BD's are the same as I constantly see one person whose now up to around 160 for sale at 500pp each.  His quantity NEVER goes down, only up as /buyers are scooping em up in low 300's.<br />
<br />
Personally if something is in my inventory for more than 3 weeks I'll start lowering every few days.  If it gets &quot;too low&quot; I'll either give it away or tribute it if option is available as I'd rather turn over merchandise that just have it collecting dust.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no sellers are in the red dragon hall and buyers in the blue dragon hall. you cannot use the /trad or /buy command in the wrong hall<br />
<br />
When in the round area with the merchants look to the corridors one will ahve a blue flag on each side, go up there and you will be able to buy<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tokkyl</div><div class="date">04-11-2006, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dark - you can also see what others have their buyer prices for an item by using the /barter command and entering the item in the search screen.  This works anywhere in bazaar.<br />
<br />
PS - it's also a great way to find and link an item you wish to purchase in auction instead of just typing out the name!</div></div><hr />

Like Kyro said, they are selling consistently on Luclin for 2.5k a pop. :) <br />

One is just under that at 3950, and 2 are a bit over it at 6500 each, but the bulk fall into the 4-6k range, mostly at the higher end of that spectrum.<br />

I'm on DRo, if'n ye care.</div></div><hr />
