<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gotin</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 01:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi to all tradeskillers out there in VS. I am looking for a Human Grand Master smith (could even let someone with 240 upwards try it) to do the final combine for Fierce Heraldic armor for a fee. I have the ingredients and sub-combines already for one piece.<br />
This is my only char so I am not out to twink my lowbie alt and this is also the reason I can't afford to buy the armor in the bazaar (24kpp for a breastplate being a bit out of my league, lol). Getting the pp together to afford skilling up myself would also take me many many months, I am trying though.<br />
To put to rest any fears that doing this would reduce their own trade in cultural armor in the bazaar: I will not be reselling this armor in the bazaar. I cannot afford the prizes charged for a ready made piece so no customer lost there. The GM smith needed will be able to recoup some of the pp spent in getting there from the fee for the combine.<br />
<br />
I propose the following fee, but I am open for other suggestions (I will supply all the ingredients and ready made sub-combines apart from the cultural smithing:<br />
Pieces needing 3 blue diamonds - 1kpp for success. 250pp for failure to cover time spent (if you are a gm smith)<br />
Pieces needing 2 blue diamonds - 750pp for success. 175pp for failure (again if you are a gm smith)<br />
Pieces needing 1 blue diamonds - 500pp for success. 125pp for failure (gm smith).<br />
I can only afford to have one piece made at a time though as I would need to restock my bank balance lol.<br />
<br />
Please send me a tell in VS if you can and are willing to do this combine for a warrior that is getting beaten black and blue by the mobs out there due to low ac.<br />
