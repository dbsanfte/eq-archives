Welcome to the Stromm Marketplace.   If you are looking for people to call friends, and to help you with crafting,  quite a few regulars from this board have made this new server a second home!<br />
<br />
<br />
We look forward to having you!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aandaie</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 05:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">HI!<br />
<br />
I made a dark elf cleric<br />
<br />
Aaeunel<br />
<br />
My first choice was accepted since it was nonsensical. Outside of trying to get the dopey dark elf newb armor I did xp and money quests until about 9, bought full banded from some dwarf then, bought all my nine spells now and am up to 36 or so in tailoring. I think the dwarves name is Keplar, he seems to be on all the time and I think was doing very well in banded in POK. Wonder if he is on the way to fine steel?<br />
<br />
I did not really intend to tailor but its where some good money items are there right now, such as the large pouch and bag (never saw the sense in making them other other servers),<br />
though I can't seem to sell them even for 4 plat. I did sell some raw silk armor, mainly the robe and pants. Its amazing that you can buy out like tons of spider silk and spiderling silk on this server from npc merchants, visiting the bazaar with 30 or so vendors is a blast too ;)<br />
<br />
Nearly 11 now. The treksar snake egg quest in neriak gives you a HUGE money boost as a newbie, though I did not make a dark elf for that reason (it was just a bonus which popped up I had not thought of) 12 copper for two eggs from an npc = 3 gold or so and some rawhide or patchwork (you seell to a vendor nearby) After buying out various newb areas like freeport (Thnx jenam and rebby!) I was doing 77 or so eggs per trip, next I thought of far off areas no one else was auctioning to buy from players, like qeynos (got 37 a couple times there)<br />
<br />
I have 26 leather padding I've made as well, no one seems to want those yet, har har. Sometime after doing this newb stuff I'll probably get bored since my character will be as successful as it can be outside of just powerleveling. I think I already have enough money for the level 14 spells, not sure what I'm going to do next.  Level and try to make adamantite plate? By the time I get there better stuff I can afford will probably be popping up in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Ah, thought of one thing I can do, make armor dyes since I've not seen anyone with them yet.. hmm pottery and brewing of 50 or so? Anyway I'll say hi to any denmom's chilluns people if I see you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Itzena</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 07:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keplar's got a few pieces (bracers, I think) of FS Plate for sale.<br />
I think I might ask him to try and make my shaman some ornate chain.<br />
<br />
Oh, and give me a few days and I'll have raw silk/raw shade silk for sale in the Bazaar - and possibly greyhopperhide as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aandaie</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OMG I'll have to ask him what he is charging for such Fine Steel plate pieces.<br />
<br />
wonder if I could ever reasonably afford the BP? Will be a very good item for some time as a newb. Mostly I'd feel sort of cool running around in a steel plate look ;)</div></div><hr />

The&quot;Old Cultural&quot; will probally be big untill BDs can be gotten ok and more people are closer to the Rec Level of 45 for the gear!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope.   As of last night, he was making only FS Bracers.<br />
<br />
The BP is too high for him, methinks.  168 for bracers, 188 for BP.  20 points is alot when working with expensive combines.  He probably doesnt even have the 168 yet. <br />
<br />
But he will.<br />

<br />
Have 6 pieces now, all very pricey at current status, but have been 6 for 15 so far, so doing pretty good.  Hope to keep every size of bracer, visor, and collars in stock starting tomorrow.<br />
<br />
60pp for the collars or the visors<br />
75pp for the bracers<br />
<br />
Have plenty of padding, and suppliers, at the moment, but once fine plate demand starts building, I will probably be sending out cries for it =)<br />
<br />
Ornate chain I will make, but it will have to be 20pp per ring until I break 140, then I'll do it for 15pp per ring.<br />
<br />
Please support the younger smiths in Denmother's Children with banded orders as they can still gain skills while I am past the trivials.<br />
<br />
For guild members only I will attempt any 1 or 2 ring Ornate Chain or 1 sheet Fine Plate combine if you provide the materials.<br />
<br />
Thanks all for your encouragement and support in the game, let me know if I can be of service to you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aandaie</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, but I was making bps about 2 every 3 tries at around 175 skill or whatever you used to max banded at back in the day.<br />
<br />
I guess they changed it though, right?<br />
<br />
For some reason back then I had trouble with legs.<br />
<br />
Ah just read what skill he was at, yeah they changed it. Boy.. it was easy back then. Max on banded in freeport, boom make fine steel.</div></div><hr />

I've been kind of going that route while Keplar is feeling the market for fine steel plate. I made 3 ornate chain coifs last night. As soon as I can corner market on large bricks of high quality ore, I will be making more and more of this stuff.<br />

Is it more ac than banded?<br />
Different color? <br />
I never got up much on ornate =/<br />
<br />
Right now after getting 14 I'm just trying to scrounge to buy spells.. AHAHHA. What a difference... I've not even bought bind since it seems a waste to spend 5 plat on it when I am staying bound around POK right now. Other people ask if I can bind them and I say &quot;sure, if you want to go and buy me the spell for 5 plat so I can scribe it and bind you ;)  &quot;</div></div><hr />

No more hordes of smiths that got 240+ pre FS nerf (still kicking myself :) ) or skilled up on Ethereal Bricks. <br />
I haven't settled in but I am aiming at making an Ogre Smith atm. If I only had more time and more money :)<br />
Good luck to you all!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gargazon</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 06:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I made a human cleric. 132 smithing atm, 122 brewing, 100+ baking, 50 fishing and 30 something tailoring...it's been a blast. Level 12 atm, trying to level up so I can get the fine steel drops I need to do ornate. I'd be a lot higher probably, but my wife...</div></div><hr />
