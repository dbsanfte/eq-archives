<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dartanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tried to make a smithing trophy tonight and failed all 4 attempts. My skill is 233 atm and I've heard of others making them at this kill level or lower. I'm not poor, but nor am I really wealthy. At  around 5k a try it's a little to costly to keep failing.<br />
<br />
Sould I just wait till I'm at 250 to try again? What skill level did you make yours at?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nex Alacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, your next attempt may make it, or it may not, but if you want the best chance, skill up to 240 then equip a geerlok.  But I don't think that would *really* increase your chances THAT much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would assume the triv is 335 for geerloks, same as all the top end trivs.<br />
<br />
Which means even at 252 skill, you have a 52% chance of success. At 233 skill I think it works out at 33% chance.<br />
<br />
If your skill is unmodified, get a geerlok at least even if you do sell it off straight away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I failed 7 times before I made the hammer. 3 tries were with a skill in the low 240's. 5 tries with a skill of 252. Was frustrating at teh time but I feel it was more than worth the wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got mine a t 230 on the second try with gearlck 241. Paid 10 total got a 100% bag so not a bad deal.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Binuru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just for kicks I gave it a go yesterday with a 195 skill and no geerlock.<br />
<br />
Not only did I succeed, but they gave me a bloody skill-up to boot!<br />
 <br />
I know I'm one lucky SOB, hehe.  Sadly, though, it seems that all my luck with that killed any other chances of skillups... been through 80 combines so far today of EVB's, and nary a skill-up to be had. /em cries</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye, technically it is possible to make it with a skill of 0 (5% chance) but very few are crazy enough to try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A trivial of 335 suggests that you should succeed the trophy, on average, once out of every two tries.  Given the number of people who needed more than that, though, I'm guessing the trivial is significantly higher -- probably high enough that you would only succeed 1 in 3 or 1 in 4 combines, on average.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Attempted 10 times, succeeded on my 10th attempt.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, I stopped after my 10th attempt.   :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Ya may want to consider that in your statistical analysis, or better yet in your &quot;list of stoopid people who tried at a low skill level&quot;.  :faint:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yitara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">At skill of 238 I succeeded on my first attempt.  Actually kind of cool as a mage walking around with the Brewer's Corker and Smith's Hammer at the same time, people can't figure out what the heck class I am if I go anon, dual welding in a skirt and all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Daikoku Ashikaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Did mine, first try at 208 skill, I don't think I had my XTC hammer equiped at the time, though I may have.<br />
