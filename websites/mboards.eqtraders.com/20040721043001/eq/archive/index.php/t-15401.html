<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At least now most of that duped plat will be flushed down the casino.  <br />
<br />
It does have one useful purpose:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow, he offers such proof of the existence of a dupe.<br />

<br />
Clearly, he is to be believed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>OberonMiM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">its probably something that deals with the rewind &quot;feature&quot; that went into the game</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aandaie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Agree with Lilosh ;)<br />
<br />
Posts like that are meaningless. Hey there is a dupe! I read some other post on some other board that said there was a dupe! Oh, but this post here was from fires of heaven so there must be a dupe!<br />
<br />
So how exactly would you let SOE know? Hey soe, there is a dupe! Could you describe the dupe and detail how it is performed? No, the guy just said there was a dupe! ... kk thnx, later...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Saleani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Some people like to make up hoaxes. Or claim the sky is falling.<br />
<br />
Sample hoaxes: <br />
Buggy banker in Befallen<br />
Mayor of Rivervale drops Jade Reavers.<br />
There is a quest for a brownie illusion item.<br />
<br />
When small bricks of ore were incorrectly priced, the rumor running around was that there was some new dupe bug. One of the red herrings tossed out to divert attention was the banker in befallen hoax.</div></div><hr />

I'm glad someone else realizes that there was no buggy befallen banker.<br />

Um, that's how buggy he was? Couldn't even find the correct zone?<br />
<br />
And I was not able to find the &quot;walkthrough&quot; of the brownie quest for your laughter and enjoyment.. But you sure knew something was fishy when one of the quest npcs you had to meet was a little gnome named Ron Jeremy and get a &quot;marital aid&quot; from him. I had the printout somewhere, and it was priceless, and about 50 pages long.<br />
<br />
So instead. Here are some lists of fun things to do when you become the ruler of all (http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html).</div></div><hr />

My personal favourite was the bunny hat.  Man those rogues were clever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Don't even mention that! I'm still sad there was no bunny hat. :( Sadly if real it would have provided a more dignified hat look to me than many of EQ's helmets. ;)</div></div><hr />
