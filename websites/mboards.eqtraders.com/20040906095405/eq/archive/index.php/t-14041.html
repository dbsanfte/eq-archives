I'm working on a Sunday.  I never work Sundays.  I am here because I will be on vacation later in the week and I'm making up hours so I don't use as many out of my time pool.<br />
<br />
This was a mistake.  Missing a guild raid, working on baking, and enchanting more clay. :steamed: <br />
<br />
Work is horriffic. Scare, nightmareish.  It would make Plane of Nighmares and Plane of Fear look like a &quot;Midsummer's Night Dream&quot;.<br />
<br />
Innoruk and Cazic-Thule themselves couldn't make a worse punishment for anyone, no matter how much they hated them.<br />
<br />
:boggled: :boggled: <br />
<br />
Eh, 5 hours left..  I'm itching to get out of here. :) ;) :p :D <br />
<br />
<br />
Eh, I'll be off now.  TY for letting me vent.  :D<br />
<br />
BTW - a stack of Mistys to the first person who gets my movie reference (in the subject line).  :D<br />
<br />
(As long as you're in my server,I can't get them onto other servers, yet...)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've been to his comic book store, too (In Red Bank NJ).<br />
<br />
Interesting place, has a lot of memoriabilia from all his movies.<br />
<br />
The &quot;sketch&quot; with the $100 from C****** A**.<br />
The armor that B** A****** wore in D****.<br />
J** and S***** B**'s clothes.<br />
<br />
Great store, quite extensive compared to your average comic store, but he had no RPG stuff.  :(<br />
<br />
My brother in law used ot hang out with J**** M*** (J**).  It's not an act.  :)</div></div><hr />

Heh, I'm not worried if someone gets it, like I said in another thread, I've done mistys from 205 to 231 since the new UI.  Even if I'm out I'll run to Rivervale and make a stack for them.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just passed the halfway mark.<br />

And if I see any of you walk in my store at 4:55PM, I will, and this is not a threat, I WILL TRAIN YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />

I worked until 3am yesterday.<br />
<br />
Valentines Day.  In the Adult Store.  And I was on the register.<br />
<br />
Everyone had to stop by to get their &quot;Toys&quot;, Massage Oils, Movies, and lord knows what else, so they could come home to their loved one, and have a night of grown-up fun.<br />
<br />
The store was jam-packed with giggling couples (and a few RUDE customers) yesterday.<br />
<br />
<br />
We did more business than any other Shift, EVER yesterday.   Wel also had the highest sales of any day, ever yesterday.<br />
<br />
<br />
Working retail is poo.<br />

*frown*<br />
<br />
It's just a retail store, folks. <br />
<br />
My fault for even mentioning work.   Sorry.<br />

<br />
Yes, but most people wouldn't giggle incessantly and make random jokes just because you sold Televisions.<br />
<br />
I suppose my nerves are just a bit raw after one too many people make jokes that are ONLY funny because of the nature of my store.     It's just like other retail jobs.  <br />

<br />
it pays the bills, keeps food on the table.  provides entertainment to the masses.<br />
<br />
does it have the potential for vast humor, of course it does.  and for me, the boring beyondbeleif bean counter, i will still giggle over 'adult amusements'.  i mean, where is the humor in attempting to make your debits = your credits...<br />
<br />
:wizard:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've got one nearly as bad: working til midnight in adult store, being propositioned by every man AND woman that walked in, and having customers refuse to ask the floor personal for help because the cashier is obviously the one (captive) audience they can be guaranteed to get information from. <br />
<br />
Converastion I had, which I'm sure you can sympathize with:<br />
<br />
SlimyGuy: Uh, can you make any recommendations on good videos to buy? *wink*nudge*<br />
<br />
Me: Would you like the top AVN awards list for the last 5 years or a book like the Wise Woman's Guide to video reviewing the various films with their merits, sir?<br />
<br />
SlimyGuy: What, you don't have favorites? *breathe on me with garlic coffee breath*<br />
<br />
Why is it that everyone thinks you're a tramp and willing to share when you work at an adult store? At that close to closing time and on that high volume of a day, my only response was a rude one and it rhymed with Yuck Foo. You're right, Lilosh. Working retail is poo, adult store or no.</div></div><hr />
