<br />
For everyone here that really enjoys doing tradeskills, you should check out the site www.istaria.com (and there are links there to fan sites) It's a new MMORPG (called Horizons) that's due out sometime this year. The cool thing is besides going out and &quot;adventuring,&quot; people who are interested will actually be able to do nothing but tradeskills. There will be XP given for using a skill, and the majority of items to be used in the game are going to be crafted by players. You'll also be able to buy land, houses, set up your own shops etc.<br />
<br />
Just thought I'd give it a quick plug since they're now taking sign ups for Beta! :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">McDunno</div><div class="date">01-23-2003, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, sorry...<br />
<br />
I figured that if there was any group of people that would be interested/excited about being able to advance by just doing tradeskills, it would be the people here at EQTraders....<br />
<br />
And since I have nothing to do with Artifact (the company making the game) I didn't really think it'd be a problem to post it here.</div></div><hr />

If he plays, I'll probably play too, hehe</div></div><hr />

I didnt take it as an ad, or spam, or anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
Probably wont click the link, unless I get bored, but thats just because I'm uninterested.<br />

<br />
Yah, took me 6 hrs or so to click the link myself ;)<br />
<br />
Got a timer?<br />
<br />
I agree that this wasn't spam, if he had come and gone and posted a form letter, that is spam... obviously he singled out tradeskillers, and went back to see the response his post had gotten.  I'd do something similar if I had spare time :)</div></div><hr />

Even if it is something pertinent, it's in the wrong forum, and still reeks of spam.<br />

I apologize if I am overvigilant.</div></div><hr />

Ah ha!<br />

It was McDunno, in the Kitchen, with the Candlestick.<br />

I think you've cracked the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heartsong_Steelsoul</div><div class="date">01-23-2003, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alas, Horizons has, to date, been nothing but Vaporware.  IIRC, they started talking about it at least as early as when I graduated college, in '99.  I could be misrembering though, but I used to be a Mordor/Demise player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">McDunno</div><div class="date">01-23-2003, 11:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it's only my first post to this board since the move from EZboards... if there was a way to look up posts there, you'd see I'd had a few posts there (mostly in the fletching forum)<br />
<br />
As far as it being vaporware, yeah, for a while I thought the same thing :( Ecspecially after they took down the public forums and stopped communicating with the fan base.. but, like I said, beta is supposed to be starting soon, so hopefully.... :)  I have no idea what changes have been made from the original promised specs, but dragons are still in as a playable race! :D<br />
<br />
<br />
So the big question is... with a game that's actually designed around tradeskills as the main method of acquiring gear, how long will it take for the Denmother to set up Horizontraders? :)</div></div><hr />

My plans had been to keep playing EQ1 and only make a tradeskills person on EQ2.<br />
<br />
 :twisted:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">McDunno</div><div class="date">01-24-2003, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks someone for deleting the double post :)  I tried a few times, but kept getting errors....<br />
<br />
As far as Horizon's being vaporware, there was a quote from...oh crap, forget the guys name now, the one that had the site reviewing different MMORPGs etc...err.... anyway, he said something like the following about Horizon's (forget the exact quote, but this is close)<br />
<br />
&quot;I would consider Horizon's to be vaporware, however the fan base for this game already has the enthusiasm of fundamentalist Iran. If they did try to cancel Horizon's, I think David Allen would find a large number of gamers camped out on his lawn until such time the game was released&quot;<br />
<br />
:lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aandaie</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 06:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The tradeskill thing in horizons does seem pretty cool.<br />
<br />
One interesting thing is that you have a 100 percent chance of success, if you can make the item at all. They assume that you got the stuff, you have the skill, you should be able to make the thing.<br />
<br />
GO FIGURE!<br />
<br />
Then they throw in this kind of neat thing where you could maybe make a couple more, using less resources, but only at 75 percent chance instead of 100.<br />
<br />
They have other weird stuff like even scribing recipes, you find on mobs and stuff. They also have a level bar thing which shows your class level and trade ones, nutty.<br />
<br />
Several game sites have updated info about this stuff, after visiting horizons in some demo thing. I think I'm looking forward to playing this one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Serenya</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I don't know how it will do, but it isn't vaporware.  I'm in beta, and I like it, it's different.   Tradeskills are VERY different there.<br />
<br />
<br />
As to horizons tradeskills, someone other then denmum would have to set it up, I think this site burnt her out :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cantatus</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been keeping a close eye on this game for a few months.  It seems like it could be a great game if everything goes as planned.<br />
<br />
You can read a good FAQ here (http://hz.stratics.com/content/gameplay/faq/index.php).  This is my favorite aspect of their tradeskill system:<br />
<br />
25 different blades can be placed on 25 different hilts, 10 unique tassels can be attached to the hilt, 10 shader effects can be placed along the blade or hilt, 10 particle systems can be placed along the blade or rotating around it, 3 socket slots in every item with 20 socket-able items in the game, combine this with 3 racial styles and 6 metal alloys usable by trades people allow for 675 million combinations of swords.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 08:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, heck, why not.<br />
<br />
The rationale for the first spam ever sent was that even though it was off topic, it would still be of interest to the readers of the news groups in question.<br />
<br />
Either way.</div></div><hr />
