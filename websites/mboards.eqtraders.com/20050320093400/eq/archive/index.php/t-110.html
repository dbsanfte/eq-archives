<br />
Just for grins, I figured I'd start up this thread which has nothing to do with EQ. The idea is to trade recipies for your favorite concoctions. I'll begin.<br />
<br />
Crockpot Cinnamon Pork<br />
INGREDIENTS:<br />
2 lbs of boneless pork cut into 1/2&quot; slices<br />
Quart of Apple Cider (hard or soft - doesn't matter)<br />
1/2 Cup honey<br />
4 cinnamon sticks<br />
<br />
Put 2 cinnamon sticks in bottom of crockpot. Add half the pork. Add half the honey. Then add the rest of the pork and honey. Add cider until the pork is just covered. Cook on LOW for 8 hours.<br />
<br />
Serve over rice or noodles, or with potatoes. Serves 3 or 4 depending on appetite. Bon apetit! <br />
<br />
Hmm - many good ones, but what's the best one?<br />
<br />
Oh, dear - I'm really not good with measurements.<br />
<br />
Chicken Marsala the simple way.<br />
<br />
7 breasts, rinsed and dried off<br />
Flour<br />
Golden Mushroom soup - concentrate<br />
(Use mushroom soup mix and 1/4 the water or use a can or make mushroom soup and boil it down some  )<br />
Onions, sliced<br />
Mushrooms, sliced - if the soup doesn't have enough <br />
Marsala (wine - available in local supermarkets)<br />
Pepper and salt<br />
(Garlic, minced - then again, I'm a garlic fanatic... somehow I can never get a date with the local vampires...)<br />
Noodles - I recommend fettucine or linguini<br />
Olive oil<br />
<br />
Sprinkle flour over chicken breasts and cook in a saucepan with olive oil and onions until brown. Add mushrooms (garlic) and pepper (and salt if you must) continue cooking for 2 or 3 minutes, turning the meat. Add soup concentrate and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes.<br />
Serve over noodles. <br />
<br />
Doomspark's Quick &amp; Dirty Chili<br />
<br />
INGREDIENTS:<br />
1 large jar of Salsa (Mild, Medium or Hot, depending on individual taste)<br />
1.5 lbs ground beef<br />
1 can of pinto beans<br />
One finely chopped bud of garlic<br />
<br />
<br />
Brown the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat, and drain well.<br />
Add salsa and garlic, mixing well with the ground beef.<br />
Open can of beans, and drain. Add to beef mixture.<br />
Cook over medium heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.<br />
<br />
Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes or so before serving<br />
<br />
 Black Forest cherry torte<br />
(Schwarzw‰lderkirschtorte)<br />
Cake Filling <br />
6 eggs 1 1/2 cup powdered sugar <br />
1 cup sugar 1/3 cup butter <br />
1 stick butter 1 egg yolk <br />
1 cup flour 2 Tbsp Kirsch <br />
2/3 cup cocoa Topping <br />
1 tsp vanilla 2 cups cherries <br />
Sirup 2 Tbsp powdered sugar <br />
1/3 cup sirup<br />
(from canned cherries) 1 cup heavy cream <br />
8 oz chocolate <br />
<br />
 1/4 cup Kirsch 1/2 to 1 tsp vanilla <br />
Glaze (optional) <br />
<br />
 3 Tbsp cherry sirup <br />
1 tsp cornstarch/arrowroot <br />
<br />
Cake - Grease one deep 9 inch round cake pan or three 8 inch cake pans and line with parchment. Ensure butter is warm but not melted. Put butter in small bowl and beat until creamy. In large bowl beat eggs until thick and creamy. If needed set bowl over a pan of warm water. Sift flour, sugar, and cocoa together, fold into eggs, and add vanilla and butter. Fold in carefully. Pour batter into pan(s), and bake in preheated 350 degree oven. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes if using 3 shallow pans, 40 minutes if using one deep one. Cake should pull away from sides of pan. Cool some, then remove from pan to rack and cool at least 30 minutes if one deep pan, 10 minutes if three shallow ones. <br />
<br />
Sirup - Mix 1/3 cup sirup drained from the cherries and 1/4 cup Kirsch<br />
<br />
Filling - Beat butter and sugar until blended. Add egg yolk, beat until light and fluffy. Fold in Kirsch. <br />
<br />
Topping - Whip cream, add 2 Tbsp sugar and vanilla to taste. Make curls from chocolate with a peeler. <br />
<br />
Optional glaze - Add starch to sirup in small pan and heat to boiling while stirring, until clear.<br />
<br />
If cake was baked in one deep pan, cut cake horizontally in three layers. Prick the cake layers and pour 1 Tbsp sirup mixture over each. Place one layer on plate and spread with a thin layer of filling. Dry cherries and place 3/4 cup evenly on filling. Place second layer on top of this, and repeat with filling and cherries. Place third layer on top, and spoon remaining Kirsch sirup over it. Cover top and sides of cake with topping. Place remaining cherries on top of cake. Press chocolate curls onto sides of the cake, and place some amongst the cherries on top. If glaze is desired, make as above, and brush or pour glaze over the cherries. <br />

I'm going to be whipping one of these up for a friend's birthday this weekend. And I didn't even have to hunt brownies to do it! ;) <br />
<br />
N.B. The &quot;Kirsch&quot; mentioned in the recipe is short for Kirschwaﬂer, a German cherry brandy. So make sure to check I.D.'s of anyone you feed it to! (for US residents, anyway) <br />
<br />
[color=indigo]3-ingredient fudge<br />
<br />
18 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips (1 and 1/2 bags)<br />
1 can sweetened condensed milk<br />
2 teaspoons vanilla<br />
<br />
Place in microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high for 1 minute. Stir. Microwave on high for another minute. Stir.<br />
<br />
Place in buttered 9&quot;x9&quot; or similar pan. Refrigerate 1 hour.** Cut into squares, but leave in the pan. Replace back in the refrigerator until you are ready to serve.<br />
<br />
**If you refrigerate it for more than an hour before cutting, it may be too hard to cut. This fudge is best served cold, so it does not get gooey until it hits your mouth.<br />
<br />
Mmmmmmmm<br />

Getting inspired by all these lovely recipes. (Yeah, I have a crockpot too and love it!)<br />
<br />
I love to bake (both in RL and in EQ) so here's one of my baking favourites.<br />
<br />
Easy Refrigerator Rolls<br />
<br />
2 pkg. active dry yeast<br />
2 cups warm water<br />
1/2 cup sugar<br />
1/4 cup vegetable shortening<br />
1 egg<br />
2 tsp salt<br />
6 1/2 to 7 cups Flour<br />
<br />
In mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Ad sugar, shortening, egg, salt and half of the flour. Beat until smooth.<br />
<br />
Mix in remaining flour with spoon or hand until dough is easy to handle. Place in greased bowl; turn once. Cover loosely with plastic wrap, cloth or foil. Refrigerate at least 2 hours. When dough rises, punch it down occasionally. Dough may be kept 3 to 4 days.<br />
<br />
About 2 hours before baking, shape dough into desired rolls. Cover and let rise until double, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Heat oven to 400 degrees. bake rolls 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown.<br />
<br />
Cloverleaf Rolls: Form bits of dough into balls about 1 inch in diameter. Place 3 balls each in greased muffin cup. Brush with butter<br />
<br />
Quick Four Leaf Clover Rolls: Form dough into balls about 2 inches indiameter. Place each in greased muffin cup. With scissors, deeply score each ball of dough into quarters.<br />
<br />
Butterhorns: Roll about 1/4 of dough at a time into a 12 inch circle, 1/4 inch thick. Spread with softened butter. cut into 16 wedges. Beginning at rounded edge, roll up. Place point down on greased baking sheet. Curve.<br />
<br />
Picnic Buns: Roll about 1/4 of dough at a time into 7 1/2 inch square, about 1/2 inch thick. Cut into nine 2 1/2 inch squares. Place on greased baking sheet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mom's Applesauce<br />
<br />
8-10 large cooking apples<br />
1/2 cup water<br />
1 teaspoon cinnamon<br />
1/2 to 1 c sugar<br />
<br />
Dice apples. Toss all ingredients into crockpot. Cook on low 8-10 hours or high for 4-5 hours. Stir occasionally if you're feeling ambitious.<br />
<br />
Amazing on pancakes and waffles.<br />
<br />
I usually use at most a 1/2 c sugar, because even then it's incredibly sweet. I've gotten away with putting no sugar in before and it's good that way too, just not quite as sweet.  <br />
<br />
Good apples for this: Melrose, Jonathon, Jonagold, Rome<br />
<br />
Cookies and Cream<br />
a.k.a.<br />
Procrastinator's Potluck Solution<br />
<br />
1 package Chip's Ahoy (or similar) chocolate chip cookies<br />
1 tub Cool Whip (or similar) whipped cream<br />
3? cups milk (approximately)<br />
1 Heath toffee bar (or similar), frozen and crushed<br />
<br />
-Start with a 9x13&quot; pan (glass, plastic, metal, whatever).<br />
<br />
-Pour some of the milk into a bowl. Dip/dunk the cookies into the milk so that they are completely wet, even a little soft. (I usually just let all of the air bubbles escape.) Replentish the milk as neccessary.<br />
<br />
-As you dunk each cookie, line the bottom of the pan with the milky cookies until it is covered. Then spread a layer of whipped cream over the cookie layer, enough to cover the cookies (or according to taste).<br />
<br />
-Layer more milky cookies on top of the whipped cream, and then more cream on top of those.<br />
<br />
-Repeat. (I usually get 3 or 4 full rolls of cookies into one pan, depending on its size.)<br />
<br />
-Make sure that the last layer is one of whipped cream.<br />
<br />
-Sprinkle the crushed candy bar (or cookie crumbs will do in a pinch, and they do not need to be frozen, just crushed) on the last layer of whipped cream, and refridgerate (a couple of hours is fine).<br />
<br />
This recipe is especially nice for people that either have a bad habit of procrastinating or are very forgetful, like me. It is most fun to share this recipe because everyone will compliment you on it, but nobody knows how easy it is.<br />
<br />
I find it is best for family gatherings and picnics and such, since if you are pressed for time, most of the ingredients can be had from a convinience-type store, or maybe even a gas station, and can be assembled fairly quickly. The most time taken in preparation is the refridgeration at the end, which can be done in a cooler or fridge while everyone eats the main meal (since it is a dessert). <br />
<br />
Argh! Ok, finally found something really to be envious about towards Americans: In Finland, there's NO way to acquire chocolate chips, short of picking them out of cookies. They're NOT sold in shops. When people want something akin to chips, we take a cheese grater and some chocolate and get to work.<br />
<br />
ObRecipe:<br />
<br />
Some chicken breasts (WITH bone. Always with bone. The bone adds a lot of flavor to the meat while cooking. What is it with you boneless chicken people?) About 2 per eater will do nicely.<br />
Red wine (go with something South American, you can drink what you don't use for the marinade)<br />
A little ginger<br />
Some whole green peppers<br />
<br />
Marinade the chicken breasts for about 4 hours in a marinade made of red wine, ginger and whole green peppers. A little garlic can be added if you're not currently dating someone who hates it.<br />
<br />
Cook in oven at 180 degrees Celsius for about 45 minutes - 1 hour, half sunken in the marinade. Don't overdo this bit or the breasts will get dry.<br />
<br />
Remove the bone (ta-daa! It comes off real easy from a cooked breast). Serve with rise (I personally love Basmati, but whatever works for you) and some Blue Cheese sauce (should be available ready-made in shops, so no recipe from me) or the cooked marinade as a sauce (you can thicken it up a little with some Maizena or similar if you want).<br />
<br />
For dessert, I made an incredible discovery: Take your favorite Chocolate ice cream. Put a big pile of it on a plate. Dig a hole in it. Pour in about 4-5cc of Cloudberry Liqueur into the hole. Check the IDs of everybody who wants a plate. Dip spoonfulls of ice cream into the liqueur before applying to mouth. Yummy * 2 indeed does make double yummy!<br />
<br />
Ok got to get my 2cp in on this one.<br />
<br />
Dirt in the Pudding.<br />
1 16oz bag of oreos Crushed<br />
1 large or 2 small box's of Vanella pudding<br />
1 9 x 13 x 4 dish. (or close to that)<br />
1 large tub of cool whip room temp.<br />
<br />
wash and dry container.<br />
<br />
Mix pudding seperat bowl. from the pan being used.<br />
<br />
Crush oreos into a bowl, Now take about half of the oreo's and line the bottom of the container with them try and cover compleatly if you can.<br />
<br />
Pour semi-set up pudding onto oreo base.<br />
<br />
Cover the pudding imeadtly or when it's about thick enough to hold a larger peice of the oreos with out it sinking too much, about 1/2 the way into the pudding with it's own weight. Use most of the reaming oreo's but do cover the pudding compleatly. Hopefully you will some left over if not no worries.<br />
<br />
Now cover the oreo's with the whip cream. Cover with lid or serane rap, Chill for 1 hour or more in fridge, Dish out with spoon or spatchula, enjoy.<br />
<br />
For thouse amoung us that are Choco-holics (I plead the fifth on that one)<br />
Replace the vanellia pudding with baseic chocolate pudding not the fudge pudding, or the devil's food pudding.<br />
Also replace the white Cool Whip with the Chocolate Cool Whip. for the chocloate lovers dream semi-low fat desert.  <br />
<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Cream of mushroom simmered chicken/pork/steak<br />
<br />
16oz (or how ever much meat you think you'll need for the number of people eating) of chicken (boneless), Pork chops, or your favorite pan fry cut of beef.<br />
1 or 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom soup, non-low fat it just don't taste right other wise.<br />
1 stick of butter or some kind of oil for frying the meat with in the pan and to put in rice.<br />

With steak cook till about half way to your prefured cooking lvl of steak.<br />
Mix in seperat bowl the soup with milk, (whole milk if you have it)<br />
reduce heat to low on stove. let pan cool a little so you don't burn the soup when adding it.<br />
add soup to pan, simmer till soup has reduced to 1/2 consistancy in pan.<br />
Note you will need to stir to keep soup from burning, and all also move the meat around in the pan to cover well and cook evenly.<br />
<br />
While the soup is reduceing in pan take 1 3 qrt microwave safe bowl.<br />
add x number serving of rice, fill with water till covered to just over the top with water.<br />
Add butter, recomend 1 Tlbs of it for bull flavor. add pinch of salt.<br />
Nuke on high for 6 min per serving, (thats in a 1000 watt nuker at 3500 feet above sea lvl, adjust accrodingly for your nuker and elvotion.)<br />
<br />
Place a covering of rice on plate, put meat on the rice cover with reduced mushroom sauce. <br />
Fresh made bread with butter is great with this.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />

try sauce and more honey to keep the slightly tangy but sweet taste to it.<br />

<br />
Add aprox 1 spoon full of lemon juice, little less or little more depenoing on your taste to get that last zip added to it.<br />

<br />
2 ducks legs and thighs<br />

<br />
cover with casserole dish lid and place in oven at 175 C proberly about 2 3rds heat on most ovens. <br />

<br />
Peppers. In the uk we have<br />
Peppers Large, green, orange red and yellow. Also know as bell peppers and are good for stuffing with rice dishes.<br />
<br />
Peppers hot, these come in a variety of sizes but are mostly tapered, that is they are long and pointy at one end. you can get a varity of hot peppers that are round and about the size of cherries, warning these are very hot and you should not trust your wife when you come across them for the 1st time as she will say that they are very sweet and tasty.<br />
<br />
pepper (note the lack of s )The ball baring type also comes in white black and green but black appears to be most common.<br />
also know as peppercorn. often used crushed on steaks and soups and is an essential piece of kitchen equipment. <br />
Note the size of the pepper mill is not important, they only use the really big ones to make up for other lacks or to make people think that they are well equipped (in the kitchen of course goodness your minds)<br />
<br />
Ok here goes. <br />
1 can chillie with beans<br />
1 can pork and beans.<br />
combine both in blender until they are in paste form dont add water. transfer mixture to pot and heat untill bubbling. <br />
transfer to a bowl and top with cheddar cheese and serve with your favorite potato chip.<br />
Warning this is one of my special dishes. I call it the gaslight special because if you dont have a cast iron digestive system its almost garunteed to make you produce gas.<br />
er ps its also mildly addictive despite the side effects. <br />
<br />
Calico Beans<br />

Dump everything into a crockpot and simmer for 4 hours minimum. Add water if needed to keep it as similar consistency to pork and beans. Spice up as desired with salt or pepper. Can be livened up with tobasco sauce also. <br />
<br />
OK, now that I've read this thread finaly I'll add my own heheh<br />
<br />
Cheese Dreams (breakfast)<br />
<br />
heat up the stove top to medium heat<br />
<br />
Take two egg yolks, a teaspoon of cinnimin and a dollop of honey and mix well by any method, I find the blender very effective. <br />
Add two cups of milk (whole or skim, makes no difference) and mix in a blender (the stand up deals with the blades in the bottom that can be detatched as a pitcher)<br />
simply mix until the mixture is well combined, ne specifics, preferably the cinimin should not be very visable.<br />
<br />
pour a portion into a saucer, top should be foamy.<br />
<br />
take two slices of bread and dip them into the mixture one at a time, make sure both sides are covered, then place on the buttered or sprayed pancake pan.<br />
<br />
Cook one side untill done, then flip and place one slice of either American or chedder cheese (chedder provides a nice bite) on both cokked sides as the bottoms cook. when done, put them together like a sandwich.<br />
<br />
You may then top as you wish, I find heated maple syrup and butter excelent <br />
<br />
sugar death cookies<br />
<br />
Ingredients<br />
<br />
1/2c. butter<br />
1c. milk<br />
4c. sugar<br />
1 1/2c. peanut butter<br />
4 1/2c &quot;Quick&quot; oatmeal<br />
8 Tbsp. cocoa<br />
2 tsp. vanilla<br />
<br />
melt butter milk and sugar in a large saucepan over medium heat. boil for two minutes. remove from heat and quickly and peanut butter, oatmeal, cocoa, and vanilla. stir well, and drop in desired quanitities on wax paper, leave to cool.<br />
<br />
very addictave, this will make around 40 cookies. as mention you must add quickly or it won't set right and then you will have a lot of ice cream topping.<br />

<br />
Another recipe of mine:<br />
(btw, I usually cook for my roomies, too, so some of these recipes might appear a tad large. Just adjust as neccessary. Also, all the amounts are approximations: Go up and down as you feel)<br />
<br />
Blue Spaghetti Sauce<br />
<br />
500gr of ground beef<br />
200gr of bacon<br />
150gr of salami or similar sausage<br />
200gr of blue cheese<br />
green olives (with red pepper filling, if you want)<br />
2 cans crushed tomatoes<br />
Garlic, pepper, oregano<br />
<br />
Cut the bacon into strips, and cut the salami into pieces. Fry all the meats with the spices. Pour out excess grease (or don't, but this'll be _really_ greasy). Add crushed tomatoes and olives. Cut up the blue cheese (helps it to melt better), then toss it in. Now wait. And wait. And wait... The longer you can let this bubble away on low heat, the better the tastes mix.<br />
<br />
Serve with pasta and some white bread.<br />
<br />
Alright, I have a few of my own to add...<br />

chease.<br />
aluminum foil. (optional)<br />
toster oven. (them little under the cubord type.)<br />
<br />
Take one of the tortilla's warm for 5 secs in nuker so when you fold it it don't break.<br />
Get your self some foil, enough to wrap the tortilla and roll edges,<br />
Now take and put on half of the tortila,<br />
Sauce cover thinly to avid spillage when eating.<br />
put on chease, meat, fold tortilal over place in toaster over set of 400, leave for five minutes.<br />

<br />
This makes the greatest cheesecake ever. From what I can figure, this is technically a &quot;french&quot; cheesecake. Fans of the really thick &amp; heavy NY style cheesecake will notice that this is MUCH lighter and creamier -- and ooooh so tasty.<br />
<br />
CHEESECAKE<br />
<br />
1 3/4 c sugar (1 1/2 + 1/4) <br />
2 c        graham cracker crumbs <br />
1/4 c + 1 T butter <br />
4         eggs <br />
3         (8-oz pkg) cream cheese <br />
1 1/2 t vanilla <br />
1 1/2 pints sour cream <br />
<br />
Bring cream cheese to room temp. (If you're in a hurry and realize that the beaters are getting too stuck in the cream cheese, microwave the cream cheese for 10-15 seconds at a time to soften it a little). <br />
Melt butter (can nuke this too). <br />
<br />
Coat the bottom &amp; sides of a spring form pan with non-stick cooking spray or grease. <br />
Wrap a sheet of aluminum foil around the outside of pan to prevent leaking. (First time I made this, it leaked, and every fire alarm in the house went off /grin)<br />
<br />
Combine 1/4 c sugar, graham cracker crumbs, &amp; butter. <br />
Press into bottom &amp; sides of pan to form crust. This mixture will seem dry, but do NOT add more butter.<br />
<br />
Combine cream cheese with 1 1/2 c sugar; beat well. <br />
Add vanilla. <br />
Beat in 4 eggs (one at a time) <br />
Fold in sour cream. <br />
Pour into pan. <br />
<br />
Preheat oven to 350∞ F. <br />
<br />
Follow directions &amp; no peeking! <br />
Bake cheesecake for 50 min. <br />
Turn off oven &amp; let stand in oven for 2 hrs without opening door. <br />
Remove from oven; let stand at room temp. for 1 hr; refrigerate until cold. <br />
<br />

<br />

Spread soup over meat and sprinkle soup mix over the top. <br />
Fold foil over meat &amp; seal securely (make a sort of tent).<br />
Cook in 300∞ F oven for 4 hrs.<br />
<br />

Prepare turkey by soaking in cold water for approximately 2 hours to firm meat, and insure is bloodless. <br />
Open breast either from end or across top bulge, whichever is preferred, and stuff with grapes, making sure no stems are put in meat. If opened across top, close cut with toothpicks or cooking twine, and place breast in foil lined roasting or baking pan. <br />
Roast at 350 for approximately 2.5 hours, then smother breast with raspberries and continue to roast for 1 additional hour. <br />
When ready, a reddish crust should have formed across breast and bottom of foil. <br />
Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly for slicing. <br />

My turn!  <br />
<br />
INGREDIENTS:<br />
<br />
Cookie:<br />
1 cup, butter (softened)<br />
1 package, instant chocolate pudding<br />
1 egg<br />
2 cups, flour<br />
1/2 cup, sugar (the sugar does not go in the mix!)<br />
<br />
Filling:<br />
any kind of jam you like or use maraschino cherries<br />
<br />
Topping:<br />
3 tbsp, butter<br />
2-3 squares, semi-sweet chocolate or some melted chocolate chips<br />
<br />
DIRECTIONS:<br />
<br />
- cream butter and pudding mix together<br />
- beat egg and add to mixture<br />
- mix in flour<br />
- roll mixture into balls<br />
- roll balls in sugar<br />
- place on lightly greased baking sheet and make a thumbprint in balls (for the filling)<br />
- bake at 325 F for 15 to 20 minutes<br />
- let cool and place filling in centers<br />
- melt squares of chocolate and butter together and drizzle over cookies<br />
- let topping cool and then eat 'em up!  <br />
<br />
Makes approximately 3 dozen, depending on the size of ball you roll<br />
<br />
Crock pot<br />
Pot roast<br />
1- can of reduced fat cream of mushroom soup<br />
1- packet of dry Onion Soup mix<br />
TONS of mushrooms<br />
<br />
<br />
Put roast in crock pot. Mix the 2 soups together. Cover the roast. Cover that with mushrooms. The more the better  <br />
Cook on low 5 to 6 hours. <br />
<br />
I do NOT advise being in the house when making this the smell will drive you crazy with hunger <br />
<br />
Feeds 3<br />
<br />
4 cans boneless salmon (tuna fish sized cans, not the tall ones with the bones)<br />
tube of Ritz crackers (you can use others, but I hate salt and that will affect the taste)<br />
2 eggs<br />
Lemon Pepper<br />
<br />
Get a large frypan and drizzle some olive oil in it, just below medium heat.<br />
<br />
Drain the cans of salmon (save water it if you've cats.. they love it!) into a bowl, crumble the salmon in the bowl, can by can, just to make it easier.<br />
<br />
Take tube of Ritz, crush them in your hands and drop in bowl.<br />
<br />
Mix lightly.<br />
<br />
Add in eggs. Try not to over mix, this will be slightly wet, but not doughish, by any means.<br />
<br />
Add in Lemon Pepper to taste (I start with a good tablespoon)<br />
<br />
Form into patties, the think kind (finger depth), about the size of your palm, you should have enough for six patties.<br />
<br />
About 3-5 minutes a side, they'll turn golden brown... They WILL break apart easily! But they are flippable.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />

4) If you are poor like me, 1 package of imitation crab meat (its just fish that takes like crab and its good :P) or if you are rich and finicky, use real lump crab meat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cook the Egg Noodles according to directions on package.<br />
<br />
Chop up the crabmeat into manageable bite size pieces.<br />
<br />
Pour jar of alfredo into a saucepan and cook on med low stirring the sauce pretty briskly so as not to singe/burn it. Add package of the Old Bay Seafood seasonings to the saucepan and stir it in well. When sauce has become warmed pretty well through add crab meat. Cook for about 5 minutes more. Serve the sauce over the noodles. This is good hot and cold and reheats in a microwave just fine.<br />

Ok...I've been lurking and learning on this board for ages, so I though I'd share my yummy slow cooker soup recipe:<br />
<br />
* 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes with green chilies<br />
* 2 serrano chilies. chop the stems off<br />
* 2 or 3 garlic cloves<br />
* medium onion, chopped into quarters<br />
* bunch of fresh cilantro - discard the stems &amp; use the leafy part only<br />
* 2-3 roasted Anahiem or Pablano chilies (or a can of them)<br />
<br />
Pop all the above into a blender. Whirl until it is a smooth consistancy.<br />
<br />
* two or three potatoes, chunked (I leave the skin on)<br />
<br />
Put the diced potatoes into the crock pot &amp; then the chili stuff. Add broth (I use vegetable) to fill up the crock pot within an inch or two of the top. Cook 6-7 hours on low or 3-4 hours on high.<br />
<br />
These days we fill a bowl half way with rice and then pour the soup on top. Garnish with a dash of sour cream, some chopped avacado and a sprinkle of sharp cheddar.<br />
<br />
This soup is even better after reheating it a time or two<br />
<br />
I have a few good beef jerky recipes (Thanks Ma)<br />
<br />
Ok have two ways to make it one is in dehydrater. One is in oven at 250 haven't done this one so I rely on dehydrater. <br />
<br />
Now I have tasted turkey, chicken, fish, buffalo, beef, snake and deer jerky and all taste good with these recipes.<br />
<br />
need losta your fave meat sliced about 1/4 inch thich and in strips to accomodate the size of your dehydrater. <br />
<br />
Teriyaki<br />
<br />
need to soak your meat for a couple hours in a mix of 2-3 cups terkiyaki sauce<br />
little brown sugar (to taste)<br />
tiny bit of vinegar (about 1/4 cup)<br />
<br />
put in dehydrater and &quot;cook&quot; to your liking <br />
<br />
Football<br />
<br />
3 tablespoons of your fave smoke flavor (ie Mesquite)<br />
3-4 12 ounce beers choose your fave<br />
1/4 cup vinegar <br />
1 tablespoon of tobasco<br />
(optional) shot of whiskey instead of smoke<br />
<br />
put in dehydrater and &quot;cook&quot; to your liking <br />
<br />
<br />
Mild - Hot<br />
<br />
1 can beer you fave brand<br />
1-8 tablespoons tobasco<br />
1/4 cup vinegar<br />
1/2 - 2 tablespoons cayen pepper<br />
1 tablespoon ground chili with seeds (for extra heat)<br />
<br />
after the soak and laying on racks sprinkle more cayen and ground chili with seeds for the extra kick in the gut (also optional)<br />
<br />
Cutmouth (recreation of what you hear about in the western/dark ages fantasy type books)<br />
<br />
1-2 tablespoons of smoke <br />
salt (varies on taste)<br />
some garlic powder<br />
can soak in anything from vinegar to water<br />
<br />
warning this was used to preserve more than for salt replacement and the stuff will be tough as boot leather and taste like ogre hide. A friend made this once and it was the most horrid stuff I had ever tasted EVER. But being the warped person I am I asked for more. <br />
<br />
I can make salt sores in mouth if enough is consumed and your jaw will hurt for a few days (stuffs so tough it took a cannon blast and called it a flesh wound). <br />
<br />
All I gots.<br />
<br />
Winden Wigglebelly's Rice cake delight's!<br />
<br />
1 rice cake<br />
1 slice of american cheese<br />
<br />
<br />
Place square of american cheese in the center of the rice cake. Place your rice cake on a microwave safe plate (I do not recommend a paper towel for the cheese will stick to it). Microwave for 10 - 20 seconds (depending on how potent your Microwave is) until cheese is just melted. <br />
<br />
Enjoy!!! Be careful as they are very hot when removed. You can be as creative as you like with toppings and different cheeses. It does not get any more simple  <br />
<br />
Mini Pizzas!<br />
<br />
1 can biscuits<br />
1 jar spaghetti sauce or pizaa sauce<br />
shredded cheese<br />
pepperoni<br />
toppings can of course be altered<br />
<br />
Place biscuits on the pizza pan or cookie sheet spread apart as you would when making regular biscuits<br />
Squash each biscuit flat<br />
Top each biscuit with sauce and toppings<br />
Bake for about 15 mins at 350 (or until cheese is bubbly and biscuits look cooked)<br />
<br />
You an also place the biscuits closer together to make one large pizza rather than the small individual ones  <br />
<br />
my contribution is for all those that love the taste of a pizza baked in an large wood-fired stone oven and live in a place without one:<br />
Make your favorite pizza dough (6 cups flour, salt, sugar, 2 TBS dry yeast, 1/4 cup olive oil, water for consistency, around 1 cup, in a bread maker works well).<br />
Heat charcoal-fired BBQ grill (gas fired misses the point!), shape pizza dough into managable rounds or ovals (I sacrifice shape for better coverage), let rise for 10 min.<br />
Grill each pizza dough for 2 min per side on the hot grill, you should get a nice puffed up slighlty charred patty. Place on baking sheet, top as desired and finish in oven till cheese is melted.<br />
Unusual and delicious.<br />
My favorite raid food:<br />
1 turkey<br />
1 package of stuffing, celery, carrot, onion<br />
Stuff turkey, put in oven.<br />
cook for 8 h at 275 - 300 F (150 C)<br />
use med breaks to baste<br />
surprise everyone at the after raid party (&quot;how did you do that, did someone bot you at the raid? That takes hours to do.&quot;) <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doomspark Deathfire</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those of us who hate to do dishes, I offer this one-skillet meal:<br />
<br />
INGREDIENTS:<br />
1 lb of ground beef (can also do turkey)<br />
2 tablespoons olive oil<br />
1 package of &quot;Macaroni and Cheese&quot; with the *paste* cheese sauce<br />
1 tablespoon ground garlic<br />
1 tablespoon paprika<br />
Various vegetables to taste - I use 1 small can of mushrooms, 1 small can of peas, 1 small can of corn, and 1 small can of stewed tomatoes.<br />
<br />
This recipie assumes that your ground beef is thawed.<br />
<br />
In a large cast-iron skillet, heat the olive oil. Once it begins to bubble, reduce heat to medium and add the ground beef. As the beef begins to brown, stir in the paprika and garlic. <br />
<br />
Once the beef is completely browned, remove from heat and drain off the grease (this is optional, but healthier)<br />
<br />
Add the vegetables, including the liquid. Stir well. If you use frozen or fresh veggies, add enough water to JUST cover everything.<br />
<br />
Heat on high until the liquid begins to bubble.<br />
<br />
Add just the macaroni and stir well. Once it begins to bubble again, reduce heat to low and cover. <br />
<br />
Cook for 20 minutes. <br />
<br />
Remove cover and stir in the cheese sauce<br />
<br />
Let sit for 5 minutes, and serve.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ingredients:<br />
3 LG Avocados<br />
2 Boneless Chicken Breasts<br />
2 Cans Stewed Tomatoes (I use Italian ones but any work)<br />

4 servings of rice (I use a rice cooker but any kind of white rice)<br />
Spices:<br />
Tumeric<br />
Cumin<br />
Garlic Powder<br />
Chili Powder (or Cayenne peper)<br />
<br />
Take out your favorite LARGE frying pan and put in 2 tablespoons of Olive Oil. Using medium heat put your 2 chicken breasts in the pan and begin to pan fry. Coat yes COAT chicken with garlic, tumeric, cumin and lightly put on chili or cayenne. The chicken should be YELLOW in color. <br />
<br />
While this is cooking grab your avacados and skin them. When skinned cut into wedges. <br />
<br />
Put your rice on to cook now. <br />
<br />
When chickens is cooked through usually 10 - 15 min or so pour in both cans of Tomatoes, all the avocado, and half the sour cream. <br />
<br />
Look at the sauce it should be orange or so if not put in more sour cream till looks orange. <br />
<br />
Simmer for 10-15 minutes<br />
<br />
Serve over White Rice. <br />
<br />
ENJOY.   :)<br />

1 can refried beans<br />
1 jar of guacamole (or you can substitute Spanish rice-a-roni)<br />
1 16oz. container of Sour cream<br />

Bacon Bits (Hormel is my fav. choice)<br />

<br />
Using a 9 or 10 inch plate layer the ingredients in the same order as above. (If salsa is not thick drain off extra liquid for a &quot;salsa concentrate&quot;)<br />

<br />
Ubercyrus' Barbarian Gumbo<br />
<br />
ï1 cup oil (needed if youíre making your roux)<br />
ï1 cup flour (needed if youíre making your roux)<br />
ï1 large onions, chopped (needed if youíre making your roux)<br />
ï5 quarts cold water<br />
ï1 bay leave <br />
ï2 tablespoons Creole (Tony Chachere's) seasoning, or to taste <br />
ï1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves <br />
ïSalt and freshly ground black pepper to taste <br />
ï1 large whole chicken (6-8lbs) (For you sportsman out there Duck works the same)<br />
ï2 pounds smoked sausage, cut into 1/2&quot; pieces (Andouille is best, but Venison works as well)<br />
ïΩ cup chopped scallions (green onions), tops only<br />
ï2/3 cup chopped fresh parsley <br />
<br />
In a large, heavy pot, season the chicken with salt, pepper and Creole seasoning and brown quickly. Brown the sausage, pour off fat. Cover meat with approx. 5 quarts of cold water. Add dried thyme, bay leave and bring to boil and let simmer for 20-30mins. Lower heat to ìwarmî and remove chicken from stock. Pull chicken from the bone and return meat to stock. (You can add carrots and other aromatic veggies to the stock if you wish)<br />
<br />
In a large, heavy pan, heat the oil and cook the flour in the oil over medium to high heat, stirring constantly, until the roux (pronounced ROO)reaches a dark reddish-brown color (color of coffee or milk chocolate for a Cajun-style roux). DO NOT LET BURN! It will ruin your pan and make the roux very, very bitter. If you prefer a more New Orleans-style roux (or just donít have the guts to try for a Cajun roux), cook to a medium, peanut-butter color, over lower heat. Add the onions and stir quickly. This cooks the onions and also stops the roux from cooking further. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, for about 4 minutes. (You can skip this process and buy your roux if you'd like. Many southern US stores now carry decent brands.)<br />
<br />
Add the roux to the chicken and sausage stock. Bring to a boil, then cook for about one hour, skimming fat off the top as needed. Add the chopped scallion tops and parsley (and additional salt and pepper to taste), and heat for 5 minutes. <br />
<br />
Serve over rice in large bowls. Makes about 12 bowl servings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heartsong_Steelsoul</div><div class="date">01-04-2003, 12:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know how to cook exactly two things:<br />
<br />
Chicken and Dumplings:<br />
<br />
Ingredients:<br />
one to two pounds of boneless chicken, cut into bitesize pieces (I prefer all white meat), depending on what ratio of dumplings to chicken you like.<br />
1 1/2 cups flour<br />
one egg yolk<br />
one tablespoon (or less, depending on taste) of dried diced onion, or equivalent of fresh<br />
1/16 tsp of white pepper<br />
Pot of beef bouillon, made three bouillon cubes to a quart of water<br />
1 cup of beef broth<br />
<br />
I suggest starting to bring your large pot of bouillon to boil before anything else.  It should be a deep pot, since these are going to be drop dumplings.<br />
<br />
Brown the onions and chicken.  Reduce the heat.  If there's still a problem with burning, scoop broth from the pot into the pan to help.<br />
<br />
Mix the flour, white pepper, egg yolk and a cup of hot beef broth.  The consistancy should be pretty thick.  Drop the dough into the pot of boiling beef broth with moistened teaspoons.  When they float to the top, scoop them off and add them to the pan with the chicken and onions.  Continue til all the dough is gone.  Cover the pan, and let sit on low heat for about ten minutes to firm the dumplings.<br />
<br />
Serves 2-4, depending on hunger. :)<br />

Maallycious' Unique Spaghetti Saunce<br />
<br />
1-1/2 lbs Ground Beef, browned &amp; drained<br />
1 Medium Onion, finely chopped &amp; sauteed<br />
1 Can (10 oz) Cream of Mushroom Soup<br />
2 Cans (15 oz) Tomato Sauce<br />
1/2 mushroom soup can of Milk<br />
6 slices American Cheese<br />
1/3 cup Parmesan Cheese (or Parmesan &amp; Romano Mix)<br />
1 clove Garlic, peeled &amp; minced<br />
1 TBS Italian Spice mix (Oregano, Basil, Bay)<br />
1/2 tsp Cilantro<br />
2 Boulion Cubes, Beef flavor<br />
Dash of each ~ Nutmeg, Cinnamon, Allspice<br />
1 TBS Pepsi or Coke<br />
1/2 TBS Sugar<br />
1/8 tsp Red Pepper or Cheyenne Pepper<br />
<br />
In 2 Quart Sauce pan, combine all ingredients (minus the ground beef &amp; onions), bring to a boil &amp; then reduce heat &amp; simmer for 15 minutes on medium-low heat. Stir occasionally to prevent the cheese from burning or sticking to the bottom of the pan. I have found that using a whisk is the best way to prevent this. While Sauce is simmering, sautee Onions &amp; brown the ground beef. (I use an old fashion potatoe Masher to get the beef into even pieces.) Drain the grease from the ground beef.  Once sauce has simmered &amp; cheeses are melted, add the remaining ingredientspotatoir well.  Serve over the pasta of your choice.<br />
<br />
**The Pepsi/Coke &amp; sugar cut the acidity of the sauce &amp;  give it a unique flavor.**<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anerak</div><div class="date">01-12-2003, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No one is sure of the origins of the following recipie but OMG it rocks... in fact, it hit the chocolate craving my boyfriends' VERY pregnant sister had last christmas (also a great way to suck up to the future in-laws when meeting for first time ;) )<br />
<br />
On a big island off the West Coast of Canada, is a fair-sized town called Nanaimo (nah-nigh-moe). Back in the day, it used to be a mining town, and it is rumored that the wives came up with this recipie for taking sweets to their men working so hard =)<br />
<br />
These are rare to come by outside of BC, let alone off of Vancouver Island. I have found, though it is featured in the Company's Coming recipie book, and I have found it online in quite a few places. This is my favourite to make, and anyone can make it =) It is VERY sweet, and if you get the 2nd layer creamy enough, it's heavenly =)<br />
<br />
Takes about half an hour or less to make.<br />
<br />
I thought that I would share the goodness with everyone. Please pass it on!<br />
<br />
<br />
Nanaimo Bars<br />
<br />
Bottom Layer<br />
<br />
Butter/margarine     Ω cup<br />
Granulated Sugar     º cup<br />
Cocoa     5 tbsp<br />
Egg, beaten     1<br />
Graham cracker crumbs     1 æ cups<br />
Fine coconut (or med)     æ cup<br />
Walnuts, finely chopped     Ω cup<br />
<br />
Second Layer<br />
<br />
Butter/margarine     Ω cup<br />
Milk     3 tbsp<br />
Vanilla custard powder     2 tbsp<br />
Icing (confection) sugar     2 cups<br />
<br />
Third Layer<br />
<br />
Semisweet chocolate chips (or 4 squares semisweet chocolate)     2/3 cup<br />
Butter/margarine     2 tbsp<br />
<br />
<br />
Bottom Layer:	Slowly melt first 3 ingredients in top of double boiler or in heavy saucepan.  Add beaten egg and stir to cook and thicken.  Remove from heat.  Stir in crumbs, coconut, and nuts.  Press firmly into ungreased 9x9 inch (22x22 cm) pan.<br />
<br />
Second Layer:	Cream butter, milk, custard powder and icing sugar together well.  Beat until light. Spread over bottom layer.<br />
<br />
Third Layer: 	Melt chips and butter over low heat (very strong suggestion to NOT use the microwave - messes the taste up). COOL it slightly (if you donít, it melts into the 2nd layer and doesn't look as clean-cut).  When cool but still runny, spread over second layer.  Chill in fridge.  Use sharp knight to cut.  36 squares.<br />
<br />
~It's not the neatest thing to cut, and I've yet to get my 3rd layer to look professional, but if you scraped lines into the 3rd layer (kinda like pre-cut paper), the pieces will turn out much neater.<br />
<br />
forget about the calories for a day and enjoy! ;)<br />
<br />
edit: and thank you for all these recipies, i'm always looking for stuff to wow my man with since i'm not the world's greatest cook ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a realativly easy one, but please bear with me as i do the coating by sight<br />
<br />
Ingreadiants:<br />
<br />
Chicken Parts (your favorate cut of chicken with or without skin / bone in or boneless)<br />
Flour<br />
Parmesan cheeze (i find that you can use grated cheeze topping by kraft but you can use what ever you want)<br />
1/2 cup of margerine or butter<br />
1+ egg<br />
Salt, pepper and paprika<br />
<br />
Intrustions:<br />
<br />
preheat over to 350F<br />
<br />
In a small bowl beat the egg so the yolk is mixed with the egg white and put to the side<br />
<br />
Mix in a large mixing bowl where you can easly put the chicken in the flour and cheeze in a 1/3 to 2/3 ratio (if you put in 2 cups of parmesan cheeze put in a cup of flour) and then add salt, pepper and paprika to taste (as mutch as you and your guests like)<br />
<br />
Take chicken and coat in the beaten egg, then place in the chicken in the flour/cheeze mix.<br />
<br />
Place coated chicken on cookie sheet or other handy pan(should have a lip on it, i find cookie/baking sheets work the best).<br />
<br />
Melt butter/margerine and then pour over coated chicken parts and haveing a small layer of butter/mergerine in the pan.<br />
<br />
Place pan in oven and cook for 20-25 mins or until chicken is done.<br />
<br />
The chicken should be a nice golden color.<br />
<br />
optional: pour a little bit of your fav spagetti sauce over the chicken just before serving.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corii</div><div class="date">01-23-2003, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is my favorite green veggie recipe lately, unfortunately I'm not one of those cooks that uses exact measurements, but this should give you a good general idea. I usually make this in a large non-stick pot.<br />
<br />
1/4 lb bacon<br />
1 onion<br />
4 cloves garlic (optional)<br />
2 bunches of greens (mustard or collard)<br />
1 cup chicken broth<br />
<br />
Wash the greens thoroughly and pat dry. Cut the bacon into small pieces and fry in tall non stick pot until browned. While the bacon is frying, chop up the onion and slice the garlic cloves in half. (here you can drain the bacon fat if that is a concern for you) Add chopped onion and peeled garlic cloves to the pot and cook until the onions are translucent. Cut or tear greens into bite sized pieces and add to the pot with chicken broth. Cover and simmer for 20-25 minutes. Serve with bread to sop up the broth! (It's important not to pour off the broth at the end, because that's where all the good stuff is!)</div></div><hr />

3 parts cocoa<br />

<br />
Blend it in a bowl (I prefer glass bowls), and add enough water to make it fluid (like syrup).</div></div><hr />

Several of my ex-girlfriends still come to me and ask me to make jars of this stuff for them.  WARNING-once you start eating this on a regular basis, you will NEVER like jarred salsa again!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Salsa Recipe<br />
2 large cans diced tomatoes<br />
1 14oz can Rotel (used mild tomato &amp; green chile Rotel)<br />
1/2 medium onion<br />
3-8 jalapenos (depending on spiciness of peppers)<br />
1/2 teaspoon salt<br />
1/4 teaspoon black pepper<br />
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder<br />
1/2 teaspoon chili powder<br />
1/4 teaspoon cumin<br />
lime juice from 2 limes<br />
cilantro<br />
1 cube chicken bullion<br />
<br />
&#61553; Dissolve chicken bullion cube in 1/4 cup of hot water.<br />
&#61553; Place all dry ingredients in large mixing bowl (salt, black pepper, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder)<br />
&#61553; Dice onions and jalapenos into small pieces and add to dry ingredients<br />
&#61553; Squeeze lime juice into bowl and mix up jalepenos, onions and other ingredients.  Stir in chicken bullion.<br />
&#61553; Add cans of diced tomatoes and can of Rotel.<br />
&#61553; Mince cilantro and stir into salsa.<br />
&#61553; Fill blender with salsa (about 1/3 of salsa) into blender and puree.  Mix back into chunky salsa.  Place in clean jar and refrigerate.  Should keep for 4 weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ilona</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The salsa recipe looks good, but what is Rotel, please?  And cilantro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryndar of Brell</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, my bad...<br />
<br />
Rotel is a brand-name of tomatos that come premixed with chiles in various heat tolerances.  If Rotel brand tomatoes are not available, just sub in another can of tomatoes and add some additional jalapenos.<br />
<br />
Cilantro is a fresh herb that is part of the parsley family.  It does however have a distinct flavor.  If fresh cilantro is not available, do not sub anything for it...there is nothing that comes close to the taste/texture of fresh cilantro.<br />
<br />
On a side note, if you do not like super spicy salsa, prep your jalapenos by first cutting them in half.  With a spoon, scrape all the seeds and the ribbing (the yellowish-white core) out of the jalapenos.  This will remove most of the capsicum (the oil that imparts the &quot;fire&quot; to peppers).<br />
<br />
Oh, and for a more tropical salsa, switch out the jalapenos for 1-2 habanero peppers and add 1 small can of crushed pineapple.  <br />
<br />
Enjoy!! :D</div></div><hr />

Chicken Boullion cube versus Chicken Broth<br />

<br />
Here's another quickie-EQ style meal, which I affectionately call &quot;Drunk noodles&quot;. Don't ask. =)<br />
<br />
2 packages of Ramen-type noodles<br />
1 package of imitation crab or lobster<br />
2 eggs<br />
<br />
Start the Ramen noodles going (water - pot - high - boil). I usually break up the hard noodle &quot;pancake&quot; in half or at least so that the cooked noodles will fit nicely on a fork. Save the seasoning packets.<br />
<br />
Chop up the imi. crab into small bite sized bits. In a big frying pan, throw in some oil and fry up the crab - this will help carmelize it a bit and give it some nice brown edges.<br />
<br />
Take out the crab, throw in a bit more oil if you need it. In a small bowl, gently break the eggs like you're making scrambled eggs - just don't make them fluffy. Throw that in the skillet and scoot your spoon/spatula around so that it breaks up the egg into chunks. Let the egg cook down on low while you finish the noodles (brown'em up a bit).<br />
<br />
When the noodles are al dente (a little bit harder than you usually like - that's okay, yer gonna cook'em more), drain off most of the water - but not all. Add in both packets of seasoning (if that's too much salt, do your own seasoning, low sodium soy sauce or whatever). Drain off the remaining now highly seasoned water - try to get as much liquid out.<br />
<br />
Throw noodles in frying pan and turn the heat back up a bit. Just fry them a bit - toss the crab back in to reheat it and grab some of the seasoning. And just fry it for a bit, maybe a couple 3-5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Nummy.  And fast (maybe 10 minutes). =)</div></div><hr />

1/2 jar of spaghetti sauce<br />
1/2 lb cooked hamburger<br />

I haven't checked back here in a few months since I've stopped playing, but I came back to find a post from Denmom on the front page saying that there was now a RL recipe page!  Sure enough one of my recipes was there!<br />
<br />
(And a good thing too, I always lose my recipes... now I can't ever lose that one! /giggles)<br />

And Bryndar, that Salsa sounds fabulous!  (Too bad cilantro makes me very ill  :cry: )  Maybe I can try a batch without it... at least I know my husband will eat it.   :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tyrsa</div><div class="date">02-24-2003, 12:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mmmmm, tuna casserole.  No, really, this IS good!<br />
<br />
1 box of mac 'n' cheese<br />
butter<br />
1/2-3/4 cup milk<br />
1 can of cream of ___ soup (I've used mushroom, celery, broccoli, potato, shrimp and mushroom with roasted garlic, but feel free to experiment)<br />
1 can of tuna in water<br />
<br />
Directions:  <br />
Cook the macaroni according to package in an oven-safe pot (no pots with plastic handles unless you're SURE they won't melt in the oven!).  Meanwhile, open and drain your tuna.  Put it into a bowl and mash it up into even sized pieces.  The more you mash, the less chunky it will be later.<br />
When macaroni is done, drain it.  Put a bit of butter into the bottom of the pot and then put the macaroni back into the pot along with it.  Stir a bit until the butter melts.  Add milk and cheese sauce mix and stir well.  At this point it'll just have really soupy mac 'n' cheese.  <br />
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F.<br />
Now, add your cream soup and tuna, stirring well after adding each one.  You can add a little more milk if the mixture is too hard to stir.<br />
Put your pot of mac 'n' cheese and tuna into the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes.  It should just be starting to get a little golden on the edges.  If it doesn't look done after the 25 minutes, turn the heat up a bit and just check it every couple of minutes.<br />
Serves 2 really hungry people, or 4-6 people on a diet.  :D <br />
Can also be doubled easily, in which case you can use 2 different cream soups together (my husband &amp; I particularly like mushroom &amp; broccoli).  It's even good as leftovers!   :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ingredients:<br />
<br />
2 tbsp olive oil<br />
generous 1/2 cup bacon, cut into matchsticks<br />
1 clove garlic, crushed<br />
1 lb spaghetti<br />
3 eggs, at room temperature<br />
3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese<br />
salt and freshly ground pepper<br />
<br />
1. Bring a large pan of water to a boil. In a medium frying pan, heat the oil and saute the bacon and the garlic until the bacon renders its fat and starts to brown. Remove and discard the garlic. Keep the bacon and its fat hot until needed.<br />
<br />
2. Add salt and the spaghetti to the boiling water and cook until it is al dente.<br />
<br />
3. While the pasta is cooking, warm a large serving bowl and break the eggs into it. Beat in the Parmesan cheese with a fork and season with the salt and pepper.<br />
<br />
4. As soon as the pasta is done, drain it quickly, and mix it into the egg mixture. Pour on the hot bacon and its fat. Stir well. The heat from the pasta and bacon fat will cook the eggs. Serve immediately.<br />
<br />
I found this recipe in one of my Italian cookbooks one day and decided to try it out. I thought it was delicious and now make it regularly as a breakfast dish, although it would be good any time of the day. Its one of those easy to fix, yet fills you up for a while, type meals.</div></div><hr />

Take aluminum foil and make yourself a nice size &quot;cooking bag&quot; with it-you may wish too double or even triple the thickness of your foil bag. <br />
Rub your ribs on both sides with Rib Spice, Salt , and Pepper. Lay your foil bag out open on a flat surface. Generously dumb about half too three quarters of a bottle of GOOD BBQ sauce on it and spread out to cover area ribs will go on. Place your ribs over this sauce . Then dump other half or rest of bottle of sauce over top of ribs. Tightle cover and wrap foil around your ribs. Place on a baking sheet , as even though you have taken great care to wrap these-the &quot;bag&quot; may still leak. If makinf 6-10 pounds of ribs , you can cover and oven rack with foil and place your bags of ribs on it too bake. Bake these ribs at 300 degrees for 3 hours. Take them out -open bags-drain all liquid from them. Put them back into oven for about half hour to &quot;dry them &quot; @ 350 degrees. Generously sauce them up with fresh BBQ sauce and bake till sauce is cooked on @ 350 degrees. These ribs come out so tender and juicy they fall apart, and also the sauce from the bag is literally &quot;cooked through&quot; the neat-every bite a tasty treat:) !!! I am a Mom of 5- and all of my kids friends request I make them when they come over:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 cups virgin olive oil<br />
2-3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced<br />
12 roma tomatos<br />
1tbsp red pepper flakes<br />
1tsp fresh minced cilantro, or 2 tsp dried<br />
salt and pepper to taste<br />
<br />
Preheat oven or broiler to 180 degrees Celsius (350 degrees Farenheit).<br />
Mix the sliced garlic into the olive oil and let sit (the longer the better). Cut<br />
tomatos in half and remove stems, then place them cut side up on a lightly oiled baking tray. Spoon at least a tablespoon of the olive oil/garlic over each tomato half, then sprinkle with red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. Bake under the broiler or on the top oven shelf for 15-20 minutes, until the tomatos look like jam. Remove and sprinkle with cilantro.<br />
<br />
I love this stuff because I can spoon it onto a whole plate (or two) of crackers/melba toast before I log on to EQ and then I have most of a nights worth of bite size snacks at hand. If it's raid night I use 5-6 cloves of garlic, some grated ginger and a little hot sauce to make spicy treat that helps keep me awake.    :)</div></div><hr />

Wash the baking potatoes and either cook them in the oven or the microwave (I cook them in the microwave by puncturing each potato three times with a fork, cooking it on high for 10 minutes, then checking and cooking for another 5 to 10 minutes)<br />
<br />
Cook the ground hamburger or turkey in a skillet, then add all of the ingredients (except the potatoes, of course) and bring to a boil. Let it boil for 5 minutes before reducing to a simmer until the potatoes are done (or at least 10 minutes if you've already cooked the potatoes).<br />
<br />
Cut the potatoes down the middle, but not completely in half, and add the hamburger mixture. Top with sour cream and\or shredded cheddar cheese if you want.<br />
<br />
Quick Chili:<br />
<br />
1 1/2 lbs of ground hamburger or turkey (optional, if you're a vegetarian)<br />
2 cans light red or pink kidney beans (they're the same thing - depends on what brand you buy)<br />
1 green bell pepper, diced<br />
1 can diced tomatoes with onions<br />
1 can diced tomatoes with green chiles<br />
2 packets of your favorite brand of chili seasoning (I prefer McCormick's, and I like the regular, but use mild, as although I have a cast iron stomach, the other people I fix this for do not)<br />
crushed red pepper to taste (optional - I recommend using hot chili seasoning instead if you want heat)<br />
<br />
Cook the meat (again, unless you're a vegetarian). <br />
<br />
Combine all of the ingredients (including the meat if you used it) into a large soup or chili pot, adding the chili seasoning last. AND DON'T DRAIN THE LIQUID FROM THE CANS OF BEANS - PUT IT IN, TOO! Bring to a boil and let it boil for a few minutes (no more than 5) before reducing to a simmer. Let it simmer for about 10 minutes, then put into bowls and allow it to cool a bit for a few minutes if necessary before eating. Should serve about 4 people, but could probably be stretched to serve 5 or 6.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, I like to serve this with a green onion on the side, as it nicely compliments the dish. Cornbread is also a good choice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 bags pretzel sticks (10 ounces to 14 ounces each bag)<br />
1 envelope dry ranch dressing mix<br />
1 cup vegetable oil<br />
1 teaspoon garlic powder<br />
1/4 to 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (depending on how much heat you want)<br />

Put the pretzels in a big bowl.  In a big measuring cup or a smaller bowl, whisk the other ingredients together.  Pour over the pretzels.  Stir pretzels until coated.<br />
<br />
Divide the pretzels onto two cookie sheets (preferably ones with a side so the oil doesn't drip around...if you don't have sheets with sides, line the cookie sheet with foil and make a side with the foil.).  Bake for 1 hour until crisp at 250 degrees.<br />

My favorite snack for gaming is Deer Jerky and this is how it can be made.<br />
 Fresh Deer meat (Beef can be used too) sliced 1/4 inch thick is soaked in marinade for about an hour.My personal favorite is Dale's Marinade,but I have used Allegro also,both produce fine results.Any kind of dark marinade will work if those are not available.<br />
 I then lay the slices out flat not touching in my dehydrator,set for 150 deg and let run for 8 hours.<br />
 If you don't have the luxury of a dehydrator you can also make it in the oven.Place a large cookie sheet on the lowest rack to catch the marinade drippings,don't want to make a big mess :-) then hang the slices of meat on the upper rack not touching each other,turn the oven to 150 deg and prop the oven door open about an inch or two to let the moisture escape.<br />
 Let set 4 to 8 hours depending on oven and relative humidity and walla,a tasty treat for hours of gaming enjoyment.<br />
 Jerky will be done when dry in appearance and whitish strands appear when pulled apart.This is a very basic recipe and some trial and error is involved,but if you like jerky as much as I do,once you get things fine tuned you will be in jerky heaven.BTW,making your own jerky costs about a 10th of what it would if you were to buy it in a store.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The best grilled cheese sandwiches ever.<br />
<br />
Instead of just boring white bread with american cheese, try one of these:<br />
<br />
Whole Grain Bread<br />
American Cheese<br />
a thin slice of Red Delicious Apple<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
White Bread (I usually use something my store sells in the bakery called Bread for Toasting)<br />
Danish Havarti Cheese<br />
a thin slice of ripe, red tomato<br />
<br />
I let my butter set out until soft.  I warm a pan over low heat for about five to ten minutes (this is the secret to cooking the perfect grilled cheese -- preheating the pan).  I turn the heat up to medium, butter one side of a piece of bread, and set it in the pan butter side down.  I lay down a slice of cheese, the thin slice of apple or tomato, and then another slice of cheese.  I butter the other piece of bread and top the sandwich with it butter side up.  Once the bottom slice of cheese melts nicely I flip the sandwich with a spatula.  Then I wait about as long and remove the sandwich from the pan and onto a plate.  I cut it in half and usually eat it with chicken soup.<br />
<br />
I wish I knew to whom these recipes belong... my mother told me about them and they were wonderful.  Enjoy :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ingredients:<br />
<br />
2 slices of Bread (usually a mild bread, like white, buttermilk, potato, etc)<br />
<br />
Margarine or butter<br />
<br />
1 Chocolate option:<br />
*Mini Chocolate chips<br />
*Hot chocolate powder<br />
*Cocoa powder<br />
*Chocolate syrup<br />
<br />
<br />
Assembly:<br />
<br />
Spread a little Margarine (or butter) on each slice of [toasted] bread.<br />
<br />
Sprinkle a little of your chocolate option on *one* slice.  (I find that about a teaspoon works well for chips, and just under half a teaspoon is about right for either powder; feel free to experiment and discover your own preference).<br />
<br />
Lay second slice of bread (butter side down) on top of slice with butter/margarine and chocolate.<br />
<br />
Warm in microwave just till the butter / margarine begins to melt: usually around 10-20 seconds.  (This makes the chocolate soft, so it stays in the sandwich.)<br />
<br />
Enjoy!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donaby</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">this is a recipie I have used several times and it has been a hit.<br />
<br />
also it gets lots of laughs.<br />
<br />
<br />
you will need<br />
1 whole chicken <br />
lots of beer<br />
a lot of salt<br />
a bit of sugar<br />
some pepper<br />
<br />
1. brine the chicken<br />
--put a lot of salt (1/3 of a cup or so) into the bottom of a large bowl<br />
--add a bit of sugar (a teaspoon maybe) <br />
--crack some fresh black pepper in there next (to taste here, I like lots)<br />
--add 1 can of beer and mix (dont drink this, its gross)<br />
--place the chicken in there and cover the rest of the way with more beer (leave 1 can about half full and reserve this)(no reserve does not mean drink it)<br />
--leave it alone for about 2 hours<br />
<br />
2. the bar be que<br />
--place the reserved can of beer into the south side of a north bound chicken<br />
--place on grill with indirect (or for my gass grill the low setting) heat for a long time <br />
--check the temprature with a meat thermometer in the breast, when it says about 170 degrees fairenhite remove from heat and take the can out of the bird, then allow it to rest<br />
<br />
3. eat<br />
the brine and the slow reast on indirect heat with the steam creates a wonderful juicy chicken.  It is very forgiving to the newb bbqer.  Just watch it while it is on the grill,  fires can start and you need to be aware so you can put em out.  more beer would be fun, but water is safer.<br />

<br />
<br />
HERMITS<br />
ingredients:<br />
-2/3 cup butter, softened<br />
-1 1/2 cups light brown sugar<br />
-2 eggs<br />
-2 tablespoons milk<br />
-2 1/2 cups all purpose flour<br />
-1/4 teaspoon salt<br />
-1 teaspoon cinnamon<br />
-1 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves<br />
-1 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg<br />
-1 teaspoon baking soda<br />
-1 cup raisins<br />
-1 cup chopped nuts (optional)<br />
<br />
oven temp: 325<br />
<br />
DIRECTIONS:<br />
*Cream the butter with the brown sugar.  For those of you who don't know what this means, combine the softened butter (not melted, softened) with the brown sugar in a large bowl and beat on low speed until the mixture is well combined and has a cream-like consistency.<br />
*Add the 2 eggs and the 2 tbsp milk to the creamed mixture.  Beat on low speed just until well combined.  Set mixture aside.<br />
*Sift together the flour, salt, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and baking soda.  This is a tricky step, it can be what makes or breaks your cookies.  What I do is sift it all at once, and I sift it at least 3 times.  This ensures that all the powdered ingredients are well combined and evenly distributed.<br />
*Add the flour mixture to the creamed mixture and stir until all of it is combined into a dough.  Add the raisins and the nuts (optional).  Stir until combined.<br />
*Place rounded teaspoons of the dough onto a greased cookie sheet OR a cookie sheet lined with wax paper and bake for 10-15 minutes at 325 degrees or until cookies are golden brown.  Cool for 1 minute and then transfer to wire rack to cool completely.  The reason I suggest wax paper here is that you can have your next batch ready to bake on a separate sheet of wax paper and then just cool your first batch on the wax paper and then transfer your second batch onto the cookie sheet and bake it while your first batch is cooling.<br />
<br />
Yield: a LOT (usually about 5-6 dozen)<br />

<br />
CHOCOLATE DEATH BROWNIES<br />
ingredients:<br />
-1 cup butter<br />
-4 squares unsweetened chocolate<br />
-2 cups sugar<br />
-1 teaspoon baking powder<br />
-1 cup white chocolate chips<br />
-2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips<br />
-4 eggs<br />
-2 teaspoons vanilla<br />
-1 1/2 cup all purpose flour<br />
-1 teaspoon salt<br />
-1 cup heavy whipping cream<br />
-1 to 1 1/2 cups chopped, toasted pecans<br />
<br />
oven temp: 350<br />
<br />
DIRECTIONS:<br />
*Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 9&quot; x 13&quot; baking pan with butter (not the 1 cup butter mentioned in the ingredients).<br />
*Melt the 1 cup butter in a large saucepan.  Turn heat to low.<br />
*Over low heat, add the unsweetened chocolate and stir until melted.  Remove from heat and mix in sugar.<br />
*Add eggs and vanilla, stir until incorporated.<br />
*Add flour, baking powder, and salt.  Stir just until flour is mixed in.<br />
*GENTLY stir in white chocolate.<br />
*Spread mixture in greased baking pan and bake for 30-35 minutes or until brownies JUST pull away from the sides of the pan.  Remove from oven and cool<br />
For ganache:<br />
*Bring heavy cream to a boil over low heat.  Remove from heat and add semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Let the cream sit to melt the chocolate, stirring until chocolate is melted.<br />
*Let mixture cool and thicken, stirring occasionally (approximately 20-30 minutes).<br />
*Spread over cooled brownies.<br />
<br />
*Press the chopped, toasted pecans into the ganache.  Let ganache harden.  Cut into squares, then cut the squares diagonally into triangles and serve.<br />

16 oz. package elbow macaroni OR small shell pasta OR other small pasta product<br />
4 cups cream style cottage cheese, small curd ñ lowfat OK<br />
16 oz sour cream ñ lowfat OK<br />
3 eggs<br />
24 oz shredded cheddar cheese OR sharp cheddar cheese, divided into 16 oz and 8 oz<br />

1 teaspoon salt OR 1 rounded teaspoon garlic salt<br />
Ω teaspoon paprika, plus extra for topping<br />
Ω teaspoon ground mustard seed<br />
Ω teaspoon pepper<br />
<br />
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.<br />
Grease a 3 - quart casserole dish (or larger), either using stick butter or margarine, or a nonstick cooking spray.<br />
<br />
Cook pasta according to package directions; drain. Rinse pasta and let drain again; set aside.<br />
<br />
Beat eggs and spices in a large mixing bowl.  Add the sour cream and cottage cheese, and stir until blended well. Add the 16 oz. cheddar cheese, and stir until blended. Add pasta, and stir until blended again. <br />
<br />
Spoon mixture into greased casserole dish, and top with remaining cheddar cheese (8 oz).  Top with additional paprika if desired.<br />
<br />
Bake to an internal temperature of 160 degrees, usually around 30-45 minutes. Cheese will melt and the mixture will bubble around the edges. Starting temperature of casserole and shape of pan will affect cooking time.<br />
<br />
For a milder dish, paprika may be omitted.  For a spicier dish, cayenne pepper or chili powder may be substituted, but do not top with cayenne pepper or chili powder.<br />
<br />
When making half a recipe, one egg is sufficient.<br />

  Last warning-many of you may not want to read this! this is the recipe for   little gator's famous &quot;Deep **** Cookies&quot;<br />
  <br />
  There are two flavors-chocolate (dark brown), and gingerbread light brown)<br />
  <br />
  I seldom measure carefully so amounts may need adjustment, especially on   flavoring.  The cookies are dense and not very sweet, this is necesssary   so that they will keep their shape during baking.  If you use white flour   or sugar they may be tastier but they won't look like ****.<br />
  <br />
  To make:<br />
  Microwave the honey till it bubbles about 1 minute). Add the butter, I've   been told using lard makes for a more realistic texture and softer cookie)   and the molasses, if any.  Add the egg, mix well, then mix in all the other stuff. Add mix-ins of your choice to some or all of the batter.<br />
  <br />
  Chill 1 hour in the freezer or several hours in the fridge. Roll dough  logs of random length and the diameter of cat poops. Roll logs in  grape-nuts and bake at 350 degrees till done maybe 10 to 15 minutes but  with my flaky oven you never know).   Note: someone with a reliable oven  says it's closer to 20 minutes for him. thanks Paul!)<br />
  <br />
  Serve in a disposable cat litter box on a bed of grape nuts, with a cat  litter scoop.  I hear you get lovely effects by decorating the box and  scoop with melted chocolate or pudding.  I imagine brown sugar might work  as a substitute for the new clumping litters, but I haven't tried it.  I've been told that mixing brown sugar with the grapenuts &quot;sweetens up the  cookie a bit while still looking truly hideous.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  This recipe worked especially well at the Halloween party where the table  was already decorated with plastic flies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mojo is a latin dip, mainly for yucca (like a potato, but more starchy).  It is a garlic based dip, which has many more uses (Mojo chicken, dipping bread in Mojo etc..).<br />
<br />
It's very good and rather unhealthy, but easy to make.<br />
<br />
You'll need:<br />
<br />
1/2 cup of extra virgin olive oil<br />
1 tablespoon of lemon juice (fresh is best!)<br />
2-4 garlic cloves<br />
<br />
Peel and mince up the garlic cloves, then throw all the ingredients into the mixing bowl. <br />
<br />
It's best to use a submersion mixer (like this one on Amazon.com: http://tinyurl.com/39glk but I got mine at Target for $20).  Blend the ingredients on high until the garlic is minsed into a coarse powder, and the lemon juice and oil are completely mixed.<br />
<br />
Chill at least 30 minutes and it's best to use it within a few days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froni Thunderpaws</div><div class="date">04-29-2004, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK this is a better place for the recipes that I was posting than primal scream.<br />
<br />
I'll edit in the other two recipes when I get a chance but here is the raspberry glaze &quot;recipe&quot; - it is one of those make it the way you feel like it recipes, and can be used as a topping, ingredient, or filling.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I usually take about 2 quarts of raspberries (fresh or frozen) and macerate them a bit with a little honey (to taste) and start it simmering to get the juice flowing.  The next part is awful (and if anyone has hints on a better way please share) - take the juice and pulp and force it through a sieve to get the seeds out.  It takes a long time and I alternate between smushing the pulp with a spoon and smacking the edge of the sieve to use a bit of momentum to get the juice out.  Be careful or you will wind up with red sticky goo everywhere - licking spoons is fun, licking the wall doesn't seem appealing.  Once you give up on getting anymore juice out (and don't eat the pulp with the seeds left behind, it smells good but is rather unpalatable) reduce the juice with a lower simmer to about 1/3 the original volume.  You can add small amounts of liquer while it cools - framboise eau de vie intensifies the raspeberryness, cointreau or grand marnier are nice accents, vanilla actually works well, and believe it or not, rosewater in small amounts goes great with raspberries.  (Too much rosewater and you won't taste them though.)  Let it cool and save part for the truffle cake and part for the glaze.  I'll add that when I get home since I don't have the recipe memorized.<br />
<br />
You can use the raspberry glaze to make a chocolate glaze but sometimes it doesn't work.  Melt about 12 ounces of a good dark or bittersweet chocolate and about a teaspoon of butter.   Add about half a cup of the glaze to the melted chocolate and mix it in gently but quickly.  Some of the sugar will begin to crystallize and the chocolate will start to harden so be ready to use it right away (I use it as the glaze for Sacher Tortes).  A little bit of espresso can intensify it but also speeds up how fast it hardens.  And it doesn't always work - sometimes the glaze won't set, other times it goes too fast.  I think it has to do with the amount of residual water but I don't have a good way to control it.<br />
<br />
More when I get home....<br />
<br />
OK here is the truffle cake:<br />
1) preheat oven to 425F<br />
2) prepare a 9-10&quot; springform by putting a piece of aluminum foil on the bottom large enough to wrap around the sides of the pan to keep it water tight. (I hope that is clear - I take the bottom and lay a piece of aluminum foil on it and sort of wrap it around, then I put the ring on and bend the aluminum foil up around the sides) - smear it with a light coating of butter and then dust it with cocoa to keep things from sticking<br />
3) melt 1 pound of bittersweet or dark chocolate and 1 cup of unsalted butter in a double boiler, you want it to melt but just barely <br />
4) in another double boiler (or bowl over simmering water) warm 6 large eggs until warm to the touch (about 100-105F) don't make scrambled eggs!!!  take off the heat and whisk with 1/4 cup sugar until it is tripled in volume and cool<br />
5) mix 2/3 cup of the raspberry glaze into the chocolate<br />
6) fold half off the eggs into the chocolate to lighten it, and then gently fold everything together with a whisk and/or a rubber spatula until just barely combined - no streaks of egg but not so much that the foam collapses<br />
6) pour into the springform and place into a larger pan with about an inch of very hot water (this is why you needed the aluminum foil - at least my springforms leak) <br />
7) bake for 5 minutes and then place a buttered piece of aluminum foil over the pan (loosely) and bake for another 10-15 minutes (it will look molten but it is fully cooked and will solidify when it cools)<br />
8) let cool on a rack for 45 minutes<br />
9) gently pour 1/2 to 1 cup of the raspberry glaze onto the cooled cake (you can wait to do that after the next step, you can heat the a bit to make it flow easier)<br />
10) cover and refrigerate for 3 hours until it is very firm<br />
11) share and enjoy - it is super rich, melts in your mouth, and is really good<br />
<br />
I think the original recipe is from Rose Berenbaum (chocolate flame) and is great for folks who are gluten intolerant.  You can also see why it won't travel well, although I guess it could be packed into a container and swirled with the glaze and devoured with a spoon.  <br />
<br />
I need to find the recipe I use for Sacher Torte, and will post it soon.</div></div><hr />

I have her &quot;Pie and Pastry Bible&quot; -- I knew that glaze sounded familar...  It's a lot of work, but well worth the effort!  I am a very amature cook irl, but I've managed to make a darn good raspberry danish - from scratch - thanks to that lady :)<br />

First thread I clicked on is write up my alley  :upsidwn: <br />

I'm going to a pot luck next weekend and need to bring a dessert containing GARLIC...  The only real recipe I have found so far is Garlic Ice Cream.  I make ice cream all the time for this shindig and really don't want to again.  Does anyone know of another?!?  I thought about creating one myself (lemon &amp; roasted garlic tart, anyone?), but would prefer not to bring my friend's down to lab rat level.  I want something that actually tastes good. ;)<br />
<br />
Any suggestions??  :chef:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froni Thunderpaws</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm...<br />
<br />
There is a German/Austrian/Swiss item called Zwiebelkucken (Onion Cake) but is a bit more like a quiche than a dessert.  If you use something like elephant garlic that is really mild you may be able to make one that isn't overpowering.  <br />
<br />
I did find this (maybe the treatment of the garlic will inspire you to think of another recipe, and it seems like a dark chocolate would suit the recipe better):<br />
<br />
Sweet garlic Wellington with strawberries, hazelnuts and Godiva chocolate served with vanilla bean ice cream and balsamic reduction<br />
<br />
8 cloves of garlic, peeled<br />
<br />
6 cups of milk<br />
<br />
1/2 cup brown sugar<br />
<br />
6 to 8 whole strawberries<br />
<br />
6 ounces roasted hazelnuts<br />
<br />
1/2 cup brown sugar<br />
<br />
6 to 8 sheets phyllo dough<br />
<br />
4 ounces ( 1/2 cup) melted butter<br />
<br />
6 ounces Godiva semi-sweet chocolate, crumbled<br />
<br />
For the balsamic glaze:<br />
<br />
16 ounces balsamic vinegar<br />
<br />
3 ounces brown sugar<br />
<br />
4 tablespoons honey<br />
<br />
vegetable oil for frying<br />
<br />
For serving:<br />
<br />
2 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream<br />
<br />
Render garlic cloves by boiling three times (Approximately 10 minutes each time at low/medium heat) using milk and brown sugar until tender as follows: Place garlic, brown sugar and 2 cups of milk in pan. Bring to a slow boil.<br />
<br />
Add 2 more cups of milk; bring to second boil. Add final 2 cups of milk and bring to third boil. Strain the garlic and save the milk. Place the tender garlic aside.<br />
<br />
Place the milk in the refrigerator to chill until it ready for use. Clean and halve strawberries. Set aside.<br />
<br />
Place hazelnuts on a cookie sheet and place in the oven at 300∞; bake until nuts are golden brown. (Approximately 8 minutes.) Set aside.<br />
<br />
Prepare balsamic glaze by placing the vinegar, 3 ounces brown sugar and 2 ounces honey together in a pan and place over low heat for 25 to 30 minutes. A creamy consistency should result. Remove from heat and cool.<br />
<br />
Place phyllo dough flat and spray or brush each layer with melted butter, stacking as you go.<br />
<br />
Stuff the phyllo dough with the cooked garlic and prepared strawberries; sprinkle hazelnut and the crumbled Godiva chocolate. Roll up the phyllo dough like a spring roll, tucking in ends.<br />
<br />
Heat a deep pan or deep fryer containing vegetable oil or peanut oil (the oil should reach 350∞). Place the phyllo roll in the oil for 4 to 5 minutes or until golden brown. Remove and drain briefly.<br />
<br />
To serve, cut the Garlic Wellington in diagonal pieces and place it over the chilled cream (milk residue) along with the vanilla ice cream. Drizzle the plate with balsamic glaze.<br />
<br />
Makes 2 servings.</div></div><hr />

(I hate deep frying stuff like that - mine generally explode or unfold and make a huge mess.)<br />
<br />
Do some web searches on garlic festival recipes to see if you find something you like better, that recipe looks tasty but I would likely make it without the garlic.  :chef:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hyelaw</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you Frondi /cheer!  I searched for garlic dessert recipes but never thought to search for festivals.  I will keep that in mind for next time.<br />
<br />
I'm not a big phyllo fan, so I kept it traditional to a wellington and used puff pastry.  It was a hit at the party and no one else brought a dessert (Big surprise lol).  In case anyone else wants to make it, here's what I did. ;)  I baked it at 350 degrees for about 35 min. and brushed water on and sprinkled sugar on top.  I didn't melt the chocolate but just broke it into pieces and stuck it inside.  I used frozen puff pastry dough which is much easier than attempting to make it from scratch.<br />
<br />
I tried it first because I was so curious and you could taste the garlic.  But after we ate the entire meal, and the garlic taste was gone.  Everyone talked liked it!  The custard sauce was good with the little hint of garlic.  I made it thicker by tempering 2 egg yolks and adding them in.   :chef:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paalrh</div><div class="date">05-25-2004, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This recipe is hard to set excat number of ingrediants since it depends on personal taste and how thick you cut your bread<br />
<br />
You will need:<br />
Egg<br />
Bread<br />
<br />
first you start warming up your frying pan, butter isnt needed.<br />
You then start whipping some eggs in a bole *NOTICE* the bole must be large enough for your bread to fit in it.  At normal thickness 1 egg pr pice of bread should suffice. <br />
<br />
You dip the bread in the eggs making sure the bread is soaked in the eggmix.<br />
Then you put em on your frying pan.<br />
<br />
a tip is that when the first side is done you turn it over then u ut a slice of pineapple on teh finsihed sice and cover it in cheese. by the time the other side is done the cheese should have melted.<br />
<br />
adding spices to the egg mix is alo a posibility.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nishi</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gyozas <br />
Gyozas originate from China and is a very popular dish across Japan. Other names for Gyozas are: Chinese Dumplings, Potstickers.<br />
<br />
This type of food takes time to prepare, but is a wonderful snack to munch on during EQ, or any other time really.<br />
<br />
There are 2 ways to prepare this dish. Fried and Steamed. I will explain how to cook it both ways.<br />
<br />
Ingredients<br />
<br />
1 -  2 lbs of fresh ground pork<br />
 Small portion of fresh ginger root, shredded OR 2 TBS of fresh cut ginger. Try to avoid dried ginger, doesn't taste as well.<br />
 Chinese Cabbage, chopped <br />
 Bok Choy, chopped <br />
 Leeks, chopped<br />
 Real Sake or Cooking Sake (called Mirin)<br />
 Soy Sauce<br />
 1 - 2 packages of Chinese Dumpling skins (You may subsitute for Wonton Skins if you wish or cannot find dumpling skins. You will find the skins in the fresh veggies section of your gerocery store.)<br />
 Tools for Fried: 1 large deep skillet, 1 pot of boiling water, canola oil (Not a lot.)<br />
 Tools for Steamed: A Steamer, or a large wok and bamboo steamer set.<br />
<br />
------<br />
Ingredients for Dipping Sauce (Optional)<br />
<br />
 Soy Sauce<br />
Rice Vinegar<br />
Hot Chili Oil<br />
<br />
Mix together to your liking!<br />
<br />
Prep time!<br />
<br />
You want to aim for about 50% veggies to ground pork. After you have chopped up the leeks, cabbage and bok choy, you will need to use a cheese cloth OR towel and  let the cloth/towel absorb the water from it. This will probably take about 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
After you have tried out the leeks, cabbage and bok choy, grab a large non-metal bowl and mix together: Leeks, Cabbage, Bok Choy and Ground Pork. After you have mixed these together, add in the ginger. Mix in the ginger well. Add in about 2 TBPS of Sake and Soy each. Add more to taste if you like. <br />
<br />
 Now come the fun part! Give yourself a good place to sit, because this is the longest part of the whole recipe. This is where you put together the gyozas. Make sure you have a large working area. You will want the bowl of ingredients, the skins, a small bowl of water (doesn't matter if it's cold, warm or anything. Just not boiling. You'll hurt your fingers!), a place to assemble the gyoza and a safe place to put the finished assembly.<br />
<br />
You can use a spoon/fork, but personally I use my bare hands. After I clean them thoroughly of course.<br />
<br />
1. Place 1 skin flat. <br />
2. Grab a small glob of 'gyoza stuffing' (the stuff in the bowl you just prepared) into the middle of the dumpling skin.<br />
3. With a finger, place it in the small water bowl and wet the edge of the skin, all the way around.<br />
4. Fold the skin in half, and pinch in the middle. <br />
5. Keep 1 hand pinched in the center. Starting from the right side, push the side in and pinch the bottom edge closed.<br />
6. Fold the top edge in so it's pleated on both sides.<br />
<br />
<br />
Repeat for the left side. You can do it left to right.. you could use gyoza crimpers, I don't care how ya do it, but this is the traditional way to fold a gyoza. If you use crimpers, or just flat out just pinch it all together without pleating, make sure the bottom of the gyoza is flat and able to stand up like a sun setting. This will make the frying/steaming MUCH easier.<br />
<br />
Whew! You're done making all of those gyozas! Now comes the cooking! Oh no, you're thinking this will be a pain too huh? Nope. Just as easy as making the gyoza filling really.<br />
<br />
Instructions for Frying<br />
<br />
In the deep skillet, if it's already nonstick, place in the gyozas and set it to about medium heat. Make sure they are standing up correctly, like a setting sun. If it's not, add in a little oil so they do not stick to the bottom. Let them sit for about 2 minutes, so the bottoms are set.<br />
<br />
Remember above I said a pot of boiling water? Well here we get to use it.  Fill the pan to 3/4th height of the gyozas and cover. Set to high and let it cook for about 4 minutes. The gyozas should soak in the water. If there is excess water, drain it after you are done cooking this set. Turn the heat back down to medium, let it cook a little longer, uncovered. Add in a little oil between the gyozas. Repeat until all gyozas are cooked. Make sure to take one out once in a while and split it open to check to make sure it's cooking all the way if you are unsure. Adjust the cook time if it's not being cooked all the way through.<br />
<br />
Instructions for Steaming<br />
<br />
Electronic Steamer: Follow your manufacturers manual for operation.<br />
<br />
Bamboo Steamer: Place your wok on the oven and set it to high. (or, if it's electronic, turn it on to highish setting). Add in the boiling water, to cover a good portion of the bottom. Load up the bamboo steamer with gyozas. I usually use a 3 or 4 layer bamboo steamer. Set it in the wok. It should not touch the bottom of the wok nor should the water be high enough to touch the bamboo steamer. Once everything is in place, cover and let it steam for a while. About 20 minutes I do believe. Chances are, if you have a bamboo steamer, you already know your usual steaming length. It varies a lot on the size of the wok and how big the bamboo steamer is, in my experience.<br />
<br />
I hope you have enjoyed this recipe. While it is time and labor intensive, I find it very fun and tasty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's something I tried recently. I hope it works as well as it did for me. <br />
<br />
---<br />
Ingredients<br />
---<br />
<br />
1 Beef Roast, OR 4 to 6 Beef Rib Steaks Trimmed of fat, but not all of it. (NOT FROZEN)<br />
3 to 5 packages of Grand Biscuit dough (Or if you feel like being odd, you can use cinnamon rolls dough)<br />
2 or 3 bottles of your favorite BBQ sauce (or even your homemade stuff! MMM!)<br />
1/2 C water (or more as needed)<br />
1 C onions, chopped (Optional)<br />
1 - 2 TBS of Molasses<br />
1 - 2 TBS of Mustard (of your choice)<br />
-<br />
<br />
Set the slow cooker to low, if you are going to use roast, it's best to do this over night. Or if you feel like cooking all day, slow cook for about 8 hours.<br />
Add in BBQ sauce, Molasses, Mustard, Water and Onions.<br />
You'll wanna slow cook for about 6 to 8 hours for Beef Rib Steaks as well.<br />
<br />
Once it is all cooked, shred the roast with a fork (should be able to do that with the beef rib steaks too.. I made it with the steaks last time)<br />
<br />
Once it's all prepared and out of the slow cooker juices, add in 1 to 2 bottles of your favorite BBQ sauce to the shreded beef, add in some more chopped onions if you wish. Stir well.<br />
<br />
Open package of grand biscuits. IF YOU ARE USING CINNAMON ROLL DOUGH --- Please roll it into a ball first, then roll it out.<br />
With a rolling pin, roll out the biscuit dough one at a time. With a spoon, spoon in a glob of shredded BBQ and wrap it into a ball with the dough.<br />
<br />
Repeat until all dough is used, may end up with left over BBQ, or might not. <br />
<br />
Place on a cookie sheet, set to 350 and cook for about 20 minutes, or until buns are golden brown.<br />
<br />
Tadah!~ Tasty! Can do this with Sloppy Joes as the filling, or ... well, anything you want honestly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pesmerga</div><div class="date">03-12-2005, 01:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good lord that's alot of scrolling.  <br />
Okay, here's a recipe for chicken quesedillas for people who like to cook but don't like to read alot to do it.<br />
<br />
Chicken Quesedillas.<br />
<br />
Brown chicken in a skillet, I usually use preseasoned skinless grilled breasts, cut the chicken into thin strips.<br />
Take 2 large burrito sized tortillas spread the chicken evenly on half of each tortilla and cover it with shredded mexican cheese.  If you're not sure what mexican cheese is... it's basically a preshredded mix of mexican cheeses, same thing you'd get if you went to a decent restauraunt and ordered quesedillas there.  The next step is to fold each tortilla in half and cook on low until the tortillas are toasted and the cheese melts.  If you like things spicy, put red cayenne pepper hotsauce over the chicken and cheese when you fold them over to melt.  When each side is browned cut them into wedges, they usually fit like a small pizza on a plate.  Finally just dump some salsa in the center and add sour cream to the top.  It's not a complicated process, it's good slow cooked food that you can pretty much make while playing EQ.</div></div><hr />
