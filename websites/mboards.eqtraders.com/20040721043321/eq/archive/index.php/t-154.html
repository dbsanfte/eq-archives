<br />
Just a reminder that Treebender is one of the 250 Tailors on Drinal and is a wood-elf,  so I can and have made all the Cultural armour. Also getting closer to fletching skill 250 at 235 atm so Cultural Bows are an option also.<br />
<br />
<br />
*edit*  see sig below for skills</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sebilrazen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm a 250+ baker(with spoon ) available most evenings from 9pm cst to midnight, i'm a druid so i can deliver or come help with quest items too, my prices tend to be extremely low compared to all other traders, I also take large orders for guild events/raids, only request is if you want hero/halas please provide the meat as I can't hunt valor or HoH yet, and I don't feel the urge to spend time in everlost with jack and his darn bear that don't like wolf form..grrr. :twisted: your day is coming jack...so any baking needs PST to sebilrazen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Figg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Figg is my main tradeskiller with 200 in many skills, 250 halfling karana tailor, and a woody alt that fletches. made a few of the nightmarewood bows but not actively seeking fletching bussiness. i figure i should let someone whos main skill is fletching take those jobs but will fletch if ya cant find another.  cya all in Toontown!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wold2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Quakr is a 250 skill Barbarian Smith. Available to make Tribunal Barbarian Warrior, Shaman/ Rogue, and Beastlord armor.<br />
(Have never made the BL armor, though).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mellen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mellen is a GM Baker, Smith (High elf) &amp; Brewer<br />
<br />
not too bad of a potter either =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KiRahann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Human Grandmaster Blacksmith (250) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Reflan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">EDIT --  skills went up enough that I'm substantially rewriting here.<br />
<br />
Blarg, 63 rallos zek ogre shaman, is raw skill 250 in baking and pottery, 243 in smithing, 241 brewing, 200 JC.<br />
<br />
Faction with Thurgadin is fine for Thurgadin-related items at this time.<br />
<br />
Can also trade ability to imbue emeralds with my druid and jade with my ogre shaman with others for their tradeskill needs at cost of components(including failures).  Vials of various types of mana vials, or imbues, will get you plenty of imbued gems.<br />
<br />
(edit) POTTERY now 246(252 with geerlok), JC is 200, Brewing 200.  Baking stuck at 250. ;)<br />
(EDIT AGAIN 6/13/03) RAW SKILLS: SMITHING(243), Pottery 250, Brewing 241, Baking 250, JC 200 -- so two more skills up to max with geerlok than before</div></div><hr />
