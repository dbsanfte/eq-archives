<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>greenwood_d</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
I got into this game knowing full well I would become an EQ addict. My nephew has been playing for a long time from the US.  As a surprise, I logged in and sent him a /tell.  Now gone on 5 weeks and I am still playing.<br />
<br />
I had to stop for a minute cause I like stories behind the games as much as the games.  I have read the book with the original game Kunark Velous etc etc.  They kept getting shorter each time.<br />
<br />
So my question is how do i find out the storyline of the game (or better yet where can I)?  I noticed in the library there are books you can buy for 0 nada - are these part of the storyline?  Anyway since I am new to even Kunark - A little behind :D - I would like to catch up.<br />
<br />
Pls tell me anything or anywhere that can help to tell me what the game is about story wise - and hopefully not about how many chara you got to 65 how fast and with what tradeskills and weapons/armor you have. :)<br />
<br />
TY GL and GH</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are places in the game that have books. :)  <br />
<br />
The EQ Web site also has some of the &quot;historical&quot; fiction.  <br />
<br />
And of course, the Story Window (ALT+N) brings up a window of text pieces about the on-going story.  <br />
<br />
Starting cities usually have a &lt;Town Crier&gt; guy who sells newspapers.  These are not often updated, but are good for some tid-bits.</div></div><hr />

If you got the LoY expansion, there is a storyline bottun that looks like a comic book bubble authors put the words in.  There is also a story line that goes along with the LDoN adventures.  You get a little bit of information for every couple of adventures you win.  Example is North Ro and the Tak adventures.  The storyline tells of how the elves used to live in Ro, but the deserts started to devoure the forests.  It is interesting, and i read it, instead of just clicking fer the stats on the charm augment.  There is also some history throughout Norrath, as well as on the EQ main web site.  I hope this helps out.  :&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You might also like the Seekers of Lore (http://www.loreseekers.com/?loc=books.php3) website.  That particular link is to their literature section.  It is REALLY old, as in pre-Luclin and possibly pre-Velious, but history is history after all.  I don't believe many if any of the books they have listed there have changed.<br />
<br />
Many of them are just recipe books but those sometimes have story to them.  There are some very good Kunark books though.<br />
<br />
You should also check out the PoK Library.  There are numerous vendors in there scattered all over the place who have books you can &quot;buy&quot; for free.  I haven't looked very closely but I think they're history books.<br />
<br />
Oh and there's the Book Listing on Lucy (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/booklist.html).  The data there is gathered when people run the Lucy item collector program while playing EQ; it automatically gathers the info and adds it to the database.  That means that it can sometimes show stuff we weren't meant to see and can be confusing.  It also means that their book listing shows every single book or note that can be read in the game, including the guild notes for every race/class/deity combination in the game.  So you'll be doing a lot of fishing through unimportant stuff.  But...it's there if you exhaust the more direct sources. :)</div></div><hr />
