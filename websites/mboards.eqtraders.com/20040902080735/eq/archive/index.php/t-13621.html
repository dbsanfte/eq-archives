Yeah, probably when I'm high enough level to get the AAs for NTM. My main is only 37th level right now and frankly I've only been playing since mid Sept 2003. I'm NOOOOOB. :)</div></div><hr />

grats.  race you to get a backpack of picnics made hehe.  jk.  picnicing is grueling.  Not as grueling as pies, though I don't regret doing those. :)<br />
<br />
Last night I was actually the only person selling picnics in the bazaar and when I woke up this morning, still the only person. Very odd even for Stromm.<br />
<br />
For those of you interested, I took a pretty standard route with only a couple of deviations. Crunchies, fishrolls, patty melts, pies, picnics. I made a few truffles on the way. And when I fell into a free stack of brownie parts, I made Holy Cake for a teeny bit too. Did a couple of combines in the liquidized meat level for a friend's Grobb's combines. And some Jord Meat pies when my hubby found a few stacks someone had sold to a vendor.<br />
<br />
Would I change any of that? Probably. I'd probably take advantage of more of what I killed in my formative levels with my main. I cringe thinking about the wolf meat I sold back to the Halas vendors. And I'd probably make a wider of variety of things just to say I had done it.<br />
<br />
I averaged about a skillup every two stacks of combines post 180, with one noticeable exception where I went on a run of 1200 Halas10 pies (yield 6, so 200 combines or 10 stacks) where I got a single skillup in the middle of everything.<br />
<br />
And I got a screenshot of my first picnic customer after I GM'd. She thought it was a hoot that I was taking her pic and promptly bought 2 more stacks. Yay me! :)<br />
<br />
Edit: Typos and forgot one meat type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i hated pies.  i went back to picnics.  have a lot of mammoth meat in bank for if i get cray or the new ui.  they sell for less take longer and cost more to make than picnics do imo.  <br />
<br />
i do pop stuff and go back and bake fun things.  dragon steaks are awesome.  once i kill my first dragon i am force eating one.  :D  got past the triv in brewing for dwarven ale and went back to make a stack of the double brewed stuff.  :)  then proceeded to get me and several friends drunk hehe.  <br />
<br />
so would you say making picnics is no picnic?</div></div><hr />
