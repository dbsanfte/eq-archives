You want to make money, I want to help you hook up with players who need your goods. If you've got tradeskill items to sell, or a skill to offer (i.e., wedding services, weapon sharpening, guide services) go to the Marketplace forums on the message boards with your ad. Please be sure to post under the proper server forum and include all important information, specifically what you are offering (i.e., not just &quot;I'm a tailor&quot;, but what types of tailored items you can/will make), and your in-game name. And if you wish, include your contact information in the post. Make sure you are NOT selling phat l00t, selling/trading accounts, etc. The Marketplace is for tradeskills only, please.<br />
<br />
If you haven't already, please post in your Servers Forum.  Thanks.<br />
