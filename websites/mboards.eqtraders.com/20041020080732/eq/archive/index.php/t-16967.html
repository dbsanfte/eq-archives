<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>AlyysSkupre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so Alyys gets bored of killing things and once in a while goes undercover to see what the other races of Norrath are up to.  Disguised as Lutilie, she became a Barbarian Warrior to learn the following: <br />
<br />
Rollian Galothar says 'Are you a young warrior here for [training]?  If not, I do not have time to chat.'<br />
	<br />
Lutilie says 'I am here for training'<br />
<br />
Rollian Galothar says 'Very good.  With my instruction you will craft a set of [armor] that if crafted well, should serve you well for some time to come.'<br />
<br />
Lutilie says 'What armor?'<br />
<br />
Rollian Galothar says 'I will give you instructions to make your first set of armor. Just keep in mind that I don't tolerate those that are lazy!  Once you start something, you should always finish it!  With that said, take this Northern Wolves Plate Assembly Kit.  You will use it to create the various parts of your armor such as [helm], , [armplates], [boots], [legplates], [gauntlets], and [breastplate].  When you combine components in your kit, make sure they are un-stacked.  Let me know what piece you wish to craft and I will give you instructions.'<br />
<br />
Lutilie says 'I wish to craft a helm'<br />
<br />
Rollian Galothar says 'To craft your Helm of Northern Wolf, you will need two Small Pieces of Ore, one Gnoll Pup Scalp, and two Bone Chips.  You should be able to find most of these items in Everfrost.  The ore is most likely sold here in town.  Once you have combined these items in your Assembly Kit, take the Helm of the Northern Wolf Material to a forge along with this mold to create your new helm.'<br />

This is perhaps the most difficult part of your armor that you will create. To construct your breastplate, you will need to find three Small Pieces of Ore, two Ruined Wolf Pelts, and one Spider Venom Sac.  Once you have combined these items in your Assembly Kit, take the Breastplate of the Northern Wolf Material to a forge along with this mold to create your new breastplate.
