The Lazy Chef; How to Become a Master Chef without Leaving P.O.K.<br />
By Demonika Crackedstaff of Erollisi Marr<br />
<br />
<br />
When trying to master most trade skills, you will find yourself spending a lot of money, and even more time. Not so with baking! In this guide, I will show you how to get to level 135 without leaving the Plane of Knowledge (P.OK.), and spending considerably less than you would on other trade skills. I suggest you read the guide in its entirety before starting, as some of what I say later on could be useful to those starting out.<br />
<br />
To begin with, like any other trade skill it is important to get your wisdom or intelligence (Which ever is easier or more useful) as high as you can. This can be done during the character creation phase if you are starting out, or by using magical items or spells.<br />
<br />
Next, ask yourself this question “Am I more cheap, or lazy?” If the answer is cheap, you will be using the ovens placed conveniently around Norrath. The ones in P.O.K. are both in the eastern trader building at locations –88, +230 and –88, +260 respectively. If you feel you are more lazy then cheap, pick up a spit. (These are sold in P.O.K by Savet Ironstove at the eastern trader building, location, –100, +300)<br />
<br />
The final preparatory step is to get your hands on as many containers as possible, so that you can hold a lot of items and don’t have to make 5 trips when you could make just 1)<br />
<br />
And so it begins…<br />
<br />
Your first project will be making batwing crunchies (1 batwing + 1 frosting). Buy about 10 stacks of frosting from Culkin Ironstove (Eastern trader building, location –100, +275) and then run to the western trader building and buy the same amount of batwings from Darius Gandril (Location +50, +1530). Insert one of each into your spit and press combine. Continue to do this until your skill reaches 46. Keep any leftover batwings because you will need them later on. Sell the batwing crunchies and extra frosting (Or keep them if you want, see if I care).<br />
<br />
The next step is making fish fillets (1 fresh fish + 1 jug of sauces). Right near Darius Gandril there is a merchant called Ramos Jerwan (Location –20, 1430) and buy 10 stacks of fresh fish. Then buy the same amount of jugs of sauces from your old friend Culkin Ironstove. Combine one of each until you reach level 86. (Obviously if you run out of ingredients, go buy more. Duh.). Keep the leftover fresh fish and do whatever you want with the fillets and jugs of sauces.<br />
<br />
This is the final step in your baking mastery. This time you will be making fish rolls. This is my favourite step for a number of reasons:<br />
1.	The merchants you need to see are Darius Gandril and Ramos Jerwan who essentially right next to each other, so this cuts down on your having to run back and forth.<br />
2.	Fish rolls are a banquet sized meal and they weigh next to nothing, making them the best food to carry around.<br />
3.	Because of their great qualities, they sell very well. Monks and others with encumbrance issues will buy these off of you in the bazaar for a nice price. I’ve seen them sold for anywhere between 5g and 2pp each. Considering how inexpensive they are to make, this is a pretty tidy profit.<br />
So, buy a bunch of fresh fish from Ramos and a bunch of batwings from Darius (Don’t forget about all your leftovers!) and get to work. I won’t even give an approximate number of stacks that you need, because this step will take you all the way to 135. <br />
<br />
Congratz! You are a master baker! And you didn’t have to leave P.O.K!<br />
<br />
The following are a few tips to either help you along the way, or ways to continue after level 135:<br />
<br />
1.	If you are young and broke, bats are a good way to get experience for the first few levels, and you can get a bunch of batwings off of them.<br />
<br />
2.	If you’re looking to make money, sell spider silks, spiderling silks and low/medium/high quality bear/cat/wolf skins in the bazaar. These are easy to come by, and sell for a lot of money to tailors.<br />
<br />
3.	To get fresh fish, fishing is a cheap and easy solution. Fishing poles and bait can be bought off of Daeld Atand (Location +20, +1430) who is standing next to Ramos Jerwan.<br />
<br />
4.	Speaking of fishing, if you want to give yourself an intelligence boost, go fishing in Crushbone where you can get boar carp. Combine 1 boar carp + 1 jug of sauces _ 1 red wine + 1 vinegar in an oven and you will have glazed carp. This gives you a +4 to intelligence, and trivial’s at 148.<br />
<br />
5.	If you want to continue raising your baking skill and don’t mind venturing out of P.O.K, go on to make patty melts (1bear/lion/or wolf meat + loaf of brad + cheese + non-stick frying pan). Either buy or make a non-stick frying pan, then go to jaggedpine forest and buy some cheese. If good, go to Pergan Darkcloud, location -1100, +3500 (This is handy, because right next to him is a banker. I suggest loading up on as much cheese as you can) if evil, go to Chef Brargus, location +1070, +2085. He’s a gnoll, so make sure your faction is still good with them before running in blindly. Then go to Shadowhaven and buy one of the aforemention meat off of Daliea Saeiersa, location 56, 1704, Eiles, location +163, -47, Tall Joe, location -666, +1788, Nicoela,  location +151, +100,  or Samotal Sedmians location +1150, -1. Then either buy meat in Shadowhaven, or go back to Culkin Ironstove in P.O.K and buy stacks of loaf of bread. Your frying pan will be returned to you on failures.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wouldn't recommend hogging a PoK oven on fishrolls.  Bringing along a spit is much friendlier, as those 2 PoK ovens usually have a line for them, and people using them, that do not need to be using them are a big irritation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kymberlee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree about the POK oven comment, and I personally use a spit. I included the mention of tanaan oven simply for completion's sake. My personl opinion is that it is better to own your own tools, therefore having the freedom to use them whenever you wish, as well as not hindering others from using public utilities. I felt, though, that persons unfamiliar with tradeskills could benefit from the knowledge that until one has money enough to afford a spit, one is not blocked from practicing baking.<br />
Thank you for your feedback! I'm happpy to hear any comments/criticisms anyone may have.<br />
