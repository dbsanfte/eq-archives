I saw 13 tae ew bloods on a bazaar vendor for 200pp each (woot!), snagged them, and went 2/2 on chain tunics, 2/2 on chain legs, 2/2 on 2h swords, and 2/2 on shields.

Do you need regular Tae Ew blood or Thul Tae Ew blood?  I saw some regular Tae Ew blood on a vendor and left it becuase I thought it had to be Thul Tae Ew blood.</div></div><hr />

Depends on yours server economy, but I can't see one ever selling for more than 25kish.</div></div><hr />

Orb of the Infinite Void sells for 25-30kpp...<br />

I could easily see this selling for that much.</div></div><hr />

OoIV is int caster usable.<br />
<br />
Not saying that OoIV should be more expensive, just pointing out why its so sought after. The people that will be using these shields are shamans and clerics that are upgrading (usually from Shield of Bane Warding). For the moment I'm charging about 5k more than SoBW goes for. I'm not being too strict though, taking trade offers, because soon these will be everywhere and cheap as hell since all you really need is 1 tae ew blood.</div></div><hr />

You lose a little in the HP department,but the resists/stats are nice.</div></div><hr />

Pali and SK 1hx dmg is so far behind 2hx dmg, its not even funny.  Add in the lower damage intake from riposies, and you have a clear bias towards 2hb or s or p.<br />

Of course, if you're dinking around, or whatever, being casual, go for the 1hx + shield.  But then, are you going to buy a 20k item for your casual &quot;suit&quot;?</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a level 51 Paladin with a Windblade, Jeldorin &amp;amp; Massive Underbulk Shell... I have to say that I generally do better soloing in LGuk with sword+shield than with the Windblade.  Especially against Casters.<br />
<br />
Sure, after level 55 or so the Damage Bonus really starts to fly... but in the 30's, 40's &amp;amp; low 50's, 1h rocks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Resists, AC and bash/interupt are hard to beat!<br />

If you are the main damage dealer its different :eek</div></div><hr />

She's got a massive dragonclaw shard and a sarnak battleshield at the moment, but I'm on the lookout for tae ew blood so she can make one of these shields for later :)<br />

PS 1/2 bd bracers, 1/1 bd boots, 0/5 bd vambraces at 214 skill+geerlok - not sure if that's good or bad, but was nice to get some new armour :)  Still in Koada'dal and acrylia otherwise.</div></div><hr />

Don't forget the increased riposte damage (yours) with a windblade versus a MDS or the like.  Sure I riposte about 2 percent of the time, but every little bit helps.<br />
<br />
The only times in the last 6 months I've used a shield is on AEing mobs for extra resists (SBS) and pulling for extra HP (ashenbone).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kokomo</div><div class="date">01-23-2003, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is an interesting shield for SK.  I use the rainbow shield (sv all 20) when pulling casters, but this one is definitely an alternative for that.  Lodi shield goes to the back slot, btw.  Quite situational for SK, a wonderful shield for any casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amphitryon001</div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont buy this 'not on the ball' stuff by not carrying a windblade or other huge 2 hander<br />
<br />
yes, the dmg is greater per hit and is useful if you are one of many melee in a crowd..but as a soloer or a MA..an SK is much better served by a sword/sheild combo..the added AC and stats are needed for the INT leaning races (like DE and erudite)<br />
<br />
I much prefer my Tae Ew sheild + greenmist (18/22) with my 41% permanent haste..specialy when solo..when you miss with that 2 hander..it seems like an eternity untill the next swing..and all the while the mob is beating on you..1 hander is a much better aggro getter/keeper and is a much more consistant source of melee damage..and if you are a smart SK, you are using your spells heaviliy..being able to bash (stun) to get  a spell off is invaluable<br />
<br />
between the AC &amp; Stas given to me on this shield/sword combo..id lose WAY too much going two-hand all the time....the 10+ INT loss alone would like losing 3 casts of Spear of Plague (thats 1200dmg!!)..i dunno..i prefer to play my SK as a hybrid..not a warrior wannabe<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
now the fact that the shield is ENORMOUS and my lil inky head just barely pokes over the top is something else..looks like im carrying around the hood of a Camaro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morgrist</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a 45 SK. I like every bit of AC/resists I can get,thanks. This looks decent for that.<br />
 <br />
And frankly,I prefer 1H/Shield over 2H in most cases. I need to absorb punishment more often than being the primary damage dealer-and that means a fast aggro and good AC/resists.</div></div><hr />
