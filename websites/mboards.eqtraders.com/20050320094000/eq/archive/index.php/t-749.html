However annoying it is, I can understand the lag in the bazaar.  I feel lucky though that mine isn't as bad as most because I have pretty good specs for my computer.   But I am also getting a lot of lag in DSP. However much lag is annoying in bazaar, it is tolerable because I am not doing any fighting. But the last thing I want is lag when I am in the middle of a fight.  <br />
<br />
I think the bazaar is hopeless with all the people in it, but with DSP and most other Luclin zones, can I get rid of it or most of it? I know you can turn things off, but I would rather leave them on if i can because well, I want to see the extra colors, etc.   Will buying more memory help?  I have 512 DDR right now and am running an AMD 1.7 XP.<br />
<br />
Thanks.   :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fyste</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With the Bazaar it's mostly video lag. If you don't want to turn off options, do two things:<br />
<br />
1) Cut your clipping plane back to zero when you enter the zone. The shorter the distance you can see, the fewer the people. The fewer the people you can see, the less effort to draw them, thus less lag.<br />
<br />
2) Buy a heap-big video card with a MESS of RAM on it. That's where all the work is down for drawing, EQ will offload as much as it can to your videocard. A lot of regular RAM will help, but only to a point. Pump up your video card and that should help a lot.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Didn't read all of it... my bad. But the effect is the same. Luclin zones are high-polygon zones... waving trees, funny mushrooms, lots of grass, all that stuff has the same effect as large numbers of PC's in zone: lots of stuff to draw. A better video card should help you there too.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilosh</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hobbun, two things<br />
<br />
1) It isnt Lag.  Lag refers to network latency. Your ping a measure of the delay between when you send the information to the remote server, and when the response comes back.  When your ping is high, you have &quot;Lag&quot;<br />
<br />
2) What you are experiencing in Luclin is your graphics Card/Video driver choking.   Even if you have a high-end video card , all of the textures, models, and millions of objects that have to be drawn are choking your vid card.  I have heard it said more then once that the people who Drew and Coded Luclin Zone Graphics used very very innefficient code. <br />
<br />
Your best bet is to turn off luclin models (Which I find ugly anyway), and set your video option options to less-intensive settings.<br />
<br />
<br />
As a side note, the reason that the bazaar is so bad is you have 1,000 characters to draw, animate, and update every few seconds....  This is why lowering your clip plane to almost nothing is Marvelous.  So Is looking at the floor.  Both reduce the number of people your video card drawns significantly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hobbun</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thank you all for your responses.   <br />
<br />
Lilosh: Yes, I am aware on how actual lag works compared to having to redraw the graphics, I just normally use lag for a general term.  I should have used slowdown.  :)<br />
<br />
As for looking at the floor, my friends have to do that and they are having to always look up to see where they are going, then look back down to move. Too much hassle.  <br />
<br />
But I think I will try lowering my clipping plane and see how that goes.  <br />
<br />
Thanks again.    :)<br />

I have had to turn off OOC, Shout, and everything else in the bazaar due to people shouting &quot;OMG LAG&quot;<br />

And those of us that know the correct terminology also know what they mean.   :) <br />
