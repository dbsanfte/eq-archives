<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ooby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Have been trying to make these again for a while. Seems that it won't recognize the Shaped Ashwood Recurve Bow. I bought it from some PC vendor in the bazaar and even a Guide couldn't figure it out. Anyone else having this issue?<br />
<br />
UI says that i don't have the bow, yet can click it in inventory and see the name exactly like it is in the UI. Also don't work when i put the items in the toolkit.<br />

Any help would be great.</div></div><hr />
