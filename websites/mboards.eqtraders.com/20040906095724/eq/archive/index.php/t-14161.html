<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Melinia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is a combo of /ooc and /primal scream. I just found out some baaad news and i gotta let it out.<br />
WB has decided to cancel &quot;Angel&quot;. I can't believe this. First I sit and watch the entire season of &quot;Tarzan&quot; and loved it but Poof! they cancel it. Then out of curiosity I sit down to watch &quot;Angel&quot; (heard Spike was joining the cast) and loved it. Now they are slashing &quot;Angel&quot; which has a much larger following. The show is unique and not too sappy like all the dramas that are crammed down our throat (which i shall not name in respect to fans of those shows). :steamed: :steamed: :steamed: <br />
<br />
Has anyone else loved a show but then had to suffer thru a tragic cancellation?:steamed: :steamed: :steamed:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Farnyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its just not Joss Weadon's year. <br />
<br />
Ill admit I watched Buffy, Angel and Firefly. Both Angel and Buffy suffered after about their 3rd seasons. They went from the individual episodes with cleverness and quirkiness to entire seasons which while still entertaining just werent as good. At least in my opinion. The news here reported that Angel got the axe because the show wasnt doing well in reruns, which I can understand since its no longer individual episodes, its hard for newcomers to catch just one episode and go &quot;This is clever, ill watch more&quot;. *sigh* Oh well, at least I still have Survivor, GO ANYONE BUT HATCH!!! (Hes just so full of himself!)<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, Firefly, good show, bring it back! That is all...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My three favorite shows for the past few years?<br />
<br />
1) Angel - in its final season (http://www.thewb.com/PressRelease/Index/0,8341,156980,00.html) <br />
2) CSI (the original series, not Miami) - still alive, thankfully<br />
3) Farscape - dead<br />
<br />
1/3 ... not a ratio I'm happy with, heh.<br />
<br />
And Angel was starting to get better again this season, too.  I do agree, the episodic seasons 1&amp;2 were by far the best season of Angel in my opinion.  Season 5 was finally starting to curve away from the trends of season 3&amp;4 (neither of which I liked particularly much, relatively speaking), and had been looking forward to how season 5 would progress and thinking that a strong season 6 was a distinct possibility.  I guess I'm no psychic :(<br />
<br />
At least I still have a decent number of Farscape reruns that are new to me (but trying to figure out where in timelines things fall is getting harder and harder, heh, as the in-order to out-of-order viewing ratio decreases)....<br />
<br />
Wish I'd seen Firefly, but it premired at a bad time for me, and I eventually just planned to catch up on the 1st season in reruns... hah, that plan didn't work :p</div></div><hr />

I think Buffy ended because Sarah Michelle no longer wanted to play the role. Maybe, just maybe, Spike (James Marsters) will get his own spin off. I love that character. <br />
Unfortunatly I never caught Farscape. <br />
Re: Survivor: I miss Rudy all ready. (I hope I'm that active when I hit 70) Hopefully Rupert will make it at least close to the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Speckocat Catnippurr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Must confess that I've never watched Angel at all and very little of Buffy, but it's sad to lose a show you like.  There's SO much garbage on any more--there's just tons more on TV than there used to be, don't know that the ratio of crap-to-good is a lot different--that when something good goes away, it is indeed a sad day.<br />
<br />
Personally, I LOVED Firefly.  After many delays (apparently including a complete rewrite of script by Whedon) the Firefly movie is supposed to be rolling towards actual production!!  Whoo Hoo!<br />
<br />
Since FOX relegated the show to a time slot that was not compatible with the viewing habits of its potentially best audience by sticking it in the 8pm Friday night dead zone.  For an old married lady like me, it was nice to not HAVE to rent a movie Friday night if we had nothing else to do.  To actually have something good on TV on Friday night is nearly unheard of  for a long time now.  Even Chris Carter's great show Millenium died there (again on Fox :irked:) .  But realistically, Firefly would have done awesomely with the crowd that is usually out on the town on a Friday night (or should be :D ).<br />
<br />
Ok...didn't mean to high jack or anything.  The Angel thing just reminded me of what happened more than a year ago with Firefly.<br />
<br />

/em sympathizes with the brokenhearted fans. :cry:</div></div><hr />

Stargate SG-1. For those who havent seen it, it can be pretty clever at times, which some definately classic episodes. New episodes are Friday at 8pm on the Sci-Fi channel and reruns are... all over the place. So check it out.</div></div><hr />

the shows i miss are cartoon shows.  they are getting replaced with crap.  a new wrestling show where the guys face is a butt and his name is Missioure (french mister however you spell it.) Cheeks.  OMG :eek: :steamed: this replaced megaman which was actually pretty good.  another one was a long time ago now space goofs replaced ronin warriors.  digimon changed to a channel that doesn't have saturday morning cartoons.  and so on.  <br />
<br />
angel has been really sad lately.  haven't even made sure to watch it for a long time.  use to be really loyal.  now i watch almost no tv unless i'm at parents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Melinia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I hate February. something bad always happens. first i hear about &quot;angel&quot;.. Then this morning a local personality passed away suddenly. (Bill Klein) To those not around western NY... He was a radio Entertainment Reporter. He was well known for his Likable personality, love of the entertainment industry, holding an Oscar party annually(proceeds went to charity), and hosting trips to England to experience the London theatre. He would even put in plugs for local school plays. He will be greatly missed in this community.<br />
<br />
With that said.. greatly missed cartoons would have to be the Original Transformers, GI Joe, Looney Toons (original ones).<br />

Is February over yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Transformers: More Than Meets the Eye<br />
I love that show :)<br />
<br />
Still feels weird to go to the Transfomers site and have to look under &quot;Classic&quot; or &quot;Collector's&quot; categories for the Transformers I know and love (they've redesigned the site since then, now using the more neutral, descriptive, and widely-accepted term, &quot;Generation One&quot;).<br />

That reminds me, I should finally get around to ordering a Takara Masterpiece Optimus Prime while there's still a chance to be some instock ...</div></div><hr />

At least we got a full season, and they didn't cut back the episode order.  And at least we'll get a decent ending, because Joss got enough notification.<br />
<br />
And as far as a Sarah Michelle Gellar appearance in that ending, I really don't care, one way or the other.  She was never the strongest player on Buffy.  I tuned in to watch Willow, Giles, and Cordelia.<br />
..............<br />
<br />
A lot of the stronger animation development is moving to cable.  Disney, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network all have some good first-run series. (as well as alot of first-run dreck).  Seriously, I think some of the stuff coming out nowadays is better than Transformers, et al.  I loved those as a kid, but trying to watch repeats of them makes me ill.  Was I really entranced by something that inane?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">you want anime.  in japan animation is just another form of media.  end up with much more mature cartoons.  <br />

<br />
Then there are the ones I haven't seen yet... Full Metal Alchemist/Panic is high on the list. Cary is pushing for Tokyo Babylon next year, and, um, we'll see. Tokyo Underground is a riot. Saiyuki Reload is hilarious ^_^. <br />
<br />
King of Bandit Jing is just... either insignificant or odd. Samurai Deeper Kyou, too odd for my plat. Lain/Furi Curi, Very Very Odd. (And corpse camping to the person who decided it would be 'fooly cooly'.) Strawberry Eggs... My jury is out on this one. Onegai Teacher/Twins. <br />

And that's not getting into the movies. (/hugs Spirited Away)<br />

<br />
Name me an American cartoon that can present a good guy, make you love him... and then make you hate him.... then redeem him. Name me one that can present a bad guy, make you hate him and establish that he is just /eeeevil/... and then turn around and make you cry when he dies. Americans think cartoons should only be funny, only make you laugh... that real people have to do all the drama... sou janakutte. A well done series with good characters, good music, good voice actors, can change the way you see the world. <br />
<br />
<br />
Just don't get me started on the quality of american VA's. Muuuuch wailing. <br />
<br />
<br />
Anime is an incredible genre, and I wish the companies bringing it to America would take it a little more seriously, treat it less as a money maker and more like the art it is. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What Scifi did to Farscape is unforgivable. Babylon 5 was lucky to finish, and Scifi should given FS that same chance. I saw exactly 5 episodes of FS, ever. But they should have been allowed their due. <br />
<br />
I used to hope Scifi would let JMS finish Crusade. Not anymore. I don't trust them, not now. <br />
<br />
And it IS so very very interesting that the good in something is always ousted in 'favor' of the bad, the greedy, the powerhungry, the destructive. I don't guess I have room to talk, because I know I'm not strong enough to leap into the fray and change anything. Poot. <br />
<br />
<br />
but anyway. love anime ^_^<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aandaie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Farscape is the best thing I've ever seen in movies or on Television. <br />
<br />
I saw a couple episodes on TV, then saw that DVDS 1- 4 were at my local hollywood video rental store. I rented them and was hooked, buying the subsequent dvds. Around 2.4 or something I had to start waiting for the next dvd to get released, now I'm up to 4.2 and 4.3 comes out march 23rd or something. <br />
<br />
This is really the best way to watch that show, from the beginning on the quality DVDS. So I'm kind of glad that I only ever saw a couple shows of it on TV then watched all of them in order from episode one.<br />
<br />
I really liked angel and buffy, but Buffy truthfully got pretty darn lame after the glory story arc. In some ways that would have been really a better way to end the series (buffy dying after saving the world and her &quot;sister.&quot; )  I've missed most of Angel for the last couple seasons due to work.<br />
<br />
These shows just don't do well in the ratings, while hospital/cop shows/situation comedies do. Unfortunately I don't really care for any of those that much, so I'll always be on the losing team ;)<br />
<br />
I due hear the continual rumors of a miniseries to wrap farscape up, who knows. The funny thing is my local best buys can't keep farscape DVDS on the shelves. The nielsons really kill shows like this because the fact that a network knows that a lot of people watch the show doesn't make a single bit of difference; advertisers pay for time based on Nielson ratings (and I've never known a single person with a Nielson box, or even a single person who knows a single person with a Nielson box.)<br />
<br />
Honestly I wish that they'd forget about privacy and have a way for companies to tell what cable/sattelite programs EVERYONE is watching, then use THAT info to add up viewership. Things might be very different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Tink, you forgot to put the Greatest Anime Of All Time in bold type in your list. You do get a gold star for mentioning it, though. :)<br />

(You also forgot Azumanga Daioh and KareKano.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Eowenna Celerdain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I miss The Pretender, myself.   :(<br />
<br />
That was especially annoying, because I got &quot;randomly called&quot; and asked to do the survey for the ratings groups.  I marked that show, and gave it all kinds of kudos in the notes ... and they *still* took it off the air.  :mad: <br />
<br />
So I don't think they watch those ratings surveys as closely as we'd like to think they do.  I think they just do whatever the blazes they please.  Their minds are made up, don't confuse them with the facts ... <br />
<br />
I liked the original Transformers, and earliest GI Joe, because I liked a couple of the characters.  Optimus Prime and Duke were great leadership figures.  Once they killed Optimus (seems to be about the time Marvel sold the series to a toy company) and supplanted Duke, both series rapidly declined.  Not all episodes were outstanding, but there were some here and there that had some actual merit in their storylines.<br />
<br />
And yes, the original and older &quot;Looney Tunes.&quot;  Those were once the &quot;intermission&quot; break for Theatres and Drive-ins, back when movies used to come in double features or as such long films that people needed bio breaks built in without having to miss part of the show.  So yes, those were designed to be light-hearted.  The movies were there for the impact.<br />
<br />
I'd guess part of what made the older Looney Tunes so nifty is that they were *not* designed specifically for children.  Somehow they got relegated to children's show hours, then a few folks got to noticing that there were some adult themes in them and took out their scissors ... and the hacked-up result played most frequently on TV these days isn't really worth watching.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
/rant on<br />
<br />
It may be only my imagination, but it does appear that more and more shows these days lack depth.  No depth in plot, little in character.  I can't speak for anyone else, but I'm starting to feel like my intelligence is being insulted.  If it weren't for the occasional better movies that sometimes appear on weekends, chances are that my TV would become strictly a monitor for my VCR.  That's almost what it is now.<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
And that explains one of many reasons why I'd rather log into *gasp* a game than turn on the TV.  At least in the roleplaying guilds, you can invent your own stories and come up with entertainment that beats the ... tar ... out of most options on the other &quot;small screen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Besides, TV's got nothing to compare to the roller-coaster ride we get from trying any single tradeskill combine ... ;)</div></div><hr />

Original Whos Line Is It Anyway? - something about the british cast and the british host was more entertaining to me than the Drew Carey version (though I like that too).<br />

MST3K. The movie was sub-standard IMHO. There must be hundreds if not thousands of episodes though - especailly if you go back far enough. I've seen, on the whole, very few of them. I noticed that they are bringing them out on DVD in 4-episode discs as well as 4-disc (16 episode) packs. I might go that route to get some. :)<br />

<br />
When I first heard of Iron Chef, I was like, 'wtf, they cook for an hour? what kind of fun is that?' But I saw it and it's really engrossing and entertaining. Not a good show to watch if you're hungry and there's no food in the dorm room ^_^. <br />

Are they just pulling a &quot;Buffy&quot; and deliberately running the show straight into the ground? After last night I barely want to watch the show anymore. &quot;Literally -ruined- it on purpose&quot; is the catch phrase of the episode review in my mind.<br />

It's like if the StarTrek people had known they were going out so they decided to make McCoy and Uhura get together while having Scotty die of liver damage, JUST so that no one could rebuild a follow-on show from the ashes and prevent any &quot;fan fiction&quot; as well.</div></div><hr />

Is Spike leaving? <br />
<br />
Spoiler<br />
<br />
Angel: You're not leaving?<br />
Spike: It's what she would've wanted. [pause] It's what I want.  I don't really like you, s'pose I never will, but this is important, what's happening here.  Fred gave her life for it, least I can do is give what's left of mine.  The fight's coming Angel, we both feel it.  And its gonna be a hell of a lot bigger than Illyria, things are gonna get ugly.  That's where I live.<br />
<br />
I took that to be their &quot;Yes, Spike is sticking around, and here's our makeshift plot point to explain it given that Angel and Spike pseudo-hate each other&quot; scene. <br />
<br />
Spike has 100% more personality than Angel.<br />
&lt;snip&gt;<br />
(just started watching the show this season)Aah, that explains it.  Then you missed all Angel's good parts :p (at least in my opinion)</div></div><hr />

<br />
But the show did give way to a spin off for Spike by mentioning there were branches all over the world.<br />
<br />
Just a thought.</div></div><hr />

<br />
a &quot;Spike&quot; spin-off .... a spin-off of a spin-off ?<br />
<br />
In my opinion they need to do a &quot;and then we all woke up&quot; or the show is in the &quot;ter-let&quot; with nowhere to go.<br />
<br />
Gunn fired (fried, in deep debt to the &quot;Sr. Partners&quot;)<br />
<br />
Fred gone (no, really, Fred is GONE, just the actress is still there)<br />
<br />
Wesley loses girl number.... 3?? Sisters if he gets a crush on you RUN!<br />
<br />
Angel ... running a law firm with no competent reliable lawyer?<br />
<br />
Spike ... locked in an eternal struggle ... nifty toys or getting the bloody hell away from Angel?<br />
<br />
Lorne ... listening to Angel, Spike and Wesley ... I'd gnaw my ears off first...<br />
<br />
Harmony ... I -still- can't figure why she didn't get a suntanning party the SECOND that the gang saw her again. (She tried to feed them all to a group of Amway-Vampires remember?)<br />
<br />
Eve ... &quot;i'm the liasion to the Sr. Partners..&quot; Had I been there she'd have been dead before she finished her first line. Just as a warning to the &quot;Sr. Partners&quot; that their pets are not welcome and need to be POLITE and HELPFUL or DEAD.<br />
<br />
I have been WONDERING, though, when the show was going to get around to the &quot;Wolf, Ram &amp; Hart&quot; idea. (Brought up in the trip to Lorne's hell dimension) They had the books, then either lost or forgot them. But now with the magic books that can be any books... and Illiryra (spealling?) to &quot;help&quot; they should be able to get a line on the &quot;Sr. Partners&quot; and do some real damage. (&quot;They were not much more powerful than the vampires.&quot;)</div></div><hr />

YuYu Hakusho is categorized slightly above DBZ and Pokemon, about the level of YuGiOh. Which isn't to say any of that or those is/are bad, just that, um, they kinda end up on/near the bottom of the stack, once you see a wider range of series. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Cantatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Guess I should've posted my review of Wonderfalls in this thread...  A lot of reviewers are saying that it might appeal to viewers of Buffy and Angel.  :)  I never really watched either of those shows avidly, but I do recall a similar quirkiness about them. <br />
<br />
I'm just beginning to wonder how much we're going to rely on the Nielson system in a few years.  It's becoming pretty clear that this system just isn't as accurate as it once was.  With VCRs, TiVo, etc. you just can't get a similar idea of who is actually watching a show.  I'd be a horrible candidtate for Nielson since I usually record everything I want to watch and then watch it all at once.<br />
<br />
Fox, in particular seems to be really bad about going by Nielson and not giving anything a chance.  Family Guy (which is coming back) and Firefly (which is going to be made into a movie) are both clearly indicative of this.  Sadly though Fox never dumps their crappy reality shows.  Seems most of the programming executives forget the fact that shows like X-Files and Seinfeld didn't start off with stellar ratings, but sometimes it takes a while for the audience to catch on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Best Anime Ever:  Armitage the Third (not the Movie, not the second movie... the OVA series).<br />

Then comes Utena, then Dual, then Excel Saga, then Air Master, then Rose of Versailles, then Tokyo Underground, then Scrapped Princess, then Key: The Metal Idol (might have to move that one up a bit), then Ranma 1/2...<br />
<br />
TV shows...<br />
<br />
Star Trek (Broke ground in so many ways.  Tackled issues, had fun and wasn't buried under &quot;regulations&quot;, cultural dogma and Political Correctness.)  This led to...<br />
Star Trek: The Pepsi Generation.  (The level of PC-ness of this show, especially in the &quot;Wesley saves the day again&quot; seasons, was sickening.)  Which led to...<br />
Star Trek: Deep Sleep Nine.  (Look, Sci-Fi can be so boring and inane that it hypnotizes people into thinking it's good!)  This led to...<br />
Star Trek: Women's Lib.  (Aka: Voyager.  Okay, I'm a woman... but could they have made the male characters in this show any less competant?  They didn't need to make all the men wimpy idiots, just so they could have some strong female characters!)<br />
<br />
Now we have Enterprise.  I honestly don't take the time to watch it much, but the episodes I have seen have impressed me.  It's not bogged down by PC (Yes, sometimes the answer is to shoot the other guy!)  It's not boring (no season-long debates about politics and religion &amp; especially no &quot;non-interference&quot;).  And it's not gender-biased.  All the characters contribute equally well.<br />
<br />
Enterprise is probably the closest to the spirit of Roddenberry's original vision, IMHO.</div></div><hr />

Best Anime Ever:  Armitage the Third (not the Movie, not the second movie... the OVA series). . . .Wow. I don't think I've ever heard of ANY of those animes! Well, except for the Armitage ones (I've only seen the movies though) and Ranma 1/2.<br />
Enterprise is probably the closest to the spirit of Roddenberry's original vision, IMHO.Amen! The first series (yes, the one with William Shatner :p) was pretty close to &quot;his vision&quot; too. It just had to much corny-campyness to it to really hold on to the meaning very well.</div></div><hr />

Enterprise is probably the closest to the spirit of Roddenberry's original vision, IMHO.  Personally, I feel that ST:TOS, ST:TNG, and Andromeda take that role, but obviously we have different opinions ;)  I loved first&amp;second season Andromeda, because to me it brought back so many of the high ideals that made Roddenberry shows what they were to me.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed Enterprises earlier episodes, primarily the first season.  The second season was a transition period to this third, where it feels like they have no original ideas.  The plots are all very standard science fiction plots, with no or very minor twists thrown in to make it unique.  They also seem to be blurring and toning down many of the strong individual characteristics of the characters - normal for any show as it evolves, but Enterprise seems to have done this far faster than most.  Throw in the trend lately of revealing the entire show's plot in the previews, which are broadcast right before the show starts (making it hard to just not watch them), and I find it difficult to enjoy Enterprise.<br />
<br />
When they changed Enterprise's intro music, from the raw to the refined, it felt like even they were admitting defeat.  As the show has evolved, its really gone from feeling like &quot;the current permutation Star Trek show, exploring different ideas in its own way&quot; to &quot;an attempt to increase the Star Trek franchise to bring in additional revenue&quot;, for me.  Not even Voyager felt like that :(</div></div><hr />

I wish that I could like the horrible pile of crap cop and lawyer shows they have on. Everyone with a Nielson box watches those 24/7, I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Armitage the Third (OVA series) is available on DVD from Pioneer.  It's the Polymatrix (first movie) story, but much more in-depth and a billion times better voice-acting in the Dub.<br />
<br />
Dual: Parallel Trouble Adventure is also available on DVD from Pioneer.  If you've heard of Evangelion... it's a little like that (kids piloting giant robots), only generally cheerful and funny.  Think Tenshi Muyo crossed with Evangelion.<br />
<br />
Revolutionary Girl Utena, Movie and TV series, are available on DVD from Software Sculptors.  The Movie is the same basic story idea, just told in a very different (almost surrealistic at times) way.  It helps to watch the TV series first, btw.  ;)<br />
<br />
Key: The Metal Idol is available on DVD from Viz... but it's been more than two years now, so many &quot;video stores&quot; probably don't have it.  The story is slow-paced at times, and there's a lot of exposition (characters talking to advance the plot/explain the story)... but I love it.  Especially the music.<br />
<br />
Excel Saga is available on DVD from ADV.  Extremely over-the top comedy that is rediculously fast-paced.  The American voice actress for Excel strained her voice doing the dub, simply because the character is so manic.  The inside jokes (there are lots of those, too) can be easy to miss if you're not a long-time Anime fan...  But Excel Saga is still funny, even then.<br />
<br />
Air Master, Rose of Versailles, Tokyo Underground and Scrapped Princess are not available in the US.  Rose of Versailles is actually fairly old, having been made in the early 80's, I think.  The other three are recent series that are very common on the Fan-Sub circut.  I think Tokyo Underground is licensed for release in the US (but probably not in production yet), but I know the others are not.<br />
<br />
For more information about the Fan-Sub circut, I suggest www.animesuki.com  BTW, having a broadband internet connection is best if you're going to get into downloading Anime. :bookworm:</div></div><hr />

Ranma 1/2 is also a good, if silly, series.<br />
<br />
I'll just about have to agree with the rest of the posters about Anime. It's totally awsome!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Princess Mononoke is incredible... I like it much more than Spirited Away, which received more awards and aclaim.<br />
<br />
Record of Lodoss War is good, but doesn't fall into my all-time favorite list.  It was nice to see the &quot;typical adventuring group&quot; made into an anime though. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Oddly enough, the typical adventure groups from my D&amp;D 'career' tended to be nearer that of Slayers than Lodoss War. :D</div></div><hr />

There already has begun a movement by some viewers to get it released on DVD (which I definitely would buy) or even to have the 9 other episodes aired at sometime.  I needn't express my anger over Fox cancelling this show for fear I'd have to ban myself.  :steamed: Fox really needs to learn to give shows more of a chance to catch on.  Sometimes word of mouth takes a while.</div></div><hr />
