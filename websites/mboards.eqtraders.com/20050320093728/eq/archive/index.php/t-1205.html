Yea... some liberties here &amp; there... but it all worked really well and gods know, if he hadn't we'd STILL be there watching it! hehe</div></div><hr />

TTT doesn't open here until something like Jan. 6!  So I will personally convince the RNG to give you horrible runs on tradeskills if you spoil the plot.   :twisted: <br />
<br />
Oh, wait a minute, the plot is already in the book.  Doh!  And I've already read it.  Several times.  Double doh!<br />
<br />
Of course, if I could really do that, I'd convince the RNG to give me great runs when doing my own work too, but that's another story.  /sigh</div></div><hr />

I'm going with my boyfriend.  We've both been waiting for it all year.  Take your S/O with you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My attractive woman isn't the one that WANTS to go, and explaining to her why going to see a movie at 12:01 am is worth it just wasn't working for me.<br />
<br />
Shockingly I may get to see it tonight, if we can get tickets, as she said she wanted to do something nice for ME on HER birthday.  I KNEW doing the dishes and cleaning the downstairs yesterday would pay off.<br />

Tossing and turning for hours and I couldn't figure out why I wasn't  drifting off even though I was tired and comfortable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lanir Odysia</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I hope you got to see it last nite.  I did and it was wonderful.  Personally I still like the first better but that's not to say that this is bad.  I really liked it.  The Battle at Helms Deep was great and so were the Ents and well I liked it all.  Couple of things don't go with the book but I could understand why they did them.  Kinda like why they brought Erwin (did I spell her name right?) into the first movie even though in the book it's just like a 1 paragraph mention of her.<br />
<br />
So anyway yes a good movie, can't wait for the third though I don't want it to be over after that.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Serenya</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm really excited.  My husband lost major points because we didn't see it in the theaters, so this year he promises not to let that happen.  But, I get really grouchy if I dont get enough sleep, so we have to either wait for the weekend or try to see while visiting family for the holidays.  Luckily they all want to see it too, so I think I can drag everyone out this weekend :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pootle</div><div class="date">12-24-2002, 05:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i saw this on Sat night (21st), and OMG it was AWSOME!!!!<br />
<br />
The Ents rule all !<br />
<br />
Everything about this film was simply stunning!<br />
<br />
If you havent seen it yet, you gotta... NOW!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gillin Whisperfoot</div><div class="date">12-24-2002, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, my girlfriend and I didn't stay up for it, instead we took wednesday off. Watched FotR in the morning then went out to see Two Towers in the afternoon. It was a great movie!! (We only had wednesday ticked off as a vacation day since... oh May?)<br />
<br />
I got into work the next day and a bunch of people said they had read reviews that said it was better than the first one. My response was, 'Well, you're talking about two parts of the same movie, they both rocked!'<br />
<br />
I know that a lot of movie sequels suck compared to the first one, but those sequels are nothing like the Lord of the Rings saga. If you look at it in terms of when and how these movies were created, they really were making a 9-10 hour movie during the long months of filming. They intelligently cut it up along with the books because only people like myself would go to see this movie if it was released in the theatres in the full blown 10 hour length! <br />
<br />
Not only that, but I'm sure they are making a good deal of cash with this marketing scheme. And they should, they really put heart and soul into these films. Which is great, because that's the only reason they turned out so good!!<br />
<br />
Hmmm.... maybe I'll watch the making of FotR tomorrow. ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilosh</div><div class="date">12-24-2002, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had not seen FotR.<br />
I wanted to see The Two Towers.<br />
<br />
So early saturday afternoon, a friend of mine DRAGGED me over to his house, and played the first movie for me.<br />
I was *breathtaken*.<br />
<br />
Then, at 10pm, we joined our group, and went to see the Two Towers.<br />
I was in Awe!   <br />
<br />
<br />
The part where Gollum (Smegal?) is arguing with himself has FANTASTIC camera/animation work.   My jaw dropped to the floor.<br />
<br />
<br />
I must see this movie again.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lanir Odysia</div><div class="date">12-24-2002, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I must say I am one of those people who once they are out will buy all 3 uncut versions on dvd and sit down and watch them all at once.  I could do it in the theater if they'd let me.  Seeing it on big screen all at once with no cuts so you have all the little but important details...heaven.  :D  :D <br />
<br />
ok that's all just had to add that. =) <br />
oh yeah and glad you liked it Lilosh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username"></div><div class="date">12-24-2002, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All I have to say about this was that reading the book does NOT spoil the plot.<br />
<br />
The liberties taken with this one were worlds more than with the first one... :(<br />
<br />
I wont get into plot points, but Faramir (sp) was not the guy from the books I liked.<br />
<br />
I did like the movie overall though, just felt they could have stuck to the book more.</div></div><hr />
