Reading all of these posts of women who play EQ with their husbands makes me sad. My SO is not interested in the game and gets angry with me when I play. I've tried to get her interested to no avail.....<br />

So I have 1 working computer and 1 account.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm the reverse: I EQ all the time -- what an addict -- but my husband won't (says he doesn't dare, he might play as much as I do and needs more time and energy for his work than I do for mine  :) )<br />
<br />
Though, at this point it might be awkward if he decided to try it now -- my two primary alts are married and my main has two suitors (all friends who know I'm married RL -- but still awkward if RL hubby appears in-game, hehe)<br />

Reading all of these posts of women who play EQ with their husbands makes me sad. My SO is not interested in the game and gets angry with me when I play. I've tried to get her interested to no avail.....<br />
<br />
So I have 1 working computer and 1 account.<br />
<br />
We have 2 working computers, 1 dead as a doornail computer that serves as a nice stand for my new (WOOT!  :) ) working one, 2 players, 3 accounts.  1 mule on my account and 1 on the shared account.<br />
<br />
1 account is mine, 1 is my husband's, and one we share (I have 2 slots and he has 5 (1 for mule) - hey!  :? Not sure how I ended up with that deal  :oops: )<br />
<br />
Quinner - /comfort    My husband and I used to argue about EQ a lot too.  He spent a year begging me to play with him and our friends.  &quot;Just try it, you'll like it!&quot;  Finally got tired of him asking me so I said,  &quot;OK let's get this out of the way.  Just tell me about this stupid game even though I'm not going to play.&quot;  He described all the classes and races and said &quot;Yeah, it's too bad you're not going to play.  We could really use an enchanter but they're really hard to play.  That's OK though you'd probably just get frustrated anyways.&quot;  My ears perked up.  Something difficult to do well?  I can do that!  Just watch me, I'll be the best darned enchanter you ever did see!<br />
<br />
Gah, that's what I get for marrying someone *smart*.  :D</div></div><hr />

Same person :)  Asked who could be enchanters, and he ran through the list.  He said that the best races, in his opinion, stat-wise for playing enchanters were Erudites and High Elves.   But, he said, there are a lot fewer Erudites since they're not as easy to play.<br />

Gah, I fall for that trick so easily sometimes ;)</div></div><hr />
