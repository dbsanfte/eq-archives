<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daqmar the Dark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wrong at EQ Traders for some idols depending on how you navigate to the various pages...  Edit- ingredients not listed wrong... Tradeskiller just temporarily a little of the mark.... hehe.  Thanks!  <br />
<br />
Hello everyone… been lurking in the shadows for a few days now :) .  I have been working pottery for about 2 weeks and at am the 199 mark.  I was very surprised to come across the errors linked below and also set back by them… if this is common knowledge and posted before, my apologies.  I did not see it.<br />
<br />
From the &quot;Quick Triv&quot; list at eqtraders I decided to make unfired idols up to 248 following the ingredients listed.  Go to do combine- no go.  Review and review to only find out that the ingredients are wrong- it does not use a Vial of Clear Mana, it uses a Vial of Distilled Mana, a several hundred pp difference on my server (to bazaar on 7th).  I search for Vial of Clear Mana and found this- http://eqtraders.com/search/reverse_recipe_search.php?item=1445&amp;menustr=010000000000 ... every idol in this list that calls for clear mana is an error- I think every one, did not test every single one.  However, if you look up Idol of CZ or Karana or any of the others individually or from the Deity page (http://eqtraders.com/recipes/pottery_recipe_page.php?article=115&amp;rsa=Pottery&amp;sub=deity&amp;sb=item&amp;menustr=080090040000 ), they are correct.  Strangely, if it lists the vial of clear mana instead of distilled, usually the water flask is left out.  Wish I would have seen the correct ingredients list before buying bulk everything... just be careful when starting a new family of Combines, research and cross reference :( .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>baldorrex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since you don't list what you actually tried to combine, it is difficult to know precisely what the problem is.  However, have you confused the golden idol line of items with the old style idols?  Golden idols do take distilled mana, while the old style idols use clear mana.  Golden idols do require water, while the old style do not.  I have successfully made both kinds (golden idols of tunare; idols of karana) recently using the ingredients list from this site.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daqmar the Dark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I hope that you are correct, baldorrex, that would make my life much easier :) .  I am glad to hear that they are potentially two differenct idols- if you navigate to the quick triv list as stated, second up from bottum, second one up is unfired idol that trivs at 248... it resembles the Golden Idol of Cazic Thule (sorry, tagged that one as CZ up top).  That ingredient list is the one I bought ample supply for... it does not work as stated.  I will revisit this and hope that i was just tired last night.  Try it, see what you find.<br />
<br />
Here is the link straight to Unfired Idol- http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=4936&amp;menustr=080090900000 .  Navigated as instructed above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daqmar the Dark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Greetings, again.  Tried this combine again shortly after posting my second response- it did not work.  I checked twice the ingrediants and even started over once, lol- just to be sure.<br />
<br />
I read something somewhere about lvl requirements now... is it possible that I can not do this combine because I am only 199 and it trivs at 248?  I realize that is a far spread gap, but it is just leveling :) .  <br />
<br />
Is it broke, or am I not yet uber enough, lol?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Depending on what the response was, can tell you if you are (or are not) skilled enough.<br />
<br />
Did it say:<br />
<br />
Does not combine in this container.<br />
<br />
or did it say:<br />
<br />
You are not skilled enough to attempt this combine.<br />
<br />
(I am paraphrasing a little, but I think you can tell what I am driving at).<br />
<br />
It has not previously been skill restricted to the best of my knowledge (2nd message). But I have not attempted making a Golden Idol yet myself.<br />
<br />
If the recipe is wrong (it works with a different mana vial or whatever) we will correct it. But if even one little thing is not right in the Pottery Wheel when you try the combine... it will give you the first message (Does not combine).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OK...just a few things to check:<br />
<br />
The Amber you have you have IMBUED... right? Got a Shaman who prays to Cazic Thule to Imbue with the Level 29 Spell...<br />
<br />
The Clay you have is a LARGE BLOCK of MAGIC Clay... not just a LARGE BLOCK of Clay. Enchanter 8th Level Spell to enchant it.<br />
<br />
You actually put the Scuplting Tools in the Pottery Wheel, and not your Pottery Geerlok (Same Graphic).<br />
<br />
You are NOT using a Water Flask at all (most pottery recipes ask for a Flask of Water, but not this one from the current recipe as listed).<br />
<br />
You are using a Pottery Wheel, not a Kiln... (Silly yes... but just a double check).<br />
<br />
And just to clarify, the unfired idol you are attempting to create with the recipe makes the Idol of Cazic Thule, not the Golden Idol of Cazic Thule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daqmar the Dark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kk... yes to all your questions- Amber (imbue by cleric not shammy, but should be same according to info),  magic clay (will double check all my stacks to ensure they are Large- bought from bazaar from a couple different vendors, may have confused stacks), tannan wheel/or normal (tried both- PoK and Halas), tools... etc.  I am currently at work and unable to test to confirm which message I receive, however, I am leaning toward the former message, not the latter, but will confirm that late tonight after work.  Will post back my results after finding them...   <br />
<br />
Thank you to everyone responding, tradeskilling can be very time consuming and frustrating when things dont go well... its feels good when support and attention is extended :) .  <br />
<br />
Genuine Thanks...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Galain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The easiest way for us to help is for you to tell us exactly what you put in the pottery wheel.  Use the EQ names please.  That is the name that pops up when you inspect the item in EQ.  My guess is that it's going to just be a mistaken material.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Daqmar the Dark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Problem solved, someone kick me...<br />
<br />
Ok! The suspense was killing me, so I took a trip home quick to check on materials and get some real replies for your questions... however, while there, I realized my stupidity.  My pottery turned into a frustrating algebra (flashback, lol) problem whre despite how many times i looked at it, I processed it the same way.  <br />
<br />
I finally counted how many ingrediants were listed and then how many were in Pottery Wheel... the count was one too many.  Dont ask me how or why- but I eyes and mind thought it ok and needed for that Celestial Essence to be in there, well, that was the problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks to all who took a few minutes to read and reply.  If ya are on the 7th and ever need anything, send a tell... I will help when and where I can.<br />

I do this quite often myself. Then again I am very absent minded. It is very helpful to list each item you are putting in as it may help us narrow it down to see what the problem is.</div></div><hr />
