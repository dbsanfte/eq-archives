<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Waring McMarrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any know what the mod items cap on how far they will modify your skill to? Also looking for a list of ones that are eaiser to obtain. Thanks for any help you can give.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shaman Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It is unknown if there is a cap on how high a skill mod item can take you. I doubt there is one.<br />
<br />
There are only 2 alchemy skill items in the game that I know of.<br />
<br />
The easiest by FAR is the philosopher's stone, drops in Grieg's End, from Alchemist Verona (I think that is her name), a gnome located um...somewhere in the zone. Secondary slot only, +10% alchemy, no other mods. Droppable.<br />
<br />
The harder one to get is the Umbracite Swarm Orb. Range slot, +15% alchemy mod. Has a TON of other stats (ac, int, resists, hitpoints, the works) and has a right click of group shrink. Drops in Vex Thall. Nodrop.<br />
<br />
Maximum possible modified skill, with the swarm orb at level 65 would be 235, maybe 236 if the game rounds it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We have been told by the developers (at the last Fan Faire) that the code is such that the highest that any skill of any kind can ever be is an effective level of 252.  A baker of 250 skill with their 5% item equipped is still just at 252.  A caster with meditation at 250 and a 3% meditation item is still just at 252.  (I don't have an exact quote from the developers but this is what was in someone's report on the Fan Faire.) <br />
<br />
That said, since actual skill in alchemy is capped at 200 this shouldn't be a problem.  I don't know of any tests that have been done to prove that the alchemy mod items actually work beyond that but there doesn't seem to be reason to doubt it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shaman Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What I meant is not that there is no skill cap, but that the level of improvement that +skill items can take you is uncapped (short of running into the 252 hardcap).<br />
<br />
If someone put in a +200% alchemy item, you could hit 252 effective skill with an actual skill of 84. Not that a skill mod that high would ever be found.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i don't see &quot;Tradeskill Trophy&quot; for alchemy !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shaman Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The maximum (natural) skill you can have at level 65 with alchemy is 205.<br />
<br />
Would you care to waste the 4k or so platinum on artisan seals where the trivial for GM trophies is in the 280-290 range? I'll take a big PASS on that, thanks.</div></div><hr />

Speaking of which what level is that mob in GE?</div></div><hr />
