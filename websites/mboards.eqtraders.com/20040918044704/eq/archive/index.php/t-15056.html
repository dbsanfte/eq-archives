<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Stuck at 196 tailoring, I frequently check the recipes for new GoD options to get myself to 200, and today I noticed Muramite Needles:<br />
<br />
http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=12835&amp;menustr=080110230000<br />
<br />
Does anyone know where the Muramite Residue comes from?  How common it is?  Whether it can be farmed? Foraged?  Bought?<br />
<br />
I figure that if it is common enough to do in bulk, I'd use this option even if I had to pay 100pp per residue, given my server's economy and the other options.  In fact, I suspect that at this price, this recipe would compare favorably with Platinum LoY ribbons, for many.  But, of course, it all depends on the rarenss of the residue.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know?</div></div><hr />

Don't expect to be doing these for skill ups unless you have passed the first 6 trials which I doubt based on your level.  Sorry to bear the bad news.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The people it drops for will likely need it for advancing to further events and the needle is consumed in the quest. If that turns out to be an error or many people pass this stage, residue might become cheap in bazaar.</div></div><hr />
