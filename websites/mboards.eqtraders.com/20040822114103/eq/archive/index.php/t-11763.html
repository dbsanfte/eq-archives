<br />
Folks ask this question rather frequently these days, whether asking about EQ2, EQOA, Star Wars, DAoC, whatever.<br />
<br />
This site is pretty much a fulltime job for me, and I have no plans to branch out to make a site for any other game at this time -- nor to add other EQ game version offerings to the current site.<br />

Do you get the idea?<br />

If we charged for the site, had adds or otherwise this was a BUSINESS things may have be diferent.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>DeegerStormcrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sheesh that sucks.  People who leak names like that should be required to wear their newbie armor forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Noni DeeCups</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So harsh :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, it's harsh, but the idea of the game is to have fun.  As Ngreth says, the fun has been taken out of the game for Niami.  That's about as harsh as it comes, so making leakers wear newbie armor is a minor punishment in comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ellesidil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For all those that think it is harsh to say what was said, might I offer the following....<br />
<br />
I was the third person on Cazic Thule to hit 250 in tailoring. Despite the fact that 2 others had hit the mark several months before I did, I still found it impossible to log into EQ without getting 10 tells in 2 hours asking about making Tailoring gear for them. I was also a moderator for EQ Traders at the time and my name was fairly well known to those in the tradeskill community at the time.<br />
<br />
I then decided to retire the character that had hit 250 in tailoring and told noone but my guild and 1 other person who my new alt was, asking everyone in the guild to keep quiet about my new character so that I could once again play the game.<br />
<br />
From what I have heard from talking to the DenMom, that is nothing compared to what her experience is like. I cannot imagine what it was like for her when cross-server tells came into play for her to get tells from her own server and from servers across the game.<br />
<br />
There is a price to fame and the DenMom and Da Ogre have paid it in full. They have provided an invaluable resource to many thousands of people in the tradeskill community, myself included and I will be the last one to begrudge her the anonymity that she may desire.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for making the game that much more enjoyable for me DenMom. May those who leak your alt's see this and understand.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Soulfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So let me get this straight.<br />
<br />
People absolutely positively REFUSE to let Niami play the game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Imagine if you will-- getting so many tells it scrolls your screen faster than the melee spam of a raid. getting asked for every single recipe in the game &quot;because you know it, and I don't want to log to check it.&quot; getting a dozen tells of &quot;I just wanted to say 'Hello,&quot; every time you zone. Being told &quot;You suck cause you won't make stuff for me for free, and I know you can,&quot; because you simply are too exhausted and too broke from being the only one doing research. Being the only one doing research, editing, posting, checking, and tripple-checking the site. Being the target for everyone with an axe to grind about tradeskills because the workd thinks you'll get Sony to see it their way.<br />
Niami is my dear friend.  One of the best I've ever had.  I got into EQ because of her.  I used to watch over her shoulder at the volume of messages she would get.  I watched her scream in frustration because her mail box was full and it took an hour just to download.  And I watched her go from having fun to hating EQ. <br />
<br />
So no, she won't be making a site for another game.  Other games are for fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Goresmash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't mean to be rude, but I really need to ask.<br />
<br />
Why do you keep doing this if you no longer enjoy it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ShaylannaS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have GM'd 4 tradeskills and am over 220 in all others.  People ask me recipes all the time and my response is always &quot;ALT-TAB, Click your Web Browser, Type in www.eqtraders.com and LOOK IT UP JUST LIKE I DID!&quot;<br />
<br />
They get the hint.<br />
<br />
People ask me &quot;WOW! What neat Pally twink items can you make for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
I tell them &quot;&quot;ALT-TAB, Click your Web Browser, Type in www.eqtraders.com, see what is available.  Get the parts and I will attempt a combine for you.  Combines I am happy to do, farming for other people I am not.&quot;<br />
<br />
I get few tells regarding tradeskills anymore aside from doing combines and most people are intelligent enough to NOT bug me non stop.  I will do it when it is convenient for me to do so.  My enjoyment of my time online comes before helping joe_bob_05 get leet crafted twink-wear.<br />
<br />
I can understand how a person can get driven nuts and get to the point where they don't want to log in, let alone start an entirely new venture in a new platform and get put through it all over again.  Hell just DOING the Tradeskills in itself is so time consuming I never would have done it at all where it not for wanting the Aid Grimel Earrings.  I destoryed 2 mice with all the clicking, alienated some friends in my determination to get it over with, remained guildless for several months and lost out on some prime raiding, spent over 300K in plat and I wouldn't EVER do it again.</div></div><hr />

I don't mean to be rude, but I really need to ask.<br />
<br />
Why do you keep doing this if you no longer enjoy it?  <br />
<br />
Have you noticed a lot less frequent Posting by Denmom?  Well... she is pulling back a bit to reduce the stress involved, and it helps tons.<br />
<br />
Why does she keep doing it at all?  Because she loves the Community here at her site (at least the 99% of you that are decent folk that ACT like adults... no mater your physical age) and she does not want to close down a site you guys love so much.  She also has put sweat, tears, pain, and stress hormones into this site and does not want to just drop it.<br />
