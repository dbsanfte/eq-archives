Yes, you have to enchant Large Bricks, then combine 3 of them to make a Block, to then make 1 sheet. Large Bricks are not stackable, nor are Blocks. You can also fail on the Block Combine, and the sheet combine. <br />
<br />
I really wish VI would go back and look at this stage of armor making. Either make it so you can enchant Blocks, or allow Clerics to also Imbue/Enchant metals for racial armor...</div></div><hr />

You need large bricks to make rings and Rings to make chain jointing. There for they made an OK desicion to make the spell enchant the large bricks. Failure rate at 180+ on the ore conversion is small (1 our of about 50 for me at 205). <br />
<br />
The only way that they could change this is by creating a new spell, and being part of a guild and having a 51 enchanter at my disposal I know I do not want to buy 3 more spells to enchant metal. (I help the DEs, Dorfs and High Elves in my guild out).<br />
