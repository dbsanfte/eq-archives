<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EQForager</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When I was first looking through the forums to find the best place to forage Tufts of Dire Wolf Fur, I came across a posting by Hibashira (Original Thread (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/showthread.php?threadid=7926)) [Fixed the link to work again]. <br />
<br />
It was exactly what I was looking for, yet didn't appear to have been updated since mid-2003, and there had been several expansions since then. This inspired me to continue the work where it was left off, and perhaps re-forage some of the zones already done in case anything has changed.<br />
<br />
So far I have only completed 10 zones, but I am working on adding new ones every couple of days (as time permits). Also planning to get together a few friends so I can forage through a couple of dungeons for the data.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is the link for the Forage data I have so far:<br />
<br />
Forage Data Chart Sorted by Zone (http://members.cox.net/tradeskills/ForageData.html)<br />
<br />
Forage Data Chart Sorted by Item (http://members.cox.net/tradeskills/ForageDataSorted.html)<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically it is just an Excel spreadsheet that has been saved in HTML format and hosted off my website. Will see about organizing it a bit more as I gather more data.<br />
<br />
<br />
Zones I intend to forage:<br />
<br />
Misty Thicket - Finished <br />
Thurgadin - Finished<br />
Greater Faydark - Finished<br />
Lesser Faydark - Finished<br />
Icewell Keep - Finished<br />

There are some very good summaries with the details and applications of the forages.  If I can find my lost links I will add them into this post.  I know you are looking for statistics, but it might save a little bit of time for you if you don't have the lists.</div></div><hr />

Thank you. Have to say I'm fairly familiar with the EQ Trader's website as a whole. Unfortunately it doesn't list exactly which common forages are found in each zone... as not all common forages can be found in every zone.<br />
<br />
Still working on this project... just completed Barindu (wanted Tea Leaves) and Natimbi.<br />
<br />
Have to say the Taelosian Tea Leaf forage rate is fairly disappointing... in 550 forages I was able to pick up roughly a stack. It's no wonder why I see Bazaar prices of 400p a Leaf, and none of the new teas up for sale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think there is something wrong with the sorting on the &quot;by item&quot; chart.  There is a gap so the right side wasn't sorted along with the item column.<br />
<br />
In any case, I'm glad someone is making good use of that spreadsheet. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mewkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd like to see Cobalt Scar and Temple of Veeshan added to the list. Just to find out where the best Dragon/Drake egg concentration is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tyber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One zone you may want to look into is Kael. I didn't notice it on your list, but I know that I like foraging there when my druid is in the zone due to the Tufts of Dire Wolf Fur you can get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">See link on top post first line.  I had Kael and ToV there.  But that was a while ago, not sure if they changed the forage table since then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tyber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Whoops...my bad. Just looked at the one EQForager was working on. *blush*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>EQForager</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just added those onto my list when I saw your reply, very good idea =)  Thanks!</div></div><hr />
