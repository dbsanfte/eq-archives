<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>soluran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, was trying to do the combine for BoA the other day and it appears to be bugged.  I just want to confirm that the recipe hasn't changed.  Yaeth's compendium pg 26, right and left, quill, parchment, etched signet and writ of quellious.  Had a guildy attempt to research it for me with 200 research and +5% mod with the advanced research tome.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inien of Vazaelle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That worked last time someone asked me to make the spell.  You sure he had 2 different halfs of pg 26?  (not 2 lefts or 2 rights)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>soluran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, I have confirmed that it is 1 right and 1 left.  Perhaps its a bug indigenous to CT server, Im not sure though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lendyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I heard it's now two 26 lefts, rather than right and left.  Rumor only until I try it myself! =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Narnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did the combine yesterday w/ necro at 200 skill. Luckily for me the combine was success as I forgot to equip my 5% quill  :rolleyes:   1 -26left, 1-26right, quill, parchment, etched signet, and writ. You sure you didn't have a runed emblem in place of the signet or something?<br />

BTW I'm on CT too  :p</div></div><hr />
