<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Prescottdatroll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I dont know if anyone else is having issues with this but I am still unable to make Blood of the Wolf from my recipie list.  I have also been told there is the same issue from ant potions and IVU.  If your having this issue all so please bug report it and send a feedback also.  <br />
<br />
Hopefully this issue can be fixed soon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I also tried to add Kilva's Skin of Flame last night and it didn't add to my recipe list.<br />
<br />
Getting kind of sick of SoE ignoring all these shaman-related bugs LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have yet to be able to add any recipes at all. Even when I do complete a combine and get the message that I've learned a recipe it doesn't show up in my recipe list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just learned Blood of the Wolf and made 10 of them off of my recipe list, using a regular medicine bag.  Are you using regular medicine bag or folded medicine bag?  Are you remembering that once you learn it you have to search for it to see it?  The only ones that display automatically when you open the new UI are your favorites.  To add a recipe to your favorites you have to learn it (if it's not autolearn), search for it, and then add it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Prescottdatroll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yep not expecting auto learn but I did find out the foldable bags are broken.  I can do the combine in a regular medicine bag. I don't really have room for it so I just buy em and sell em if I am going to make a large amount of any of the non-addable potions.<br />

*edit* spelling pwned me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ah so that's it, the foldable bags are broken :steamed:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Previously learned recipes (learned after the recent patch that wiped them) are now showing up in the foldable bag.  Also, I just successfully learned and used Adrenaline Tap.  So it looks like foldables are fixed.</div></div><hr />
