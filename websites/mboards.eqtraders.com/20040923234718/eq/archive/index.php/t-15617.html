<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eumerin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It took me a while yesterday, but a few hours after I started, I finally managed to get past the log in server (fortunately, most of that time wasn't spent in front of the computer...).  Then I got that irritating bug where the howling wind sound effect carries over into zones that down have howling wind (such as PoK...), so I logged out - and couldn't get back in.  I eventually did manage to get back in, and before I quit for the evening, briefly considered setting up my trader in the bazaar - just for insurance.<br />
<br />
But I don't have much to sell, and people had been having no trouble logging in for the raid I joined (we wiped on MB when the tank went LD...).  So I figured, &quot;Why bother?&quot; and logged out.<br />
<br />
Then I glanced at the various message boards today and realized that might not have been a good move...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you seen the language and personal attacks that are going on over in the SOE official boards just now? Frustration is understandable but that kind of abuse is beyond belief. <br />
<br />
I can only thank the moderators here that the kind of behaviour being displayed over there doesn't creep into this board at any point.</div></div><hr />

At this time, all servers are up and all systems are working as intended. Good luck and have fun.<br />

I like SOE. I generally trust SOE. However, the phrase &quot;working as intended&quot; scares the bloody heck out of me...<br />

yes, login server being down = teh sox. &gt;_&lt; Does anyone know /why/?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A little out of context and a bit unfixed in time but:<br />
<br />
Great war. Terrible war. Much killings. Everyone fighting. A great darkness. It is the end of everything. Zathras warn, but no, no one listen to poor Zathras, no. Great war. But, great hope of peace. Need place. Place to gather, to fight to organize...to help save galaxy on the side of light. So they tell me. Must have. Or it is the end of all. The One leads us. The One tells us to go, we go. We live for The One. We would die for The One. We pull this place through time to save us all.<br />
Zathras warned Zathras, but Zathras never listened to Zathras. Zathras was quiet one in family. SO! What can Zathras be doing for you?<br />
Everyone always coming to Zathras with problems. Great responsibilities. But Zathras does not mind. Zathras trained in crisis management.<br />
But only Zathras have no-one to talk to. No-one manages poor Zathras, you see. So Zathras talks to dirt. Sometimes talks to walls, or talks to ceilings. But dirt is closer. Dirt is used, through everyone walking on it. Just like Zathras, but we've come to like it. It is our role. It is our destiny in the universe. So, you see, sometimes dirt has insects in it. And Zathras likes insects. Not so good for conversation, but much protein for diet. Ha! Zathras fix now, this way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Apolline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There was an easy fix for this, and hopefully I (and my friend zeny, gotta give her credit) were not the only ones who noticed.<br />
<br />
Look at the date on the everquest server statusything (apparently its been changed, I went to grab the exact messege, and its different now.) Heres how it *was*<br />
<br />
<br />
4/4/2005 2:55 PM PST (-8 UTC)<br />
<br />
We are currently experiencing issues with our login server.  As this problem is being looked into, logging into EverQuest may be affected for long periods of time.  Please check back here for updated information.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
-The SOE Game Operations Team <br />
<br />
Notice anything odd about the year on the messege about login server having issues?<br />
<br />
2005. I couldnt log in. I set my computer clock a year ahead... and logged in fine. <br />
<br />
This was not too long after it started having issues, around 3:30ish pst. I petitioned as soon as i could when i got ingame, somethign along the lines of &quot;Fyi it might be your clocks are set wrong. According to the messege on network status page, its 2005, and when my computer clock was set forward a year, I was able to log in fine.&quot;..<br />
<br />
Maybe just a really weird coincidence. But something to keep in mind in the future, if you're having problems logging in.. check the date.</div></div><hr />

Even stranger that it worked! :boggled:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Apolline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I get that a LOT :worried: (the 'thats weird' thing).<br />
<br />
Makes you wonder if I was just lucky or if a typo that tiny could screw everything up so much.</div></div><hr />
