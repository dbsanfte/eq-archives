<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Back before the database there existed a table with trivial values for all of the parts one could use for fletching bows and arrows.  There have been a number of requests for this chart to be reinstated, so I decided to post the information, since I find the chart so useful for figuring out what parts to use for best range, damage, etc.  So, here it is, in ugly format:<br />
<br />
Entries for arrow parts are Name, damage, range and trivial.<br />
<br />
Field point arrowhead, +0, +0, 16<br />
Hooked arrowhead, +1, +0, 102<br />
Silver tipped arrowhead, +2, +0, 182<br />
Condensed (shadow, fire, ice), +3 (+4), +0, 250+<br />
<br />
Parenthetic extra damage for condensed substance is magic for shadow, fire for fire and cold for ice, if the target fails to resist.  Also, all arrows using condensed substances must be condensed arrowheads, acrylia shafts, shield cut fletch and a small groove nock.<br />
<br />
Wood shaft, +0, +0, 16<br />
Bone shaft, +1, +0, 68<br />
Ceramic shaft, +2, +0, 135<br />
Steel shaft, +3, +0, 202<br />
Acrylia shaft, +5, +75, 250+<br />
<br />
Round cut fletch, +0, +0, 16<br />
Parabolic cut fletch, +0, +50, 46<br />
Shield cut fletch, +1, -50, 82<br />
Wooden vanes, +1, -25, 122<br />
Bone vanes, +1, +25, 162<br />
Ceramic vanes, +2, +0, 202<br />
<br />
Large groove nock, +0, +0, 16<br />
Medium groove nock, +0, +25, 36<br />
Small groove nock, +0, +50, 56<br />
<br />
Entries for bow parts are name, damage, delay, range and trivial.<br />
<br />
Hickory staff, 10, 50, 50, 16<br />
Elm staff, 13, 51, 75, 68<br />
Ashwood staff, 16, 58, 100, 129<br />
Oak staff, 21, 65, 125, 168<br />
Darkwood staff, 25, 68, 150, 215<br />
Shadewood staff, 27, 66, 200, 250<br />
<br />
Note, shadewood bows with no cams are range 150, one cam are 175, and 2 cam are 200.<br />
<br />
Hemp string, +0, +0, +0, 16<br />
Linen string, -1, -4, +0, 32<br />
Silk string, -2, -8, +0, 46<br />
<br />
Whittling blade, -1, -4, +0, 102<br />
Planing tool, -2, -9, +0, 148<br />
<br />
One cam, -1, -5, +0, 192<br />
Two cams, -2, -10, +0, 235<br />
<br />
<br />
That should get you fletching!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>segel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why remove that chart?  It was so useful and so helpful.  The new database format with trivial lists are not helpful at all when it comes to fletching arrows.<br />
<br />
Please bring the properly-formatted chart back, denmother!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The old flat HTML pages were next to impossible to maintain.  They required hand-editing of HTML files and could only (reasonably) be done by a single person or small set of people for security reasons. <br />
<br />
There were problems with source control.  It was entirely possible to loose data because one person installed an old version of the HTML, loosing changes made by someone else. <br />
<br />
In short, it was a nightmare on the site end. <br />
<br />
When designing the database-driven site, it needed to be more or less &quot;one size fits all&quot; for everything trade-skills related.  No one had time, energy or spare cash to code huge numbers of exceptions.  (The site is paid for entirely out of the pockets of the Denmother with some assistance from donations.)<br />
<br />
The database coding was done by Negreth with some assistance from volunteers.  No one and I repeat  NO ONE  got paid to do it.  End users are getting this service free of charge. It’s not like EQTraders has funding to keep a staff of professional web-developers on call. <br />
<br />
So, while the format of some items may be inferior to previous versions, whatever makes the site maintenance easier and cheaper for the owners will have to take precedence. <br />
<br />
Someone was kind enough to type in an older copy of the chart for you and other users.  Thank them, be happy, and move on.  <br />
<br />
I'm closing this topic.  Nothing further need be said.</div></div><hr />
