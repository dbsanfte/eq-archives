<br />
Recently, there was some discussion regarding learning languages on the boards.  That inspired me to get off my lazy buttocks and write up a quick guide on the most common and speedy way to learn languages.  This is still in &lt;b&gt;draft form&lt;/b&gt;, as there are a couple of points I still need to verify.  Once I've done that, I'll edit this guide and post a note at the end of the thread.<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate any comments, corrections, criticisms, flames, or death threats regarding the guide.  Just post here and I'll take it all into account.  :)<br />
<br />
The Kyros Krane Random Guide Series, Part 1:<br />
Language Skills<br />
<br />
(For a guy who's been playing the game all of three months, I'm pretty arrogant, aren't I? ;) )<br />
<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
<br />
1) Prepare a language macro<br />
2) Set up your windows correctly<br />
3) Set your language<br />
4) SPAM! (with apologies to Hormel)<br />
5) Zone to check skill (optional)<br />
6) Check your language.<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Prepare a language macro<br />
<br />
The key to learning languages quickly is volume.  Not volume as in sound; volume as in quantity.  As with all other skills, you learn by doing, and the more you do something, the better your chance to get a skillup.  So, for language skills, you want a macro (called in EQ a &quot;social&quot;) that lets you get the maximum number of lines out there with the least work possible.  I'll use the terms &quot;social&quot; and &quot;macro&quot; interchangeably.<br />
<br />
In EQ, socials can have a maximum of five commands.  For languages, I've seen two versions of the macro you'll need.  One is the lazy and convenient way that reduces your number of possible skillup opportunities (I'll call this the &quot;safe&quot; macro); the other is the quick and dirty way that potentially renders you unintelligible to most other EQ players (I'll call this the &quot;speedy&quot; macro).<br />
<br />
The &quot;safe&quot; macro is set up as follows:<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Line 1:&lt;/b&gt; /lang 20<br />
&lt;b&gt;Line 2:&lt;/b&gt; /g (something meaningful here)<br />
&lt;b&gt;Line 3:&lt;/b&gt; /g (something meaningful here)<br />
&lt;b&gt;Line 4:&lt;/b&gt; /g (something meaningful here)<br />
&lt;b&gt;Line 5:&lt;/b&gt; /lang 1<br />
<br />
This macro automatically switches you to the language you set up, spams the group chat with three lines of text in the chosen language, then switches you back to common.  Note that the number &quot;20&quot; is just an example, you need to find the correct number for the language you are teaching and set it to that.  Language number &quot;1&quot; is always Common tongue, and it is the default language that everyone uses.<br />
<br />
The &quot;speedy&quot; macro foregoes the language-switching in favor of five lines of group speech, like so:<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Line 1:&lt;/b&gt; /g (something meaningful here)<br />
&lt;b&gt;Line 2:&lt;/b&gt; /g (something meaningful here)<br />
&lt;b&gt;Line 3:&lt;/b&gt; /g (something meaningful here)<br />
&lt;b&gt;Line 4:&lt;/b&gt; /g (something meaningful here)<br />
&lt;b&gt;Line 5:&lt;/b&gt; /g (something meaningful here)<br />
<br />
To use this macro, you have to manually switch into your teaching language before you start, then manually switch to Common when you're done.  This has the advantage in that you're pumping out much more data, thus enabling faster skillups for your groupmates; but if you reply to a tell or say something in OOC or Shout while training, it will likely go out in the language you're teaching, not Common.  Likewise, if you forget to switch back at the end of the training session, you'll confuse people you chat with as you speak to them in some obscure tongue they don't understand.  <br />
<br />
The &quot;safe&quot; macro avoids this by switching you into the chosen language at the start, then back to Common at the end of each press.  You give up a bit of volume (teaching speed) in favor of convenience (language safety).  Which you choose is a matter of preference; I chat enough that I prefer the safe macro.<br />
<br />
Note that you can say whatever you like after the /g.  I use the verses of a song that I like; other folks put in a small story or a limerick; others just use &quot;blah...&quot;.  What you use doesn't matter; I haven't noticed a difference in using short or long messages.  I try to keep the messages short so that they show up in only one line for the other folks; this minimizes vertical window scrolling.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Set up your windows correctly<br />
<br />
The EQ user interface is wonderful in that you can make mini-chat windows for dedicated purposes.  A perfect use in this case is to make a chat window dedicated to the training session.  You will see HUNDREDS of language messages go by each minute.  That's a monstrous volume of spam that will make it all but impossible to read any other text in the same window.  <br />
<br />
So, get rid of it!  Make a new window to catch the language spam, and leave your Main Chat window for &quot;normal&quot; stuff like OOC and tells.  To do this, right-click on the Main Chat window's title bar and choose &quot;New Chat Window&quot;.  Position the new window somewhere out of the way, then right-click on the new window's title and look at the &quot;Filters -&gt; &quot; option.  Select Group and Other for this window (you'll see a star appear next to each one in the menu after it's selected).  Now, all the group messages, language skill-up notes, and language change messages will go to this window, and everything else will stay in the main chat window.<br />
<br />
When you're done with the language session, you'll probably want your group and skillup messages to go into their usual window.  To do this, just close the new window by clicking on the X in the top-right corner.  Any text that was filtered to this window will now go into the Main Chat window instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
3) Set your language<br />
<br />
For some reason, it appears that the code number associated with each language changes from time to time.  The only constant I've seen is that Common is always language 1 (one).  To prepare for your language session, you need to find the correct code for the language you want to teach.  Here's how you do this.  Type these lines, and after each one, note the language you've switched to.<br />
<br />
/lang 1<br />
/lang 2<br />
.<br />
.<br />
/lang 15<br />
.<br />
.<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
To return to Common (the default language), type this:<br />
<br />
/lang 1<br />
<br />
(Note that it's the number one at the end, not the letter L or i.)<br />
<br />
So, let's say you've found that the language you want to teach is number 3 for you.  If you're using the &quot;safe&quot; macro, change the first line to read as follows:<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Line 1:&lt;/b&gt; /lang 3<br />
<br />
Leave the rest of the macro alone.<br />
<br />
If you're using the &quot;speedy&quot; macro, just change the language before you begin by typing the following before you begin:<br />
<br />
/lang 3<br />
<br />
<br />
4) SPAM! (with apologies to Hormel (http://www.spam.com))<br />
<br />
Form your group as normal, and make sure you know who the group leader is (he's the person who will have to invite new members if they want to join after you start).  Start clicking the macro button you made.  Each press will send out three (for the &quot;safe&quot; macro) or five (for the &quot;speedy&quot; macro) messages to all your groupmates.  Hopefully, they've also set up their macros and are spamming right back at you in other languages.<br />
<br />
Note that it's impossible to have a meaningful conversation in group chat while spamming.  Instead, most folks will either use tells to the group leader, or say stuff out loud if the group members are close to each other.  Both will show up in the main window, not the group spam window, which makes it much easier to converse while training.<br />
<br />
<br />
5) Zone to check skill (optional)<br />
<br />
Every once in a while, you'll see a message like &quot;Your language skills have improved!&quot; in dark blue.  (I forget the exact message text.)  However, if you check your skills from the Inventory window, none of the numbers have changed!  It turns out there's a small bug that causes the skills window to NOT update language improvements until you zone or camp out.  Your skills really are improving; you just can't see how much until you zone.  If you're impatient, you can zone every five minutes or so to see how much you've improved, but note that this will slow down the rate at which you're learning.  On the other hand, it is useful if you just need a few points to max out a language and you don't want to waste time &quot;learning&quot; a language that's already been mastered.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'll just zone once at the end of a session if my rating in the language I'm being taught is really low.  If my skill is high and it only needs a few points to max, I may zone more frequently to maximize my investment.<br />
<br />
<br />
6) Check your language<br />
<br />
When you're done with your language session, remember to switch back to Common so everyone can understand you!  Type this just to be sure:<br />
<br />
/lang 1<br />
<br />
If you use the &quot;safe&quot; macro, you should automatically switch back; if you use the &quot;speedy&quot; macro, you have to do this manually.<br />
<br />
<br />
And that's it.  Happy spamming!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moonlilly</div><div class="date">01-14-2003, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually its a very well written post Kyros.<br />
<br />
If I may allow me to add a couple things you have missed or just havent found out about yet. 8) <br />
<br />
So, get rid of it! Make a new window to catch the language spam, and leave your Main Chat window for &quot;normal&quot; stuff like OOC and tells. To do this, right-click on the Main Chat window's title bar and choose &quot;New Chat Window&quot;. Position the new window somewhere out of the way, then right-click on the new window's title and look at the &quot;Filters -&gt; &quot; option. Select Group and Other for this window (you'll see a star appear next to each one in the menu after it's selected). Now, all the group messages, language skill-up notes, and language change messages will go to this window, and everything else will stay in the main chat window. <br />
<br />
While this is a great idea for the one teaching the language, an easier way is to just open your options menu and under filters turn off group chat. (For the learner)<br />
<br />
For some reason, it appears that the code number associated with each language changes from time to time. <br />
<br />
Languages are set up on two systems. The order they came into the game and what languages you know.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
Taken if you know ALL languages<br />
Common is /lang 1<br />
Barbarian is /lang 2<br />
and lets say Dragon is /lang 20<br />
<br />
Now lets say dragon is the first language you have learned.  Your language list would look like this:<br />
Common is /lang 1<br />
Dragon is /lang 2<br />
Your languages will stay like this until you learn a language that had entered into the game before dragon.<br />
<br />
Now lets say you go and learn Barbarian. You languages will now be as such:<br />
Common is /lang 1<br />
Barbarian is /lang 2<br />
Dragon is /lang 3<br />
<br />
Also you dont need to find someone with a max skill to learn a language (Although it makes things easier). A person with a skill of 1 can teach a language.<br />
Example:<br />
Bob wants to learn Dark Elf.  Jim's skill in DE is 1.  Jim spams Bob as above untill Bob sees &quot;Your language skills have improved!&quot; twice.  Both people zone.  Once zoned Bob checks his DE skill it should be 2. Bob then spams Jim untill Jim gets the 2 messages. Zone. Jim should be at 3. etc. etc. etc. untill both are at 100.  This WILL take longer but at least it is an option if you cant find someone to teach you the language.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hanna</div><div class="date">01-14-2003, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple of other quick tips:<br />
<br />
While making your macro to do the group spam, I found it easy to make others, one with the language I am teaching (ie: Dragon(in the title box so it show up on the key itself) and on the first line /lang 24 (or whatever it is)) and one for common as well.  This way it's easy to switch to back to common to answer a tell, find out about an auctioned item, or other communication.<br />
<br />
Emotes are ALWAYS displayed in common.  Have something to say to the group while you are spamming/being spammed?  Word it in an emote!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ngreth Thergn</div><div class="date">01-14-2003, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also for speed and simplicity of the macro...  you don;t even need anything meaningfull.  You will NOT be able to read the language, even at 100, until you zone!  so... my macros are like this...<br />
<br />
/g a<br />
/g b<br />
/g c<br />
/g d<br />
/g e<br />
<br />
so even faster :)<br />
<br />
Also note.  People on modem connections, and unstable high speed connections can be punted by the spam, so be carefull :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramlador</div><div class="date">01-14-2003, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I did one day to max out all the base languages was to borrow my friends account. Created level 1 characters of each race (well most races, since some speak duplicates of what I already had), have them use their city's book to get to PoK, then group with my character and spam away. I tried to do the zoning thing so I could get skill ups in the &quot;elder&quot; languages, but it was taking too long.<br />
<br />
This is even easier now that eqwindows is legal so you can run 2 accounts on 1 computer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Imrahil</div><div class="date">01-23-2003, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's how you do this. Type these lines, and after each one, note the language you've switched to.<br />
<br />
/lang 1<br />
/lang 2<br />
.<br />
.<br />
/lang 15<br />
.<br />
.<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
Or you could just type &quot;/language help&quot; and it will list all languages you know and their associated number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Milla</div><div class="date">01-23-2003, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've found that you can even teach yourself a language using similar to what Moonlilly posted.  As long as you have one point in a language, you can spam your group until you get a message that your skill has increased.  You then zone and spam group again until you get another skill-up.  Continue back and forth and you can master the language all by yourself.<br />
<br />
I actually came across this while trying the trick with two people that Moonlilly posted.  I had my enchanter and my druid teaching each other a language.  It was the enchanter's turn to teach the druid one point and I was shocked to have the enchanter get a skill point before the druid did.  At first I thought I had just gotten confused, but I stopped doing anything with the druid and just zoned the enchanter back and forth and found that I could teach myself the language.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tyrsa</div><div class="date">03-29-2003, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way the skill-ups go for languages was changed &quot;recently&quot; in some sort of stealthy way. <br />
Used to be that in order to teach a language, you had to be grouped, and someone had to have enough skill to teach it.  (You couldn't teach yourself).  Basically once you hit the highest person's skill limit, you had to zone to gain any more skill.  For example in the old skilling system:<br />
Person A has skill 25 in Gnoll.  Person B has skill 20 in Gnoll.  Person A spams the group with Gnoll until Person B has a skill of -26- (one point higher than the one teaching).  You both zone.  Now person B teaches the group until Person A has a skill of -27- (2 points higher than they were and 1 point higher than the teacher, again).  You could not raise skill any more than one point higher than your teacher until you both zoned.  Rinse, repeat. <br />
The new system allows the teacher to gain one skill point each zone change.  So now Person A with skill 25 and Person B with skill 20 works like this: <br />
Person A teaches until Person B has skill 26.  More than likely Person A also got his 1 point and so is also now skill 26.  Person A zones.  Person A can spam the group (even with Person B on the other side of the zone) and gain one point again.  Person A zones back and can gain yet another teaching point (and teach Person B a couple points if he didn't zone with A).  Repeat.<br />
<br />
Makes the skilling up a lot easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morani</div><div class="date">03-31-2003, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something else to watch out for: if you just switch you language filter for the spam-off, be sure to switch the RIGHT window.   :oops:   I have two windows open; one for communication and one for combat spam. If I'm not careful to change the language in the &quot;main&quot; window (and change the OTHER one) I never actually speak in the other language...</div></div><hr />
