<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Galgond Cloudburst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've started working on ceremonial solstice robes to raise my tailoring, but unfortunately am not rich enough to crank out the pp to buy the stones for gem studded chains.  Anyone know of a good place to hunt for a lvl 58 druid where I might at least get the occasional sapphire or ruby?  It hurt my wallet tonight to crank out the pp for 20 attempted gem studded chains and to only have 8 successes.  And what sucks too is that even though my skill is only 188 out of 26 attempts actually had 2 successes and only one skill up (bringing my skill up to 188).  Oh well, back to the salt mine.  :p <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Optimum1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, geonids in WL and undead in Nadox reliably drop the gems, but not nearly at the rate youre going to require. If youre not very high level those two are not an option anyway. As you are finding out, youre going to need lots and lots and lots of....money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Galgond Cloudburst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks, I guess, lol.  Not really what I was hoping to hear but what I kind of expected to hear.  Have decided to swear off tailoring for a few while I work on getting more pp so I started quading in dulak for good aa xp and am crossing my fingers for the occasional blue diamond so I can save them up and then sell them.  Also am finding lots of the things used to make celestial essence drop here so saving a little pp there.  Not to mention the weapons dropped sell to merchants for around 4pp each and since I have lots of inventory space I tend to make around 200 to 300pp each time I sell.<br />
Thanks again for the response :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ariene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd try soloing in Natimbi.  Watch out though - named can't be snared/rooted.  <br />
<br />
I solo the undead and usually get about 100p cash, a stack of cel essence (I take the blue stuff that makes it and a mixing bowl with me and combine as I loot so that I can hold it all) and a major gem or two an hour (diamond/blue diamond/sapphire).<br />
<br />
Really nice 'rare off anything in zone' items as well - a FT neck for casters and a AoB neck for hybrids/melee - that are droppalbe.  If you don't need the items I would think either would fund quite a bit of skilling up if sold.  They are really rare though so don't count on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>AB-girlie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i have had a few sapphires drop while hunting shardwurms in GD for biles. <br />
about 1 of 100 / <br />
not worth the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Myrron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I used to get the occasional emerald off of arctic wyverns.  I forget if I ever got sapphires or rubies.  I do see sapphires and rubies in level 60+ ldons, but they are very rare.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have had sapphires drop while XPing on the Stormwave in Dulak.  I get about the same number as I do Diamonds (avg. about 1 per hour) so it's pretty uncommon.  I would expect you can get about the same on any of the boats.  I have seen Blue Diamonds, Diamonds, Sapphires, Star Rubies and Peridots from that boat.<br />
<br />
Only done 6 levels and 12 AAs there waiting for that (add word that would make a troll blush :faint:  ) charm to drop :irked: .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zeralenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At your level it's better to farm cash and buy them -- quicker and more reliable too.<br />
<br />
Try Dulak Harbor -- money drops are good, you get occasional blue diamonds which sell well, and even sapphires and rubies on occasion.<br />
