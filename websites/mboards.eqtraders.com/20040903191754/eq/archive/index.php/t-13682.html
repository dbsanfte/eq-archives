<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TZer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking to get to 220- what would be best way, MTP, griffon cheese caseroles, PoW fish, mephit pies?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Castaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did those levels doing 10 lbs pies.<br />
<br />
You can collect the mamoth meat in EW.<br />
You can collect the wolf meat in EK.<br />
<br />
The rest can be purchased in Thrug.<br />
The big draw back is the number of sub-combines to make a single pie.  It's mind numbing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cannyar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i did meat pies mostly as well.. a few points before they became trivial i switched to picnics because of a few threads i had read on here. picnics took me past the meat pie trivial and up to 250.<br />
<br />
a side note, meat pies sold far better and for more pp than picnics did. i think that's partially though because there were far more picnics on the market than meat pies. prices were 10pp ea (on xev).<br />
<br />
i'd go back to selling meat pies but i don't want to farm the meats any longer. i also only make picnics when i'm out of them or if a guildie needs them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Narces</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The best best way is fish from Plane of Water. If you have anyway to get ahold of these, and you can forage Bread Crumbs in Plane of Justice, your gold to 222.<br />
<br />
Giant Snapper/Halibut + Bread Crumbs + Jug of Sauces + Garnish<br />
<br />
Easy combine to 222.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i did mostly picnics from 193 on.  had about 240 halas pies and 180 justice fruit pies in there.  guildie gave me justice fruit so he wouldn't have to combine it too.  also a gm baker though lol.  as a wizard jagged pine was a bit mean with adds and not flagged for water.  <br />
<br />
recomened in order water fish, mtp, jaggedpine<br />
<br />
if you are in water you can tear through jagged pine but even farming the drops aren't as quick as mtps.  if you have plenty of stuff for mephit pies go for it.  not sure on drop rate there but imagine water is still easier to get.  take a collapsed spit with you to water and have a party.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>RangerTimy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you hunt in Bastion of Thunder, let your groups know that you need the Vann Toes and Jord Meat for baking.  My groups always let me take all of them, and I've been using those for skillups.  Vann Toe Stew and Jord Meat Pie are both very simple combines (apparently unlearnable, though).  The stats are weak, but hey, it's a free component that you get while also gaining experience, and it's easy.  Works for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Once the trivials get worked out it looks like some of the versions of GoD steaks, pies, and souffles will be worthwhile especially for foragers - I wind up with more hynid and cragbeast chunks than I can work with just standing around in Natimbi.  The sauces take a bit of work to accumulate because of single yield but it is easier and cheaper than MTP's and HP's so far.  <br />
<br />
One that worries me is if the pies and souffles only use snake eggs that a bottle neck will exist, but steaks to 220's is nice.</div></div><hr />
