<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tigger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
  <br />
My spell research was going along as planned. Until last night.<br />
<br />
 First I put into my sorcer's Lexicon: parchment, a quill, and Salil's Writ page 90.  I was attempting to skill up on swatches.<br />
<br />
 I hit combine and, got the message &quot;cannot combine these in this container.&quot;<br />
<br />
So I thought I might try practice runes.<br />
<br />
 I went and got my Concordance of Research in North Karana.<br />
<br />
 I attempted to both Magi and Master practice runes.<br />
<br />
 For Magi, I put in parchment, quill, topaz, shark skin, and brownie torso.  Hit combine, and got the message &quot;cannot combine these in this container&quot;<br />
<br />
 So I moved to Master.  Put into the Concordance of Research a quill, parchment, pearl, griffin feathers, and a undead froglok Tongue.  I hit the combine button, and got the message, &quot;cannot combine these in this container&quot;<br />
<br />
 So I went back to looking for runes.<br />
<br />
 About 2 hours later, I tried putting practice runes components into the Concordance of Research. I hit the combine button, and this time absolutely nothing happened.  No error messages, nothing. The components just sat in the Concordance. I hit the button three more times to make sure, same result, nothing. I switched to the Master Beza components, hit combine, and again absolutely nothing happened.<br />
<br />
  I am really confused at this point.  Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A few things to check:<br />
<br />
Did you use a quill or your research geerlock? (been there, done that., it’s why I ask ;p )<br />
<br />
For the swatch :  Did you use the “Sorcerer’s Lexicon” obtained in Gunthak ? Did you use Salil’s Writ Pg 90 right?<br />
<br />
For the Magi (Azia) Practice Rune, you need to use “Brownie Parts”  (the ones that are used in Baking to make chocolate, NOT torso, head or leg.)<br />
<br />
For Master (Azia) Practice Rune, that’s supposed to be the correct recipe, if it doesn’t work, /bug it in the game.<br />
<br />
Finally, once you have a pair of Practice Runes, you have to combine them in your Sorceror's Lexicon, NOT in the Concordance of Research...the Concordance is only used to created the Practice Runes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
  <br />
My spell research was going along as planned. Until last night.<br />
<br />
 First I put into my sorcer's Lexicon: parchment, a quill, and Salil's Writ page 90.  I was attempting to skill up on swatches.<br />
<br />
 I hit combine and, got the message &quot;cannot combine these in this container.&quot;<br />
  <br />
<br />
When you used Salil's Writ Page 90... which side did you use? Left or Right?<br />
<br />
And did you use &quot;a piece of parchment&quot;?<br />
<br />
The reported recipe to produce the Mana Scribed Swatch should use the Right Side of Salil's Writ Page 90</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>tigger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank you for your replies.<br />
<br />
<br />
(1) I checked and I have page 90 left side =( This stinks because I have been saving them up and have a stack of 40 of them.<br />
<br />
(2) Yes I was using brownie torsos.  I will check into the baking section and see how to make brownie parts.<br />
<br />
(3) I will do some more experimenting wth practice runes, and may need to report a bug if it doesn't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You don't MAKE brownie parts... you loot them off dead brownies.<br />
<br />
The item is actually called &quot;brownie parts&quot;. Looks like a foraged rabbit meat.<br />
<br />
Let me make a suggestion. Stop wasting time on practice runes. If you have practice points, just train research at your guildmaster. If not, its usually considerably easier to make swatches or gather real runes off vendors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I tried a go at the practice runes way back when.  The thing that stopped me was that one component out of every recipe wasn't stackable, which made it difficult to do in large quantities.<br />
<br />
If you are interested, the brownie parts drop rather abuntantly in Steamfont near the gears/mino cave, from fairly low level brownies (under lvl 15, I think).  They are casters, so be prepared.</div></div><hr />
