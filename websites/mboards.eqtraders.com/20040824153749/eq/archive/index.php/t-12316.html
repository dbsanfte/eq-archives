<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LlandraLorewind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi.. I'm new, and I was just wondering if I had to have LoY to make illusion potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To make anything, you simply need the materials and the tradeskill container. The actual expansion would only be needed if you can't buy/trade for the materials needed... or can't reach the tradeskill container to do the combine.<br />
<br />
For Example, to make PoP Jewelry you need a Planar Jewelery Kit... which someone else who has PoP can buy and sell to you. So PoP is not required.<br />
<br />
But, to make PoP armor that can only be made in a Tanaan Forge, found only in Plane of Knowledge... you MUST have the PoP Expansion.<br />
<br />
So for LoY Potions... get someone with LoY Expansion to buy them for you, or find someone in the bazaar that is selling them... and get them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, the herb you need is not No Drop, so you just need someone to go buy it for you.  The other ingredients are the meat (or blood, for guktans) of the race you wish to become.  Most or all of those drop outside LoY, and all are tradeable.</div></div><hr />
