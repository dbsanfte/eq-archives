<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fazon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">anyone know of a store bought way go from 48 skill to 250 skill?<br />
<br />
and what would the approximate cost be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, you can storebuy your way to 250.  However, I'd really only recommend using the normal skill up route to about 199...  From 200 on it is actually cheaper to just spend the money and burn training points at Stanos in Highpass for the skill-ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lolanae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I raised poison to 250 doing storebought.  You can make Athropic Sap to about 98 skill, then calicum Rot to about 172.  You can apply these to raise apply poison in the process.  Afterwards, you can make Spirit of the Sloth all the way to 250.  Don't apply these, just sell back to the merchant.  They sell for about 9pp each.<br />
<br />
With Sipirt of the Sloth, you never have to leave the poison merchant room in PoK.  Calium rot requires a trip to the vendor in Steamfont, and I can't remember about Athropic.  <br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fazon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks Guys ... I have put off poison making for way to long :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lolanae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was the same.  I had gotten it to 117ish range, and then put it on the back burner.  I had some pp to blow and time to kill (groupless due to holiday weekend).  So within about two days of on and off combining I got 250.<br />
<br />
When it comes to the master vial (I bet you will get this far :) ), I tried once at about 238 skill with geerlok and failed.  So afterwards I waited to 250, and made it fine.  Afterwards, the factioning for the seal began.  The seal is NICE.  So if you get interested in this, I would suggest beginning to raise faction with Circle of Unseen Hands.  From post I've read, max ally is the safest bet to keep Renux from eating your box (8 poisons + eyerazzia + gm vial).<br />
<br />
GOOD LUCK =))<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Barli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I fully agree with the path that  Lolanae suggested as I did that myself.   I have a level 39 Rogue and got up to 200 skill using that skill up path.   It takes a lot of plat, even had my DEX skill at 215 during all attempts (it helps a lot believe me).<br />
<br />
I have to level up more (51) to raise it further but since I'm at 200 now I can make Drop of Mercury for my Dwarven blacksmith's Earthen Tempers.  Its nice not to have to farm one of those components anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lolanae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Mercury is a main compenent in alot of high end poisons.  So I'd set aside some in the bank.  All advanced poisons, use advanced poison vials and celestial suspensions (celestial esscense + etheral susp.).  Just some ideas on what to look out for and save for later.<br />
<br />
Note: Only advance poisons can be made into 5 and 10 dose poisons using the summoned coffin vials from seal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nihixul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I always sold back my made poisons to a vendor, since I knew that the only poisons I was really worried about were the PoP proc-based ones, which do not check for Apply Poison skill. It really helped offset the cost at the end, especially if you use a geerlok.</div></div><hr />
