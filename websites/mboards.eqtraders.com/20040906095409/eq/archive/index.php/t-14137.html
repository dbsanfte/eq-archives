<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ryndar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So has anyone discovered exactly what mobs drop these? in what zones? are they foragable? I haven't had much time to play in the new zones, but did complete the first of the freebie quests with one of the fletching merchants in Abysmal, but haven't as of yet had a chance to go hunting. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seraph</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Chunk of Taelosian Rock drops off tureptas (the big turtle things) in Natimbi. I've seen it in a couple other places, but don't have the exact mobs, and if you're gonna farm it, tureptas are by far the easiest to kill. It's not an incredibly common drop, but by no means rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>madkat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">chunk of taelosian rock dropped from vxed and tipt too but kinda rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Deoca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Have also seen the Chunk of Taelosian Rock drop in the sewers off the turtles.  Several hours ... 2 rocks.  So they aren't exactly common drops.  It would likely take quite some time to use this route for skill-ups.<br />

The resulting arrows are hopefully of use somewhere in the new expansion (I am an optimist, there has to be a reason for pre-Velious rank arrows in a mostly PoP+ area).  After all, the NPC on the Queen *did* mention in his chatter something along the lines of &quot;being able to improve&quot; upon the arrow.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>adetia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">there's several types of arrows that can be created with these materials when refined.  do a search and click on the recipe thingie in the database. i would imagine that there will be other recipes in the future but i know there are many different types of arrows, some triv ~ 227 or so, so will be good for skilling up if you have the drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vixxen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Chunk of Discord Rock dropped in Kod`Taz forgot which mobs.. it was where we were farming key peices from Forgotten Martyr's. Drop rate so far on these seems rare. <br />
<br />
Also noted when finishing the quest to have the ability to work the material it stated that in time we might be able to improve the technique. so perhaps they will develop something in the future, or become absent minded and waste our time :D</div></div><hr />
