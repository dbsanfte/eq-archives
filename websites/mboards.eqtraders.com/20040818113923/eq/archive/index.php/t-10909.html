<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sond Planeshifter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Besides Old Sebilis and Akheva, can anyone confirm zones where this rune can drop?  I am looking for a place to farm this rune in quantity for use in cultural tailoring, any help would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6718 is the faq.<br />
<br />
There is no zone where you can farm individual research components &quot;in quantity&quot;<br />
<br />
Old world research items are random drops, and selected from ALL research items in a level based set.  A mob that can drop rune of astral can also drop EVERY research item for spells of that level, for ALL classes.<br />
<br />
Seb, hate, fear (although not a great place for any drops), chardok, hs.. any zone where the old world research stuff drops, that has higher level mobs.  Also a decent place is raptors in Tim Deep, as they seem to have no loot table other than research stuff.<br />
<br />
Some loot tables for mobs is skewed (read as either broke, or &quot;working as intended&quot;).. genoids in wakening lands drop research stuff for mid 20's to mid 30's spells.. for example.  Old world, and kunark, seem to have decently tuned tables.<br />
<br />
Also, vendor shop.. going through PoK, bazaar, and PoT vendors might give you an abbundance of the pieces you need, just hope no one came before you needing the same one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />
