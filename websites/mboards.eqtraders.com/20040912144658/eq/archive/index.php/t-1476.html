<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turlo Lomon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Despite what some people believe, I recall a post by Verant from way back stating that the spell file people parse for information is not actually used by the system.  It is there for reference only. The spell processes are affected server side only.<br />
<br />
So...<br />
<br />
If we now have a 10 slot mortar and pestle, and possible hidden data on server side, that would mean we have possible recipes requiring more then 6 slots.  I suspect these are Tier III poisons.<br />
<br />
I would love to hear any theories, suggestions on testing, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Feel free to try some, and sugguest avenues of research. <br />
<br />
And check links listed in this forum to see what others are doing. <br />
<br />
Do you have a reference to that post?  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dulok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is virtually no way there is currently tier3, even if they could hide spell effects which they really can't do rogues had to trial and error to find all the pop poisons that means virtually every single combine ever thought of has been attempted.   I mean feel free to try it but just think you would be wasting your time.</div></div><hr />
