<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Deseray</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK i read in the learn section of this site that the guy went to around 122 with 30 odd plats. HIs list incudes 50 Med Jar Sketches, 200 Med Bowl Sketches 250 Waters, and 250 Med Blocks of Clay. After doing a little more research i cant find where he bought these med blocks of clay. Was he mistaken and meant small or large curious cuz Im looking into starting Pottery cuz smithing has got me at wits end at 204 currently and dont want to see Velium for a little while. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kumgum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are no blocks of clay labeled as &quot;medium&quot; that I am aware of.  However there are large, small, and just regular blocks.  If you look up the receipes he describes you will see that you need &quot;blocks of clay&quot;.  <br />
<br />
He probably made the mistake because of the &quot;medium jar sketches&quot; and &quot;medium bowl sketches&quot; resulting in medium jars and medium bowls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That info is old and needs to be updated.<br />
<br />
It used to be the low end pottery skillups whent WAY too fast, compared to the other tradeskills, and a while back they fixed it so the skillup rate is more in line with the other skills.<br />
It will take you 2-3 times as many combines to skill up to that level now.<br />
<br />
P.S. You can follow the route shown where you looked in Thurgadin, thats where i always skilled up my toons for the Thurgadin Gate Potion quest.</div></div><hr />
