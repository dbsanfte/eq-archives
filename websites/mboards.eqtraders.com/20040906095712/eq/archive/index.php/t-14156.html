<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I saw this looking to see if anyone entered the weird tuna recipes into Lucy database.  Not sure but the collector went by Bill &quot;Chef&quot; Chowderly.<br />
<br />
Anyhow just conjecturing that maybe there is a baking quest that uses the weird recipes in the list <br />
Spicy Tuna Salad<br />
Pan Seared Orange Tuna (only made by Vah Shir rogues I guess)<br />
Taelosian Tuna Kabobs<br />
Tuna Rice Surprise<br />
and maybe that Chowderly's Delightful Tuna Cakes.<br />
<br />
Also wondering in in JC there might be something parallel going on with the oddball recipes:<br />
Golblin Eye Earring?  (forgot what it made)<br />
Shrunken Skull necklace<br />
and Iridescent Shell Headdress.<br />
<br />
I guess we will find out more if someone says how they got the book, and when folks make the JC items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Millibeans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I made Tuna Rice Suprise today and did not give me my Wok back the successful combine :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqNichola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Maybe that's the surprise? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naeadiene Needsamap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">OUCH!</div></div><hr />

Maybe that's the surprise? :p  <br />
<br />
Ahahaha! Thanks for that, haven't had such good laugh in hours. I'll sleep sound tonight :D<br />
<br />
... Say.. is that a wok down your throat or are you just happy to see me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Finally got &quot;A Spotted Mushroom&quot; and made the Kabob.  Chef Chowderly actually took the item from me but didn't say a word.  Everything else I ever handed to him gets handed back - including the Spicy Tuna Salad Sandwich.<br />
<br />
Had another question - where did Chowderly's Delightful Tuna Cakes recipe come from? - it isn't one in the UI and I don't remember it in the recipe book either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kaycie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">dunno im still working on geting a vahshir rouge up high enought o cook for me lol.  It almost seems like you need some kind of faction with chowderly he wont talk to me at all all i get is the you havent proven yourself to the cause messages, still need to go farm eggs in ssra  could really kick myself for giveing them all to my freind in noodle form a few weeks before the expansion<br />
<br />
Kay</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How do you get Chef Chowderly to speak to you in the first place?  Everytime I hail him, I get that &quot;you need to show more dedication&quot; message.  Is it a quest, trial, etc, that I need to do to get him to speak to me?<br />
<br />
-Fin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So far as folks have reported he hasn't spoken to anyone yet.  I just handed him the kabob and he kept it.  Didn't say anything at all, versus when I hand him other things and he says &quot;Froni, I have no need for this item.  You may have it back.&quot;  (or whatever the exact phrase is)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Koutarou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would assume it to be a quest.  The lack of response says to me that you've stumbled onto one of the items of a &quot;hand in 2-4 things&quot; turnin.<br />
<br />
Did you try handing in another one or anything else immediately after (to verify that the lack of response was indeed not due to some change in your faction)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yep, but I didn't have any of the other weird tuna recipes with me at the time.  I tried giving him a patty melt, barbequed tuna cakes, and a few other things that I can't quite remember (prolly roots - I try and give everything roots.)  He only took the kabob and was silent.  I tried hailing him afterwards and got the standard prove yourself first reply.<br />
<br />
I tried in the past (maybe 2 weeks ago) to give him the spicy tuna salad sandwich and he didn't want that or any of the tunas, or tuna meat reduction I tried.  <br />
<br />
I'll try and get another A Spotted Mushroom or four (they sure don't drop very frequently and none of the other no drop mushroom types from DSP have worked in the recipe to date) and see if he'll take them then.  I can try giving him tuna surprise, but have no way to make the pan seared tuna and will need to drag friends to Ssra to try the other recipe.  I am still wondering where Chowderly's Delightful Tuna Cakes came from.</div></div><hr />
