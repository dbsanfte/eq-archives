<br />
I am doing the Journeyman Smith Trophy Quest, and it asks for a Platinum-Bladed Long Spear. I cannot seem to find a recipe for this anywhere. <br />
<br />
Is it the same recipe as the Golden-Bladed Long Spear, just with platinum substituted for gold? Or is it something else altogether? Any help would be greatly appreciated. <br />
<br />
ps Thank you all for the massive amount of help you have already given me over the last few weeks. This tradeskill community simply rocks!</div></div><hr />

Is that what you're looking for? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks so much Lillanu!</div></div><hr />

My search on EQTraders did not find this recipe.  I located it on Allakhazam.  Could it be that there is some coding problem with this recipe that it does not appear readily on search here?</div></div><hr />

I feel this item being required, as well as the pale platinum mace, are just prime examples of the hatred of casual players.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;, you might ask.  It is simple.  This is an example of the unending show that people who are not just swimming in platinum are all but useless to the EQ community.   These items will end up costing me more then I have, or could make in months, in pp to make.  The kits required, which can only be made by high level jewelcrafters, go for thousands of pp on prexus(terris thule).  So again, thank you EQ for taking away the joy of crafting and leaving it to high end people who only do it to pass time and to get rid of unending amounts of plat that those of us who are too low level, and too impoverished in game to even afford spells, will never see.<br />
<br />
Thank you for killing the joy from tradeskills.  Might as well put a lv 65-70 requirement on them to start, as those are the only people who can afford it.<br />
<br />
Excuse the rant from a lowly crafting fanatic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People are charging that much because they are gouging. You don't want to buy from gougers anyway, it's bad karma.<br />
<br />
You say the kits cannot be made except by high level jewelcrafters, but the kits used for the pale platinum combine trivial at 122. At that level, there isn't a lot of profit to be made (jewelers have a lot of competition, since it's easy to &quot;buy into&quot; that skill.) Have you tried using barter, or asking around? This is exactly the kind of thing that I love about tradeskilling - making things for people who appreciate them. I'm sure there must be some friendly people on your server, as well.<br />
<br />
I know it's frustrating sometimes, and I feel your pain. I'm not going to see level 70 anytime soon, either.</div></div><hr />

I made my kits myself... back when the Master Quest required something made from Shimmering Steel.<br />
<br />
It's terribly easy to get your JC up to 150-ish.  And if you have a pocket-chanter (like my bazaar mule, level 26), you can enchant the Silver, Electrum and Gold and lose very little on the sell-backs.<br />
<br />
As far as the Aligned Ore goes... I find that on NPC Vendors sometimes still.  It drops in Natimbi (rarely, but it does) and isn't that hard to aquire.<br />
<br />
Trust me, the new Trophy is well worth it!</div></div><hr />
