<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lyron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, this is a thread for all the things that still bother us about EQ, not necessarily tradeskill related.  Keep it clean and rant-free.  Remember, the goal is to NOT get punted to Primal Scream.<br />
<br />
Things I'd like to see:<br />
<br />
1) A decent set of mid-level, tailored caster armor - something with a little int and a few other stats, something like the new smithed armors from LDoN.  (Which, by the way, are nice, but did they really have to cream the old-school cultural smithing market to do them?  But I digress...)<br />
<br />
2) Some useful rezzes for low-level clerics (and paladins).  A cleric should be able to resurrect a dead group member of similar experience by close to 50%.  Let's say, 50% if the resurrectee is of the same level as the spell, falling by 1% every level until the current percentage value of the spell is reached.  Same thing for paladins, but they use the cleric spell levels.  Or maybe they start at 35%.<br />
<br />
3) Some sort of alteration to necro sacrifices.  Allowing a full rez would be bad, I get that.  But full death seems a little extreme too.  Of course, the idea that a necro could trade sacrifices with another necro and rez himself without a cleric will send some money-making clerics into conniptions....<br />
<br />
4) Some sort of bard brass song that would actually let you practice without hurting your surroundings before level 42.  Maybe something that lets your party (or raid) members know where you are in relation to them. (OK, so I've seen LotR : TFotK a few times, what of it?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Interesting.  I have 3 little wishes.  <br />
<br />
1.  Has nothing to do with tradeskills, but would LOVE to see the racial experience penalty disappear at a higher level, say 50 or 55.  The reasoning behind it (ie-iksar have regen and higher innate AC) is understandable at lower levels, but gear and buffs sort of even everyone out later along.<br />
<br />
2.  A use for learning languages.  I've gotten lots of them to 100, and still enjoy hanging with guildmates and doing a quick spam session to learn another.  Maybe a quest where you have to respond to an NPC in their native tongue?<br />
<br />
3.  Maybe a chance to forage alchemy ingredients?  I know iksar are the only shaman who can forage...but then again, we're the only shaman who can't use the beloved JBB.    <br />
<br />
Otherwise, I'm fairly happy in my little world.  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
They didn't cream the old cultural market any worse than it was already creamed.  Speaking as a dark elf:<br />
<br />
AC: 26<br />
STR: +4 DEX: +10 INT: +4<br />
<br />
isn't creamed by:<br />
<br />
AC: 27<br />
STR: +3 STA: +4<br />
<br />
Judging by the non-market for the cultural robes, I'd say this (more int caster items) would be a total non-starter of an idea.<br />

Resurrects are supposed to save time.  Well, that's the net purpose of a rez.  Since clerics get a 50 percent rez at 34, you're talking about lower levels.  Although it has been a while since I've been that level, I'm going to guess that you lose more time getting back to wherever you are hunting than you lose regaining the experience (I know an unrezzed death is one kill at the PC levels, and it's not terribly much more after that).<br />
<br />
I'm actually pretty happy with the direction they are taking the game now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You reminded me of something when you mentioned necro-rez.  It's something that will likely never happen, but be fun if it did (in my mind) and fall in line with the whole necro &quot;masta of the dead&quot; theme.  This is how I would love to see necro rezz work:<br />
<br />
- Wahriorr McTanksalot dies.<br />
- Johnny Necro rezzes.<br />
- Wahriorr pops back into zone at full health and no rezz-effects however he cannot control himself.<br />
- For the duration of however long normal rezz-effects last, the newly raised player is the necro's pet, with all the normal pet commands and actions available to the necro, with the exception of the &quot;Go away/kill yourself&quot; command.  Basically the rezee is charmed for the duration.<br />
- When the &quot;rez-effects&quot; timer runs out, Wahriorr McTanksalot regains control of himself.<br />
<br />
HOW COOL WOULD THAT BE!?  I'm not a necro nor do I ever plan on playing one, but that just sounds like fun to me.  The opporunities for the funny in such situations are endless.  And it fits the whole necro raise-and-control-the-dead motif!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">check out what the necro wake the dead or call of the dead does.  <br />
<br />
caster robes may not sell well but i would have loved an option to tailor some stat items for other areas.  jewelry fillis in a lot of it but a player made int/mana item for shoulders (before shawl obviously), back, maybe a wrist, gloves and boots be nice, and definetely pants and arms would do wonders.  how badly do int caster arms and legs :steamed:? (say it with smiley)  <br />
<br />
mostly past that on my main but something like ldon armor with options of int/mana, agi/ac, int/ac, mana/agi or so on doesn't sound bad.  could even make it a durn forage.  my alts would thank them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lyron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually, caster robes selling well on my current server (Stromm).<br />
<br />
The problem with caster robes is, of course, so many recipes are available for one slot.  So when people use them to skill up, or make a batch to sell, they only produce chest slot items.  Also, good low/mid-level robes (Crystalline, Green Silk, Crystal Covered Shroud, Oracle, Advisor...) already drop, so the new robes are competing with them.  But for low/mid-level caster armor (for chararcters say, 25-40) there aren't many drops. (Loam-encrusted? Netted kelp?  Maybe.)  Maybe it's just more noticable because I'm playing on Stromm.</div></div><hr />

I want Mules. I want to be able to use my other 5 non-playing char-slots on sullon as bank space. I wrote out a whole thing on Mules, I should find it and type it up. The main great thing about Mules, as far as any general person is concerned, is that they would be able to hold 12 bags on their person, not just 8, and they'd have super-low graphics, making them preferred for bazaar mules. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Apolline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Finally, someone else who agrees XD<br />
<br />
I'd LOVE to have mules. Not like a playable character, but like.. like.. a MULE. Donkey. whatever you want to call it.<br />
<br />
Make them have VERY limited skills (Kick is the only one that comes to mind), but nice strenght as well (they're pack mules, of course). That way, for those like me that would just DIE to play a quadraped other than a froglok ;) , we wouldnt be as tempted to actually play it. <br />
<br />
Have them mostly be bland, 'skin' varition wise, I mean, just enough that they can be unique, but not enough that you could have a hot pink, purple-mohawk hossie :/<br />
<br />
Yet another way to add uniqueness.. Who wants to see a mule without packs on it's back? just WHER does it hold the stuff?! (I know, I know, item database cant handle this, but I CAN DREAM CANT I!?) Whelp, they could toss in a variety of livery..<br />
<br />
Ie, &quot;Small Saddlebags&quot;, chest slot (back wouldnt show up), would look like, well, small saddlebags when equipped. Could have like.. 5 str on it. now, &quot;Well Made Bag&quot; or somesuch, that could look a lot more dencent, as in he had a bag and stuff on back.. and have a bigger bonus to str (to hold more stuff, of course)<br />
<br />
Course there could also be things like 'Leg Warmers' that would keep their shins protected, and chestguards, and stuff like that..<br />
<br />
<br />
NEver going to see it, but I can pretend :( &lt;prods eq2&gt; I have hopes!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I remembered the other thing. <br />
<br />
A &quot;Group Gate To Self's Bind&quot; for druids and wizards. Like, I can take my group with me to my own bind point. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Re Mules.<br />
Gonna do this from memory, so this is not the complete version. <br />
<br />
The singular point of Mules is to offer Bank space. To this end: A Mule is almost a playable NPC. A Mule is chosen like a race, not a class, the player choses the gender, and there are only two models, independant of race. A Mule is linked to a main character, in my case, Iroke, and starting city, deity, and necessary stats are determined by that main. (Irokemuleone would start in Kelethin, worship Tunare, have the faction appropriate to an unadjusted woodelf druid, and the HP of one as well.) <br />
<br />
(Snipping section on how to aquire Mule names, it's not the most important thing atm.) <br />
<br />
Mules enter Norrath within right click distance of a Banker, devoid of any possessions. Mules cannot equip gear or weapons of any kind, do not need to eat or drink, and do not have that noob bag on them. Mules have the standard 8 bank slots, the 8 Loy bank slots of the account is equipped with such, and instead of the 8 standard self-inventory slots, a Mule can carry 12 bags. Mules can, of course, receive bags through Shared Bank, or purchase from vendors. Mules can hold plat and interact with NPCs and the world of Norrath in appropriate non-offensive manners (buy from vendors, be killed by kos mobs, die from falling off of Kelethin, the like). Mules cannot fight, group, or hold buffs. Mules can be TLed by a wizard but not ported by a druid. Mules cannot /duel but can be killed in Arena-style PVP. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm probably missing something, but that's the general idea. They hold more bags, you can try to haul them around with you if you want but they can't group and are so very likely to die (they'll have anywhere from 8 to 26 hitpoints, depending on what the linked Main is, and they can't hold buffs or gear to increase this number), they cannot recieve rezzes (rez-effects is a 'buff'). The idea is to either leave them by the bank or take them to the bazaar to be bazaar fluffs. They do NOT fight, they do NOT travel long distances. <br />
<br />
<br />
etc etc. make more sense? anywho, that's my crazy creation. <br />

Well, they've said repeatedly that they weren't going to allow people two bind spots - just too many FedEx quests.  And with two porting classes, that's exactly what this turns into.  Imagine one person binding on Sister's Isle, another in Kaladim, and shuttling a twink (or 4 twinks, on 4 accounts) back and forth, doing the kiola nut quest.  Of course, that quest has been nerfed, but still, I'm sure you get my point.<br />

And this is different than porting them to a druid ring (or to Surefall) now how?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been ported (visible) to every druid ring there is (including SFG).  Haven't once died from it yet - well that's not entirely true - I got evaced to EK with 40 health at level 30 or so once and didn't quite make the zone.  The only mildly unsafe one is north karana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
MANY people can be KOS to that dragon...  that lives rather near to that ring, and agro range is to that ring if it is in its starting point...<br />
<br />
If it happens that that dragon has spawned (OK the name escapes me!!!) you could have a very dead person :)<br />
<br />
But yeah.  Gate to bind could be very abused :)<br />
<br />
Bight right in front of the entrance to Umbral planes.   Heck.  Bind right in front of Rumblecrush in Umbral planes!!!  Sure the Wizard is also not safe... but you can take them down with you :)<br />
<br />
If you are a Dark Elf Wizard... bind deep in the Necro area of Neriak 3rd gate.<br />
<br />
There are many really nasty places that a person can bind, and kill a group :/<br />
<br />
And that does not even includce fed-ex abuse :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Well, they've said repeatedly that they weren't going to allow people two bind spots&quot;<br />
<br />
Thurg gate potions and spirit/faithstones already circumvent this for a few classes. A cleric or a shaman could have 3 places they could go: gate, guild, thurg. Int casters can have to (gate and thurg) and melees can get TLed to bind or have thurg. IOW: too late. <br />
<br />
<br />
And as for being ported someplace bad: it's the same kind of thing as selling ports in the first place. I would NOT randomly take the group I was with to my own bind without telling them first, anymore than I would randomly port to CS or WL. It's an option, just like all other ports are options that 'weren't there before'.  And if Wizard_2034 causes you to be killed through Group-Gate-To-Self-Bind, he either better apologize and find you a rez, or you can tell Pok that he is untrustworthy. Same as normal. Just one different spell. <br />

No, those are completely different things.  Those are predetermined locations that you go to, not player-defined.  Heck, shamans have a whole list of port potions they can make, and druids and wizards can already go pretty close to anywhere that's not on Kunark.  I still say that having two separate places where someone can bind and port, or a two-person approximation of that, is a recipe for exploitation.</div></div><hr />

Here's one. <br />
In-group tracking. Two days ago (or was it yesterday?) I ended up buying Neverwinter Nights to play with my BF and his friends online (Quartic loves to slip in little reminders that 'playing online is free'). When I'm in a group and my groupmembers are in the same zone, I can either bring up a map and the people in group with me show up as little purple dots, or if I don't want the map up, there is a certain box with an arrow for each charactor, noting which direction they are, relative to myself and which way i'm facing. <br />
<br />
Now, I can understand why only druids and rangers have Track. But in group tracking would be sooo very nice, especially when PKers come and we get split up in Great Divide and I'm the cleric and my groupies start taking damage and I have no idea where anyone is and oh what a pretty Harmtouch graphic just hit me..... <br />
<br />
<br />
Someone also mentioned, once upon a time, being able to check and see who has what buffs on (with an in-group restriction, of course). This to me would be nice for those tanks that forget to call when DS falls and then get angry when I don't keep it on them all the time.  Not that I can think of a decent UI method of displaying this, but oh well. <br />
<br />

<br />
Oh yeah, that was something else. It would be nice to be able to see, in the UI, the class (and if i really wanted to dream, the level) of people I am grouped with. Useful for low level pick up groups, so I know whom to haste and whom to c1. If i REALLY wanted to dream, I could wish for seeing current/total HP (useful for clerics, to know when to heal to maximize mana). Not that I can justify a lot of this from an RPing perspective, nor that I even expect it. But as long as we're dreaming.... ^_^ <br />

Sounds like a good story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">aah zones. Another thing from NWN, you can hold your mouse over the portrait of your group members and see their name, their actual/total HP, and what zone they are in (if they have no zone, they are zoning). Also, there is a little red bar next to all portraits that shows health, and turns colors if poisoned or diseased. <br />
<br />
Now I KNOW a lot of that is (apparently) beyond the scope of EQ. The NWN server we (myself, my BF, and his friends) play on has a maximum of 20 people logged in at any given time, so I assume the system can take 'flourishing liberties' that EQ cannot. But still, it's either refreshing or spoiling. ^_^ <br />
<br />
<br />
Heck, I'd be happy if I knew how to force my UI to show the names of group members not in zone with me (rather than a solid dull red bar that only means &quot;they're not in the same zone&quot;. I can't ever seem to find what piece of code controls that, grrr. <br />
<br />
but yeah, /who all group seems like it wouldn't be that hard to put in, you know? I mean, you can search /who all [class], and that's got to be a more complicated return than returning people who are already grouped with you. (not like it would make a frigging difference on sullon anyway, the first thing everyone does is /anon and they stay that way from 1 to 65+300, unless they're suicidal or showing off *cough*Hate-in-Time-b*cough*.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Definitely having a /who all group that is just a macro type command for<br />
<br />
/who all member1<br />
/who all member2<br />
/who all member3<br />
/who all member4<br />
/who all member5<br />
<br />
Hmmm... with the %T, %R, %C etc... that subsitute in the target's NAME, RACE, CLASS... etc... maybe have added in %T1, %R2, %C3... where the number following is the group member number. And that would be useable in the /who command? hmmmm....<br />
<br />
and it would make sense to have a /who all raid as well.<br />
<br />
Besides, they do have a /who all guild which has been around forever.<br />
<br />
I would also like to have my default channel be -SAY- when I log in... with it auto-changed to -GROUP- when I join a group, and -RAID- when I join a raid. If I leave a group, channel should revert to -SAY- (unless still in a raid). If I leave a Raid, revert to -SAY-. If I join a group that is part of a raid already, default should be -RAID-..</div></div><hr />
