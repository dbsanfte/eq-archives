<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>OutcastAssassin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My Skill in Brewing is 80 now. I brew Gnomish Spirits from skill 62 (fish wine), to my current skill. I'm thinking about continuing with the spirits, but the last thing i want to do it run all the way across east commons with teh lag i already hit, just to buy rat ears. any other suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inyidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Brew Fetid Essence (I think that's the name).  It's one grub (normal fishing grub) and one water flask in a brew barrel.  Trivials at 122.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>OutcastAssassin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aha! Exactly what i was looking for! Thanks! it's cheap, easy, and it's easy to buy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Once you get done with that, you can either use Faydwer Shakers OR you can use Shar Vahl essense.  One payala fruit (groundspawn in shadeweaver's thicket) plus one water flask trivs in the 180s</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>OutcastAssassin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think im gonna do Skull Ale to 151, then do the Shar Vahl Essence to my 180s. It's quite a jump from 180s to 248 using Mino's, so ill have to find something to bridge the gap there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>maedie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just do Minotaurs from 187 to 248. It actually is the easiest, and there are no &quot;stuck points&quot; in brewing like there are in other tradeskills. If you just want to skill up fast, go to Halas (where i went) and brew up in the room where the merchants are that sell short beer and everything else you need. It's the quickest and cheapest, with the least amount of clicks and no foraging!<br />
<br />
I did grobbs and teas for about a month, just to amuse myself. got from 187 to 205, but took a long time. (grobbs subcombines are a pita.)  After that diversion,  i went from 205 to 248 in two days doing mino's in Halas.</div></div><hr />
