<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Are the crafted LDoN chest and leg pieces really the only items in the game with Type 2 aug slots on them?  I purchased a Broken Crypt Stone of Fortitude (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=24088) for 100AP at the Mistmoore camp in Butcherblock the other night before I realized that I have not a single piece of gear that it can go on.  If type 2 slots are indeed limited to only the crafted LDoN chest and legs, then I think I just wasted 100AP since I don't believe any of that stuff would be an upgrade for me, even with the aug.<br />
<br />
Do any of you know of any other gear with a type 2 slot or did I just waste a bunch of adventuring time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Serenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A large percentage of the jewelry/armor bought in LDoN camps have type 2 slots, a somewhat smaller percentage have type 3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
has a list, but short answer is that type 2 augs go in LDoN purchased armour.<br />

I'm pretty happy with my shaman's LDoN neck.  Was about 700 points:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok, so pretty much I just need to adventure my way into enough points to purchase a gear upgrade that has a type 2 slot.  Thats not so bad I guess (even though I don't adventure much anymore so this will probably take a long time).  I can just bank it until I get enough points for something decent.  Thanks for the heads up.  I'll go check out the item lists to see what I should work towards.  I was &gt;&lt; this close to just destroying the aug in flustration.<br />
<br />
So, a side question.  Anyone have any suggestions on what item/camp I should adventure for to this end?  Keep in mind that it has taken me since LDoN was released to pull off 150 points for my BP and 100 points for that aug, so stuff in the bajillion-gazillion AP range isn't a huge consideration.<br />
<br />
&lt;Stugein&gt; Dude!  I got the 1492AP boots with a type 2 slot, finally!  I can put my Cryptstone on it!<br />
&lt;Guildie_001&gt; Um, bro.  You bought that aug 2 years ago...<br />
&lt;Stugein&gt; ...<br />
&lt;Stugein&gt; I hate you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Kiztent beat my reply. :)<br />
<br />
I think you nailed it with that ring.  With the aug added, it certainly is an upgrade for me in one of my ring slots.  Thanks for the suggestion.</div></div><hr />
