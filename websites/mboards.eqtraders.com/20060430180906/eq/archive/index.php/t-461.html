<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very server dependent.  On my server I buy windstones if they're priced at 200pp or less.  I'd suggest you take a look at what Acrylia plate is selling for on your server and judge from there.  It takes two windstones per piece of acrylia.  If you charge 200pp each, the smith is spending 400pp per Acrylia piece just for the windstones.  If they're making 3k or more per 3 sheet item (breastplate, greaves) then maybe you can hike your price up a bit.  If they're making 2k-ish then 200pp is about right.  If they're making less, you should probably consider dropping the price a tad.<br />
<br />
Unless the smith is just dripping in money, they are going to want to make some plat off their successes.   The more you eat into that the less likely they are to purchase your components.  And the more likely they are to spend their time doing shadowscream instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xaanru</div><div class="date">12-08-2002, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on the server, but on Rodcet Nife, I've never paid over 100pp for a windstone. Not even when the Acrylia BP was selling for 3500pp. They are down to 1500 or so these days, so now, I will DEFINITELY not be paying over 100. <br />
<br />
Real quick breakdown of costs for you, with the prices I usually pay:<br />
<br />
Acrylia temper:<br />
   2 windstones                200pp<br />
   1 essence of wind           50pp<br />
   1 clear mana                  30pp<br />
<br />
Breastplate mold                21pp<br />
Padding                             20pp<br />
3 folded sheets of acrylia   300pp (assuming no failures)<br />
Acrylia chain jointing           40pp (80 pp for one large brick)<br />
<br />
TOTAL                              661pp<br />
<br />
This is the cost for 1 ATTEMPT at a breastplate. This also assumes you get my prices, and I am very strict on not overpaying.<br />
<br />
Today I did a run of acrylia plate. I was shooting for 7 pieces, and failed twice. Plus I lost 2 blocks of acrylia to the sheet conversions. Then I lost one temper during the combine. That is a loss of 1800pp right out of the gate. Add to that the 3305 I spent on the successful combines, and I spent a total of 5105pp making those 5 bps and greaves. The last several pieces I have sold, have gone for between 1375 and 1550. Lets assume the average is 1500, which is about right. This means I am making a grand total of 450pp per item sold. If you ask me, any less, and it's just not worth making the stuff.<br />
<br />
Plug the prices for your server into this analysis, and you'll get a decent idea how much those windstones are worth.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Xaanru, you're prices seem low. Padding for 20pp? Acrylia blocks for 100pp? That's the vendor price for them (lower acutally, it's 104pp).<br />
<br />
The windstone price you pay depends on who your market is.<br />
<br />
If you are trying to sell to people skilling up, you need to make it cheaper than making sickles (and somehow fudge for the fewer subcombines on a acrylia BP).<br />
<br />
If it's to allow someone to make a reasonable profit selling acrylia armour, look at Xaanru's reference, check prices on all the subcomponents, and set it so that buying at market will cost about half the price of the final product (which has been the rough rule of thumb for tradeskill pricing for a while).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suva</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really hate paying more than 150 per a windstone.  The only time I will ever pay more is if I have the acrylia to make sheets and just need some tempers.  Blocks of acrylia go 125-175pp that I see on Brell.  I paid 25pp for the clear mana, but then I had to go farm the essence of wind since only one person was selling and wanted 150pp for em.  Usually the windstones are 250+ though, so I make a lot of shadowscream.  BP's sell slowly at 1500 and legs are also slow and just dropped to 900pp in what looks to be someone trying to sell their stock out.</div></div><hr />

Neither is 100pp for a block of acrylia -- heck, I sometimes buy them in the bazaar for 80-90 per block.<br />

I generally don't pay more than 125pp per windstone.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iceblossom</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On Morell-Thule... Windstones average above 200 (up to 350) when there is a seller.  Anything lower than 200 is bought immediately.  I, however, refuse to pay that (but I would consider 100-120 pp each).  I farm my own or go (PRIMAL SCREAM) shadowscream farming.<br />
<br />
Padding, if you buy from me 15 pp.  Otherwise 20ish.  Sometimes (rarely) as low as 12.  And all the grief I used to get on these boards 18 months or so ago before the smithing changes when I was being called a greedy extortionist shaman for charging 5 pp each to the buyers who sought me out...<br />
<br />
Essence of Wind, not so bad.  30-50 pp.<br />
<br />
Acrylia... people actually buy that?  Haven't ever had to buy, have so many stacks of rings and such in my bank account from when I am trying to get the #(%*)*) windstones.<br />
<br />
Clear Mana, hardly ever for sale in bazaar.  Brought my enchanter up to level to make my own.  (First it was the viscous mana for tailoring...)<br />
<br />
Iceblossom<br />
Who has about 100 combines in trying to break 191 in smithing<br />
But did manage this weekend to break 162 in tailoring after about 60 combines</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do people really use acrylia for skill-ups (in bulk I mean)? When I was skilling I looked at the various options and it quickly became clear that shadowscream was the only viable route. And this was before Hollowshade was fixed, when you'd spend more time getting the mobs you wanted into the south islands than actually farming them (not to mention the no rent tag on shadows). It's even easier now.<br />
<br />
I think Xaanru is right, pricing of windstones should be looked at in relation to the pricing of acrylia armour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zukobim</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 05:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On AB I can at all times of the day find atleast 10 windstones in the 150-200pp price range. These are actually never sold.<br />
Windstones seems to sell for 50-100pp, where a 100pp pricetag even can take some time to make a sale.<br />
Many smiths on AB seems to be or have highlevel toons that can do the farming quickly, which result in a low sales price.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not ENTIRELY true. You also have to buy water and the ore to make metal rings.<br />
<br />
 :D <br />

I'll skill up on anything I can get my hands on.  My point was that if I were to consider buying windstones, it would have to be at a price that makes it cost effective versus sickles.  I'm not going to look at the end product (acrylia plate) as a source of income, I look at windstones as a source of skill ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahlig</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Going to have to go with Kiz here.  If I am skilling up on shadowscream and I acquire Windstones and Acrylia, I will use them as quick as a whisper to get skill ups.  If they were even slightly more common, I would use acrylia over shadowscream due to the shadow gathering pita.  My time is limited so the easier farming, the better.</div></div><hr />
