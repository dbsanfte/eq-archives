is getting a little dated.<br />

One thing for sure, I would rather someone else did the work :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FennyMT</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i make a storyline called FoofySpells (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2171) that could be adapted to generate eqtraders info.  <br />
<br />
i have long wanted to do something like this, but, from what i have seen in the forums, eqtraders does not make it available in order to prevent the yantix crowd from profitting.<br />
