<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Longfoot Wispwoods</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a GM tailor that buys almost all components in the Bazaar. A large percentage of my profits come from Fleeting Quivers, Leatherfoot Haversacks, Acrylia Reinforced Tunics and Lemming Fur Backpacks. When I make a Storm Rider Tunic or a Mastodon Robe, there's not much profit after taking into account component costs and failure. <br />
 <br />
Just considering high priced items, and consider buying all components in the Bazaar, are other GM tailors seeing profits in items other than the ones I've mentioned?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Skilling up I made cobalt drake hide belts since they actually sell for a profit (depending on fail rates). I also made haversacks and when i got closer to 252 modded I made earthweave. The storm rider tunics also sell but VERY slowly. It took me 2 weeks to sell my first one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mahlig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have yet to sell Haversacks (still outfitting myself and friends), but I have made a large profit on Mastodon Cloaks (25k sales with less than 1k purchases as I farm my own furs) and Robes of Tempest (I vendor mine and loot all my runes and sell robes for 10-15k).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>AB-girlie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">a large ammount of my pp comes from ice silk armor. especially caps, since they only take 1 swatch.<br />
<br />
etheral silk swatches + cured for ornate is always a seller,but not really high end.<br />
<br />
when i see every tailor selling storm rider tunics, then i make cap and gloves.<br />
<br />
then theres my favorite, tae ew leather pants. If you can get 2 hides....=)<br />
<br />
velium mastodon fur cloaks, im done making them ! just failed 4 today (<br />
<br />
also storm-caster gloves.. whats the name..eeehm..stormweave or something. requires storm volaas hair. sells quite good for me.<br />
<br />
my 5cp of comments..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Velium Mastodan Cloaks fail about 50% of the time with MAX skill. I wouldnt make then unless the profit % is VERY high on your server or unless you have a very high skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>piting</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I make most of my plat with the (gnomish) Cultural Robes, particularly the final robe - robe of intellect. Even if I have to pay 2kp for the yaeth's p25 right that still gives me a handy profit because I sell them for 5kp.<br />
<br />
One really nice thing about the cultural robes is that they have &quot;low&quot; trivials - the 5th robe is triv 252 and the 6th is triv 262 - this translates into fewer failures!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Solarax_Manastorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">stonehide is a money maker but a really expencive combine<br />
<br />
today i just failled 7 in a row on earthweave =( there goes 21 saps down the drain)</div></div><hr />

From my own experience, this is what I've been selling best since regularly making higher-level combos. I've not got into planar tailoring yet, so there is obviously even more money to be made! :) <br />
<br />
Velium Mastodon cloaks: I know others don't appear to like them, but I've sold about 8 or 9 now for around 12k each.<br />
<br />
Fleeting quivers: Regular fast sellers at 3 - 4k each.<br />
<br />
Black Pantherskin: Sells well on my server. I concentrate on tunics, arms, legs and cloaks. They tick over nicely at a price of 1500 - 3k per item, depending on the competition in the Bazaar!<br />
<br />
Cobalt drake belts: Nice sellers at 700pp - ish<br />
<br />
Acrylia studded: Sleeves and cloaks sell out as fast as I can put them on my trader. 6 - 700 for sleeves, 800 - 1k for cloaks. I can understand the cloaks, for the +10 WIS, but have been surprised how quickly the sleeves have been snapped up.<br />
<br />
Leather padding (of course! :p ): Sells for 60pp per padding on my server (Mith Marr). I put mine at 50 and it's gone in minutes. I don't go out specifically hunting for hides for padding - more of a by-product of hopper killing!<br />
<br />
I'm doing a bit of everything at the moment, desperate for that last tailoring skill point. Tigeraptor and Arctic Wyvern armour is tough to move, and sits on my trader for quite a while. I've not bothered with Velium hound combines at all, as they are far too expensive, and these days there appear to be better items available in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps, and I'll be posting an analysis of my progression from 200 - 250 once I hit the magic figure.</div></div><hr />
