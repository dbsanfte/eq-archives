At this point, I have (from memory - YMMV) just over a stack of rune of concussion, less than a stack each of words of capacity, words of obliteration, flakes of lodestone and essence of (ro?  marr?  The one that looks like a treasure chest.)<br />
<br />
So, roughly totalled, about, um 60ish combines. <br />

I should check my mules, I probably have a stack of flakes of lodestone and possible some words of capacity, too, that are just sitting there.<br />

As for prices, feh, you are supplying the stuff so if I am not busy I will be happy to help you out, I'm trying to skill up my Tailoring too and I totally sympathize.... <br />

Though some folks seem to think they are worth more in the bazaar (much, MUCH more!  yeesh!) I've been buying them up at up to 100p each, and would be glad to work out something mutually satisfying.<br />
<br />
/grumbles at trivial changes to Arctic Wyvern...<br />
Fortunately, my druid is only 50, so druids and wyvern are very blue to him.  I took him to CS yesterday after dinner with a fresh KEI and by the time it wore off, I had 2 drake hides, 11 wyvern hides, 1k in vendorables, and got 50 back and came just short of 51.  <br />
<br />
Weeeeee!</div></div><hr />

Picked up some more stuff in the bazaar and on a few vendors.  I think I'm up to 80 combines.  Since I'm carrying around all the extra armor and symbol patterns, I about have run out of room, but I'll get some stuff moved around to some alts this weekend, free up some space, and then I can get the quills and parchments.  I'll drop you an email and see if we might be able to link up somewhere along the line for a transfer?  Once you get the goods, you can just convert them at your convenience and holler when you are done?<br />

You sure there's not SOMETHING I can do to reciprocate?  Maybe farm you up a few stacks of something?  Assist with some endless subcombines?  CE's?  Something?</div></div><hr />

Farm me up....hmmm.../evil chuckle<br />
<br />
Well, High Elf DoN Cultural Tailoring is crappy, can't use Shissar Scales which are abundant, the way Wood Elves can (except that I can use them for smithing  the Master symbols, though...go figure) <br />
<br />
....sooooooooo, if you have a a couple or a few Nightmare silks or Storm Volaas Hairs just lying around I wouldn't refuse them (but DON'T go nuts farming them)  ;) <br />
<br />
We need to link up soon, I'm on vacation for 2 weeks as of Sunday the 24th.  I have a raid tonight, but if you are around when we are done, or tomorrow night, we could meet =)</div></div><hr />

I've been looking for those myself, none have been in the bazaar at ANY price, let alone a reasonable one<br />
<br />
(but DON'T go nuts farming them)  ;) <br />
LOL.  A 60 cleric?  Not much chance of that, I'm willing to bet! <br />

Tonight I'm working late, so I won't be on until probably close to 11:00p (EDT).  Tomorrow should be regular time (? whatever that is)  If not, I'll find a place to bank it until you get back.  I need to nudge those blue bars a bit, so I may take a bit of a tailoring break.<br />
<br />
Of course, I need to whip up a few stacks of MTP.  Can't go completely without pressing combine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zabu</div><div class="date">07-21-2005, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started to grab you some platinum forrestgreen ribbons at the bazarre this morning.  Someone was selling 79 of them at 25p per.  But I wasn't sure how hard it was going to be to mine up 79 words of virtue, and knowing how bank space is generally at a premium....<br />
<br />
Someone also had a small amount (single digits) of rune of impulse, but I figured I had better check before I start stockpiling LoY components.  I knew another HIE tailor back when LoY was new, and I used to take my druid to LFay regularly and forage up sylvan berries while committing genocide on the hapless orcs for the stray berry drops.  A stack or two a night (back then) was not unheard of.<br />

Any of this enticing you?   :fishin:</div></div><hr />

I have a raid tonight, but maybe we can hookup after, or possibly on Saturday afternoon, assuming Im not too busy with packing &amp; other vacation-stuff.<br />

Feel free to seek out another researcher if you need to, btw, I won't be jealous :p  I do want to help you, but circumstances are getting in the way...</div></div><hr />

Feel free to seek out another researcher if you need to, btw, I won't be jealous :p  I do want to help you, but circumstances are getting in the way...I'm in no hurry.  In fact, I've been bouncing through all my alt's bank accounts gathering up what I had leftover from doing MTP to 250.  I decided I'd try to get that to 300, since it looks like more Taanan crafting mastery AAs are not in the forseeable future.<br />

Even if you were, you could still have the runes.  You're the only one who talks to me...<br />

Tis' okay.  I have been working on this spell that turns people into frogs.  I have not quite perfected it yet.<br />
 <br />
Plus been on vacation for a while now.  I am usually on late at night and early in the morning.</div></div><hr />

I hope you haven't triv'ed on robes yet?  12 runes of impulse, and 3 impulse runed swatches (so far.)  Should get you a good half dozen robes, and hopefully a point or two!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Make that 24 and 3.  <br />
<br />
Camping the bazaar for the good drops!<br />
<br />
(Worst case, my necro will practice her research on these.  I just hate to waste them if you can use them.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maevenniia</div><div class="date">08-16-2005, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OOOO<br />

Ok, we really need to meet soon!  tonight I will be online, hopefully no later than 9 eastern, until at least midnight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tonight's my late night to work, so I'll probably be pushing 10:30 or so before I get to sit down at the keyboard.  The good news is, I got ambitious before work this morning, and let Mylok (my Necro) loose on my collection of runes of concussion, and she trived 132 in no time.  So I let her have a go with the flakes of lodestone, gearlok firmly in hand, and she hit 136 (triv) with only about 5 failures in 41 combines.  <br />
<br />
So all I saved you is the platinum level words, which works out to probably less than two stacks.  Didn't want to push my luck  :faint:</div></div><hr />
