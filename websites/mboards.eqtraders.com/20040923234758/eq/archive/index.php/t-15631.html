As most of ya'll know, I don't post 10% of what I used to.   I'm kind of burning out on everquest. Job keeps me weird hours.   And some of my views are a bit more negative then the mum has expressed a taste for.<br />
<br />
<br />
So I post less.   But Krazick keeps posting.  And posting.  And posting.   All of her database posts have spammed her all the way to my plateau.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sometime in the next 24 hours, she's going to knock me from my  postcount pedastel.<br />
<br />
<br />
:( :( :( <br />
<br />
:cry: :cry: :cry: :hurt: <br />
<br />
<br />
/salute to you, Krazick,  and boy am I bitter.      Gratz.<br />
*hands over the spam-crown*<br />
<br />
(Hope this post is taken in the friendly manner it was written.)<br />

We realize and appreciate that it was meant in fun.  But other folks might take it in their heads to imitate in a less successfully tongue-in-cheek manner that could result in some serious hurt feelings.  We are very serious about our unwillingness to allow personal attacks of any kind around here, and hesitate to allow even those that are meant in humor, lest folks use it as an excuse to push further.  <br />
<br />
And no, Lilosh is not getting banned. :p  But you can give him one noogie apiece when you see him.  :shocked:</div></div><hr />
