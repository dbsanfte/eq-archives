<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbuegel</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm finally over 150 in tailoring.  In fact, I'm over 150 in almost all my tradeskills (except for fishing).<br />
<br />
So, what should I make?  I'd like to get some money for my skills, or at least put them to good use for myself.  I enjoy the skill-up process and hunting for supplies (its like mini-quests!).  But, not sure what to do now.  Any ideas would be appreciated.  Thanks!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiatek</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can still do Wu's until 158.<br />
<br />
Then you pretty much do anything you can get your hands on:<br />
ceremonial solstice robes<br />
studded arctic wyvery hide<br />
cobalt drake hide<br />
pather skin<br />
tigerrator skin<br />
acrylia studded<br />
just list a few.  Check the tailoring section :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbuegel</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did not mean to ask what I should do next for skill-ups.  For that, I can easily refer to the amazingly beautifully organized, easily referenced trivial charts on this awesome and handsome website that we all call home (thanks Niami!). <br />
<br />
What I was actually asking was, what should I do with my new skills.  Should I make stuff to sell?  Should I make armor for myself?  What do you all recommend that I should do now that I'm over the &quot;hump&quot;.  Are there certain items that most tailors make and sell often, or armors that most tailors make for themselves?  What do all you experienced tailors do with your skills?!?!<br />
<br />
Or, should I just make a living off of making leather padding and getting to 150 was a waste of time??</div></div><hr />

You can make wu's and sell it for a few pp, I see people auctioning for it on occasion on Ayonae Ro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NewanderSylvanus</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">150ish you are mostly going to be doing wu's for your twink monk or your friends' twink monks, or backpacks. Higher levels you can make a decent living on acrylia studded and/or black panther skin. And then there's the new planar stuff...<br />
<br />
All in all, it's not a wasted skill, but as with any, it is more for your own pride than for any real use  :mrgreen:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">monocot</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 07:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good news is you can do Wu's still till 158. As far as the 250 tailoring, you are far from &quot;being over the hump&quot;.  Until 210, your success rate is still pretty much 5 percent on any 250 combine.  If you are looking for cheap skillups, do acrylia (IF YOU GATHER YOUR OWN SUPPLIES), Relying on Bazaar prices makes it far too expensive.  If you are going for fast skillups, the solstice robes are great.  Be warned they are expensive to make, especially if you mess up and actually succeed on one. ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnexus</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 09:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If money isnt an option, get someone to imbue a TON of emeralds and make a bunch of solstice robes. I personally did Arctic Wyvern at 163 on. After 400 combines of Arctic Masks (and 40-50k later) I ended up at 191. I was happy. If the funds are short, start dedicating your life to the hoppers in Dawnshroud for their pelts. Tailoring isn't fast nor cheap unfortunately. Go into thinking that and perhaps you won't give up after your first 10k or 20 hours of pharming giving you squat for skill raises.<br />

I haven't really found a market for any of the other acrylia studded gear.  I have been buying my supplies from the bazaar, and at my skill (164) success rate has been near 50%, meaning that I tend to break even for every two attempts.  I've also found that acrylia reinforced bracers (require one boning, so not too bad) sell quick if priced well, so they may also be another alternate path for skilling up on an easy item and trying to recover the costs.  Obviously, if you farm your own supplies, the profits are excellent.<br />

Make Wu's and sell them, make Backpacks and sell them... as other people have suggested.  With a skill of 150, you can also try making Acrylia Studded Cloaks and Tunics.  There are not too many choices to make with Tailoring, unlike Smithing.  Good luck with what you choose :)<br />

I am WE and am stockpiling supplies and hides to make the Soldier armor, I realize my chances of success are slim, but the hope is keeping me going   :D <br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiatek</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wasn't trying to be smart alecy with my post on what to make.  Any of those things are possible to try to make money or to try for skill ups.  Personally that's what I do.  I try anything I can get my hands on-to make them to sell and to get skill ups.  Granted with some of that stuff there isn't much of a market and you have a low success rate, but at least it is serving two purposes.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krystof</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The acrylia has done the best for me, as far as selling goes, particularly the cloak.  If I'm low on funds, making a few cloaks usually spares me the pain of having to go kill giants in Rathe Mtns instead of exping  :o Though at 150 your success rate will probably be less than stellar.  My recommendation is to max out Wu's, at least, before moving on to anything else.  And then make paddings from velium hound furs if you happen to have any lying around, very cheap skill ups :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghratch</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would prolly agree on Acrylia and Backpacks bein yer best bet from a cash earning stand point</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahlig</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of my friends has had much better luck on the Othmir armor than anything else.  Problem is, it does not even sell to vendors.  So, you can ask the druids in CS that are QK the Othmir (because no matter your server, they are there).  If they are not tailors, they have no use for the othmir skins and may let you have them for a song.  This is also a great way to skill up.  Just an idea.<br />

It was tailor made for you (pun intended.)  If all your skills are past 150, you should have very few problems finishing all the tradeskill pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbuegel</div><div class="date">12-08-2002, 10:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks to everyone who answered my questions of what to sell with my 150-ish tailoring skill.  I appreciate the advice.  And, thanks to Niami for providing a forum like this where I can get such advice!</div></div><hr />
