<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Djaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Took a guide on this site, but it's not very detailed, as with other skills such as baking, brewing, smithing, they say to buy medium jar sketches, and medium bowl sketches.  That birngs me to 122, but I don't know what to do after.<br />
<br />
I'm looking for expert potters advice, what did you do to bring your skill to -at least- 200?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i'm at the same spot.  going do do the poison vials and then casserole dishes but holding off for a while.  triv  for shawl 4 is 122 and need more work on others for 5 and 6.<br />
<br />
lined, sealed, advanced posion vials i think.  check the main site for the order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Same here - I chose to do poison vials.<br />

The cost to make poison vials is stupid considering you can just buy them from vendors in the PoK for a  fraction of the material costs. However after making so many unfired bowls and just throwing them away rather than firing them I was looking for a product that was cheaper to make than large bowls and was actually worth firing.<br />
<br />
I base this comment on the cost of buying premade poison vials against the cost of the HQ firing sheet, not the cost of whole cost of the materials. Against the cost you get back from the merchants if you sell the final fired vial it's not worth it. But I have an enchanter who can combine the vials with pearls to make viscous mana and in turn use those vials for skilling up tailoring on Mr Wu's armour.<br />
<br />
It's not much of a saving but using the products of one trade skill-up effort to reduce the materials cost of another trade skill-up can help reduce at least some of the damage incurred.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I tend to agree that cross-defraying charges is a good idea (make something with one skill that you can use for another), but in this case I'd have to disagree.  Poison vials are a good route to 148, but making large bowls doesn't require any farming at all.  It's all vendor bought stuff.  If you're hunting zombies anyway, it'd be better to set the skins aside for your lined and sealed vial attempts, and just suck up the cost of bowls to 148.<br />
<br />
After vials, casseroles are really the only affordable route to 199.  Beyond 199, it gets costly, but I've had good luck with opal encrusted steins.  Some people like doing ceramic bands instead of steins, but my main reason for steins is that you can (with a short side trip into jewelcrafting) make it all yourself no matter what race or class, save for enchanted clay, and finding or making a level 9 enchanter is much easier than finding or making an enchanter to make mana vials.  Plus, steins sell, but I've not had much luck selling the bands.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Personally, all the characters I've had that did pottery did medium bowls to 122 and then large bowls to 148. Lined poison vials to 168 and sealed to 188. My highest potters are both 188, and will be doing the cassarole dish to 199.<br />
<br />
After that, probably opal steins. I already have a 24 enchanter, so the clay is a non issue. :)</div></div><hr />
