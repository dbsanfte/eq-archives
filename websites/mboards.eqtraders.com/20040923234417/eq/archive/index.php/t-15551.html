<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wyzalf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We apologize to those of you experiencing graphics problems since the patch on the 23rd. We expect that most of these issues will be cleared up by June. <br />
<br />
In the meantime we've made some small, but interesting changes to gameplay based on player feedback. Enjoy! <br />
<br />
*************************** <br />
<br />
Planar Advancement Change <br />
---------------------- <br />
If you are not properly flagged for a PoP zone and get on the hate list of a god, you will be ported to a random old-world city zone. This applies to those players entering based solely on their level or the current 85% raid rule. You'll still be able to obtain flags - you just won't be able to assist in the killing of a zone &quot;boss.&quot; <br />
<br />
Spell Changes <br />
---------------------- <br />
-In order to make spellbooks easier for players to navigate, all spellbooks have been alphabetized. <br />
-The level cap of the spell Bliss has increased from 68 to 73 (see below). <br />
-Magician earth pets no longer proc Root; they now proc an agility debuff spell. We've made this change because some Magicians were using their pet's root ability to halt the movement of NPCs. <br />
<br />
NPC Changes <br />
---------------------- <br />
-We've added the Death Touch ability to several raid-level Gates of Discord NPCs. We'll leave you to figure out which NPCs in particular are affected by this change. <br />
-Planes of Power giants have developed an immunity to mesmerization spells. They are, however, still susceptible to stuns and charms. This was in an effort to make them more in line with their old world counterparts. <br />
<br />
Item Changes <br />
---------------------- <br />
-The Obulous Mantle is now Cleric useable. <br />
-The Scimitar of Ethereal Energy is now a one-hand blunt weapon. <br />
-Effects on Kunark armor are now useable at level 1. If your character is below 20th level, however, you can only equip one piece of Kunark armor at a time. <br />
-Golden Tickets can once again be won in the Shadowhaven casino. We wanted to take as much platinum out of the economy without adding to it, so we had temporarily removed these jackpot winnings. <br />
-We've removed the NO DROP flag on Velious quest armor. In accordance with this change, players must now be at least 55th level to equip Thurgadin armor, and 60th level to equip Kael and Skyshrine armor. <br />
<br />
Bug Fixes <br />
---------------------- <br />
-Minor change to pathing in Butcherblock bandit camp #3. <br />
-Kodiaks in the West Commonlands no longer drop snake eggs. <br />
-Characters can no longer &quot;walk on water&quot; in the Karanas. <br />
-Replaced the +25 INT stat on Water Sprinkler of Nem Ankh with +25 WIS. This was inadvertently switched in a February patch. <br />
-Buying Handmade Backpack Tokens in the Bazaar no longer causes a change in your character's gender. <br />
-The warrior epic no longer drops from The Master of Spite. This was unintentional. <br />
<br />
*** Berserker Winners! *** <br />
<br />
We hope you've enjoyed playing the Berserker class. Whether or not Berserkers will be instituted as a permanent playable class has yet to be determined. Watch for an EQLive post on April Fool's Day indicating the top Berserker players for each server.</div></div><hr />
