<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hanni Oltion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all again,<br />
Just letting you all know that I will be opening my stall in the Bazaar as soon as possiable, the stall will include many components of the  Misty Thicket Picnic, Tinkering goods, Tinkering Products, Imported goods, foraged goods for balking and brewing...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Quendi_Selli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I knew this would happen - as soon as they opened the bazaar to Player Traders I knew people would start to think that EQ Traders was about Bazaar Traders instead of TradeSKILLERS!    lol <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hanni Oltion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was just letting people know that I was starting a stall in the bazaar to help tradeskillers, by having items that they need and don't want to go far for it.... I know that it is annoying to have to travel to Steamfont to by a bottle, and then travel half way accross Norath to get another item. So I thought that it would be easier to have all the items at lower prices in the bazaar.... If you had bothered to look at some of my other posts you would see that I am looking for tradeskill items, sorry if you have looked at my other posts.....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i am looking for echanted blocks of clay<br />
<br />
My new twink chanter gnome will be picking up his enchant clay and silver spells this evening, and can hook you up after that.<br />
<br />
How many do you need?  (Do they stack?  Space is still a bit at a premium until I get some things handed off to my other chars.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">they stack quite nicely.<br />
need a supply of like... hmm.. 500ish<br />
<br />
(but not all at once of course)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, the enchanted clay stacks.  Please note that so far large is the only size of blocks of magic clay that are required in making various pottery items. <br />
<br />
Direct quote from the main site: “A large block of magic clay is made by an enchanter using the level 8 Enchant Clay spell. It requires a large block of clay as a material component. “<br />
<br />
And, let's try to keep it civil, posting a WTB or WTS notice has always been one of the uses of The MArketPlace forums.<br />
<br />
Happy trading, and happy tradeskilling  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ilona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Maev, sorry I just can't see what isn't civil about the question or the response.  Zabu probably hasn't seen magic clay before.<br />
<br />
I've never seen anyone post non-civilly on this board :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've never seen anyone post non-civilly on this board :D<br />
<br />
I suspect Maevenniia is referring to the earlier posts about the bazaar vendor stall, not anything subsequent to Bartox's request for clay.<br />
<br />
And, I have *so* seen magic clay before.  I have two pieces on a mule that I found on the ground once.  Of course, I never knew what they were or where they come from... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, it was more of a &quot;nip it in the bud&quot;  remark, if you look at post #2 and then the original posters reaction in post #3, nothing serious but wanted to prevent it from escalating (or degenerating, rather) into a Traders vs Tradeskillers thing.  Ok, so maybe I'm a little over-zealous  :oops:  :) <br />
<br />
Ok, move along, nothing to see here  :D   ;)<br />
<br />
edit: I spel gud</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Maev-<br />
<br />
   I probably would have done the same thing if I thought a thread was heading in the direction. <br />
<br />
<br />
    Of course, I never claimed to be un-paranoid. Either way, *hi-five*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Quendi_Selli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Entirely my mistake.  I didn't catch the tradeskills ref. in the original posting.  I thought the third post there corrected me just fine and wasn't going to post on this topic again - now however I decided to weight in to defuse the situation once and for all.<br />
<br />
I didn't intend a personal attack in the first place; just an observation that after Verant started the bazaar and it's &quot;traders&quot; that the EQ Traders name would suddenly get confusing to a whole new group of EQers, the original poster to this thread not included however.<br />
