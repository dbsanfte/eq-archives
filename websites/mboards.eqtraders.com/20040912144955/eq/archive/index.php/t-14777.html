<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I got together a group to do a LDoN adv.  Consisted of a 44 bst, 47 rogue, 48 druid (me), 47 cleric, 51 pally, 51 chanter(guildy in /role).  Decided to try a hard MMC.  The Mobs in there were highly resistant to tashing, mezzing, slow and my line of debuffs and nukes.  The Pally was pulling, sometimes getting 2 at a time due to the pac being resisted.  On one pull, the chanter died, and the cleric says outloud instead of in group &quot;what an idiot, how hard is it to mezz a mob&quot;.  So after he gets rezzed, I ask in group if he was having a problem with the mezzes being resisted, and he replied yes, and also the tashes.  I then told of my problem with my spells being resisted.  Nothing further ensues.  Get down to the last 15 min, need 5 more drops.  We could have won.  If not, we could have pulled it out shortly in the overtime.  Unfortunately, the pull went bad, 6 mobs came back.  Pally went first, and fast, then the chanter.  I was trying to get succor off, but it is hard when that many mobs are beating down on you.  We all died.  10 min left.  Cleric all of a sudden is gone from the group, and no longer in game.  Get back to the dungeon, time expires, we lose, and gather our corpses.  We had a brief discussion about the cleric probably doing /q thinking she would not get hit with the loss, boy will she be surprised.  We then port out, sell, split, and camp.<br />
<br />
Now, would you ever, ever, first, insult someone like that without knowing what was actually transpiring, second, /q just to try to avoid a loss?<br />
<br />
Needless to say, I will not be grouping with said particular cleric anytime soon.  Bad cleric, no sow for joo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yuck.  I've never had anyone /q to avoid a loss, though I have seen folks /q after ninja-looting.<br />
<br />
In one particular case we had a bard who was not designated as the ML, but kept looting the coin.  Mob would drop and she would do the &quot;looting-kneel&quot; by the corpse.  She would then leave any items on the corpse and open a trade window with the ML to hand over any coin she picked up (we could only assume she was being honest).  She claimed that she liked seeing the items on the corpses (*cough*BS*cough*).  But she didn't loot any items so while it was irritating, nobody made a huge fuss.  Then a mob dropped an aug and &quot;Oops!&quot;, she 'accidentally' loots it.  Big argument ensues.  Time is winding down so we decide to just say screw it and press on with this person already on our &quot;do not group with again&quot; list.  We finish the mission and decide to hunt down a named that was on track.  Surprise surprise when we drop it the item it dropped got looted by the bard who promptly left the group and /q out of the game.<br />
<br />
This bard has built quite a reputation now.  From time to time I see her LFG in various zone and her shouts for a group always result in at least 2 or 3 people shouting to everyone else not to take her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tash is unresistable, but I suppose that's not really your point.<br />
<br />
I'm suprised that the enchanter would be having problems since he's the highest level in the group (paladin too).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ixiola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, I'm not suprised.<br />
<br />
Based on the levels you gave, you had a 48.0 average group.  A 48.0+ avg group ===&gt; a level 50 addy.  When you chose hard, you turned it into essentially a level 55 normal addy.  Your cleric was 51 trying to mez level 51 mobs, and the rest of you were even lower.  Not suprising you guys had a difficult time of it.  If anyone in your group had been 1 level lower, you would have had a level 45 hard (aka 50 normal addy) and you would have been fine.<br />
<br />
I realize the point of your rant was the cleric abandoning the group strictly to avoid a loss, and I say booo to the cleric.  )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nhin Impious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nothin' to say on that &quot;idiot&quot; comment... but, well, sometimes people lose internet connection, and can't get back on.<br />
<br />
One thing you can do, if you aren't for absolute sure what's happened, is keep an eye on guild names; if someone disappears close to the very end of the adventure, send a tell to another guild member (preferably an officer if you can find one). &quot;Hi, I was just in adventure with your guildie so and so, and they disappeared right at the end so we wiped, I think they got booted-- I'll hold onto some of the split for them, could you let me know when you see them back on?&quot; (This is assuming they've been decent up to that point)... if the guildie replies &quot;Oh really? They're logged onto their warrior right now&quot; then you just busted them; if the guildie responds &quot;Oh man, poor guy, he's been having phone problems all day&quot; then you know what happened, and depending on how the group feels or how generous you are, at least they'll get a little bit of plat for their work.  Plus you look like a freakin' hero for caring enough to check up on them. ;)<br />

Having lost connection during the zone of a Succor, cursed wildly at the 1017 I got immediately thereafter, and then stomped in to the living room computer and told my partner (wizard in same adventure) &quot;Tell them I can't get back on&quot;-- I'm not entirely sure your &quot;special cleric&quot; did a /q on purpose.  <br />

That actually brings to mind one LDoN adventure where we gated out and the ML went LD soon after.  I got a paniced phone call about 5 minutes from someone sitting in an apartment in the middle of a thunderstorm with no power.  I relayed said information to the rest of the group.</div></div><hr />

That's my reason for not volunteering for ML duty. While my connection is pretty stable, as a chanter my CHA is maxed to the hilt and I always empty my pockets and bags to make space in case I'm asked to ML I just don't like the thought I might LD and be accused of ninja-ing the group. Everyone is just TOO fast to cast accusations in this game.</div></div><hr />

I know how that goes...i play on my laptop, and it will do abyssmal just fine, but client crashes only innatimbi. I was in 2 different groups just recently, client crashed out on me...and since i was visiting my BF in germany, and playing in the same room i could ask him to tell the group what happened the first time, the second group it happened with, i just moved over to his spare computer and logged in and we finished playing that way. i finished out the 3 week vacation pretty much playing eq on his computer. i *really* need a good desktop at home to play on, my poor compaq is so gimpy it wont even zone, i set up a bazaar mule on it and it crawls along making me plat=\<br />
<br />
I absolutely detest going LD for any reason when i group...and hate it when i can not get back in. i have even been known to call a friend who i know is in game and have them send people tells letting them know what happened...</div></div><hr />

Never seen that worstofeq site before! I'm going to have to remember that, and get screens of worst ones. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There was another Magician in my guild who had bad LD issues. I grouped with him on occasion, even though I knew he was having these problems. He would go LD once or twice during adventures, but would be fine after that. (He would also go LD off and on at other times - had several occasions where he went LD while conversing in guild chat) <br />
<br />
One night we did a group together and the group let him be ML, even though they were told he had LD issues. At one point, he goes LD while running (this was the second time he went LD, but the first time was no problem), and runs right into two mobs who start beating on him. The group was taking a break at this point, as the Cleric (who is also in the same guild as me and the Lord of LD) was low on mana and went afk for a second, and the other casters were also low on mana or completely out. (I had Mod Rodded a few times, and we had just finished a tough fight) The SK bravely decides to go save him, and ends up dying.<br />
<br />
Mr. LD comes back a few minutes before the SK gets rezzed and apologizes. We finish the adventure and everyone decides to wait outside the dungeon before heading back to BB (we were at the crypt, btw), and all the casters sit down to med. He ends up going LD a couple of minutes later, it takes longer than usual for him to leave the game than it does when someone normally comes back, and he never does return, so we get no loot.<br />
<br />
Suffice it to say, the Cleric and I both decide we're never grouping with him again. <br />
<br />
Turns out something on his computer went boom, and he wasn't able to get it fixed for almost a couple of weeks. He's still playing, but he quit the guild a few days after coming back. (Probably after getting eaten alive by the aforementioned Cleric, I'd wager) <br />

I won't ML for similar reasons. I have a cable connection, but still end up going LD once or twice a week, and when I do it takes me a long time to get back on. (Most of the time I have to reboot and run the patcher, instead of just logging back on from the log-on screen)<br />
<br />
Plus, I play late at night most of the time, and my cable company does maintenance on the systems once a month, meaning that I can't log on to the internet at all during that time (and obviously go LD if I'm on when they start), and I never know what night that will be. (It takes anywhere from an hour to six hours before I have access again)</div></div><hr />

It sounds like your cable company needs to invest in redundant systems.<br />
<br />
Sure, my cable modem goes out on some rare nights... but the last two times it was because the main trunk in and out of the Las Vegas Valley itself went down!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I work for my cable company (free broadband....sigh:p ) and I know that on our homepage we have a section for Network Status, which lists any upcoming maintenance.<br />
<br />
Still, just flat out don't like to ML at all.  I seldom have room (altho I've been spring cleaning the bank of late) and yes, I have that fear that on the rare rare occasion I should go ld, I'll be branded a thief.<br />
<br />
Oh, and yes, on one adventure, had a ranger /q out.  We were well behind on a rescue, wound up with a disastrous pull, the wizard evac'd but the cleric had DA up and was left behind to die an ugly death.  The ranger, who was also in his guild, /q out never to return at that point...just to dodge the loss, I presume, as he wasn't looting.</div></div><hr />
