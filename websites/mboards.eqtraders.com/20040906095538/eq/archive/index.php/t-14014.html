<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fenadin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just noticing what high tribute values our cultural armor has.  All of the smithed BP's give over 20k tribute points.  This is sure a nice way to make cultural worthwhile again.  It got to the point where it was just not profitable on Veeshan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aethn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe that has been or will be nerfed according to the 2/14 patch message</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>talamariv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heraldic BP's going for 19k favor post nerf.<br />
<br />
Also noted that Tae Ew Shields were going for 4k favor post nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fenadin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Talamariv is correct.  These values are post the tribute point nerf.  All the cultural/blue diamond bp's are still giving around 20k points.  Bracers give around 7k points.<br />
<br />
What it means on Veeshan is that these items are no longer selling below cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Callandre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Has anyone checked the post nerf values on the LDoN plate armour?  <br />
<br />
Its pretty much unsalable on my server and it might motivate me back to smithing to be able to at least get tribute points out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>talamariv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LDoN armor was nerfed, now going for only a few 100 favor iirc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe it's still more favor points than you can get plat by selling to a merchant, though.  Hmmm, I need to check that out, I have a lot of LDon temper components saved for skilling up....</div></div><hr />

Sadly the shields were giving 22862 pre-nerf. Had I known then what we know now I wouldn't have turned in my entire run of 29 :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Annalina Romanov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I know Erollisi Marr Field Plate cloaks give around 762 Favor or so each, which is just as well 'cause I got piles of Sea Temper sitting around in the bank. That's still much better than what they sell back for, which is something like 200PP each or so (can't remember at the moment).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>talamariv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I know Erollisi Marr Field Plate cloaks give around 762 Favor or so each, which is just as well 'cause I got piles of Sea Temper sitting around in the bank.

Well, not necessarily.  I know that it looks like that on the surface but here's the idea...<br />
<br />
Erollisi Marr Field Plate cloaks go for 762 Favor<br />
Erollisi Marr Field Plate cloaks sell for 200pp<br />
<br />
Last night I bought 4 Tae Ew Bloods for 500pp each in the Bazaar, made 4 shields.  So I basically spent 700pp-ish on an item I made that can be turned in for 4k favor.  That's a hefty return.<br />
<br />
So in your example, I could sell 4 Erollisi Marr Field Plate cloaks to a vendor and get 800pp, take that 800pp, buy parts for shield and turn in shield to get 4k favor.  Had I justed turned 4 Cloaks in, I would have only gotten 3048 favor.<br />
<br />
Ok, I know that doesn't take failures into account, so this isn't a perfect example but I think you get the idea.  It's not important that you get more favor than how much it sells for, the ratio is the key.  Try to find an item that is abundantly available to you that has the best plat to favor ratio and use that as your key.<br />
<br />
700pp to make a tae ew shield gets me 4kish favor, about 1:5.5 ratio.  So when deciding whether to sell an item for x plat or y favor, y must be 5.5 times more than x or else I'm selling it to reinvest.<br />
<br />
Again, not a pure example because of the failures but I'm still trying to find the &quot;magic&quot; item with the &quot;magic&quot; ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Annalina Romanov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">LOL . . . you're on a different server than me. On Fennin Ro, Tae Ew bloods go for (on average) 1500PP+, with the lowest price I've seen in a while go for around 800PP or so. Furthermore, I've got piles upon piles of Sea Temper rotting in the bank. While the yield on those cloaks aren't spectacular, they're still pretty good.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>OberonMiM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">pre nerf tae ew shields were about 13500 not 22k. I know i checked them. (unless values differ on different servers)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sylphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Cultural tailoring and cultural smithing seem like big winners so far.  Also some of the skillup recipes such as arctic wyvern hide masks... they may not be worth much but at least you won't just drop them on the ground as worthless.  I'm really curious to see what solstice robes are worth.<br />
<br />
Do a little research though.  For instance, Tae Ew Chain Tunic gives 6000 tribute.  But Tae Ew Chain Leggings uses exactly the same ingredients, has the same trivial, and gives 10,218 tribute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mocean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Solstice robes are about 34 tribute points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zeralenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Post-nerf many LDoN plate items were still going for decent trade-backs.<br />
<br />
...Zera</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zacatac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Lol, well if that value stays the same, I'll be using all my cultural smithing attempts to make MYSELF the items to turn in for tribute points.<br />
<br />
No more Blessed Mithril for the rest of you!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Anaxo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">According to Lucy, Tae Ew Shields currently go for 4200 tribute points. Pre-nerf, 22862. LDON smithed stuff varies oddly;  a Large Sandblasted Ringmail Coif is 554, but the Large Sandblasted Breastplate is 240. Large Sandblasted Leggings are 794, quite a hefty amount of tribute considering how low all the other pieces go for. <br />
<br />
Razamatazz posted an interesting hypothesis over at the Mage Tower, (http://forum.magecompendium.com/viewtopic.php?t=11887) stating that he believed the new tribute values were based on an average of all the Bazaar sales of each item from all the servers. I find it an interesting, and somehow bizzarely fitting explanation for all the wild gyrations in tribute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Naedea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If tribute value is a reflection of bazaar prices, that is massively exploitable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kronepsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Um, not really.  Exploitable is assuming the prices will be changed again, which as far as I can see, they aren't.  Thus it really doesn't matter WHAT they're based off of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Naedea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I was interpreting it as a dynamic system, yes.<br />
A snapshot of bazaar data would not be usable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Anaxo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It doesn't look like tribute ratios will be changing again. My guess is that sometime between the playerbase realizing the spectacular returns on tribute for stuff such as fine steel weapons and the actualy nerfing of the values, SOE wrote a quick hack program keeping track of Bazaar transaction during that period, then used the average to peg the new tribute points. It definitely is not a dynamic method at any rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Thicket Tundrabog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Tribute points from Shadowscream combines are more worthwhile than vendor sale. Shadowscream boots resell for 2 pp and change, but are worth 30 tribute points. I did 100 shadowscream combines for skillup last night and got over 2500 tribute points. Not a gold mine, but better than alternatives.<br />
