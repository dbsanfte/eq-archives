<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Andrielle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have started pottery as a skill because of the coldain prayer shawl quests (like baking and tailoring).  I spent a long time running all over the place thru many towns looking for the &quot;medium blocks of clay&quot;  mentioned in your excellent guide.  I have discovered no such thing (there may be but I have yet to see it).  Medium blocks of clay are actually refered to as just Block of Clay, as opposed to small or large blocks of clay.  An adjustment in your guide will potentially save much heartache!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Could you point me at which specific article/guide page that says 'Medium Block of Clay'? I will endeavor to correct it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kronepsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most likely it has been called &quot;Medium Block of Clay&quot; because whenever someone puts &quot;Block of Clay&quot; in a guide someone else *will* follow up with &quot;What size is the Block of Clay?&quot; -_-;<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
It's a no-win situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Andrielle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Page # 209 (2) - this is the real problem as it specifically mentions MEDIUM blocks of clay but all the suppliers don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Page 209?<br />
<br />
Can you post a URL of the page? a Full Title? Or the Title you see in the Title Bar of the Browser Window...<br />
<br />
There are several hundred articles here, and I am at a loss at identifying which one you are refering too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>YurienStonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">would it be possible to add (medium) when referring to emdium sized materials liek the clay and such? might save trouble</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is what I intend to do (alter the writeup)... I just need to know which page the person is confused by... The various pages I have looked at with regards to pottery do NOT use 'Medium Block of Clay'... It could be a rather lonely page I have not considered, or maybe the person is refering to a page that isn't on this site.<br />
<br />
That is why I really need the URL for the page. <br />
<br />
(hint if the the URL does NOT begin with 'http://www.eqtraders.com/' then it is a problem with the writeup from another site. And therefore I cannot fix it)</div></div><hr />
