I also have a jewler at 236 and a Human smith at 192. Will attempt any combines provided that the ingredients are provided. I of course do not charge for failures. also have baking at 135 brewing at 200 fletching at 100 fishing at 145. currently working on gathering ingredients for high end PoP pottery items. merchant character is Lyzbeth but atm she has nothing but pooey stuff on her just the crap that's been lying around in the bank that i stuck on her and hasn't sold since i put her up day 1 hehe but ever i hope. So if you're in need of someone to put stuff together for ya just give me a hollar and i'll give it a whirl.<br />
