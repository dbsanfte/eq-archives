<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If I am lvl 55 and don't have any AA's at all..........am I still able to get the main Trade Skills (ie-Brewing,Baking,Smithing) to 250 Skill just through combines?<br />
Or is is mandatory to use Taanan AA's to get past skill 200?<br />
If you can get to 250 skill level through just combines.....then what does the Taanans AA's do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>elty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you can get ONE skill to 250, all other will stay at 200.<br />
<br />
If you have 1 Tanaan AA, you can have TWO skill above 200 to 250, while the rest still stay at 200<br />
<br />
So after 6 Tanaan, SEVEN of your skill can be above 200</div></div><hr />

Not including if you are a shaman, rogue or gnome as those 3 can take alchemy, poisons and tinkering above 200 as well without spending NTCM AA's. (And the lucky gnome rogues, of course, can do 3).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mewkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only way to get skill ups (past the 54ish you can get from GoD quest) is by attempting combines. Prior to the introduction of the Tanaans, only one of the seven skills could exceed 200. With each Tanaan AA you buy (at 3AAs each) you are allowed to have an additional tradeskill exceed 200. Buying the Tanaan does not provide any skill ups, it just removes the 200 cap. Whichever tradeskill hits 201 next is the one that counts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have no AA'a at lvl 55........does it take the same amount of time to attain 3aa's as it would to attain 3 regular Experience Levels?<br />
So would I get to lvl 58 in the same amount of time it will take me to get 3aa's?<br />
I am not sure if I should do the AA's or regular levels if both Experience bars move at the same rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nex Alacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One AA is like level 51.  So you will get AAs faster than levels at 55, but only slightly.  Whereas at level 65, you fly though AAs because the mobs are all higher level.</div></div><hr />
