<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quinner Sparrowhawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone actually made the Qeynos enchanted plate items? Or have you considered it a total waste of a Royal Temper. Given the low occurances of this item being made, would it make sense for the temper component for the enchanted plate line to be changed to something else? Perhaps Qeynos Tea?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cubwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Using the temper for skill ups on the enchanted stuff is nearly criminal. They need to really put Essence of Sunlight on more mobs, or have it become forageable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Royal Temper vs Sea Temper<br />
<br />
Griffenne Blood, Rain water and Essence of Sunlight <br />
<br />
against<br />
<br />
Mug of Sea Foam, Saltwater Seaweed and Fish Wine<br />
<br />
Freeport armour has 1 bought and 1 fished ingredient, then Sea Faom is fairly easy to farm.<br />
<br />
Essence of Sunlight is a git to get. Sells for 400-500pp on VS, and you need 2. Want to use that for skill ups?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cubwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">my other smith is a high elf, and even the Essence of Moonlight isn't that difficult to get. They made the Morning Dew a mob drop (formerly it was foraged only), why can't they tweak human smithing likewise?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The main reason the old qeynos plate isn't made, is that the same temper is used for Heraldic armor.<br />
<br />
Hmm, make armor and sell, at or below cost, or hold it until your skill is sufficient, and make armor that sells for 5k profit.<br />
<br />
Using royal temper to make Full plate, would be similar to having some stack of silk threads, and low quality pelts, and combining them into silk bandages and tailored small bags.<br />
<br />
Also, they don't tweak human smithing, because the Freeport armor is a viable skillup path, and the temper components are very easy to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Speaking as a High Elf Smith I would prefer to see the High Elves have 2 skill up routes like humans rather than make Essence of Sunlight foragable. <br />
<br />
However with the right group like I have (Multi boxer here). You can get stacks of Essence of sunlight in a single night. Chormo Drakes in Skyfire drop it about 1 in 3 or 4. Take a Tank type (Paladin in my case), Enchanter, Shaman and Cleric over to SF and Kill the Drakes. Keep the Enchanter, Cleric and Shaman Far enough away that they will not be hit by the AoE dispell and have the cleric start complete heals at around 50%. Once the Drake is slowed they are easy to take out.<br />
<br />
I personally have given Human smiths in my current guild around 3 stacks of these as I PL mid 40 characters and gather Pearl shards for clerics in SF. In my last guild I think I gave about 5 stacks of these away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Quinner Sparrowhawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My point of asking the question was shouldn't SOE think about removing an item from the database if it does not ever even get made or consider changing the temper component to something more easily found given the relatively low value of the Qeynos Plate. I was not asking if it should be made since it would be a criminal offense in the eyes of any human smith to use essence of sunlight on the enchanted plate line.</div></div><hr />

IIRC this is a single target debuff, they just start going down the hate list and casting.</div></div><hr />

Drakes don't dispel when feared. :)  <br />
<br />
Yup they sure don't but finding them after they warp away is a bitch. Hope they fix this bug soon, it's been months now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rachelou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually, Yes, I had made a suit of each of the Enchanted Full Plate series, on Brell Serilis before the Sunlights got real danged expensive.  I am still wearing one now, the gold version for the wisdom (I am a cleric) as my smithing skill is only 202 right now, and I am not brave enough to attempt the Radiant Heraldic yet :)  I had a good success ratio when my skill was 188, fresh from finishing with Fine Plate.  I use the Sea Tempers for skilling up right now, of course, and am saving the sunlights like a miser now.. I wish I had known how hard they would be to get, or I never would have made all this Enchanted Armor with it... however, I must admit, it has served me well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I will agree that it is tough to get the Sunlight now if you do not hunt in Skyfire. It was not always so, when they added the Pearl Fragments portion to the Cleric epic there was an explosion of folks killing in Skyfire and it drove the price way down. The problem that all Tempers/Tanins for cultural have is that, when they are first put into the game they are made to drop where people are hunting the most it seems. Elven Morning dew was more prevelent about 1 year ago because of all the people with newbies and all the rangers doing the Morin's Sword upgrade quest, add to that the Druids  and clerics doing the Neck item quest and you have alot of folks that are foraging in Lesser. <br />
<br />
Right now the only time you see people in Lesser is when they are moving through to a Mistmoore Adventure, likewise the only time you see folks in Skyfire (Other than me) is when a Bard is going for an epic part or when someone has a Newish Cleric looking for shards. Thus Chromodrakes are allowed to run rampant and not be killed as they should, thus a lack of essence of sunlight. <br />
<br />
On Tunare some folks have taken advantage of this and will camp the Chromo's and Mature Chromo's for the sunlight and sell it for Outragous prices in the bazaar. <br />
<br />
Personally I would like to see Essence of sunlight added to the loot table in either North Ro or EC LDoN Adventures, maybe then you humans would see more of it for sale at better prices in the Bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aethia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">ok - I'm a bit confused here (on a extended break from smithing atm).  My smithing skill is 214 and still farming velium for EVB to 222.  After that, I plan on doing human cultural, using Freeport to skillup on and Fierce at 240 + geerlok for some cost recovering (as well as some friends).<br />
<br />
I plan to mix Mistletoe cutting sickles in there as well, just tired of imbueing emeralds.<br />
<br />
Given the rarity of EoS, I see that Fierce is not a good skillup route, especially at 222.  But I thought EOS dropped of off Sand Giants in South Ro.  In my time trying to obtain the anchor for the Oracle Robe quest (2 ghouls, 1 AC, 8 EOS, no anchors), I didn't think EOS was that rare.<br />
<br />
So after 222, the options are human cultural (Freeport), Shadowscream (personal choice NO), mistletoe cutting sickles or Human cultural (Qeynos).  Having eliminated Shadowscream, is Freeport ok? or am I just running out of caffeine and dying of forge fumes :(<br />
<br />
Thanks for helping me clear up confusion</div></div><hr />
