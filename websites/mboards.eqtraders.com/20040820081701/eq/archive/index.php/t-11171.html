<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>slinkity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know if JC is fixed yet? I logged in today and got a small patch message, and have heard it was supposed to be fixed. Thanks in advance!<br />

Did 2 runs of gem studded chains since they &quot;fixed&quot; it in the last patch, with jcm3. <br />
<br />
First 39/60. = 65%<br />
<br />
Second 31/40 = 77.5%<br />
<br />
Total 70/100 = 70%<br />
<br />
My guess is that failure rate with no jcm is 50% on these and now the 50% reduction in failure rate means its 50% of 50% = 25%. ie 75% success... which probably is how the skill always was intended to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tawnos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Kinda strange they keep closing the topics on jcm.  To add my numbers to the data accumulation, i was 143/194 on chains (yay, finished tailoring and 1750).  Thats a success rate of 73.7% which seems about right considering the 45-50% known success rate for chains.  Also, while not statistically significant, i was 3/4 on bloodmetal earring combines.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Skilled up from 184 to 240 today (on non-enchanted metals, if that makes a difference).  <br />
<br />
I believe my worst run of luck was 3 failures out of 20 combines, normal was 0-1 failures per stack, WIS buffed to 265, without using a geerlock.  (DEX buffed to 251)<br />
<br />
I keep seeing references to JC3?  Is this an AA ability for enchanters similiar to our Shaman Alchemy Mastery AA?<br />
