<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">for those interested in making some extra PP for tradeskilling, I am offering to pay for your farmage of swirling shadows.  I really need a supplier who has the time to gather these... I would give 1k per 2 stacks (hell, as long as its close to 2 stacks, will still give you 1k)<br />
<br />
my goal is to get 50 stacks  :D<br />
<br />
<br />
locations to farm:<br />
1) shadowweave thicket (level 1-20)<br />
2) twilight (level 40-50)<br />
3) maiden's eye (level 50-60)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>lonewylfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">gah, too tempting, sign me up ;)<br />

GAH!<br />

Say it ain't so!  Previous to the smithing trivial changes of yore, I used these arrowheads to skill up my smithing.  I held them forever, and finally, out of sheer frustration at lack of room, dumped them on a merchant.<br />
<br />
I won't even begin to tell you how many stacks of these I ended up burning for mere pocket change, but remember, I make 10 slot packs, and I never have extra room...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well i was going to try the bow route... <br />
<br />
but its 360pp per attempt for skill ups &gt;235  :cry:</div></div><hr />

<br />
11 stacks in 5 days.  That doesn't suck!<br />
<br />
IIRC, Euell still sees the boys in Twilight as dark blue.  I think it's time he pushed on towards 44...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i farm with my mage.. (55) and just use pet..<br />

<br />
I wonder how they'd like to gather 'round and have a taste of my new Upheaval spell?  I haven't had a chance to break it in, yet, and and these shades are close enough to undead to make me dislike them... alot.   ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">trust me... if you get 2 or 3 on you..  AE nuke may not save you from mutliple taps of 150... and they like to proc often. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">take a shaman to slow, practically slows the lifetaps to nothing.<br />
<br />
2-3 of them beating on anything with a decent PBAE...your gonna die from the multiprocs.<br />
<br />
were talking they can average 0-2 procs per round of combat, i've seen a wizard and a druid die to 4 of them trying to PBAE, this was when they were trying to break the island and didn't want every one of them after them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Glandyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">As topic.<br />

I don't have any stacks ATM, but at that price I will be VERY tempted to rip some hours out of the calendar....<br />

still buying...   <br />
<br />
added the following:<br />
<br />
mugs of sea foam<br />
small pieces of velium<br />
arctic wyvern hides</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Zabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">mugs of sea foam<br />
<br />
Only ended up with 6 the other night, but I'm still gathering.<br />
<br />
BTW, if you happen to have (swatches made with) flakes of lodestone, someone had about 43 golden teal ribbons for a bit under cost last night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">im just making the concussion and scent robes.<br />
seem to be the easiest to find components for restricted race variety.<br />
<br />
just need a supplier of plains dye/jaggedpine dye to make ribbons out of</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Zabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">just need a supplier of plains dye/jaggedpine dye to make ribbons out of<br />
<br />
Ditto.<br />
<br />
Having a forager helps, but not all THAT much.  I'm buying them up wherever I find them at up to about 5p per, but no matter how badly I need them, I can't see paying more than that a piece for a foraged item.<br />
<br />
And don't EVEN get me started AGAIN about the &quot;going rate&quot; for the dyes in the bazaar!  What are these people THINKING?  For what they are asking for 5 dyes, I could easily skill up brewing to 122 (or higher) and buy a stack of foraged components and water, end up with more than 5 dyes and probably STILL have money left over!<br />
<br />
Hehehe ... I've got the dyed ribbons I skilled up on and don't need priced less than the cost of the dye itself!  [See Zabumule for details...]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">yes I noticed.. i price matched what i had .. cuz frankly its not worth it to me to try to even get cost on those ribbons.  it was purely a skill up venture ... so I didnt have to farm DSP &gt;&amp;lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Zabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">yes I noticed.. i price matched what i had .. cuz frankly its not worth it to me to try to even get cost on those ribbons.  it was purely a skill up venture ... so I didnt have to farm DSP &gt;&amp;lt;<br />
<br />
I figure I'll probably check and match the vendor buy back on the platinum ribbons.  They're not moving anyway, considering how hard it is to come by the research components for those swatches, so if someone wants to hoard them up and roll the dice, I'm going to make it really easy on them.</div></div><hr />
