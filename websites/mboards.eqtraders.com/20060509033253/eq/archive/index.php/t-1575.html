<br />
Phuror tells you, 'Do you make Fulv armor by chance or just selling your old stuff?'<br />
<br />
You told Phuror, 'AFK Message: I can smith any of the Fulvous, Crimson, or Blackened Darkscale armor. Tell me what you want and I'll check my tells when I get back, make it, and put it up for sale.'<br />
<br />
Just in case you didn't see the afk message, yes, I have a smith that can make Fulv armor. The prices for Fulv are the same as the prices I have for other stuff. You have been asking my mule this since the dawn of time (okay, maybe like 3 months) and he still has the same AFK message. Post here, send me a PM, or send the mule a tell and your armor will be made if the materiels are available.<br />
<br />
Cross posting this to several boards because I have no idea who this person is.</div></div><hr />
