<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khoren Stonefall</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi.  My HTML signature seems to have quite a lot of space between each of its small-text lines, making it even more offensively large than it already as.  I will leave it in this post so you can see it, but I will stop using it until/unless I can find a way to make it a bit more compact.<br />
<br />
Everything I know about HTML is embodied in that signature--I just went to tag reference site and gave it my best.  Could anyone tell me if there is something I could try to get those smaller lines not to be spaced so far apart, to make it look like it does when I post on EZBoard?  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

The only thing I can think of is to ask if you put carriage returns after each of the  tags when entering your signature file. Sometimes carriage returns are treated as an additional  tag. Make the signature one long line of code, and it should work fine.<br />
<br />
If, however, that's not the case, I don't know what to say... it may be just the way this format displays and spaces lines.<br />
<br />
<br />
p.s. don't tease me about my sig file ;-) I disabled HTML so I could post yours without the board interpreting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niami DenMother</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually *removed* the  tags from my sig file, as they were doing flaky things.  Instead, I used a single carriage return after each line, and it seems to have behaved nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khoren Stonefall</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I meddled a little, and had no luck, so I just made it one line shorter for now until I figure something out.  Did you notice how with this board your sig is not committed into the message for all eternity when you post, but is rather picked out of your profile each time it's displayed?  So when you change your sig, the change is retroactive to all your posts. :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Incidentally, this board DOES seem to count CR's in your sig (as I recall, EZBoard did not).  I had no CRs in my sig at all, although I did try removing the 's and replacing them with CR's here.  Notice that the sig works fine, still, but it hasn't changed.</div></div><hr />
