mixing bowl UI works on computer A and not on computer B /shrug. This indicates some kind of setting. Now while mixing bowl does not work forge works, loom works, fletching kit does not.<br />
<br />
any ideas?</div></div><hr />

are both computers patched to the current UI? are they using the default or a custom one (that doesn't have the tradeskill windows)?<br />

Is one computer set to only open tradeskill bags on control-rightclick? Try control-rightclicking on the bag to open it.<br />
<br />
It's probably the second if stationary containers open the ui but bags in inventory don't... that's the way I have mine set up (since I also use bags for storage.</div></div><hr />
