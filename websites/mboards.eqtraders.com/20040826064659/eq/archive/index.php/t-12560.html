<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mac128k</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have a better way than the Muffin quest in Freeport (I am KoS). I have able to do the Harmony/Invis method but it takes so long I can only get a friend to help for a little while.<br />
<br />
I could make as much money as I like selling Blessed Poles if only I could get into PoG to forage the Planer Oak.<br />
<br />
Any ideas are appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you're just wanting to get into PoG to forage, I don't think you need to get faction. Just go in invis, go diredtly to the SW corner (which is right behind the zone in), as far as you can go into the zone wall corner and forage away....nothing paths close enough to aggro there even if you drop invis...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hurk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">its the only way unless you have good elf caster factions, then you can do bone chip/batwing quests to raise a general faction that will open up other quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mac128k</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have had limited success in the corner.<br />
<br />
The problem I am having now is that the mob at zone in sees through invis and jumps me as I zone in. I am not sure what I am doing different now because I was able to get past him a few times before. I have suffered a few unrezzed deaths so I stopped trying to make it to the corner.<br />
<br />
I was there a whole day once without anything pathing into that corner but I did have one get me there once.<br />
<br />
Also, can you get faction hits just for being in the zone? I was there while a raid was happening and I kept getting faction messages even though I was tucked into my corner.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the noobish questions but I just recently discovered the joy of making Blessed Rods :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorvari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Protectors of Growth were fixed a while ago and have zone wide agro if you are KOS,  So even if you go to the corner they will hunt you down.  Because you were on their agro list when they died, you were getting the faction hits from the raid killing them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mac128k</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That explains it :)<br />
<br />
Thanks, Thorvari.</div></div><hr />

Oh bleh...well, shows you what I know...=P  <br />
<br />
Your advice is still sound as long as there is no killing in the zone :p<br />
<br />
So I appreciate the effort :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kelaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The muffin quest will fix all your earthside factions that were damaged in Plane of Growth, but it will never fix your faction with the mobs who live in of Plane of Growth (Faction is called Servants of Tunare).  At present, there is no way to repair that faction, once you're KoS to them, you always will be.<br />
<br />
Here is the guide I wrote for my Guildmembers on repairing factions after fighting in PoG.<br />
______<br />
Repairing your factions after PoG<br />
<br />
Killing anything in Plane of Growth lowers the following four factions: <br />
<br />
Clerics of Tunare <br />
Faydark's Champions <br />
Soldiers of Tunare <br />
Servants of Tunare<br />
<br />
Three of these four factions can be repaired in an hour or two! The fourth faction is only attached to npc/mobs within the Plane of Growth itself. If you wish to quest an item with an NPC IN PoG then you should not be hunting there until you've finished your quest because there will be no going back. However, for the rest of us who just want to be able to visit the guild trainers in our home town or complete our epics, here is the way to repair the other three factions: <br />
<br />
In a nutshell, you need to hand in hundreds and hundreds of muffins to Pandos Flintside in Freeport West (see here: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=611). This will raise the three Norrath-side factions, the ones that are stopping you from visiting some NPCs in Kelethin and Felwithe: <br />
<br />
Clerics of Tunare <br />
Faydark's Champions<br />
Soldiers of Tunare<br />
(plus raising King Tearis Thex and lowering Crushbone Orcs) <br />
<br />
Pandos Flintside is on Faydark's Champions, as strange as that may seem. If you're KoS to Pandos (and you will be) you can <br />
a) sneak if you can <br />
b) get a druid or ranger's help to harmony him and invis-reinvis you which should allow you to do the hand in<br />
c) Kill Crushbone orcs. Much more fun! <br />
<br />
Killing Crushbone orcs raises the following three factions: <br />
<br />
Stormguardians <br />
Faydark's Champions <br />
Emerald Warriors<br />
<br />
One you're out of KoS to Pandos you can then do the muffin quest. <br />
<br />
So, that's how to raise your Norrath-side factions after a slaughtering spree in PoG. There are many other ways to raise those three factions but from all reports this will be the fastest by a long way. All up, it should take a few hours at most. <br />
<br />
Disclaimer: That said, don't forget that at the present time there is no way to raise your Servants of Tunare faction. If you have PoG quests you want to do, you will not be able to do them after killing even 3 or 4 regular mobs in PoG. If they introduce new quests or new NPCs on Servants of Tunare faction at any time, you'd better hope they introduce a way to fix the faction as well! Also, there are roleplay reasons for some people not to kill in PoG. <br />
<br />
Hope all that helps some people. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lanalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sometimes the whorl at the zone in will see through invis, sometimes he won't. Sometimes mobs will cast see-invis on him as they path by, which is why he sometimes aggros you.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there is no way at this time to fix the PoG faction Servants of Tunare, so you're stuck KOS there. :( The muffin quest will only fix worldly factions (Kelethin and Felwithe).<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some resourceful person came up with a solution to this. He asked me to go pull the whorl, root it and port out. As a druid this was easy, and he was able to zonein and find a hiding place with out any trouble.<br />
<br />
(I love doing unusual tasks like that to help people.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>mac128k</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">All of your info has helped me a lot and I thank you all.<br />
<br />
Knowing that I cannot repair my faction is actually a relief. I am no longer stressing out about how to do it because it cannot be done! Ahhh :)<br />
<br />
My new plan of action, which has worked well so far, is to zone in with my non-KOS shaman to see if the zone-in mob can see invis. He didn't last night so I made my move with my ranger. I also thought of using cancel magic or rooting to move him but luckily it didn't come down to that.<br />
<br />
I am now happily foraging away and was able to make 3 poles last night :)<br />
<br />
My final concern will now be logging out in time if I accidentally log on in the middle of a raid up there. That aggro came REALLY fast last time :p</div></div><hr />
