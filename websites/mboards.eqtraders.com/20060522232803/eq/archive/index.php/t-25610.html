I have seen quite a few saying they went back to sickles, has anyone done something different?<br />
<br />
What results are the 300 smiths getting from sickles? It sounds like 8-10 sickls per 1% from other threads? That is going to be one heck of alot of sickles and plat :(</div></div><hr />

I just finished my Smithing 7/7 today.  Held graphics is the same as inventory icon: http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=95056</div></div><hr />

<br />
At 30kish per 100 that is 330k that I will have to pass on spending, on the bright side, at least I got a 12% mod now.</div></div><hr />

It's really not worth grinding out 1,000 sickles again to me.  I might do a run or 2 of sickles just for tribute purposes, but not that many. <br />
<br />
I'll just do BD cultural, GM-DoN augs, white/black inlays, and other combines just as normal work and hope that someday I'll get up there.  Only 3% so far though. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Agreed, specially I have the VT gloves that gives me 15% mod anyways. I will be taking my time on all my trophies to evolve, exception being baking and brewing since I can always use the stuff I make.<br />

I'm not in a big rush, especially since right now, I get no benefit from the extra 3% skill mod.</div></div><hr />
