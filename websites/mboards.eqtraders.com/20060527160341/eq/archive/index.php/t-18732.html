<br />
I am a level 51 cleric in the process of raising his fishing skill and of doing lots of tradeskilling. I need money. I am looking to enter into a regular buying agreement with a tailor wherein I fish lots of cod oil, and you buy it from me in quantity at a slight discount. <br />
<br />
You get:<br />
<br />
lots of cod oil (only have 25 atm but I'm willing to do much, much more) at a fairly cheap price -- I'm thinking 80pp per but this is negotiable. <br />
<br />
I get:<br />
<br />
a guaranteed buyer for as much cod oil as I can sell. I will not put my oil in the bazaar for as long as our agreement holds (assuming you buy regularly...we'll work the details out in game) -- you get rights to it. <br />
<br />
Please contact me -- Murel -- in game if you are interested. I am also perfectly willing to fish fixed quantities if needed (if I am not yet under contract).<br />
<br />
Happy skilling!</div></div><hr />
