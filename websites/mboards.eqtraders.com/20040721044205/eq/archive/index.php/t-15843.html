<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meerina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a 65/250ish ranger with a bit of elemental gear at 213 tailoring and solstice robes are starting to get expensive (not to mention the JCM3 enchanter I usually have make my chains is starting to get tired of making 'em).<br />
<br />
I can farm velium no problem, and the other components for velious tailoring aren't much of a problem either.  I also have a ton of acrylia stockpiled.<br />
<br />
So my basic question is which is fastest to farm: flawless rockhopper hides, or tigeraptor/black panther/arctic wyvern hides?  I spent several hours in WL yesterday and only have 30 hides to show for it.  <br />
<br />
I have about 120k in the bank, but that needs to get me through fletching as well, so I don't think solstice robes are really an option any more (if there's even a decent chance that I can get those last 7 points for about 60kpp doing solstice robes, by all means say so!  I've been buying the spider silks for 8pp and under lately, and there seems to be a good supply at that price.  I also have about 60 combines worth of silk left if I get more chains made).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any and all advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>crimson69</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As a ranger myself, w/ 200 aa's, few pieces of elemental gear, and a few pieces of VT gear I have found it well worth my time to just go Exping and collecting drops in elemental (or sol ro) and use the money made from those groups to more than fund my solstice robe route. I do have access to a JCM 3 enchanter for the chains, and i do also have a Cleric on my second acct that is able to imbue all my gems so that does make things a bit easier but the skillup rate i have noticed from solstice robes to Velious tailoring is quite in favor of solstice robes both skill up rate wise, and cost wise. Cost wise because velium has become so expensive with the enchanted metal bits recipe for smithing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Toffen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Arctic wyvern have a decent drop rate, about 1 in 6-8.  Plus with coldain tempers at only 6pp now, velious leather is pretty cheap IMHO.  I did velious leathers from 200-239.  I would consider also buying the hides in the bazaar you can usually find tons on Zeb 75-125pp.  Arctic Wyvern is a MUCH better drop rate than flawless hopper hides.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meerina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Both posts much appreciated, thank you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For a ranger, I think velium/Velious hides (i.e., those in WL) are prolly the easiest to farm (black panther especially), but it's the yew leaves required for the temper that's a pain. Even as a druid, mashing forage ever time it's up, I could farm 3 stacks of black panther skins and only forage 2 yew leaves on a good day.<br />
<br />
I agree; farm for plat and do solstice robes. They are a pain and expensive, but at least your &quot;farming&quot; will also acculumute you xp. (and/or watch the bazaar like a hawk for the rarer components, yew leaves, etc.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dorfsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wyvernhide masks was a GREAT path for me ...started near 220 and took them to 250.....buying bricks of velium to make the studs on Maelin wasnt overly expensive and although u can near forget selling the final product It seemed to me that the skill path was easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm using Wyverns for my route as well, but my drop rate is more like 1 in 10-15. I farmed for several hours last night with 5 Hides to show for it.<br />
<br />
But I still like this route and I'll keep at it until 250.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Other than spider silk, none of the high end trivial pelts/hides/furs are anywhere near reasonable in price here.  spider silk usually 10-17pp each, flawless rockhopper usually 400-450 ea., arctic wyvern 350-500 ea (bloody nutcases need a good facial stabbing for those), othmir fur not sold, holgresh fur 20pp ea (if you really want to burn 4 sapphires per combine, be my guest.), haze and black panther skins not sold, cobalt drake hides not sold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Id say wyverns. They do drop a fair ammount of cash stuff that can be sold to the othmir if you have the faction (non KS will work since youre a ranger with Sneak) and you can use the cash to buy more pelts/velium/whatever other stuff you need in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />
