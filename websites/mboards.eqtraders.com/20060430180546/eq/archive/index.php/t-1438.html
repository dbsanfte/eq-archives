<br />
Mischievous Platemail -&gt; but as i understand, the armor must be made by a dwarf. I used to have a dwarf paladin on my account but i deleted her. I got a iksar 60 monk with a 112 smithing. But his STR is only 255 when i get some nice shaman buffs. I have the gnome cleric (level 55) on a different account for the imbued peridots and i have a DE chanter i could level a bit to make any vials or do any enchantments. I have a halfling 49 druid that could also be used for any foraging / farming as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
I recently did some armor upgrades and my bank account went from 20k to 10k but taking a few days off from raiding and stripping my alts I could raise some decent cash.<br />
<br />
1. I'm going to look online and see if we have any grandmaster dwarf smithers on my server (xev). what would be the best way to find one?. just look for a specific type of cultural in the bazaar and go from there? In your opinion what would be the best things to do/collect to help the smither out to reduce the total cost?<br />
<br />
2. Lets say I wanted to do this myself. I'd hate to create another cleric (i have two on different accounts already) wish dwarfs could be enchanters :) but this sounds like the best class to use if i really wanted to pursue this.<br />
 <br />
3. Looking at the trivials, is this all i need?<br />
<br />
Brewing 136?<br />
tailoring 31?<br />
smithing 242? + Geerlok Automated Hammer +5% smithing<br />
<br />
Thanks again for all your help.<br />

a. The best way to find out if there are dwarven smiths on your server, is to check the Marketplace forums here for your server and ask(it's at the bottom of the main board page.) then check your marketplace for your server message board(if you have one), and also look around the bazaar for anyone selling dwarven cultural. <br />
b. The things you should collect is whatever you can. For dwarfs the more difficult pieces are(I believe) the blue diamonds and Lava Rocks. Your best bet for reducing costs are to bring as many of the finished peices as you can, and bring extra(for example fully smithed infused sheets over the rings and bricks to make them, or completed tempers over just the components.) Every smith is different though, so build a rapport with the guy/gal and see what they WANT you to bring(which may just be plat), and bring as much of that as you can.<br />
<br />
2. If you wanted to do that yourself It wouldn't matter which class you did it as a dwarf. Since your main can already imbue the peridots, you can make it all the way up to max skill with using the &quot;old&quot; cultural imbued without ever needing an enchanter or a single level. Dwarf Warriors won't have a too difficult time getting there STR to 255 using cheap items/buffs so you would probably be better off with that.<br />
<br />
3. Well technically you could do it all at skill level 0 and succeed, but if you want the best chances to succeed given combines you need..<br />
<br />
Pottery 199(this is fairly easy to get, and even with this level you will fail a lot on the blue diamond powder)<br />
Brewing 150ish<br />
Tailoring 100ish(a lot easier than you think)<br />
And smithing 250 straight up, or 240 + Geerlock, or 220 + Creators Hammer.<br />
<br />
Of course even with that smiithing skill you will still only have a 50-60% chance on the final combine. At a straight up 200 skill you will only have a 5%ish chance. It basically goes up a percent for every effective skill point, so you will have to make your own risk assesment based on difficutly of materials.</div></div><hr />
