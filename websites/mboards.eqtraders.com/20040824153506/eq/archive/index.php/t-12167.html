<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mentalcaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had a HDD fail here at work that I absolutely had to get the informatin off of and found a company by the name of Drive Savers (http://www.drivesavers.com) <br />
They did an amazing job. worth taking a quick glance at.  The cost was cheaper than I expected but maybe more than you able to pay since you run on donated costs.<br />

Very cool! I bookmarked it and sent the link to my boss. I think we're going to keep track of this just in case. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mentalcaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">so you know you can arrange for them to transfer the data to cd's, dvd's, or even a ftp or ldap space to retrieve the files from.<br />
<br />
In my case to recover a hard drive from arm failure leading to head crashes it cost $1500 for a 60 gig hhd put on dvd's. <br />
<br />
(in layman terms the arms inside the harddrive that reads the data from platters were bouncing off of it causing scratches )<br />
<br />
I'm glad this information can help someone. <br />
<br />
My wishes go out to you DenMother in case you do get a chance to read this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Azif Icared</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Was going to also suggest, that if it had been your own machine and the drive failed that you find an identical drive and swap the controller boards.  This can be done fairly easily if you know someone who can solder in an ESD environment.<br />
<br />
We do it often at work and have had more success then farming out drives to recovering companies.</div></div><hr />
