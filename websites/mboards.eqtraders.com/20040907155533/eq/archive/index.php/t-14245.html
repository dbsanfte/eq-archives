<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi..I just got my Fishing to 100 and got my graphics working again.......i have just 2 Fishing questions:<br />
#1 - I read in a previous post that i cannot find now, that you could take Gunthak Mackeral and put it in a tackle box with a fillet knife. You could then make 5 baits from it. I tried this in a collapsible tackle box and it says i cannot combine these items. Does anyone know what tackle box and what is needed to make 1 Gunthak Mackeral into 5 baits?<br />
<br />
#2 - My second question is, are there lures or flies that can be used continuously? I saw we can make flies....but after you catch a fish, are these Flies re-useable? Or do we lose one Fly for each fish caught. Basically I was curious if there is re-useable bait? I go through bait so quick in Abysmal Sea, I was wondering if this was possible.<br />
Thank You all :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can buy bait from the the general supplies guy across from the banks below deck on Queen of Thorns.  (OK does anyone else expect to see some Love Boat references as easter eggs there?  One of the brewing merchants at least could have been named Isaac.)<br />
<br />
You need to use a skinning knife to make bait from the mackeral and don't ask about the reasoning behind it - no one knows.  I guess there must be more than one way to skin a fish?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Where do i buy a skinning knife? Is it player made or sold by vendors?</div></div><hr />
