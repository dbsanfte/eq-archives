<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>greenwood_d</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
I had a friend give me this suggestion - thought i would pass it on since there wasnt an article directly written by EZtraders like the one for pottery.<br />
<br />
Here ar my details Lvl 33 Paladin<br />
STR 138<br />
STA 95<br />
AGI 113<br />
DEX 92<br />
WIS 148<br />
INT 111<br />
CHA 96<br />
<br />
Now to be honest i started this with the instructions here to make bog juice and then skipping casks Heady Kiola, but this is simpler faster and much much less expensive. ( I have in fact made a 200+p profit on the deal muhahahahah)<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I was at lvl 30 when i switched so it 1) will take more attempts than recorded 2) will cost slightly more than recorded and lastly 3) will take slightly longer than recorded - if you start from lvl 1 BUT I HIGHLY suggest you do.<br />
<br />
I used a geerlok fermentation tool to help with the combines (got it cheap in Bazaar for 20p)<br />
<br />
I worked in Pok everything is literally right there.  Talk to Merc Vuli Ironstove opposite the brewing barrel for the Water Flasks at 1 silver.  Talk to Caden Zharik outside and down from the small bank for grubs 3 copper. (Don't know where that is - give a /ooc and they'll tell yah),<br />
<br />
For all you who havent figured it out we are making Fetid Essence.  Simply combined 1 wf and 1 g = 1 fetid essence.<br />
<br />
Here are the stats (again from lvl 30):<br />
100 attempts: 5 yld levels 30-47 7 min<br />
200 attempts: 25 yld levels 48-68 7min<br />
300 attempts: 33 yld levels 69-80 7 min<br />
400 attempts: 63 yld levels 80-101 7 min<br />
500 attempts: 86 yld levels 102-121 7 min<br />
6 attempts: 6 yld levels 122 1 min<br />
<br />
total attempts: 506<br />
total combines: 218<br />
<br />
Costs:<br />
506 grubs @ 3c = 1p 5g 1s 8c<br />
506 wf @ 1s = 5p 6s<br />
total cost: 6p 5g 7s 8c<br />
<br />
Mercs buy at: 1s 1c (fetid essence)<br />
Mercs sell at: 1s 2c<br />
Cost to make 1: 1s 3c<br />
<br />
You have three options as follows: (btw mercs buy unusd parts at cost = Breakeven)<br />
<br />
1) sell back 218 to mercs for total : 2p 3g 9s 8c <br />
this is a loss(cost of master lvl): 4p 1g 8s <br />
<br />
2) sell in bazaar/players<br />
a) breakeven - on 218 (including the total for 506) = 3s per<br />
b) wait for profit - I looked in bazaar 100 were offered by 3 ppl at 2-8p per<br />
I sold for 1p and got 218p <br />
Total Profit: 211p 4g 2s 2c for getting my main to Brewing Lvl 122 Master <br />
<br />
WOOHOO He can BUY his drinks now and work on that Alcohol Tolerance lvl<br />
<br />
Okay now time for the sinical ones to have a go - GL and GH<br />
