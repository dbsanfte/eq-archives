<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xaanru</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DOn't do sickles at 188, that would probably make you decide to quit smithing very quickly. You'll get a success rate of about 1/20, and a  stack of 20 costs about 7kpp to attampt.<br />
<br />
Factor in the 2k or so that sickles sell for these days, and you'll be losing somewhere around 5kpp per stack.<br />
<br />
Figure 2 stacks per skillup on average, and you're looking at 10kpp per skillup, and that probably won't improve much until you hit 210 or so.<br />
<br />
If you can afford 220,000pp to get to 210, then by all means do sickles. If not, do shadowscream, or old cultural, or acrylia (or ideally, all three, as the materials become available).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I meant the sickle components, instead of finishing off on FSP.  I believe the pommel will take you to 183-189 ish.  Somewhere in there.  And no &quot;padding&quot; to deal with.  Granted, there is the problem of mistletoe tempers (which as a smith, you really need 135+ brewing too) and the blessed dust (requiring embued emeralds) but as many taxi's as there are in Nexus, one or two will surely sit around and imbue a couple of stacks for you.</div></div><hr />
