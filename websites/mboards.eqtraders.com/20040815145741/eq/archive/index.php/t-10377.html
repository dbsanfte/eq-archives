<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cinaed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Given that I'd already printed out most of the recipes from this site for my crafting needs, and that I'd taken a break from tradeskills in general, I hadn't gotten a chance to check out the new formats for them.<br />
<br />
I ducked out of something today on EQ to look up..um..what was it..oooh..right, was looking up where the Giant Halibut, Giant Snapper, and Storm Salmon spawned, since I had stacks of bread crumbs and wanted to use them. <br />
<br />
So, I pop onto eqtraders and click into the recipes..baking..Planes of Power ...Wow!<br />
<br />
I couldn't have been impressed more.  I'm sure others have long since posted this, but..my hat's off to you, Niami, and to all that helped with the new format, I am incredibly impressed!</div></div><hr />
