<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dryanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">recipes which do not require an expansion in order to obtain ingredients <br />
<br />
This is probably why - you can get all the ingredients without any expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Turlo Lomon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Personally, I dislike using the Era field in databases I create.  There is too many grey areas.  I replaced it with a Source field, which references the book, quest, etc. that introduces the recipe into the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Given how many dozens, if not hundreds of sources that would be (I can think of over 30 books and NPC's just for baking stuff, for example), that's not a viable option.<br />
<br />
However, given how frequently in the past we've had folks whimper &quot;But I can't get that ingredient, I don't have ___ expansion!&quot;, sorting by the expansions *needed* to make something was what we decided was best.<br />
<br />
As always, we can't please everyone, and there will always be someone who doesn't agree with our decision.  :)</div></div><hr />
