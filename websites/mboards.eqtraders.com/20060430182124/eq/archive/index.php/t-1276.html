<br />
The AC is lower than the BD cultural, the difficulty and cost is higher, and the stats it gives aren't even that good for the classes that use it. It gives agility and dex, no strength and no stamina. If you were to use the same AC increase that the PoP chain has to the BD chain, then you would have some good armor. The plate only has 5 ! 5 more AC than the chain , and its stats are worse.  From what I have seen of the stats posted, the same holds true for all the differnt types of planar armor.<br />
<br />
Also, the plate takes 2 times as many tempers as the chain does to make , and its not worth making compared to the chain. I am not saying the chain should be nerfed, or made harder ( its a hell of a time gathering the componenets as is ), but that the plate should be made to take less componenets, and that it's stats be signifigantly changed. I want SoE to take a good look at the stats on this armor in comparison to what nearly ALL 61s will be wearing at that time. Nearly every 61 will have BD smithed armor, or velious quest armor. This armor is currently completely worthless. If I were to buy all the componenets and not go farm them myself, it would cost nearly 12k to make one attempt at a BP on my server.<br />
<br />
When I saw the stats of the chainmail when they were first posted, I was under the false impression that the same upgrade would be in store for the smithed platemail as well. I could not have been more wrong. The platemail in short, sucks. It gives the wrong stats, lower ac, and the same or less (depending on the type) hp as the BD smithed. The velious quest armor dominates it so completely its pathetic, while the chain can compete or better some of the slots compared to the velious armor. I believe the stats on the plate BP should look something like this :<br />
<br />
Night Terror Breastplate<br />
AC:54<br />
Str:+12 Sta:+8 Dex:+3 Agi:+3 Wis:+8 Int:+5<br />
HP:+40 Mana:+40 SV Magic:+10<br />
Recomended level of 61.Required level of 46.<br />
<br />
This would be in line with the chainmail's stats.<br />
<br />
I am just posting this to see if anyone else shares my opinion and maybe get SoE to look at this problem.</div></div><hr />

I have posted feedback that if they are going to make them that sub par they should at least remove the lvl 61 Required for full benefit. Required lvl 46 or even 51 would at least make it desirable to some.<br />
<br />
I have had almost no luck selling the little bit I have managed too make.</div></div><hr />

PoP chain is good, plate is not.</div></div><hr />
