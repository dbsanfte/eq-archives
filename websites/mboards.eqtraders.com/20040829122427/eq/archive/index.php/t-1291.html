<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tellum Deyash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Gathering coiled springs in PoI yesterday after the patch, I noticed that coiled springs don't drop as often as before.<br />
<br />
Was it just bad luck or can someone confirm??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xeni Vidivici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Got about 4 in a 2 hour trip there, not sure if this is a nerf or still the same. Total droprate seemed the same as before, lots of items on most mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tellum Deyash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think it used to be more. On a 2 group event for 2 hours, we ended up with almost 5 stacks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sennes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can't say anything directly about the actual droprate, but I have observed that the number of springs on vendors and traders has dropped to almost nothing. This could also mean the tinker twinks are catching up, but still, you'd expect to find something sometimes.<br />
My planar smugglers are also coming up empty. Lots of crap, but hardly any springs or bearings. <br />
<br />
so, long story short. There does seem to be some smoke. If this means there is also a fire remains to be seen..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kritta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My spring gatherers have been saying the same thing, but as I'm not here first hand I have no idea if it's just smoke or fire.  8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Handor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Early on there were tons of springs dropping.  It seems to me that they added more 'stuff' to the loot table -- lots of 5pp type items that you didn't see often early on but are more common now.  So it's not so much that the springs are nerfed as there are more items there competing for a chance to be the dropped item.  I have still seen two springs drop off the same mob.<br />
<br />
I've spent the last two nights there trying to level up a chanter friend (two nights, nearly all of 59).  Gotten several stacks of springs, a nice stash of mana batteries, and a few carapaces.  Not like it was early on, but still not a bad haul. :)</div></div><hr />
