<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>novel44</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'v mastered most trades. Have a shamy for alchemy and now the time has come for tinkering. Basicly what I would like is a rough estimate on how much it's gana cost me PP wise from 50-250. I have plat to spend but as u can see I still have tailoring to finish off so just trying to get an estamate on how much pp to reserve for this wonderful skill. Please help me out and let me know how bad my bank account is gana suffer.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
Edit: one more thing I was not clear on. It might sound dumb but is tinkering like alchemy?  In other words at lvl 16 I can raise my skill from 50. does that raise my skill only 5 points untill I hit lvl 17?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At level 16, your gnome can achieve 250 tinkering.  Tinkering is a bit costly.  Mine is at 199 now and I've made a ton of geerloks, which I have to sell at a loss in bazaar, just to recoup some costs.  Others sell to merchants.  For geerloks, which can get you to 236 with LoY geerloks, all ingredients but 1 are vendor purchasable.  The vendor prices for sprockets and gears isn't cheap.  <br />
<br />
You can make money skilling up on collapsibles, but due to their lore status, it's hard to make them enmasse.  It is a bit easier since the shared bank was added.  <br />
<br />
Sorry can't give you approximate costs, as I don't keep track of those things, but take a look at the recipes and the costs of vendor items and you should get an idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kritta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tinkering has changed so much that I can't give a plat estimate, as it cost me much more then it would today due to geerloks, anizoks and collapsibles. Mostly now it is time that slows most down, the tedious farming for components.<br />
<br />
However, I can tell you that a lvl 16 gnome can get to 250 tinkering. It is not level based beyond lvl 16.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not cheap...maybe not as expensive as tailoring was in the long run, but more expensive than fletching was (I did store bought fletching 200-250).<br />
<br />
My tinkerer is at 239 (10 points from doing guild elemental cam combines) and I think I've spent maybe 60-80k on it...? (buying velium for geerlok hammers in the baz, buying springs, pinions, ball bearings, knuckle joints, etc. when I can find them at good prices).<br />
<br />
Oh and spending forever farming in PoI (hate that zone). And farming in Wakening Lands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>novel44</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the replys. Soudns and looks like it's going to cost me around 50k at most to get it to 250 since I have all the time in the world to farm any component needed.. it just might take a while but not in a hurry. thanks again</div></div><hr />
