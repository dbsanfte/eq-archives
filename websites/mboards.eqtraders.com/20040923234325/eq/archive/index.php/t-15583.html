Is it just me, or is the login server down?  Nothing is mentioned on the EQLive site, all servers are up and nothing is down.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hilbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Same problem when I got home this  morning. Guessing the log in server is down even if the rest of the servers are up.  Why they don't show the status of the log in server at EQlive I don't know. Stupid that they don't, would also let people know when they can log in after a patch since the log in server seems to be the last server they reactivate.</div></div><hr />

Still getting error 1001, as I have been for almost 3 hours.  This is getting boring ... <br />
<br />
/sigh.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping that changes soon, a buddy I hadn't seen for a while emailed an intention to be on, so it would really be nice if we could both get in.  :boggled:</div></div><hr />
