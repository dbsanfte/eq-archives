<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Voltai Ausra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone had any luck with making zek bane weapons.  Yeah I know they are pretty much useless but it's just a neat thing I want to do with my smithing skill because I can....well if I can more like.  Not much is known about them it seems<br />
<br />
Not much info here about them and to make dark insanity there's not any sort of info abuot where the blood or the fang drop to make the pulsing black vial.  <br />
Also missing is information what drops the decorin ore shards.<br />
<br />
Any information that anyone can provide me with would be greatly apprecaited</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Decorin ore shards are dropped by the animated swords which get summoned when you engage Tagrin Maldric in PoTactics.<br />
<br />
Insanity fangs are dropped by construct seedlings in PoTorment.<br />
<br />
The blood is I believe a simple quest in Tactics... possibly you even just have to hail someone? My memory is a little fuzzy.  I know it was hard to get to the guy but a SoS rogue could do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dumpty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Insanity Fangs are dropped by the ravens when you are killing Saryrn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The above info is right, get your brewing up a bit for the subcombines, however, your assertion that the Zek Bane are worthless is completely unfounded.  Try going after the Zeks with and without the weapons, you will see a HUGE DPS increase.  Yes, they can, and have been dropped many times without using them, but that doesnt make them useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes made my claidmore last nite, just the +15 bane wep (DARk POWER). No fails. Not sure what trivial on final combine was. I am at 244 smithing. FYI that stats on this wep rule +15 to all 100 hp 100 mana. IF ANYONE has a pulsing black Vial on Cazic I am willing to buy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>AbitooXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">final combine is no fail.<br />
<br />
Failable combine is the decorin ore + water, which may have a required skill to combine?</div></div><hr />
