<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ReflexMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a quick question on the unfired idols that trivial at 248. I understand that the imbued amber can only by made by clerics/shamans that worship CT, but it appears that the final combine is not race/diety restricted.<br />
<br />
I've hired someone to make me 1000 each of the vials, clay and imbued amber, but want to make sure I can do this combine. If I can, it would seem the quickest way to 250 (well, 248 anways), and not terribly expensive either (figure this will cost me approx. 23,000pp for 1000 attempts, which equals about 50 skill-ups if I average 1 skill-up per 20 attempts...).<br />
<br />
Anyone know for sure if a human mage can make this combine? Recipe page says I can, but just want to double-check...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nimphe Wildwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">. I understand that the imbued amber can only by made by clerics/shamans that worship CT, but it appears that the final combine is not race/diety restricted. <br />
<br />
That is a correct statement, and yes you are able to do the final combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't be surprised it if takes significantly more than 1000 combines.  My current skillup rate, with a 280 wisdom is more like one in 50 or 60 in the low 200s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aethia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I too, am doing idols, but Rallos Zek (Jade).<br />
<br />
I had 320 vials of clear mana made, 320 imbued jade, and an int of 222 with KEI and stat food.<br />
<br />
I went from 225 - 232 on 200 attempts (average skillup rate 1 per 25 attempts).<br />
<br />
I was fortunate to have a small army helping me - 2 chanters making vials, 1 shaman imbuing jade, 2 clerics and 1 druid healing me (necro) and shaman while we liched/cann'd.<br />
<br />
It made for an interesting afternoon, especially when youngsters would come up to me and ask me for clarity.  If you have the resources to go this route, it is definitely much cheaper than star ruby steins.<br />
<br />
Best of luck to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>DaariAyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1 in 20 is probably a little too high expectation.  I think the average is 1 in 40, it can be better but it can be much worse.  My recent skilling averaged 1/43.......<br />
<br />
Don't want to rain on your parade, but you may decide you're paying too much if what you may be able to gain is only 10-15 ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ReflexMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm still collecting supplies, but after perusing the recipe lists I decided to make unfired idols using imbued rose quartz. They're cheaper and that particular unfired idol trivs at 250. Problem is finding an Erollisi Mar cleric to make the imbued rose quartz. I hired one guy and was paying him 1k per full 10-slot bag (200), but he lost steam after 3 bags. So I still need another 400...<br />
<br />
The clear mana and clay was easy enough tho - I borrowed a friend's chanter and made 1000 each in a couple hours.<br />
<br />
If I do average 1 in 40 I'll simply make more. But for 1000 combines, my cost looks to be around 20k. Not too bad.<br />
<br />
When I finally do these combines I'll let everyone know what I averaged. So far, I've raised 4 skills to 250 and have averaged the following (all figures are for skills above 175 or so, as the skill-up rate prior to 175 is quite high):<br />
<br />
Tailoring: 1 skill-up per 22 combines<br />
Brewing: 1 skill-up per 21 combines<br />
Jewelcraft: 1 skill-up per 32 combines<br />
Baking: 1 skill-up per 18 combines<br />
<br />
I'm hoping fletching isn't too bad, otherwise it'll cost me over 100k to get to 250 - argh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Pottery and fletching skill ups were &quot;nerfed&quot; in that may 8 patch, making it harder to skill up.  Both can be a pain. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm doing these as well...I was lucky enough to scribe the imbue plains pebble spell back in the day (I'm a woodie druid), so I can imbue those, so I buy them cheap in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Went from 222 to 233 in 200 combines - I was pretty happy with that.<br />
<br />
Got another 200 combines ready to go. I'm hoping to get 10 or so (or more!) skill ups from this batch so I can move onto star ruby steins...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Callandre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was doing unfired Karana idols and it took me 120 combines to get 1 stinking raise... from I think 225 to 226 (or was it 224 to 225?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gokusprout</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As luck would have it, I skilled up on unfired idols just today.  My WIS was 355 at the time, and I did NOT have a geerlok or other mod.  <br />
<br />
I started at 214 skill and went up to 248 skill in 635 combines.<br />
<br />
That's about 1 skill up every 19 attempts.  Now I got a few in a row, and I did a bunch with nothing.  On an unrealated note, I got my last 2 points making Star Ruby Steins.  Took me 61 combines to get those last two points =:(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aethia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">grats on making 250 :)<br />
<br />
And I'll take those last 2 points with only 61 combines :) -- made 40 Star Ruby Stein attempts and 0 skillups.  <br />
<br />
Hope you have better lucky with your trophy than I did (if you don't have it already).</div></div><hr />
