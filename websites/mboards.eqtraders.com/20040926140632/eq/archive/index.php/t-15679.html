<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kittaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, I just finished the AG Quest and thought I would never do tradeskills again, but last night I felt like trying to gm my smithing as it is the last one not 250. I have over 500k in the bank and don't mind spending all of it if thats what it takes but I am looking for a combine that doesn't have tons of subcombines e.g mistletoe sickle, or require farming ala ss. I am a tunare wood elf. Is there any other easily made yet expensive combine that I could work with?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The problem is getting enough blood to do that many Tae Ew Chain combines.   You could try cultural armor if it's available to you, blue diamonds are easy to find on vendors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kittaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wood Elves don't get a high level smithing combine for their cultural unfortunately, that is high elf only. Tae-Ew.. yeah that could work but it would take me a year to get enough blood to do those. Anyone else have a suggestion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bregalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, last I checked, Tae Ew bloods were less than 700pp on Xev bazaar, not sure about your server.   You did say you got half a mil to burn.   And if TE chain does not sell on your server, you can always get tribute for it - I've read TE chain legs are worth like 10k tribute points.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hurricane or Night Terror Chain would work as well. You can Normally find all the items to make it in the Bazaar or just grind out some AA's in BOT Birds area for the Blood, South for the SandStorm Pearls. Then Buy the Electrified Copper in Baz as well as the Drops of Pure rain.<br />
<br />
Night Terror is a bit more of a pain to make as few people  hunt nightmare anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zacatac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well I'd say Acrylia if you have the money to buy up any/all windstones you can find.  Although that may still be hard to get a lot of combines that way for skill ups.<br />
<br />
It took me 6 months or more to get from 242 to 250.  I did tons of HIE cultural and Mistletoe sickles along with some Black acryila weapons and Tae Ew armor.  Even with all that, it took a looong time to get my final skill up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Mistletoe Sickles is probably your best bet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>oerin trubble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If money is no object hire a bunch of folk to do the subcombines for you for sickles. Pay them with completed sickles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Yitara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In addition to buying Tae Ew stuff, you might also want to look at Black Acrylia Weapons.  You can usually find the bricks of black acrylia very inexpensivly and the temper components are also usually less than the Iksar and Tae Ew blood.    They don't sell as well as they used to but with your money that's not a big concern.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>syndellbristle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The only problem with black acrylia is that it is lore... while that doesnt pose a problem for multiple skill ups reselling is a tad difficult when you can only hold two at most on one character (one in bank one in shared slot)</div></div><hr />

Yes, this is true if you are a reseller.  However, the original poster has 500K plat to spend so not sure if this is a major concern.  Still, you can make 14 different Black Acrylia weapons (28 total if you use shared bank) the only major change being the molds you use and whether you need a shaft or not.  Since the molds don't stack it makes not much difference if you buy all of one type to make non-lore or different ones to make lore items.  Most Black Acrylia items can vendor farmed or found in the bazaar so this does technically meet the original requirements for a skill up path that doesn't involve farming no-drop stuff, ala ShadowScream, or massive subcombines, ala Solstice Robes.</div></div><hr />

That's a very slick idea.</div></div><hr />
