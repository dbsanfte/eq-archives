I would prefer to only buy them if you have a 10-slot backpack full of stacks of 20 velium studs though as opposed to buying them in small amounts.<br />
<br />
Im not sure exactly how much one of these would cost to make, but if you farm the velium and just buy the temper im guessing around 40-70pp per stud. <br />
Anyway Ill pay around 15k per bag as I described above. If this is unfair post here and we can work out another reasonably fair price that we can both agree on.<br />

Im upping my price to 25k per bag....<br />
<br />
Thats 1, 10-slot bag full of velium studs(which should be 200 studs) for 25k<br />
<br />
I will but up to 4 of these bags. all at once or as you bring them to me. If you can actually bring me all 4 bags at once Ill probably toss in a bonus or something.<br />
<br />
Also if you want to help me but it may take a week or two at least let me know and I will tell other people that I already have someone so you dont farm them for nothing.</div></div><hr />

Thank you to those who may have shown interest and for great information and help on the boards.</div></div><hr />
