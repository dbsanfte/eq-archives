<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, reports from the FanFaire say that they're going to &quot;look in to&quot; PoP Smithing...<br />
<br />
I'm one temper away from an attempt at Livestone Plate Vambraces ( I've already made the sheets &amp; jointing ).<br />
<br />
I'm three tempers away from an attempt at Inferno Plate Vambraces ( I've already made the sheets ).<br />
<br />
From past experience ( Removing the gem requirement on enchanting ores ), we know that we won't get reimbursed for tempers we used already.<br />
<br />
It's unlikely I'll get the three tempers I need for the Inferno Plate in less than a week... so I'm just going to hold on to any I get, rather than start making the Chain Jointing.<br />
<br />
But should I go for the Livestone Plate Vambs, assuming I get that last Liquefied Earth I need?<br />
<br />
Should I hold off buying supplies at inflated prices, hoping for increased drop rate later... and thus greater availability?<br />
<br />
/sigh   Why couldn't they have fixed this last year?!? :faint:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When they say they will look into something a fix won't be implemented for a few weeks at best (if ever). I would assume they would up some drop rates, but thats my guess. I would say make the armor because any change will take a long time to be made.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because they don't seem to reimburse for already done combines, and the impression I got from reading the FF posts here on Eqtraders, I'd say go for the Livestone.  The impression I got was that they were either going to up the drop rates, or change the recipies so that only the final combine requires the temper, the others requiring something else as quench.<br />
<br />
In either case, since you've already expended the tempers preparing the combine, go for the combine when you get another temper.  You're not going to get those tempers back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got an Intellectual Superiority buff...  Then made a few Tae Ew Longswords &amp; Tae Ew Two-Handed Swords, just to check the RNG...<br />
<br />
Then failed on the Livestone Plate Vambs.  :(<br />
<br />
Need 3 Metallic Substances to try the Inferno Plate Vambs...  But with all the Elemental+ level players playing in GoD when they're not in Time, it's gonna be awhile.  :mad:</div></div><hr />
