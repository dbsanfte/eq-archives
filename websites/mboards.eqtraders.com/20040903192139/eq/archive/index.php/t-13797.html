<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zephaus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">AS indicated below, this quest is linked on the front page.  You have to complete the quest to use the recipe, so even though I've posted the recipe below, you can't use it until you do the quest.<br />
<br />
This is the complete text.<br />
<br />
Make sure you turn in the items 4 at a time - 1 per window.  Not in a stack of 20.  <br />
<br />
There are recipes to be gotten from the Pottery Supplies Merchants, Malkidiv and Hiloan in Abysmal.  Hail them and they tell you the following:<br />
<br />
Hiloan O`Yviania glances at you and holds your stare for a moment before speaking. 'I don't suppose you have any skill at all throwing clay or at the kiln, because if you do I could use your help with some of the more [intricate items] that the fools around here are always breaking.'<br />
<br />
You say &quot;What intricate items?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hiloan O`Yviania says 'I have been given the unsatisfying task of replacing [specialty items] for the gardeners and the folks that deal in poisons and other such things, but I just don't have time for it.  I have my own research into the native clay to work on.  There appear to be stone workers made out of a type of clay that was dug up long ago, when this land was much more fertile and magical.  The clay of these [ancient stone workers] is more powerful and useful than the rest.  If you are interested in helping Malkidiv out with lesser tasks, talk to him.  He can also refine chunks of broken stone workers for you.'<br />
<br />
You say &quot;What specialty items?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hiloan O`Yviania says 'Let's put you to work.  You don't have to be a skilled potter to handle this.  Oh, and, well, I'll need you to get some clumps of refined Taelosian stone worker clay from Malkidiv.  He can refresh the stone for you, making it into useable clay, if you can find some.  I won't need the ancient stuff for these tasks.  Hand me the clumps and I'll get you started.  Work hard for me and I'll reward you with the secret recipe that Malkidiv and I share.  Since what I need is more difficult to obtain, I'll be quicker to reward you.'<br />
<br />
You say &quot;ancient stone workers?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hiloan O`Yviania says 'I hear they roam deep in the interior of the continent.  They say something about a temple, but I really don't have time to keep up with that sort of prattle.  The parts of these ancient golems are more potent and I can use as much as you can bring me.  If you do, I'll restore and refine it and give you the bulk of it back.'<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Malkidiv U`Ycionuz says 'Hello. Thanks for stopping by.  Are you, by chance, interested in helping me with some of the more [menial tasks] I have to get done around here?'<br />
<br />
Malkidiv U`Ycionuz says 'Well, I am responsible for keeping the ship stocked with plates, pots and other simple supplies, but with all of the research I'm working on and my experiments with the amazing local [clay], I just don't have time to keep up.  Wayfarers are notoriously hard on dinnerware.  Can you [help] me out?  And if you have any spare clumps of refined ancient clay, please speak with Hiloan, she needs help making some of the more complicated items used on the ship.'<br />
<br />
You ask, &quot;Clay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Malkidiv U`Ycionuz says 'Ah!  Yes, amazing stuff.  It seems that the locals have a way of making clay that is so powerful they can use it to make stone workers!  It's fantastic, and I just can't get enough of it.  If you come across any, please give it to me.  Parts of broken golems seem to work the best.  If you do, I'll restore and refine some of it for you.&quot;'<br />
<br />
You say &quot;I will help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malkidiv U`Ycionuz says 'Great!  We've discovered that this new clay makes wonderfully durable plates.  Of course, there's no point in making durable plates, that's just a challenge to these people to try to break them.  With this clay we can make thinner plates that are just as strong and take up less room.  Here, take these bits of broken plates and this bonding agent and re-fire the plates.  Bring them back to me as soon as you can.  I'm grateful for the help.  If you can keep helping me out, I might be willing to share with you our secret method for refining the stone worker clay.'<br />
<br />
Turn in several stacks of Wayfarer Plates (5 stacks, I think).<br />
<br />
Malkidiv U`Ycionuz says 'Thank you for your efforts.'<br />
<br />
Malkidiv U`Ycionuz says 'Excellent. You're obviously too talented to be wasted fixing plates.  We could use a lot of pots.  Our cooks are just as clumsy as our patrons.  Take these pot molds and blocks of clay and fire them in a kiln.  I can use a lot of these things, we use them for storage, cooking, breaking over heads. . . All the usual stuff.  We don't need quality here, just quantity.  Bring them back to me quickly or we'll run out soon.'<br />
<br />
Turn in several stacks of Wayfarer Pots (5 stacks, I think).<br />
<br />
Malkidiv U`Ycionuz says 'Wonderful!  You are certainly good at working with a kiln, and you've been a great help to me.  I have a somewhat more complicated task to be done, if you have the time.  We go through mugs here faster than an ogre goes through chocolate.  Take this clay and these flasks of water and turn them on a pottery wheel until you have something that resembles a mug.  Handles would be helpful, but are not necessary.  Then take the unfired mug and these Wayfarers seals and carefully fire them in the kiln.  Don't worry, those seals are stamped onto tough sea serpent skin, they won't burn.  Bring me the mugs when you're done.'<br />
<br />
Turn in your stacks of Wayfarer Mugs.<br />
<br />
Malkidiv U`Ycionuz says 'Fantastic!  You have been of great service to the Wayfarers Brotherhood.   If you can help me with my next task, I'd be willing to give out one of the Wayfarers' trade secrets.  This task will require more effort and skill than those I've been asking you to do.  Some of our scouts use ceramic shafts for their arrows.  These require some skill to make properly and have to be made well.  I can't just trust just anyone to make them.  Take this clay, these flasks of water and this special dye and use the pottery wheel to form them into unfired shafts.  Then, take these molds and fire the shafts.  The dye is important, as each of our scouts likes to have their own colors on the shafts.  Something about competing over who kills the most enemies or something like that.'<br />
<br />
Turn in your stacks of arrows.<br />
<br />
Malkidiv U`Ycionuz says 'You've been a great help already.  I'd feel very guilty asking you to help out any further.  There are others that can do that work for us.  For all of your efforts, I'd be honored to teach you the secret of refining chunks of broken stone worker into refined Taelosian clay and chunks of broken ancient stone worker into refined ancient Taelosian clay.'  Malkidiv pulls a small text from his coat and leans forward to show you a few of the pages.  What he shows you seems amazingly simple once you've seen it.  You think that with practice you might be able to get better results than Malkidiv gives to those that he refines clay for.  Just place a single chunk of broken Taelosian stone worker onto a pottery wheel and you will receive clump of refined Taelosian clay.'<br />
<br />
Note, the combine works in the Kiln, not on the wheel as indicated in the quest text.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azirux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All the new tradeskill quests available in Abysmal Sea are already posted on the main site. The Link is currently on the front page of the main site, or can be found under the &quot;Quests&quot; link on the side menu.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zephaus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You're right, I didn't see that.  Well, this is the full text, including for steps 3 and 4.<br />
<br />
Z</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did anyone go any further with pottery?  Seems that the taelosian clay needs to be good for something and I did see that there are sketches of Brell Serilis and Rallos Zek listed for some diety figurines that i never saw before.  (What drops the stones to make the clay anyhow?)<br />
<br />
What do the bolos with ceramic bolo weights do?  Looks like they get charged with alchemy potions - are they thrown?  Are the reusable?  Anyone know more details?  I'll try things when I get a chance but was wondering what others have found so far.<br />
<br />
Hungry for more pottery details ;) and looking forward to working on the new recipes if I can find the components.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zephaus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are golems in Barundi that are probably the ones they are talking about (the black and blue guy on the patchserver skin).  I have yet to gather sufficent strength to go make an attempt at killing them, so I haven't tried anything else yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I keep forgetting to write down the exact details but two recipes in the UI for pottery wheel are unfired gnollish figures - recipes are clay + diamond + either a sketch of brell serilis or sketch of rallos zek.  Anyone ever hear of those sketches?  Doubt it is a Gates recipe due to the severe lack of gnolls in Taelosia.<br />
<br />
Another was a Runed Clay Jar (I think) in the kiln - Gray Jar + Finely Crafted Runequill set + Sonic Wolf Blood.  Trivial listed as 282 and I was all excited until I remembered collecting non stacking grey mud and that the Grey Jars are lore.  (Who wants to root around in Shar Vahl's litter box looking for clumps of grey mud - think about it.)  Also a bit worried it will eat my runequill set based on problems with the figurine quest.  It think it was 6 slot and 35% weight reduction.  <br />
<br />
If I can ever get myself to focus for 10 minutes I'll get the details and post them correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">OK I know this is bordering on a rant - but I can't seem to find any new recipes for pottery in the expansion except for making ceramic bolo weights.<br />
<br />
Pottery has been skipped in LoY and LDoN while the other skills got new recipes.  Did anyone find any other GoD pottery recipes at all?  (OK so the new mortar and pestle were LoY, I think.  But it wasn't a fun general item to play with.)<br />
<br />
I find it interesting that jewelcraft uses crucibles for metal working - I wonder if any of the EQRPG glass recipes were slipped in.  (I almost had a fit in guild chat when I saw the crucibles on a jewelry merchant.  Glasswork is much more related to pottery and ceramics than jewelcraft both in terms of techniques and in materials science.)  <br />
<br />
I guess the other thing to try is using the taelosian clay in old recipes and seeing what happens.  Too bad I only found one piece of the stone so far.  I am gonna cry if it is just used for bola weights and some new type of poison vial.  <br />
<br />
Guess it is time to submit all those recipes and stories for pottery I have been writing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well not sure what all I will be able to try as um, the rock I have is for fletching not pottery - sigh.<br />
<br />
Pale Nihilite can not be lacquered so I don't think we are going to have Pale Nihilite Encrusted Steins.<br />
<br />
The EQRPG recipes use stone to make glass (limestone or sand while it really should be both with some soda tossed in for simple soda lime glass - hmm I don't think any of the minerals were borates but we might be able to make Pyrex (TM) down the line LOL) as well as the crucible and glass blowing tools - haven't spotted them anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Qhue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In Yxxta last night I found a no_drop lore &quot;A centaur figurine sketch&quot;.  A few of them dropped and when I cast Identify on it I got:  Lore - The instructions seem simple enough<br />
<br />
Since there are other no_drop tradeskill things from other zones (part three of Ikkinz has the fletching bow, the first mountain trial has the tinkering parts etc) I assumed that this was for pottery.<br />
<br />
Sadly none of the clay + water + sketch combos I tried worked and so I think this most likely needed the Taelosian clay.  There are numerous golems in the area but none we killed dropped any clay.  Will be back there later today Im sure and hopefully will get some clay that works with this sketch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zephaus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">By the way, once you've done the quest for one of the pottery merchants, there's no need to do it for the other.   Either gives you the recipe. <br />
<br />
I still have yet to find any ancient stone worker parts, so I don't know what the 2nd part of her mission is...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I picked up a &quot;Chunk of Broken Ancient Stone Worker&quot; My understanding was this converted same as other raw material...

<br />
Apparently the text of the quest is wrong -- you have to put the chunk in the Kiln -- at least with the non-ancient parts.  You might try the Kiln rather than the wheel.<br />
<br />
Do you mind if we ask where you acquired the Chunk?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Confirmed: Clump of Refined Ancient Taelosian Clay. Trivial 15 in Kiln</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zephaus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Did you turn it in for the quest?  Any result?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The result of the conversion is the same result as the quest, so there is no point to turning it in. We now just need to know what it is used for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zephaus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ah, I see.  I thought maybe she gave you a new recipe if you gave her the ancient chunk, as opposed to the regular chunk.  Oh well!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>SilverfurMangycoat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The clay is used to make a ceramic bola weight.<br />
<br />
Recipe Here. (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=10911&amp;menustr=) <br />

The ceramic bola weight is used to make bolas that can proc effects like stun or a fire dd.<br />

I can confirm that the bola itself is NOT thrown.</div></div><hr />
