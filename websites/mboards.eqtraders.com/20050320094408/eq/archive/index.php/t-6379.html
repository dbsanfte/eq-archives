He was a serious tradeskiller on Mith Marr server.<br />
<br />
He was a shy, most often quiet (though with an off-the-wall sense of humor) fellow who was always available to help with tradeskills, gating, or to share his wealth of EQ knowledge.<br />
<br />
Monday, April 21 ... he fainted from low blood sugar (he was diabetic), and fell in a position that did not permit him to breathe. By the time he was discovered, it was far too late.<br />
<br />
His funeral is tomorrow, and I'm ... probably not going to be on EQ for a few days. I shall miss him terribly. It's gonna take me a while to feel like playing again, though I may log in and wander about aimlessly visiting places he and I used to frequent.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your patience with me while I mourn him. Losing him really hurts.<br />
<br />
Rest in peace, dear one.</div></div><hr />

May the spirts of those who passed before guide him to his final resting. <br />

We mourn with you. <br />

Rest assured he will be missed somewhere as this game often has a bigger impact than some of us imagine.  Friends are friends - blood, distant and in pixels.  I'm sorry for your loss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eowenna Celerdain</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He had a gift for brightening anyone's day, pretty much anytime he got involved.  Both worlds are poorer without him.<br />
<br />
I know he used to come to these boards ... he's the one who introduced me to EQ Trader's site and msg boards.  I'm not sure which forums he frequented, though.  I thought anyone else who knew him might appreciate knowing why he stopped posting.<br />
<br />
Home server was Mithaniel Marr, though he sometimes visited Test, Firiona Vie, and others.  He tended to use the same character names: Meerc / Merc, Kolya, Scre, Laars, Kalrin, Abree.  I helped him pick the name for his Trader: Gnoc Turnal, a gnomish necro.  He wanted a tinker.   :cry: <br />
<br />
I pulled myself together enough to put in a mini-memorial for him on the lower section of the portraits page on my site (see sig link).<br />
<br />
I'll try to do better by him when I recover enough to do it right.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bigalow17</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My name is Bigalow, i play on mith marr, no i am not a tradeskillmaster, but i am a overlord, and i am a diabetic, I have come close to death a number of times. I belive my worst one is this,  my sister was there in the emergancy room, cant really remember, but heh funny thing is, i act so much like i hate her, i piss her off so much. But there i am, laying there, my mom asks me do you know him ? ( my father, ) my anser is no, Do you know me ( my mom ) my anser is no, then she points to my sister do you know her, all i said was yeah she's trouble, then asked me about my other sister and her boyfriend , n-no i dont know them.  <br />
This happend after i got back from a diebetic camp a few years ago, i met a girl named jessica, in the 3 or 4 days i knew her, she was the greatest thing to me. I dont really talk to her much not since she lives so far away from me, i just cant think of myself leaving and the feelings my family, friends, loved ones, past loves ones would feel.<br />
<br />
I stilllll treat my sister like crap, purpisly piss her off somtimes, but she knows i love her. Where ever Kolya is in the clouds, i'm sure he knows you all love him and miss him.<br />
Iunno if this acualy relates to anything here at all , but being diebetic myself and my family can relate to this.<br />

R.I.P Koyla  :cry:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eowenna Celerdain</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thank you all for your kind condolences.<br />
<br />
It has been decided that I shall inherit his Everquest account.  SOE was informed ... they're not thrilled, but not forbidding it either.  I have the full support of the family in this.<br />
<br />
I know he had promised that his characters would be available to aid others in tradeskills, etc, and that some of them held items in storage for others.  (Yes, I know what and who - so don't get any bright ideas!)<br />
<br />
Whenever I am able to access his characters without crying so much, I will begin to fulfill my promises to help them become epic and max out certain tradeskills ... in his memory.  <br />
<br />
Too many of his dreams were buried with him, his own story incomplete.  I have no power to complete all of them.  I can, however, continue his legacy through his own EverQuest characters.<br />
<br />
If you hear me speaking of my &quot;legacy account&quot; or &quot;legacy characters,&quot; that's when I'm talking about his.  Even though I &quot;own&quot; his account now, I still feel that I am only a steward of his creations ... I feel they will always properly belong to him.  I'm only caring for them in his absence.<br />
<br />
Whenever the day comes that Kolya, Meerc, Scre, Gnoc, and the others again appear in Norrath ... please understand that I will be the hand that guides them.  I must learn their classes, and I will do my best to reflect his own style for them as they go forward.<br />
<br />
I realize that it is unlikely I can ever play them as well as he would have done.  I don't have his incredible knowledge and understanding of the ways that EverQuest works.  Those of you who knew him well may be disappointed that his characters cannot be exactly the same.  I can only do my best, and I crave your tolerance for my shortcomings.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />
