<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gnnoby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there anyway to get to GM 250 by just store bought items?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sorry, but no.<br />
<br />
You'll need drops of some kind, or foraged items to get past 191.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lanalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Even Misty Thicket Picnics require brownie parts and foraged fruit and veggies. That's the only recipe I know of that requires the least amount of foraged/dropped items, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree, of course, that all the items aren't storebought, but if you want to expand your definition of &quot;storebought&quot; a bit, you can get the items in the Bazzar; and fairly cheaply.<br />

One Brownie Part goes a long way :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mordican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From 191-226 I did the meat pies... they take aw hile, but have a good return rate. The new UI helps alot, but its still very very time consuming because of the number of 1 for 1 combines.<br />
<br />
Misty Thicket Picnics are extremely easy these days. I camped the brownies for about 90 minutes and got 19 parts... 1 part = 100 misty combines. The fruits and vegies are easy to come by. bazaar or just /ooc in PoKnowledge. To get to 250 from 226 took about 800 combines for me. 305int. Can all be done in PoK. took me maybe 30 minutes per 100 combines cycle.<br />
<br />
I woudl recommend having your tailoring skill around 100 for making the baskets. Lows the failures on the mandarke root and basket combines a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jylarien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Don't forget you need your brewing up for the Jum Jum beer.  Believe it is trivial at 165, so close to or above that to avoid having to run back and forth to vendors to pick up supplies to cover botches.<br />
<br />
Just a couple of pointers on MTPs:  If you are doing them and can't forage (me being a cleric I can't do much of anything effectively for tradeskills) make sure to keep an eye out in the bazaar for good prices on veges and fruit.  Veges you will need at least 20 for a 200 picnic run, fruit isn't nearly as much... 2 if I remember right.  Brownie parts are easy to get, just go to lfay and farm the ones that aren't brownie guards and you'll collect parts rather quickly.  Oh, and you need eggs for dough.  Spend a few hours in Lavastorm and kill basalisks there for them.  1 egg will last you for over 1000 combines so you don't need a ridiculous amount of them.<br />
<br />
All in all aside from farming and buying stuff in the bazaar it takes me about 35-40 minutes to prep for an MTP run and about 10 minutes to do all the combines.  Even at 225 skill I can still get about 220-250 MTPs out of a run (with geerlocks) and immediately /ooc them in the bazaar for 3pp to make a quick 600-800pp and clear out my inventory for the next run.</div></div><hr />

Don't forget the Basilisk Genitors in Jaggedpine; they're often over looked as an excellent source of eggs, as some will drop 6 at a time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, up to 6?  honestly I had no idea about that.  Looks like I have a new locale to farm for eggs :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aye. Jaggedpine is a Baker's paradise if you are a Druid or Ranger, and not bad otherwise if you'll get your faction up a bit. <br />
<br />
If you've got bad faction, and can do the Poachers, you're set. The &quot;Heads&quot; quest is a bit time consuming, but very nice faction hit and a decent, one time (I mean you can only get it one time), ring. The ring isn't particularly good by current standards, but the faction is what you want. Jeremy's Letter, that faction quest is good too.<br />
<br />
You can GM Baking with the Casseroles. If you like to Bake, and you're not in a hurry, this is the place for you. I've made a small fortune selling meats, eggs and foraged Plant Shoots from this zone and GM'd Baking in the process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yandros</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm at 205 baking now and ready to make a big push for 250.  Would it be easier to:<br />
<br />
A) Use the new interface and make MTP's, or<br />
<br />
B) Take advantage of the GoD recipies and the new interface.<br />
<br />
I'm leaning toward (A) since I can kill brownies easily and I have a number of mule characters I can use to hold the intermediate combines.<br />
<br />
Any tips would be greatly appreciated;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nanndas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There are a lot of recipes that will take you to 220+ from GoD baking that don't require snake eggs. My bst did mtp's from 200 and took over 2100 combines to get to GM. Presently my druid is at 237 and I didn't really start mtp's until 220. Between 195 and 220 I did GoD recipes. I also did a few small runs of hmp's and mtp during that time. Mainly to get set up to run the picnics..<br />
<br />
<br />
Nan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">At this point I'd say it's mostly personal choice. If you spend a good bit of time in GoD, well then use those recipes eh? Otherwise, MTP's would be my recommendation.<br />
<br />
My 31 druid is my 250 baker.<br />
<br />
He did MTP's from  191 to 250 before the new UI, with 255 WIS. Took him 1965 combines total.<br />
<br />
Basically  200 combines per day with a couple extra 200 runs thrown in. Took me a bit more than a week total.<br />
<br />
One brownie part, one snake egg, 3 fruit, 10 veggies per 100 combine run. Everything else can be bought in Shadowhaven. :)<br />
<br />
With the new UI, I can crank out a 200 combine run of MTP's in about 45 minutes... Assuming I have those few items that can't be merchant bought in advance. :)</div></div><hr />
