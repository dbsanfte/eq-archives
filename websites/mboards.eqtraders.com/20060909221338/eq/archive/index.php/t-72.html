<br />
First 250 or so, mostly before PoP (skill 168 to 190): 20 Skill ups, 10 robes.<br />
Then about 140 miserable attempts (skill 190): 0 skill ups, 1 robe.<br />
Last 50 something (skill 190 to 195): 5 skillups, 2 robes.<br />
<br />
Total success rate about 2.5%, but the first and third group are 4%. This is far from enough samples for a decent analysis, but are we really sure the minimum success rate is 5% ? Even if it were 5% once, they may have stealth changed it without letting us know.<br />

Have exact data at home from 155 to 211, broken down to number of attempts/successes per point. Skillup from 155 to 191 was almost all Solstice robes with some Velious and Fleeting quivers mixed in. Robe success rate hovered around 5% with a few long runs of no robes balanced out by runs with multiple robes.</div></div><hr />

Like any skill when you are at the lower skill level skill ups come frequently but don't assume it will always be like this.<br />
<br />
If you look at posts from people in the 188-200 range you will see many having to do 100-200 attempts per skill up. It happens to a lot of us and I personally had a 221 combine skill up at 244.<br />
<br />
As with any combine that is in the 5% category you DO get a chance at making stuff beyond your reach. A person with tailoring skill 20 has the same chance at one with skill 200 doing a 5% click.<br />
<br />
Just saying this since I see many saying how skilling up isnt so bad when they have yet to hit the nasty levels :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
771 attempts, 39 successes. Average success rate 5.058%<br />
<br />
Broken down per ranges.<br />
<br />
155-159: 88 combines 5 successes 5.682% average<br />
160-169: 116 combines 7 successes 6.034% average<br />
170-179: 365 combines 15 successes 4.11% average<br />
180-189: 202 combines 12 successes 5.941% average<br />
<br />
Obviously the 170's were a hell range for Kirasha, more combines and fewer successes per combine in that range.<br />
<br />
190-191 were done on velious tailoring and 192-211 were done on ethereal silks. Haven't picked up the needle since then as we've been busy making up for lost raiding time.</div></div><hr />

Robes sell for around 2k on my server, I figured it was because the components were expensive, but it is just because you need so much skill to make them consistently?  I'm just finishing my crystalline, and looking ahead to get tailoring up further... so I guess my guestion is:<br />
<br />
What is your average cost per combine for these robes?<br />

After being 6 days without electricity due to an ice storm, I'm not able to find anything in my house, so can't find the originals.  What I recall was that the +/- SE for my estimate included 4% and 6%.  This was mostly for Acrylia/Velium Boning with a smithing of 180+Geerlok, and for some BD dust with Pottery at 190+Geerlok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dian</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys, I am finished my 8th shawl, have 176 tailoring and am going to my EoTS and thus robes are next on my target item.<br />
<br />
An enchanter is making me my Gem Encrusted Chain, I only need one correct as I only need 1 robe for the quest.  <br />
<br />
Can you confirm that you get the Gem Encusted Chain back after and thus all it is going to cost me is the dozens and dozens of silks and emeralds to pull this off?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jannelle Silverthorne</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes Dian, the chain is returned on failure.<br />
<br />
Cost per failure on Robes is about 50pp assuming you can do the imbuing and make the dust yourself. <br />
<br />
Cost per success is more like 800-900 depending on success making chains. I've gone 3 for 10 on them before with 250+5% JC skill a few times so they're not easy.</div></div><hr />

well I should prepare my self for many hours of tailoring here sigh.<br />
<br />
thanks again for the responses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Felonna</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Average cost per combine is about 48pp + the cost of a terrible success (300-500pp for the chain).  With failures of blessed dust and whatnot, put that up to 50pp+chain.  At 2k per robe sale, at 5% success you actually make a small profit.  The price on most servers has gone down quite a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EQPlayer</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I've been trying to skill up on them and here is what I got:<br />
<br />
7 Chain Attempts - 3 Failures, 4 Success (250 skill + Trophy)<br />
<br />
10 Robe Attempts - 10 Failures - 2 skill ups (158-160)<br />
<br />
10 Robe Attempts - 10 Failures - 1 skill up (160-161)<br />
<br />
10 Robe Attempts - 8 Failures, 2 Success - 1 skill up (161-162)<br />
<br />
10 Robe Attempts - 8 Failures, 2 Success - 0 skill up (162)<br />
<br />
So I ended up with 4 robes and 4 skill ups for 40 attempts. (158-162)<br />
<br />
BTW It cost more like 80pp per attempt if you buy silk swatches.  Average price on Xegony seems to be 5pp per spider silk or 10pp per silk swatch.  This seems about right, it took me 1 hour to get 100 silks in EK and I can make that much hunting IG's for an hour.  Although I wouldn't mind spending half as much either.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Silk swatches 	10 X 900 = 9000 + extra for failures<br />
Emeralds      	13.5 X 900 = 12150 + extra for failures<br />
Celestial Essence	2 X 900 = 1800<br />
Acid 		.5 X 900 = 450 + extra for failures<br />
<br />
Total is about 25K per 300 attempts and doesnt include the preptime to make the emeralds. (glad I have a Tunare cleric twink) thats still a couple three hours just makeing imbued emeralds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Celestial Essence	2 X 900 = 1800<br />

<br />
I believe best price for CE is 1.6p <br />
<br />
1.6  X 900 = 1440<br />
<br />
I just saved you 360p.  :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, from 900 Blessed Dust Combines, expect 45 fails. Leaving you with 855 dusts.   Turning Blessed Dust and Silk into sacred silk,  Expect 42 fails, leaving you with 813 Sacred silk.<br />
<br />
813 Sacred Silk  = 273 Robe combines. <br />
<br />
By my math, thats 23k for 271 Combines.    About 85 per combine.<br />

I can't say exactly what my average cost per robe is but I can say for sure its minimum 1600plat up to about 3000plat.  The robes sell for maximum 1400plat on my server (and even then... there's some joker selling them for 1k even so its tough to get rid of them at 1400 sometimes).<br />
<br />
I'm still making robes for skillups because the drop rates on most of the pelts I could be using now are bad enough for me to tear my hair out.  Every now and then I get fed up with the robes (or I go completely broke) and I go try and farm flawless rockhopper pelts or arctic wyvern or SOMETHING different.... only to get totally disheartened after hunting for hours upon hours and only getting enough for 3 combines (if I'm lucky)..... so I end up back at the old &quot;farm other stuff for money... use money to make robes&quot; grind.<br />

Hehe this is not about Solstice robes, but I can agree with Tasu about Rockhoppers being disheartening, although they are my to get to GM Tailor.  Spending 4+ hours in DSP at the Rockhopper/Sambata cave and only having 3 Superbs and 4 Flawless Hides (if I'm lucky to find a healer to group with) can be disheartening if you keep track of what you've gathered for the evening.  Most times I try not to pay attention to that so I'm not discouraged at the slowness of the drops.<br />

2 days ago my tailor did 194 robe combines, started at 175, ended at 189...made 8 robes if that helps the math. little worse than 1 out of 20..more like 1 out of 22..just under 5%</div></div><hr />

 :shock: And then at 206 I got 5 robes out of 13 combines and yanked my skilling to a screaming halt because I ran out of gem studded chains.  ROFL some times you just can't win.  At least I got one skillup.  ;) <br />

<br />
i tried to make 10 gem chains and failed 7 (chanter with 250 jc, geerlok and gm tool) i was pretty disappointed to be 70 combines into the 194 and run out of chains LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dian</div><div class="date">12-24-2002, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the kicker here is I actually need the robe for my earing quest.<br />
<br />
My guild mate provided me with 6 chains and I figure I am good to go for awhile for skilling up on these.  I have to make him 3 robes as payment for his chain work but it is a good deal for me clearly.<br />
<br />
OK I have enough for 40 more attempts tonight.<br />
<br />
If I still get zero success I am going to take out my frustrations on the halflings like a good necro should.  (sorry to the halflings of the world, but I gotta be me....)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amaruk</div><div class="date">12-24-2002, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a note, to make 300 combines at the Robe you will need 1800 Celestial Essence.<br />
<br />
You need 900 Blessed Silk.<br />
1 Essence and 1 Powdered Emerald per silk<br />
1 Essence and one emerald per powdered emerald<br />
900 x 2 = 1800 Celestial Essence x cost of essence<br />
<br />
That is a LOT of combines... Wish we could just buy it from a merchant. The vendors in the bazaar sell it for around 4pp each, I then hunt the silk myself. To keep cost down.<br />

So what happens? 2 successes out of 13 tries and I'm out of chains again. You'd think those chains could have lasted longer - I'm only 161.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystic Lioness</div><div class="date">12-26-2002, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I could not find anyone to make chains for me on Kane Bayle, so I took my alt and made her a GM jeweler last week.  (Got her eyeglass yesterday! Yeah!)  She was able to do 11 chains out of 20 attempts.  <br />
<br />
I then gave the chains to my main for tailoring.  Did 50 attempts - 0 robes but 2 skillups.  I am going to continue to try to make these, as it is cheaper to do than buy flawless hopper hides.  I will probably throw in hopper hides as they are available as my successes with them are pretty consistent and I can sell the finished products.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dian</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well did 60 combines last night on this:<br />
180 skill, 255 int, 5% device<br />
<br />
60 combines 4 skill ups and 6 robes.<br />
<br />
CRAP.  Now I have to find more chains......<br />
<br />
My best session in tailoring ever, my partner who was helping almost fell over dead.  Needless to say I my guild mates were very happy to get their robes for the quest.</div></div><hr />

Hell I dont need more compition out there.. its ok guys.. tailoring is to hard.. give it up.. do somthing easy .. like Pottery.. yea.. pottery is where its at.. get to GM in a matter of hours.. np.<br />
<br />
hehe.. I want to picture myself as an old lady right now.. <br />
<br />
Why I remeber when I was doing Grandmaster tailoring.. only thing we had to combine were Othmir hats and Arctic wyvern mask.. Ever try and sell an Arctic wyvern mask.. hell.. I couldnt even give them to Runnyeye gobbys.<br />

<br />
Successes  865 /  Attempts 1689<br />
<br />
All at 250 skill plus GM needle- I hate to guess how many I made skilling up from about 225 or so on them.  :shock: <br />
