<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wyntyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a question on this. If you look at the recipe listed for Ethereal Curing Agent, it says that the trivial is 212 but has a required skill of 220. Doe this mean you can't attempt the combine with a skill less that 220?<br />

Correct.</div></div><hr />

Would have been a nice cheap skillup path.</div></div><hr />

thats exactly why this was implemented. Everyone would be highly skilled tailoring and smiths EASILY if these were not &quot;fixed&quot; :)</div></div><hr />

There's actually a number of people who did get to 250 in tailoring and smithing in the months that the trivial was over 250 for the rings and whatever the tailoring things are called.<br />
<br />
The only reason there's not more 250 tailors and smiths as a result is because they had to perma-kill the vendors after every patch since the buyback on the tempers was completely messed up.</div></div><hr />

So far skilled up from 192 to 200 on Ethereal Metal Rings.  Need another 30% of an AA before I can go over 200 in smithing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Saleani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you just made the tempers and sold them back to the vendor, you made like 35pp profit per success. Thats the big reason the vendor was killled off. The nerfing of ethereal rings/plates/swatches/energy trivials were just collateral damage of the changing of the resale price of the items back to the vendors.  If your adjusted (base or with mods) smithing or tailoring skill was 220 or above, you could have made a very quick progression to 250 as long as the mob drops lasted. Apparently some folks did, and that offended someone who put the kabosh on it. This whole incident is the poster child for nerfs caused by over-reactions.</div></div><hr />
