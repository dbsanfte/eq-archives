<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It has now been one month since PoP was released, and we still have NO new potions.<br />
<br />
Now, rumors on the Crucible point to a hard coded 200 skill cap for Alchemy, even if you are level 65 and are actively skilling up in it.<br />
<br />
BOOOOOOO VERANT.<br />
<br />
Give us alchemists some lovin', or we'll... we'll.... we'll..... stop slowing mobs for the rangers! That's it! Unless you give us the goods, we'll see a mass wave of ranger deaths all over Norrath, and Luclin as well!<br />
<br />
Remember, Every Time You Don't Slow, God Kills a Ranger. Please, Think Of The Rangers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually, the word from the Fan Faire was that there was not a hard cap on it anymore, BUT it's hard to tell from our end.<br />
<br />
There's a thread about the Fan Faire over on the old boards that shows that while they've not forgotten alchemy, they've had issues with getting any new potions approved by the powers that be.  (i.e., too strong, steps on some other class's toes by doing something they do, only better, cheaper, etc.)  They're still knocking around ideas, at last check, so it'd be good if we can come up with some *reasonable* suggestions to revamp alchemy for them to knock around.  <br />
<br />
(Hmmm, like upgrades to the shielding buff line, stat enhancers without the negative stats, maybe an acumen buff to continue the vision line of spells, a closer look at herb prices, etc.)<br />
<br />
If we can come up with some useful ideas, we're far more likely to see some changes to the skill than if we all sit here and write it off as a dead skill, methinks.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>UbercyrusForbeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree that putting ideas out there are a good idea, but I have issue with the better faster stronger thinking.<br />
<br />
one of the best parts of tradeskill s is getting the new stuff with patches. We've sat dormant for a while now and it seems to me that we are being overlooked.<br />
<br />
As for suggestions, I've heard it mentioned a few times and think it's an awesome idea. Illusion potions that work as a faction modifier. This is not something that only one class gets. Most classes have the ability to turn into something other than thier natural form (sorry Warriors, Pallies and Monks :? ) <br />
<br />
This would give us a cool new potion. It wouldn't have to be cheap or &quot;easy&quot; to make, but it would give us a really cool goal to reach for.<br />
<br />
Thoughts on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>belwolfey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would like to see them revamp the herbs and the prices on them.. There are potions that cost over 200 pp per attempt that are all but impossible to sell, if you manage to succeed.  I spent 900 pp in one day attempting a mana regeneration potion, I only had one success. It seems unfair to me that our only &quot;class specific&quot; skill is so expensive to practice.<br />
<br />
Anyway thats my 2 coppers on the subject</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Murjden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As far as stepping on other tradeskills' toes... Verant sure doesn't seem to have a problem doing in reverse.  Stats on baking items (man, that was a slap straight at alchemy), the Velious gate potion, grow/shrink items for tinkering, etc.  Makes me /slap my forehead and say &quot;WHAT are they thinking?&quot;  If they have no problem giving away alchemy abilities like that, they shouldn't have a problem with doing the reverse.<br />
<br />
They really need to sit down and revamp.  Not do what they've done in the past, which is take things out, add new things, put all the old things they had in the first place back again.   <br />
<br />
As for ideas (these are rehashed from many other folks, but bear repeating):<br />
<br />
Take the negative stat effects out.<br />
Make buy backs more reasonable.<br />
Potions that don't require an extra reagent (enduring breath and scales; lev and bat wings).<br />
<br />
I'd much rather see brand new stuff tho:<br />
<br />
Illusion potions.  No stat mods on low level potions, stat mods based on the Illusion type for higher level ones.   Skels, dogs, bears, other races, etc.<br />
<br />
Forage capabilities for shaman (And, no, I don't care that it would be a big re-write....if people are writing things like /gems and mp3 players for the game, they should have time to add that).   It would make things tough for people looking to forage items they need, but it would make alchemy a LOT more interesting.   Buying herbs from vendors?  A primitive shaman type?  Come on folks....<br />
<br />

<br />
I agree, these are herbs that are found growing places.... shouldn't we be able to forage these things oursleves? I mean after working with them to the point you're a master alchemist, I think you'd have an eye to spot them on the ground! If only in specific zones, I'd love to see this. It won't happen, but it'd be cool.<br />
<br />
As far as sell back and all that goes, I really don't think we'll ever see a sell-back we'll be happy with, just ain't gonna happen.<br />
<br />
I say rather than a revamp... let's go for new things.<br />
<br />
Verant sure doesn't seem to have a problem doing in reverse. Stats on baking items (man, that was a slap straight at alchemy), the Velious gate potion, grow/shrink items for tinkering, etc.<br />
<br />
I agree! We should have the ability to make things others can. Just in another form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">at the crucible we've been toying with some new ideas that would make alchemy better. Not the old 'gate' 'invis' 'bind' etc ideas, but new ones.<br />
<br />
One of them was a Focus Effect potion. like the new spell haste cleric buffs.<br />
<br />
An interesting idea I thought was of offensive potions, not defensive. Using the throwing skill to throw potions at an enemy that have some detrimental effect on the mob, like a stun, or maybe a disease.<br />
<br />
Other current potions are nice, but mark my words. In no way is alchemy dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Flabbo McFattyfatfat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Dear god, WHY do you people want a stupid skill to forage herbs?  Do you run around with 4 empty backpacks or something? I am strapped for space as is.<br />
<br />
In theory, you want to forage to reduce the cost of alchemy. This will achieve it, but only to a small degree.  Imagine you want to make a 10 shot clarity potion.  How many herbs are there?  Lets say you have a 80% success rate. So you need 12 of each herb that goes in the potion. But if the herbs are random, you will need to forage roughly 12 of each other type of herb in that forage range.  Its just an unneccesary PITA when they could just as easily drop the herb prices by about 70%.  This would give the same results, be easier on them, and most importantly easier on us.<br />
<br />
Honestly, when chanters are on 24/7 selling extended kei for 50pp, having a cruddy clarity potion for 4 a tick that doesnt cost 80pp per attempt wont kill the game.<br />
<br />
What I want<br />
<br />
Reduced herb prices. Keep buyback low on many potions, to prevent people from selling 10 shots with 1 charge left to a vendor to rebuy in a recharged state. <br />
<br />
10 shot invis, 10 shot gate potions. If vendors sell them, they cant be that unbalancing right?<br />
<br />
Remove the negative stats from potions. I know they dont matter, the devs know stats dont matter, but the rest of EQ is pretty damn ignorant. I swear, people would balk at an instant ding potion that had an AGI penalty on it...<br />
<br />
Remove reagent requirement for drinking a potion. Keep it in the combine if neccesary.  Its aggravating.  Alchemy is supposed to reduce annoyance, not compound it.<br />
<br />
Increase duration on haste and regen potions to be in line with the spells they emulate<br />
<br />
Add in a few new potions.  <br />
<br />
I like the illusion idea, a LOT. Perhaps requireng a piece of meat from the creature being copied?<br />
<br />
A way to enchant ores.  I hate shackeling an enchanter to a forge, enchanters hate being. The bricks dont stack and its just a pain.  This way, the shaman races without enchanters but with cultural armor dont have to leave their culture to produce an effect.  Make it cost about 30-40pp per cast, thats about what I pay an enchanter anyways.  Something an alchemist can sell to a smith to enchant at their leisure.<br />
<br />
Focus effects would be nice. Mages can summon these for free, why not stick em in a can for a modest fee? Likely a dropped/expensive component would be in order.<br />
<br />
This brings me to my final thoughs on alchemy. Its store bought. All of it. Moreover, its customers constantly use up the product, unlike, say jewelcraft, so an alchemist rarely has to compete with a secondary market.  So any extraordinarily good product should require a dropped/ground spawn/whatever component (similar to brewing or baking).  Alchemy has potential, but its been neglected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Arghargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think the dilemma Sony faces with new potions is to make them good enough to be worth making/buying/using, while not so powerful that they become mandatory.  Say they made a new agro increasing potions.  Then a MT could be more sure of keeping agro, which in turn allows everyone else, melee and caster alike, to attack all that much harder.  This could trivialize some encounters (don't you just hate that phrase?).  Given their track record, they may also be concerned about unforeseen tactics (i.e., exploits).  <br />
<br />
Given the test done long ago on STR spell as a buff on damage output, I can't see how a STR potion without the negative stats could be that unbalancing.  I can already self buff my STR buy about 180 points (HoS, Strength, plus Rage).  I know lots of tanks that would love a decent STA buff potion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Murjden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't want to forage to reduce costs.   There's no way that's effective.<br />
<br />
I want to have forage because 1) it makes sense for a shaman to be capable of this and 2) if they make components we can't buy, but need to forage, they're more rare and (hopefully) more interesting than what we have now.<br />
<br />
Knowing Verant, they'll add foraged components, but then screw Barbs since they can't do it.   :?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>UbercyrusForbeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ok, Flabbo...<br />
<br />
First off, who said anything about foraging being easy? Ever played a druid or ranger? Part of the reason the potc quest {bites} is the stuff you have to forage.<br />
<br />
Cheaper.. I doubt it. Seriously, foraging things is not an alternative to buying them 9 times out of 10.<br />
<br />
Secondly, you really think they're gonna lower the price on mana regen herbs and the like, or make it easier to make? Dream on {text removed}.<br />
<br />
I'd hav to say the closest tradeskill to Alchemy is Smithing. It's a long hard expensive process. People had issues with it at one time, did they lower the prices on smithing items? Nope. They did however, make some of the things available via other means. Foraging has been brought up as an alternative to buying items. I agree with Murj though. If foraged compnents do work thier way into the game, they need to make sure all shaman can forage or just forget about it.<br />
<br />
I would't mind seeing an invis and gate potion. (gate to bind)<br />
<br />
I think the idea of parts being used to make llusion potions is great. But creating maybe a higher yield per part, better than a 1:1 ratio. We see that in other tradeskills. Or perhaps use a filleting knife to create chunks out of the parts,  so one chunk is a 1:1 ratio, but 1 part makes 5 chunks.<br />
<br />
I would't mind seeing some special kind of enchant potions. Would be a nice alternative to enchanters.<br />
<br />
Focus effects would be very nice. Stuff along the lines of the Mage items, or maybe even cover some of the gaps the mage items leave... I dunno.<br />

<br />
Would also kill for a potion that did Illusion: Gender.  spell been in the game FOREVER, lets get some use out of it =P   Shock value would be the best.  Specially if they made it stack with other illusions, so you could have chanter project and then drink potion and be incognito.<br />

It looks like they may actually be trying to fix Alchemy now.  Would be nice to here what the cost per attempt on these potions are though.  Either way, I'm just glad they're finally doing something with Alchemy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Flabbo McFattyfatfat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">{Text removed}, yes, I realize that foraging {bites}. Why do you think I am so firmly against it?<br />
<br />
Second why not drop mana regen potion prices? You think 70pp for a friggin clarity potion is a good deal? {Text removed.}  They need to drop prices on these things.  Otherwise we're skilling up on a worthless trade because no one will buy anything made.<br />
<br />
Dont even compare alchemy to smithing lol. Alchemy is throwing money in the furnace to produce worthless over priced CONSUMABLE garbage at the moment. Its the equivalent of jewelcraft, pre Pop, where theres one or two recipes worth making for the money involved.  Why not ask a jeweler how many velium black pearl gear he's sold lately /sneer<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>bromboor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Price is the problem with alchemy.<br />
<br />
Secondly, foraging would be nice. I do have the slots available and the reduction of even 2pp on a possible potion is worth clicking the button while I walk around or med, especially when you have to try 20 times to get a single skill up (20x2=40pp). Even if all I can forage are herbs for alchemy. (I would also love eggs, vegetables, etc for cooking which is both easier and cheaper to do. Why make a potion for +5 strength with a limited time, big price, and a 30 second casting time when I can make 5 frost giant steaks at a time?)<br />
<br />
Yes, I have played both druid and ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cantatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think a large part of the problem Sony has with Alchemy is potions can be used by everyone.  A potion can be used by a level 1 Rogue or a level 65 Wizard and anything in between.  This may not sound like a bad thing, but it limits Sony into just going down the middle of the road.  For example, to a level 65 Cleric a potion that heals 500hp in 5 ticks isn't that powerful, but it's godly to a level 10 Warrior.<br />
<br />
This is part of the reason there are such weak potions with such high costs.  They can't make good potions for a level 50 player without making it cost so much to ensure people won't use these to powerlevel a level 10 one.  Potions were meant to be situational things, not something people could use to powerlevel their twinks.<br />
<br />
So, I really think Sony needs to revamp Alchemy and add potions that can only be cast by certain classes and can only be cast by certain levels.  It might also be neat to add some racial potions as well.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
Expeditious Visions:<br />
Effect: Adds 10% haste which goes over the haste cap.<br />
Restrictions: Level 55+<br />
Duration: 5mins-7.5mins<br />
Cost per use: 20pp<br />
<br />
Delusions of Grandeur:<br />
Effect: Gives the smaller races a certain advantage in fights. [Turns the user into a troll, adds 100str and 10% haste (stacks with all other haste effects)]<br />
Restrictions: Level 60+, only usable by Gnomes, Halflings and Dwarves<br />
Duration: 30seconds<br />
Cost per use: 10pp<br />
<br />
Stone Fists:<br />
Effect:  Turns the users fists into stone making them do more damage than before). (Adds 15ac, 15str, 45atk)<br />
Restrictions: Level 55+ Monks and Beastlords only<br />
Duration: 1 hour<br />
Cost per use: 15pp<br />
<br />
Blessing of Destruction:<br />
Effect: While using this potion, all weak detrimental spells will increase in power. (Doubles the amount of damage level 40 and below DDs do).<br />
Restrictions: Level 55+ Wizards, Enchanters, Necromancers, Magicians, Clerics, Druids and Shamans<br />
Duration: 3mins<br />

<br />

Restrictions: Level 63+ Wizards, Enchanters, Necromancers, Magicians, Clerics, Druids and Shamans<br />
Duration: 5mins<br />
Cost per use: 50pp<br />
<br />
Tribunal's Pardon:<br />
Effect: Doubles the amount healed by the next spell. (2.0 sec cast time)<br />
Restrictions: Level 61+ (excludes CH, %CH, Heals over time, and any heal over 2000hps) - Emergency Potion<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shaman Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Mostly, having potions being useable by everyone is really not such a big deal.<br />
<br />
First, out of the 64 or so (not counting &quot;old&quot; alchemy, which is universally terrible) potion recipes, only about 10 of them are actually useful to any degree.<br />
<br />
Rundown:<br />
<br />
Sow: Not a problem, ever timed the duration of this potion at level 1? Bring a stopwatch that measures down to thousandths of a second. Plus, this is first available in non-potion form at level 9, so it can hardly be considered a twinking nightmare.<br />
<br />
IVU: Just like the spell, the random duration is a severe limiting factor. Plus, not all that many undead about that people might want to avoid, certainly a twinking/PL issue.<br />
<br />
Kilva's Blistering Flesh/Skin of Flame: Innately level capped. Skin of flame does 31 points at level 60, but only like 6 at level 1. Duration is also shorter, non-issue.<br />
<br />
Shrink/Grow: Presents no balance issues of any kind, at any level.<br />
<br />
Stinging Wort: Ah, now we get into a potion with some room for abuse. 300 instant heal...that's pretty spiffy for a newbie, and isn't (AFAIK) level restricted. But, it requires a drop that comes from only 3 mobs spawns in the whole game, and the people camping them, in the interests of saving weight, destroy them. Sometimes you can get lucky and find toes inside Perma, but that is OBSCENELY rare. The 3 everfrost giants are the only real source.<br />
<br />
Field of Bone/Innothule/Everfrost gates: Extremely expensive, no real balance issues I can think of. The 30 second cast time makes them completely useless as an emergency item, and PoK being open to level 1 characters means that there can't be a problem in VI's mind about ease of transport.<br />
<br />
All the other potions on the list are either flat out useless (stat potions), of exceedingly meager use (levitate --- still requires the drinker to carry bat wings!, serpent sight, cancel magic), or far too expensive for any possible use you could have (all of the luclin potions except Grow).</div></div><hr />

I believe alchemy has become stagnant.  Unlike the other trade skills, the small gains we have seen in recent expansions are too little and far to late.  In addition the shaman community has shot itself in the foot by continuing to sell potions in the bazaar at prices close to cost.  10 charge SoW potions are now continuously available at 80p and below on Mith Marr.  Not one or two but 30 or more stacks of 10 charge SoW potions.  I used to be able to sell the high end damage shield potions for a reasonable profit, but these too have fallen to the Walmart Shaman kick-back-prices.  Now I only make potions for alts and only for others if they bring me the ingredients.  I make more plat selling arrows in the bazaar now then I was making trying to sell potions.<br />
<br />
They finally removed the negative effects from stat potions, but I doubt that will encourage many folks to fork out the pp for them.  The main problem is that our potions are no longer needed (or considered worth the cost).  On the high end game (50+ and above) stat boosts mean little.  Hitpoints, resists and AC are everything.  Potions have very little to offer folks on the high end game.  Unfortunately they are the majority of the ones who can afford it.<br />
<br />
With run-speed 3, jboots, and horses who needs SoW potions?  A hundred different magic items and trade skills now dupilicate many of our &quot;useful&quot; potion effects making them worthless.  Only the damage shield potions offer anything remotely useful, but the cost makes them toys for the elite and wealthy.<br />
<br />
Give us a 10 charge KEI potion!  Folks would pay for that!  Enchanters would scream bloody murder because they are the current kings of making money for buffs.  When was the last time someone paid your shaman for a buff?  KEI makes the Luclin shaman potions look like yesterdays trash (with the cost it was trash).  Only the Grow potion is even close to a reasonable cost.<br />
<br />
I really like the idea of Illusion Potions, Invisibility, Gate to Bind, and &quot;Throwing Potions&quot;.  Have mercy and make potions sell back at a reasonable percentage!  How bout a temporary &quot;instant&quot; invulnerability potions similar to the cleric spell (divine something or other)?  Give us reasonable HP and AC buff potions that stack with caster buffs.  Give us potions that buff all the resists (heck there is many a piece of gear that does this on a permanent basis).  At least lower the cost so the noobs and power-levelers can get some use out of the current potions we do have.<br />
<br />
Get a clue Verant, you will not prevent power-leveling!  Level 12 cleric with KEI looking for group!  KEI dangit!  I can't even cast my post 50 stat buffs on folks under 46?  What the heck were they thinking?  Give us a potion the enchanters will want to buy;  they're the ones with all that free plat laying around.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Give us a 10 charge KEI potion!  Folks would pay for that!  Enchanters would scream bloody murder because they are the current kings of making money for buffs.  When was the last time someone paid your shaman for a buff?  KEI makes the Luclin shaman potions look like yesterdays trash (with the cost it was trash).  Only the Grow potion is even close to a reasonable cost.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
You expect them to let shamans make a ten charge potion of a Level 60 spell?  <br />
<br />
Of course Enchanters would scream bloody murder. A level 60 class ability, and letting anyone with a few plat cast it.<br />
<br />
Would you also suggest a Harmtouch potion?  A Rez potion? (Yumm.. 96% proof)<br />
<br />
I'm not sure I see the wisdom in letting one class emulate the effects of others.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Waring McMarrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I can see the Kei potions already, 5k plus per attempt and a trivial of above 300. Wow just what we needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>unoeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Errr, no I don't really expect a KEI potion.  That was a bit of sarcasm there.  My jab at KEI is that it's a pretty unbalancing spell given that it can be cast on a lvl 1 newbie.  I've also been frustrated that KEI sells better than our potions.  My point was that potions are about the farthest thing from unbalancing as you can get.  They have limited usage because they are charged.  Even should Verant be up late smoking something funny and put KEI potions in the game, how many folks would fork out 5K a charge to have one?   :D <br />
<br />
On a side note, the level of the spell/effect a potion duplicates seems irrelavant.  Many new PoP items have level usage restriction, why not potions?  Our damage shield line of potions are an excellent example of a level balanced potion.  Even without level restrictions, the consumable nature of potions make them abusable only by those with endlessly available plat.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Quinner Sparrowhawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">There are already several spells of different classes that duplicate the effects of one another. Most of the potions already duplicate spell effects but have the price of the components priced out of the range of usefullness. If one were to hold to the argument of other classes screaming about potions that duplicate the effects of their spells then alchemy should be done away with entirely since there would be no use for it. <br />
<br />
If I were a warrior and had a choice to group with a cleric or lug around a bunch of healing potions, I'd choose to group. Why waste plat when I could get healed for free? But it would be nice to have an option to play my warrior when no groups are available. I know of several mid-level warriors who would rather log to alts than try to fight without a healer.<br />
<br />
As far as powerleveling goes, it already happens so potions could not make it worse. Some level restrictions on usage would prevent some of the more useful potions from being abused. So that argument does not hold water either.<br />
<br />
I would like to see new potions and for them to be made solely from dropped components. There seems to be many drops in the game that are singularly useful to one class. As a result, those objects rot on mobs if there are no members of that class that need them. Why not make them components for alchemy or some other tradeskill?<br />
<br />
I like several of the suggested potions such as Invisibility, Gate to Bind, Illusion and would like to see better healing potions and mana refresh potions. The possibilities are endless and could be added in such a way that would not be unbalancing nor diminishing to any particular class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Shaman Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I'd be happy enough if they would update the levitation and water breathing potions to not require bat wings and fish scales.<br />
<br />
A better cure poison/cure disease line would be nice. Something up in the abolish range. Useful for Grummus and such. Remove curse potion maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Serax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I'll just throw my coin into the hat as well. There have been times when I did not care about alchemy (as in right now), and there have been times that I was furious about how sucky it was.<br />
<br />
Wish List : <br />
1 - Herb prices drop by about 50-75% depending on herbs. No one is going to pay 100p for a gate, no one charges that much for a port to bind and it ridiculous to think that just because it is portable it's worth that much.<br />
<br />
2 - New Potions. Easier said than done. I like most of the suggestions posted above, aside from the illusions. Granted they would be fun, but essentially useless (we've got that already), unless you really just hate faction work. Potions obviously need to be balanced. Why not pattern them after the DS potions, in general? <br />
<br />
HP Potion : Level X 10 HPs, Duration = Level/2 minutes.<br />
Mana : Level X 5 mana, Duration = Level/2 minutes.<br />
Regen : Level / 4 regen per tick, Duration = Level/2 minutes.<br />
Mana Regen : Level /4 mana regen per tick, Duration = Level/2 minutes.<br />
<br />
That's 4 insanely useful potions that I think would be fairly balanced. Even better : halve or double the appropriate numbers for lesser and greater versions, and viola, 12 new incredibly useful potions. Price them accordingly (*** THIS DOES NOT MEAN USING THE CURRENT FORMULA TO CALCULATE HERB PRICES ***).<br />
<br />
3 - Fix current potions. Part of this has happened with the removal of neg side effects. So far so good. Get rid of reagents needed for lev and enduring breath, while you're at it. If you're going to leave the port potions at the same cost, bring down the cast time so they're useful in emergencies, or better yet, make them an evac for everyone in group. THAT is worth 100-300pp a shot.<br />
<br />
4 - A note to whomever is responsible for alchemy in its current form, or its future :  PLEASE USE COMMON SENSE. The system as it stands is stupid and wasteful. We would really like to have a real tradeskill that we could use and benefit from. Of course we want to profit as well, but that's what EQ is supposed to be about, interaction. Ask a KEI'er how much money he pulls down if he just sits in nexus or PoT and KEIs all day long. 4-10k a day. Easy. Depends on how aggressive the salesman is. <br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
I can't honestly see our alchemy throwing everything out of whack in it's current state. It would take a collosal act of ignorance to put potions out there that actively disrupt and disturb the balance between players. <br />
<br />
Please make alchemy fun.<br />
Please make alchemy useful.<br />
Please make alchemy beneficial.<br />
<br />
Not so hard?<br />

<br />
If I remember correctly, tempers are brewed, howabout making at lest some tempers/components made via alchemy only?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>ShamanPlayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">:D  I don't know what ye other shamans been doing, but some of the old Alchemy has been revived!  Such as an Enduring Breath(Vox's Vitality) and Levitate(Gulon's Impunity) that do not require components... Sure they cost a bit per attempt, but if you are patient and purchase the ingredients from Mydi in Shar Vahl then it is not too bad... <br />
In fact I sell back potions to the same vendor for close to what the component cost me(within 1-2PP)<br />
<br />
When I auctioned in the Bazaar that I had non component required EB and Lev I had quite a few tells.  :) and sold what I had. AT A PROFIT!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Claritin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">1.) Reduce cost of reagents<br />
2.) some potions with new and most importantly STACKABLE effects... focus effects are a great idea... how about a 5% stackable DD focus that costs 80PP to make... they would be great for raids... and even for exp.<br />
3.) Twinking... Twinking is a major issue with potions yes I know some of you are debating that... but it's the truth.  There IS a fix though... Make potions go in the ammo slot... put a level restriction to equip them... make them only clickable when equipped like an illusion mask... PRESTO fixed!  However an even better solution... add a Potion inventory slot... you added a &quot;Charms&quot; Slot for the new expanion coming out... how about a potion slot works like Ammo with the features I just talked about.... and maybe a potion bag that works like a quiver making sure your potions are always at hand for &quot;potion addicts&quot;?  Then make a command line trigger /drink to drink a potion... or even better /drink 1 to /drink 6 where it will automatically swap in a potion from a specific slot in your bag into the new potion slot THEN drink... make the bag lore so you can't have more than 1 to avoid bag slot # glitches.<br />
<br />
Just a few ideas I am tossing out there... I play many classes and I have worked on a few trade skills.. I think I know what is over powering and what isn't... and how to counteract the overpowering problems.  I hope these soltuions make some sort of sense to someone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>schulerta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Alchemy in it's current state stinks. <br />
<br />
1: It should be completely revamped to where potions made emulate spells. The highest level of spell that an alchemist could create would be dependant on their level. <br />
<br />
2: In order to facilitate this, they should include a mechanism to enable casters to scribe scrolls, make it a skill that is learned by Int casters at 1st level, Wis casters at 5th level. Hybrids don't get the ability. <br />
<br />
     2a: These scrolls would then be used in the creation of potions. <br />
<br />
     2b: They could also be used as a right click item that is used up. Increase casting time over the standard version of the spell. <br />
<br />
     2c: Scrolls made by a shaman, could be used by another shaman, but not by any other class (and so on). You wouldn't be able to use a scroll that is too high level for you to cast. No level limit  on creating scrolls. <br />
<br />
3: Alchemy would then also be opened up to all casters (no hybrids).<br />
<br />
4: Get rid of all the roots and herbs and crap, and introduce some kind of potion solvent similar to the poison making solvent. They could even introduce different degrees of quality solvents. One for a certain spell level range, another for a different level range. In some container, you combine a vial, the scroll of the potion you wish to make, and the solvent. Voila! Potion is ready or Poof! you lack the skill.<br />
<br />
5: Certain spells should not be allowed to become potions. Buffs yes, DD spells no. Healing, resist cold/fire/etc, SOW, Spirit of Scale and so on. A class like Necro would have very little use for alchemy. The shaman would still have a great deal of use for it. Rez shouldn't be in potion form though. A good level cap for potions would be 49. Anyone would be able to use a potion, unlike the scrolls.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>bromboor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">The potions as they are are good. It is not the potion, it is the cost to make it.<br />
<br />
My on earth would I spend 50p on a single, rather detrimental, regeneration potion? How about 5p for a +5str/dex potion that lasts less then 30 minutes? Thats at cost!!!!<br />
<br />
Until they fix the pricing, there is no real alchemy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Give us potions that buff all the resists <br />
<br />
There's already one of those. Blade leaf + beltherium bark (+10 to all saves). It's not cheap though...62.9 platinum per dose.<br />
<br />
they've had issues with getting any new potions approved by the powers that be. (i.e., too strong, steps on some other class's toes by doing something they do, only better, cheaper, etc.)<br />
<br />
They dont seem to have a problem whoring out our shaman abilities to other classes.</div></div><hr />
