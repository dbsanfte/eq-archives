<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nakorie</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello everyone :D  First time poster, but I've visited the site too many times to count (Wonderful site, DenMom)<br />
<br />
I was wondering if anyone could help me locate these rarities (the fingerbones).  I assume that they drop in Hollowshade Moor, but I've been there the last 3 evenings for a couple hours each time an no luck.  I've killed just about every different type of grimling that I can find (fisherman, herder, lookout, scout, mystic, overlord, soldier, recruit, etc.)  Is there some trick or should I just keep on with the same pattern?  Any help is greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />
P.S. This is for the bone beaded belt in the Shar Vahl quest with Broker Fahaar. :D</div></div><hr />

I am not exactly sure which mob dropped it.  I also killed one or two of the healers behind him so that could be where I saw it.  Unfortunately I didn't know what it was for at the time and destroyed it.  Later that day I started working on my Vah Shir tailoring quest and kicked myself when I found out I needed the finger bones.  I haven't been able to get one since mainly because the grimlings are hardly ever up and the war has been broken for a while (a recent patch may have fixed it, I haven't been back in a couple weeks).<br />
<br />
One other note.  I tried the grimlings in Grimling Forest with no luck.  With some friends' help I AoE'ed a bunch of the grimling camps in hopes for a finger bone without finding one.  I am guessing that those grimlings don't have fingers or something. =)  A friend tells me that the bones drop in the grimling caves in Tenebrous Mnts. though I haven't been there myself.<br />

The problem is that the runts only spawn right after a patch, then stop spawning for some reason.<br />
<br />
I think I got the one I used either from a runt, or from Hollowshade Moor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spihret</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have picked them up ( very rarely ) from the grimlings in the Grimling Forest and I believe even once in Tenbrous.  They are not at all common because I have seen 5 or six in the time it took me to kill thousands of grimlings ( and i do mean thousands ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dedori</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can confirm from personal experience that the fingerbones are a rare drop off grimlings in TM mines.  I say rare drop because in all the time I've spent farming acrylia in those mines I only recall seeing a handful of fingerbone drops (although I have no records to back up that impression).</div></div><hr />

Didn't know of any usefulness to them so destroyed them.</div></div><hr />

I do remember was a rare drop, as so many of the kitty quests from the Moor are.  Just keep trying, and good luck!<br />

<br />
And in T.S from the mines, more from Geomancers I think (again Rare).<br />
<br />
Btw what are these things for ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nakorie</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you all for replies.  I'm still killing every grimling I can find in Hollowshade (no luck yet, though :( )  I guess I'll just keep at it until I get one.<br />
<br />
Bennan, they are for a tailoring quest for Vah Shir resulting (eventually) in a nice tunic (for leather classes, anyway  :) )</div></div><hr />
