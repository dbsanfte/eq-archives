Let me know here or in game if you'd like to sell!<br />

<br />
In a recent merchant mining expedition, I managed to pick up 132 of these little gems.  I have them on one of my sales mules this morning, marked up to provide a healthy profit.  If you are interested in bulk, however, I'm willing to deal to move them out and make room for the leather padding my chars are accumulating.</div></div><hr />

Send me a PM if you'd like to buy or contact me in game if you still want more. Otherwise they goto a vendor!</div></div><hr />

I've still got a little over 2 stacks left, but at only 10p per essence, I've been having a hard time keeping them in stock.  I'll probably have Zabumule back in trader mode this evening (late).  Since they're moving so well, I think I'll send the boys back out shopping.<br />
<br />
I'd also be willing to trade for some of the other goodies I can't readily get my hands on (coiled springs, hero parts and other planar food stuffs, etc.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vendors will not purchase these items.<br />
<br />
And the stats aren't good enough to generate many player sales. So I'm looking at 20pp+ per combine at this point, that I can't recover.<br />
<br />
Planar Steins are not the way to go. Unless you're rich.<br />
