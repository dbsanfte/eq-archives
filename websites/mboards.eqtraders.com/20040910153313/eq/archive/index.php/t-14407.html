<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Velorek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For some reason, I can't recharge my Happy Dragon now. I've never had any problems with it before but I just tried today and I get the &quot;You cannot combine these items in this container type!&quot; message.<br />
<br />
I checked and re-checked that I had the right recipe (Happy Dragon, Saltpeter and Gnomish Firework all inside my Collapsible Toolbox) so not sure what's wrong.<br />
<br />
Anyone else experience this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Which firework did you use?  Only the firework with the Blazing Comet effect works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Velorek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow! I feel really silly now. Honestly though, I had no idea that there were actually 4 different fireworks effects. I thought they were all the same. :confused: <br />
<br />
Thanks for the help. Problem solved. :)</div></div><hr />

Can you recharge a Meterological Rocket somehow as well? From Kritta's recharge guide at the top of this forum page:<br />
<br />
How to Recharge Items <br />
To recharge an item, place item + battery in a toolbox (regular, deluxe or summoned via collapsible toolbox) and click combine. No skill is needed (in other words anyone of any race and any skill [even 0] can combine with no risk of failure).<br />
<br />
