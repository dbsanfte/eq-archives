<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was talking with a friend today...<br />
<br />
I'm currently trying to scrounge up Metallic Substances (from PoF).  I certainly can't go there myself, so I have to rely on others.<br />
<br />
I have friends in three different Time-enabled Guilds.  I have other friends in a couple Elemental-level Guilds.<br />
<br />
It has been said by many Elemental+ level people that Inferno &amp; Livestone Smithed armours aren't worth the trouble to make.  The Elemental+ level Smiths that I know are not making these armours.<br />
<br />
When I asked one of my friends if he could possibly grab some Metallic Substances the next time he or his Guild was going that way, he told me: &quot;Oh, that stuff goes to the Guild Bank&quot;.<br />
<br />
And then what?  It's certainly not sold in the Bazaar!  I asked him if he could buy it out of the Guild Bank for me (I would pay him, of course), but he didn't reply since he was on a Raid and probably very busy.<br />
<br />
So, any of you Elemental+ level people out there have an answer for me?  If it's not getting used (that I can see) and not getting sold (that I can see)... then what happens to it?!?<br />
<br />
Edit:  P.S. It's stuff like this that makes me laugh when Maddoc posted how non-uber tradeskillers would get ahold of stage-2 tradeskill drops in GoD...  That just doesn't happen very often!</div></div><hr />

Well it depends on the guild and the server. <br />
<br />
The real elemental guilds, those who are still working on farming elementals for gear and didn't kill all 4 elemental gods thus not in PoTime yet do make BPs and legs because elemental BPs come from PoTime and elemental legs are a rare drop from elemental gods thus they need tradeskill items for those slots.<br />
<br />
Depending on how crowded the server is and how rare the elemental mold droppers are they might make stuff for other slots too.<br />
<br />
Now if you are talking about guilds who been in the elemental planes for over 8 months and did some massive elemental mold farming and already in PoTime or one kill away from it they probably won't bother with Inferno and Livestone.<br />
<br />
I'm in an elemental guild and have RL friends in another one and both guilds do make Inferno and Livestone stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KanadWinterstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can tell you truthfully, in our 6 months raiding fire and the other elementals we've killed maybe a handful of the magma guardian model mobs... certainly no more than 20. With a good bard or monk you can pull any named mob in that zone without touching anything else, and the mobs that spawn during the fennin event don't drop metallic substance. This is a huge departure from going to earth and doing rings, where you're forced to kill all the various mob types in huge numbers (an average night of doing rings in earth nets us 10 elemental stones, for example) or Water where the trash sees invis and you have to kill it to pull mobs like Offassa and Hydrotha.<br />
<br />
For raiding guilds and making armor it's all about what is killed during guild time... people exping in a zone on non guild time aren't going to give those pieces to the guild, they're going to keep them for their own use or sell them. Metallic Substance doesn't drop off the mobs we kill in fire on guild time, hence we have none in the vault and have never made a piece of Inferno plate or chain.</div></div><hr />
