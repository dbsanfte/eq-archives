<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">cannot be brewed on al'kabor to my knowledge. even with 220 smithing (hardly anyone has gotten there yet anyway) and 220 brewing i think you still need to be flagged as killing terris thul (what alla said) and since flagging is broken i doubt thatll happen soon. sad, sounds nice to carry a stack around that last twice as long as normal ones.<br />
<br />
any of this inaccurate?<br />
<br />
additionally i can brew constitutionals as well as any other high end drink available on our server. my tradeskills are below, usually charge about 2X price for brewed stuff.<br />
<br />
250 brewing, 200 fishing, 200 baking, 200 fletching, 190 pottery<br />
<br />
send tell to pazuzu or PM me on here or eqmac for trades, can do most solstice combines (less the tailoring, smithing, and star ruby steins which fail often).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arghargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From what I've experienced, the combines aren't tied to flags at all.  Whether Aid Grimmel will give you the next part of the quest is.  <br />
<br />
Are you trying to use the portable bew barrel the Grimmel gives you?  It only works in a taanan brew barrel.</div></div><hr />
