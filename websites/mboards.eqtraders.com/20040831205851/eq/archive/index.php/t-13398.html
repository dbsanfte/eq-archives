<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Archangelz24</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">To do the newbie armor quest for barbarian warrior talk to one of the men in the pit of doom.  Im not positive on the name but he's the only guy in the pit of doom without the words Warrior Guildmaster under his name.  Simply hail him and he will say something along the lines of &quot;Are you a warrior here for your [training]?  If not bugger off(or something to that nature).<br />
<br />
Say 'what training?'<br />
<br />
He'll tell you the training involves crafting of [armor].<br />
<br />
Say 'what armor'<br />
<br />
I think at this point you get the northern wolf plate assembly kit.<br />
<br />
He'll then tell you what pieces you can make-[armplates] [bracers] [legplates] [gauntlets] [boots] [helm] [breastplate].<br />
<br />
To get the mold for each one say 'i want to craft bracers/legplates/etc.'<br />
<br />
In order to make the item you must gain the ingredients(recipes for each one at end of guide) and place them-UNSTACKED-in the northern wolf plate assebly kit and hit combine.  Once you have the material put the material and it's appropriate mold in a forge and combine.  I don't have the exact statistics for each piece of armor but they raise strength, stamina, and (maybe) agility.  Also the breastplate is a lightsource so you can dump the torch.<br />
<br />
The quest giver will also say at the end of telling you what pieces of armor that you can make that he has a [final task] for you to accomplish once you get done with the armor.<br />
<br />
Say what final task and he'll tell you to travel to blackburrow and get him two perfect gnoll skins and two giant snake rattles.<br />
<br />
I don't know at the moment what the reward is for doing this but I assume it's a weapon of some kind.  That is just an guess though.<br />
<br />
Recipes:<br />
<br />
Legplates- 1 small piece of ore, 2 ruined wolf pelts, 1 bone chip, 1 spiderling leg, 1 patch of gnoll fur<br />
Bracers- 1 polar bear skin, 1 small piece of ore, 3 bone chips<br />
Boots- 2 small pieces of ore, 1 polar bear skin, 1 spiderling leg<br />
Helm- 2 small pieces of ore, two bone chips, one gnoll pup scalp<br />
Armplates- 1 small piece of ore, two ruined wolf pelts, one bone chip<br />
Gauntlets- 1 small piece of ore, 1 ruined wolf pelt, 4 bone chips<br />
Breastplate- 3 small pieces of ore, two ruined wolf pelts, 1 spider venom sac</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">do you really get skillups from this recipe?  doesn't seem tradeskill related.  just quest related.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kentarre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My little barb shammy just did her newbie armor, and yes, you do get skillups for the combines in the forge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>OutcastAssassin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What's the Triv on these newb armors? If its anything significant, maybe it could be used as a Skillup Route for Smithing (and Tailoring for thsoe caster newb armors).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Archangelz24</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I do not know the triv on these items but I would not suggest it as a route.  I think all the items have a LORE NO-DROP mold AND my skill only went up 2 points and I did all the pieces.  It will take you forever but if you have a lot, let me repeat A LOTof time on your hands and huge amounts of patience try it and let me know what the trivial is on it.  We may have found a glitch to get to 250 in smithing w/o expensive materials.  Oh i just thought of something, the only item that would not have a LORE mold is the bracer, but it may have LORE components.  If you find out plz let me know. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Archangelz24</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hehe.  I just looked at my own beginning to this thread*embarassed*.  The bracer does not have any LORE components so you could figure out the triv easy by crafting those.  Btw the only hard component to get is the polar bear skin which is a rare drop off polar bear cubs and maybe uncommon off polar bears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Pyrus_darkmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Did this quest the other day with my lvl 5 warrior on fironia vie, it took me about 4 hours from helm to sword. It was the poler bear skins that took so much time, thay do drop from the cubs but its like 1 in 25 kills.<br />
