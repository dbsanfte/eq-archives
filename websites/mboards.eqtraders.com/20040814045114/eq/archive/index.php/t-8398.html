<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I seem to remember reading somewhere, a long time ago, that someone was setting up tradeskill recipes in a palm database (pdb).  I started messing around with a hand-held when someone turned it in last week, and something like that would prove most useful.<br />
<br />
Anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Looks like it's up to me.  Using Web2Doc Beta3 (Freeware) (http://home.netvigator.com/~clarenho/Web2Doc) and pointing at some of the pages here, I was able to come up with a crude but useable .prc file for some of the recipe pages.  <br />

I need to do some more research and see if these can be cleaned up any, but meanwhile, they work.</div></div><hr />

If you could see my desktop -- all the printouts, the maps, the quest info (there's even NON-EQ stuff!) -- you'd understand then.  <br />
<br />
Anything to get a few pounds of paper off the surface!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>lonewylfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just use folders and those ingame things that stick it in the story window.<br />
Makes my life easier :)<br />
<br />
edit: like those 3-ring folders, not computer desktop folders, lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just use folders<br />
<br />
To my left are two 5 drawer file cabinets.  The middle drawer, closest to me, is half full of manilla folders.  I'm constantly pulling some out, putting some back.  However, certain things (like recipes) never get put away.<br />
<br />
Now, ambiant light permitting, I know where to find them at a glance.  <br />
<br />
YMMV<br />
<br />
Come to think of it, this would be a good place to put a list of quest gems, to help determine what is vendor fodder (we were nearly encumbered with all the gem drops in SG the other night.)</div></div><hr />
