<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anidazen</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 05:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yay! I finally finished Master Wu's armour. (I am a 158 skill tailor on Luclin). I am a level65 Magician as well.<br />
<br />
And now I am looking at how to progress.<br />
<br />
As I see it the choices are:<br />
<br />
Acrylia armour - not even gonna consider this if posisble not to.<br />
<br />
Arctic Wyvern armour - Wyvern skins not too hard to get, about 60pp in other costs per combine buying the tempers from thurg.<br />
<br />
Cobalt Drake armour - same as above but with Drake Skins not Wyvern.<br />
<br />
Soft Fur padding - this is one im thinking of doing untill its trivial at 176, just 1 silver thread and 1 velium hound fur. I can kill the hounds solo but its not as easy as I would like, and they are hard to find... so quite a pain but at least not expensive. Biggest drawback is no track.<br />
<br />
Shaded Hide armour - as far as I could see this needed 2 main parts, shade silk which is easy to get, and hides off the mind worms in Akheva, can anyone tell me how hard these would be for me to farm solo.<br />
<br />
Othmir Fur armour - An othmir fur cap simply needs 2 othmir furs a silver thread and a vial that costs 13pp to make if you have a pet enchanter, so propably bazaar price 20pp. This sounds like a good idea, but killing othmirs lowers faction is only main concern.<br />
<br />
Or for a little more expense (don't know how hard farming is though) I can do it with Holgresh furs, but this needs platinum thread.<br />
<br />
Please can somone give me advice on this, I am prepared to spend time farming and don't have THAT much cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Liwsa</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cheapest is acrylia armor if you farm components yourself.  <br />
Rockhopper pelts in Dawnshroud(static spawns in one cave), scarlet desert, or Mons Letalis.  Superb pelts are for studded acrylia trivials at 188.  Flawless pelts for reinforced trivials at 240(245 forget which now).<br />
Acrylia(small bricks = bonings for reinforced and pieces = studs for studded) various zones in Luclin check other post for locations, are enough of them(posts I mean).<br />
temper is brewed component is like 2pp each.<br />
<br />
Remember if hunting for acrylia that blocks and bricks can be broken down into the next lower brick/piece using a chiesel and block/brick in forge(no temper needed).<br />
Block breaks down to large brick<br />
large brick breaks down to small brick<br />
small brick breaks down into 2 pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anidazen</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, I tried farming Velium Hounds earlier, killed about 9 and got 3 furs. They were not too much trouble but almost always found me before I found them, and did about 1 bub hp to me (unbuffed) before my pet got chance to hit them and take aggro. Eventually I decided that I didn't like all these monsters that wanted to kill me and could easily do so, so I gated out, but might go back again.<br />
<br />
Out of 3 combines 2 were successful and 1 gave a skill up. The soft fur padding they make is used in 8th shawl which im nowhere near yet but none-the-less worth saving.<br />
<br />
I was kind of hoping to avoid acrylia though, as people always say how annoying it is and everything, but I will try acrylia masks and perhaps wyvern masks tomorrow.  :)</div></div><hr />

1 Postive Othmir Faction.<br />

So kill the little otters until you are a 250 tailor, then go Kill ulthorks until the Otters love you again.<br />

I will propably head over to CS and farm everything in sight except named Wyverns. Otter faction can be repaired (easily?) and it seems like a way to get tailoring up for about 20pp per combine (bazaar price) which is cheaper than some Wu's combines I have done.</div></div><hr />

I do sometimes produce an alternate product, however:<br />

<br />
Tailoring is already an expensive tradeskill.  If you purchase your components, you're TRIPPLING your cost.<br />
<br />
If you choose to farm your own, go the Acrylia Studded route till it trvials out at 188.  After that, switch to Acrylia Reinforced and throw in some Arctic Wyvern now and then.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zebroxks</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldnt recommend acrylia. I have been farming acrylia in Tene mtns for about 13 hours and got enough acrylia to do 20 combines so =( and im farming both caves non stop no downtime</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ed146</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From 158 I went straight to 250 making solstice robe.<br />
<br />
<br />
Took me 3 weeks total to get to 250 if you have enough plats  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anidazen</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 04:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What kind of plat is needed for the solistice robes?<br />
<br />
And farming definatley does keep costs down, but perhaps farming plat and buying off people that already have be better if the price is right?<br />
<br />
Can you say where I should farm as well, eg. Rockhoppers in DSP etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pockets FullOfGold</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 06:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While farming Acrylia may be a slow process, it can be very profitable.  Most of the Grimlings I've ever gotten Acrylia off of have dropped items that are stackable that range anywhere from 9 CP to 114 PP.  I three seperate 6 hour periods farming Acrylia in TM I've made over 1k PP by running into Katta when my bags got full and running back to the cave before someone else moved in.  Yes I have lost the Laborer cave doing this, but it's been well worth it in my estimation.  But then I'm not racing to get to 250.  I'll get there sometime.  It takes longer to farm Rockhopper Hides than it does farming Acrylia.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prizzle</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 08:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Worked on soltice robes also.<br />
<br />
- 250 JC + 5% making the gem studded chain I fail 50% of the time. Given the cost of material per combine is around 250 plat, that yields 500 plat per chain. Luckily this isnt destroyed on robe failures.<br />
<br />
- I buy silk in bazaar for 5 plat or less (or 10 plat or less for swatches).<br />
- Emeralds cost 13,5 plat a shot and must be imbued (make friends with Tunare cleric or druid)<br />
- Making the sacred tunare silk involves making emy dust (needs celestial essence ~ 1,5 plat self made)<br />
<br />
- Given the fact you loose 5% to minimum failures for the dust and tunare silk combines, U can say that a dust costs around 16 plat (13,5 + 1,5 + 5%) and the silk 29 plat (10 + 16 + 1,5 + 5%)<br />
<br />
- U need 3 silks per combine, so that's 90 plat. Round it to 100 if you donate for imbues or buy imbued emeralds.<br />
<br />
Given the high triv point, you will have the 5% minimum success rate up until 210 220 skill. 20 combines cost you 2000 plat, unless you farm silk. On my server (Terris Thule) robes sell around 1k. So this would yield a cost of 1000 plat per 20 combines (without farming silk), unless you are very unlucky and get zero successful combines.<br />
<br />
PS: I neglected material costs less than a plat piece or one time investments such as the needle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anidazen</div><div class="date">02-04-2003, 04:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok after realising soft fur padding is NOT for skill ups without track, seeing the drop rate on Othmir Furs and Acrylia components I think I will just do Solistice Robes and farm pp maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anidazen</div><div class="date">02-18-2003, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Started on Solistice Robes, got to 174 skill quite well.... had 2 successes too which is kind of annoying and kind of cool as they can sell for 1.8k on Luclin. If anyone can suggest any way to get some money back though, I would be grateful.</div></div><hr />
