<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am getting a Gnome alt to lvl 16 and I am starting Tinkering.<br />
I am new to all Trade Skills.<br />
What other Trade Skills should I level up first before I start Tinkering? What Skill Level should I get these other Trades to before i start to Tinker?<br />
Is it a good idea to do this since I hear other items are needed as ingredients for Tinkering, so I should work on my other Trades first.<br />
Should I get Tailoring, Brewing , Smithing and Fletching all to skill 125 first? What about Pottery?<br />
Please let me know before I begin.......or can I just start Tinkering with my other Trade Skills at zero?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>piting</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can most certainly start Tinkering with other trade skills at zero! But eventually, other trades come into 'play'.<br />
<br />
I think the first other trade you may need is Fletching. The Catapult (Triv 135) uses a Bow. I think smithing is probably the other trade most used - but a skill level around 50 would probably be fine...<br />
<br />
But, you could decide to do brewing geerloks (Triv 215) all the way! They are cheap (~3p per attempt) but they require you spend lots of time in the Netherbian Lair zone (mobs ~Lv25) (or spend plat in bazaar) getting Porous Mineral Blocks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you want to make collapsibles I'd recommend getting your smithing up to 60-70 range to make skewers and folded sheets. Other than that it's quite possible to do your tinkering without other trades. My gnome has only increased her smithing to go with the tinkering. I did skip catapults though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Some basic smithing is useful too, as you may want some metal bits or skewers at some point in your progress.  <br />
<br />
An alliance with a fletcher is very useful, so you can partner with someone or do it yourself.  You need them, they need you, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rainingdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have found so far that I wanted...<br />
Fletching to 148 for the Shaped Ashwood Bows<br />
Pottery to 31 for jars<br />
Smithing to 33 for folded sheet meatal</div></div><hr />

I'd comment in agreeance, but it'd walk the line that denmum has repeatedly ask us not to.<br />
