<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Alfhild</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As part of a list of suggestions to improve the Rangers class, a number of Rangers are advocating changes to Elemental Bows (e.g.. making them no-drop and/or decreasing their stats).

<br />
Nevermind the ramifications to tradeskilling, they're actually begging to have their archery skill nerfed by having the bows nerfed, which is truly insane.  How do they justify the thought that the stats on the Elemental Bows are overpowering?  What kind of BS are the numbskulls in their uber guilds feeding them to make them think that their bows are too good?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well think about it. They are elemental class weapons. They are tradeable. This means they are obtainable by rangers who are not in elemental planes. Other classes (say rogues) do not get such nice weapons tradeable. Its really not fair. I wouldn't have made them as good as they are in the first place. Or perhaps made them No Drop. Its too late to nerf them now though.</div></div><hr />

Um aren't those bows useable by all bow classes? Or by elemental bows, are we not referring to stonewood, featherwood, etc?</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's referring to rangers, using the bow, as their main form of attack since a meleeing ranger is mostly a gimped warrior in range of DPS.<br />
<br />
Sure rogues, warriors, etc can use the bows, but we're more for stats than actual using them like a ranger will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cragzop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Before you say they're not overpowered, sometime look at a parse of what an EQ, AM3 ranger can do with a featherwood (24/24 with a 75 point dd and stun). The bow is 63 recommended and 61 required. <br />
<br />
If archery is an option (and I know that not all encounters have that available because of mob positioning etc) there is nothing that's even close to that damage. It is way out of balance.<br />
<br />
A ranger with that bow outdamages lvl 65 wizards and has almost no aggro issues. And you buy it. For a comparable rogue weapon you need an iffr - a rare drop off of an elemental god kill. There are no other tradeskill made weapons that are that dominant and even the nuker/dotter pottery focus items are relatively tame.<br />
<br />
Tell me just how that is balanced when it's available at lvl 61 and requires no skill to buy and no other classes have anything comparable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's very simple. It's always the same answer. The ubers don't want anyone else to be uber.

<br />
/agree<br />
<br />
Personally, I think all benefits from PoP should have been usable only in PoP zones.  All items from all the zones no drop, and no tradeskill items made.. that weren't no drop.  A level 65 time flagged individual doing anything ANYWHERE other than PoP = a level 60... with gear modified DOWN to fit a predetermined max for non=PoP content.  <br />
<br />
These people complaining about the bow fail to see that the ENTIRE expansion trvialized virtually all the content prior to it.<br />
<br />
Maybe the elemental bows are a bit overpowered.  I KNOW a mage, bard and cleric trio'ing a veliuos dragon shouldn't happen... but it does.<br />
<br />
Now, they could nerf the bows.. then I think they should track back to who made each bow.. and remove all the plat and items that uber-guilder got for making the bow in the first place... of plat items they got for selling the components.<br />
<br />
.. but, i prefer to agree with Pyraxis.  I've seen it way too much.</div></div><hr />

If the ubers cared that much you wouldn't see any for sale, ever.  Nor would you see any components to make them for sale...ever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a rediculous statement.  <br />
<br />
The components for these bows are not sitting on a vendor at the zone in of each elemental plane waiting for folks with access to buy them.  They have to be farmed.  In many cases the components are rare.  In some cases you will only see the components drop on raids.  <br />
<br />
Should guilds that have access to the elemental planes put up the components for sale to people they dont know before making sure ALL of their members have one?  Think about what you would do before knocking guilds with elemental access.<br />
<br />
I will tell you right now many people with elemental access will never even see a PoF elemental bow since the fiend guts only drop on raids.  PoA bows are going to be rare because it is really not a grind zone.  PoW bows are going to be rare because very few people like to grind in water.  PoE bows are going to be the most common and even then it took me several days of grinding to farm components for 2 attempts at my bow (one failed).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dvinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">65 ranger , eq-am3.<br />
<br />
Yes elemental bows are overpowered.  Are rangers overpowered..please excuse me while I laugh my ass off.  With all the problems inherent to archery, there is no way you can say it's overpowered, plus you need 45 AA points (which is a crapload of AA by the way) to even consider it a combat option.<br />
<br />
Verant has always, and will always cater to uber guilders, this is why the elemental bows were created.  These bows should be absolutely, positively, made no-drop.  It's my belief that no player should be using an elemental bow unless they have access to the elemental planes themselves.  It sickens me to see plat farming type players using stonewoods.  I still use a twisted longbow, because I want to earn what I wield, not play Hi-Lo bazaar seller.   My next upgrade should be either Tallon-Zek bow or the LDoN bow, you won't see my buying any elemental bow that's for sure.<br />
<br />
EQ2 should fix these types of issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">so you dont use elemental armor for stats or ornate for effects?  i know ornate isn't quite ele but still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Iannyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If they weren't intended to be used by people not in those planes, they would be drops, like the bow that drops off of Tallon Zek in Drunder.  <br />
<br />
IMHO- Bows (planar or not) are the perfect model for what player crafted weapons can and should be.  Highly sought after items that are player made.  They have minumum levels on them for a reason, just like cultural armor and planar armors do.<br />
<br />
I don't think that SOE is catering to ubers in this case.  I think that they are catering to the masses who will never see the plane of Fire, but can still use items from it if the player base decides to sell outside.  Basically, stop crying, and learn to share.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">can we see some plane of fire firery weapons?  it takes longer to get the stuff to make my own fiery weapon than to farm for a comparable weapon.  player made weapons are way behind for the most part.  tae ewe black acrylia and ele bows are not the most part.</div></div><hr />

Ianyenn you are a dip**** if you don't think elementals bows cater to ubers.  Ubers are the ones farming the components, making the bows and selling them for ridiculous amounts of money.  All this does is make the rich richer and encourage bazaar mongering from the less fortunate.<br />
<br />
The bow has become a symbol of the desperate, poorly-played, plat scraping ranger in his eternal quest to be uber.   Owning an elemental bow means nothing today, which is why I won't buy one.   <br />
<br />
If you can't understand what I'm talking about, that's your problem.  You probably don't like what I have to say because you're too busy trying to get fithy rich of the same bazaar mongerers saving up for a stonewood.  You like to delude yourself into thinking your'e &quot;sharing&quot;, when in fact you're just holding them up for as much money as you possibly can.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Pesco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The bows were balanced for the zones in which they are obtained... not for the lower teir zones, period.  In Teir 4+ they are balanced, in Teir 3- they are overpowered.<br />
<br />
There is 2 ways to &quot;fix&quot; the elemental bow issue.  Make smithed elemental weapons or nerf the bows in their current state and have some sort of gimp quest or an NPC at the zone ins with a flag check ( non-flagged people cannot do the turnin ) in the elemental planes to turn them back into their current state but no drop.<br />
<br />
Now.. I'm honestly not a fan of putting elemental DPS power into the hands of people in the lower teirs.  If you want to complain about trivalization now.. I'd hate to see it with everyone having elemental weapons. I personally had no real desire to own an ele bow til I stepped foot inside of the plane under my own power.  So I dont think that ele smithed weapons are a good fix unless they do something similar to the quest listed above.  Then I'd be all for Elemental Smithed Weapons.<br />
<br />
It isnt so much an issue of the &quot;Ubers dont want anyone else to be Uber&quot;, but the fact that it is causing balance issues due to broken itemization.  Sure it is broken across the board.. but the elemental bows are one of the best examples of it.  <br />
<br />
And honestly, anyone that thinks it is about Ubers not wanting others to be uber, needs a reality check.  Most of the people that speak on the subject of component farming have no idea what goes on behind the closed doors of the elemantal planes and what is involved in getting to that point, none-the-less obtaining the actual components themselves.  Stonewoods are really the only &quot;grindable&quot; bows, and even then it makes more sense to do the Vine Ring then try to grind those out.  Some things need to be earned, not given, which is what most of the &quot;ubers&quot; out there want everyone else to do.  They earned the right to get the components and they allow you to purchase them.  It is a service and services dont come free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dvinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Pretty good post Pesco but the first sentence of your fourth and fifth paragraph contradict each other :P.<br />
<br />
To illustrate the problem with elemental bows, last night my guild killed Avatar or War.  There were 2 rangers, me and another person who probably has 1/4 of the days played I have.  he declined on War Bow of Rallos Zek (43/45) because he already had a Stonewood (42/37).  I looted it, because it's better than my twisted.  Before PoP, rangers drooled over AoW's bow, now it's just a piece of junk not even worth being awarded.  We're talking about a raid encounter, AoW is still brutal due to his damage output.<br />
<br />
Owning an elemental bow means nothing today.  They should all be made no drop, or at least give them a significant reduction in stats when sold/traded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">and the ele pants or even ornate you bought your ranger aren't much better than avatar leg drops?  just nerfing bows is short sighted.  everything needs rebalanced.  to just do a bit of it breaks things.<br />

we call this mudflation.  :p its everywhere.  bronze armor and banded were good.  now you get laughed at except by true newbies in cloth and tattered.  maybe they've bought leather already.

How can it be mudflation when its no drop?  Do you think blade of carnage gets passed over on loot rolls?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its less of an issue though honestly with some pretty nice point buyable weapons in LDoN (for example 14/19 rogue backstabber that you can put a 2 damage aug in and make it 16/19).<br />
<br />
Notice rangers didn't get much in the way of buyable bows from LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Pesco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Actually.. there is a 40/37 bow obtainable via adventure points.  Not quite a Stonewood / Featherwood, but it is very good considering the effort required for it.</div></div><hr />

Actually, i tend to find my elemental components on vendors... not everyone in uberguilds is smart enough to save all their components.<br />
<br />
Ubers are the ones farming the components, making the bows and selling them for ridiculous amounts of money. All this does is make the rich richer and encourage bazaar mongering from the less fortunate.<br />
<br />
In this part i agree with you; but, PoP was Verants doing.  This happens all the time though, uberguilders do whatever they want.. destroying markets, stealing mobs, eliminating content for others.  LDoN was designed specifically to address some of these problems, but it hasn't addressed all of them.  However while i agree with you on those points, you need to take a chill pill.<br />
<br />
Sure it is broken across the board.. but the elemental bows are one of the best examples of it. <br />
<br />
No, the best example is when elemental flagged groups go around killing ALL the raid mobs designed to be done by level 50-55 characters.  Of course that only happens EVERY TIME those mobs spawn...<br />
<br />
I go back to what i said.. make all PoP items no drop.  Level restrict (including abilities, spells, hps, ac) everyone so NO ONE is above level 60 unless they are in a PoP zone... well.. and the ldon raids, which can be geared directly for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Daikoku Ashikaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I am sure the same complaint was heard when kunark was out, it is the same power growth between 50/60 as it is now between 60-65.  the so called evil ubers were slaughtering the same stuff at level 60 SoL equipment.  from the tank/melee side of thing the biggest change IMO, with pop, is already illrelivent in all older zones.  Armor Class,  it now matters again, no matter how many HP you have in pop a tank with 1250 AC is going to get mauled, where everywhere else 1250 was good,  there is no real diffference in mitagation and avoidance between 1300 ac and the 1900+ I can get now, a mob will miss only so much, they do have minimum amount that they can hit for.<br />
<br />
The pre 60's game is not what it once was it is so much more easy then it was when I started it is not funny,  FG the zone I got 60 in, which was thought of as good XP back then, you have a hard time getting a 55 to go into, the XP is that bad, they do not want to touch it.<br />
<br />
There is not much 50-55 content because progression is part of the underlining design of the game.  They do not want people sitting fat and happy at some point, the goal is to get people to progress and grow, new levels, new AAs, new spells, new gear is all that, 50-55 is to be a path of growth, not a stop off.<br />
<br />
It might be nice to make buggy whips all your life, but most people in the end wanted cars instead, throwing up artificial barriers in EQ would likely have a worse effect for SOE then what went on in the early days of the auto.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Ceinwein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Well, for my 2cp, I'd hate to see Elemental bows get nerfed for a few reasons.<br />
<br />
- I own one. Yes, I am not elemental-capable. Yes, I bought *GASP* this weapon. Just like 90% of players bought a droppable item they could not achieve themselves. If you want to try to come up with some sort of moral arguement against this, you'll have to do better than any of the posts I've seen here.<br />
<br />
- It destroys the viability of 250 Fletching. You managed to make it that far, despite SoE nerfing the skillups. You've spent a ton of pp and a lot of time to do so. Congratulations! You can now make 3k pp selling Nightmarewoods. Or are we suggesting they should be nerfed so only people who have been to PoN can use them? Or better yet, they should be No Drop?<br />
<br />
- Ranger archery is NOT all that and a bag of chips. With all the inherent problems with archery, these bows do not have any sort of unbalancing effect on the game at all. Assuming that SoE did &quot;fix&quot; archery (and this is one reason some Rangers are calling for the nerf) I still do not see them as overpowering. Assuming a Ranger has spent their 52 AAs (EQ - AM3 - Combat Fury3 - FotA3) to become an &quot;Archer&quot; and that they are using Trueshot and they &amp; the mob are standing still, yes Elemental Bows will kick ass. But so will melees with 52 AAs, disciplines, the right conditions and uber droppable weapons. All these bows do is make archery an option for Rangers. <br />
<br />
- It's a nerf. Without an overwhelming arguement in favor (and I have not seen any), I will always oppose taking something away from the players. <br />
<br />
The call to nerf Elemental Bows is coming from two sources. One is classes other than Rangers who envy Rangers having some fun with archery and (god forbid) maybe outDPSing them in certain ideal situations. The other is from high-level Rangers who hope that by offering up Elemental Bows on the sacrificial altar, SoE will either fix archery (LoS, Walling, Autoattack, etc) or up the melee DPS of Rangers to compensate. Neither of these two arguements, in my opinion, outweigh the reasons not to nerf as I and others have presented.<br />
<br />
So get yer greasy mitts off my Stonewood!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes there is... It can be augmented with a 3 dmg aug to make it 40/36. ( Sorry, I was off by 1 delay )<br />
<br />
The idea of special coding content to max out at level 60 is insane.  I dont know what happens on other servers, but for the most part, things that arent PoP Teir 3 Flag Mobs, PoP Teir 4+, LDoN Raids, or VT Key Required are pretty much left alone by the ele guilds where I am from unless one of the guild takes on a massive backflagging effort.  <br />
<br />
There is plenty of content for people non-elemental.  The issue is people are so worried about the &quot;evil ubers&quot; or they want so bad to be one that mid-level guilds just dissolve.  And also.. there was never much content for the 50-55 crowd... most of it was geared for 55-60 at its origins ( Old World Encounters excluded ofcourse ). Sure there is &quot;crawl raid&quot; content, but not many single mobs were ever designed for 50-55.  There is that content now BECAUSE of mudflation.  Even when the level cap was still 60, content was twisting its acceptable level due to mudflation and it continues to do so with the level cap at 65 through the power of the Bazaar and LDoN gear.<br />
<br />
The issue with Elemental Bows is they create this warping of balance from Teir 1 to Time for the Ranger Class. There are no Bazaar weapons on the caliber of elemental weapons... so why are there bows?  There are LDoN Weapons are close to ele weapons, but you have to put forth some effort for those.<br />
<br />
People are just freakin because when they hear &quot;nerf&quot; they think the item will become useless.  Far from it.  They can nerf the ele bows to still be viable in Teir 3- til you are capable of making the turn in for the ele bow in its current form.  Heck, you can even put the upgrade quest mob in Sol Ro's Tower if you'd like.  There is a good bit of effort in getting that, almost as much as eles.<br />
<br />
But all of this is basically pointless, the bows will remain as they are forever.  Why? Not because of game balance or anything like that. But because too many people would be upset with the change at this point regardless of what it fixed.</div></div><hr />

Coming up with the money to buy a bow is more dificult for the average ranger then what  effoft it takes the average knight to get one of these, so I have yet to see why these are out of balance compaired  with what is availlbe to other classes.  add for monks the rebb, which does take flagging,  but is like another 4 group encounter.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Loviotor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">As a level 65, EQ/AM3 and a whole lot of other AA's ranger, I would have to say that anyone thinking that a bow is overpowered or unbalancing, needs to play a ranger to the level and AA count that is required for that type of damage output.  Even then, it is purely situational.<br />
<br />
Half the raid mobs that you will go against either end up walled (which requires proper positioning on the part of the ranger to get a shot off) or cornered (which means that we cannot even use our bow, in most cases, and have to simply go full melee).<br />
<br />
The trivial level of the bows is very high, making failure always possible.  Although I have a very high combine rate on elementals (mainly stonewoods), I still failed on my first combine for myself, after successfully combining them 12 times for other people.<br />
<br />
As for any one set or series of items making anything trivial in lower zones or other expansion zones, that is to be expected.  As the game progresses, otherwise they would have to change everything in the previous expansions to meet the level of difficulty of the newest expansion.  With this, it's a double edged sword, and no matter what they do, there will always be people who are not going to be happy about something.<br />
<br />
All the rangers that I have talked to, and other classes, as well, have similar complaints.  Line of sight when raiding major mobs is a pain.  You can graphically see the mob, yet are unable to hit it due to game geometry, causing the game engine to &quot;think&quot; that the mob is in a position that they cannot be seen/hit from.<br />
<br />
What's with the &quot;your target is too high/low&quot; when firing a bow...  As an experienced bow hunter, in the real world, that statement is ridiculous.  If I am sitting in a tree 30 feet DIRECTLY above my target (deer/elk/whatever) I would have a MUCH better chance of hitting it, than if I were doing a straight on shot across a field.<br />
<br />
I can see by the varying opinions here, that this is an arguement that won't likely die anytime soon, however, I hope to at least have given some good points for discussion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Cerpicio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Speaking of dropable, crafted, elemental gear, what about the Ceramic items you can make with pottery?  Spell Haste IV, Mana Pres. IV, Extended Range IV, Improved Healing IV, etc, etc.  Should those be nerfed too?  I think they have even lower level requirements than the bows.  And more classes can use them, too.  And you don't have to be EP flagged to get them.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying bows or the ceramic items should be nerfed, I'm just pointing these out as an example.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">The obvious difference being that they are useable by all classes... while bows are only effectively used by rangers.<br />
<br />
But you knew that right?<br />
<br />
The arguement is NOT that they are unbalancing in the absolute... only in the relative. In that they are unbalance as primary weapons for one class when other classes do not have equivalent tradeable primary weapons.<br />
<br />
They won't change it though... its too late now to do anything about it. And as I said before, they partially fixed the class imbalance by providing some very nice LDoN weapons for other classes.<br />
<br />
The 16/19 piercer from LDoN is the about best you can get until Fennin Ro for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Daikoku Ashikaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Most Ssra weapons beat LDoN 2hdrs  for knights.<br />

<br />
PS Unbalancing how?, if anything, they bring the play field a little more in balace with the availibilty of weapons for other classes off of mobs which are far from uber, are just farm mobs.<br />
<br />
is it just the limiting factor is plat as opposed to having an enc friend and a cleric/druid one, with a few fillers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Iannyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">One thing that I see as a viable solution is to have 2 versions of an elemental bow.  The first kind is the crafted, existing droppable kind.  The second, would be taking the droppable bow to an NPC in the elemental plane from whece it came, and doing a quest/turnin (say 500pp to buy an Earthen fletching kit from the NPC, put the bow, an earthen temper, and 2 celestial essence [everything else uses it, why not this] and hit combine to recieve an Earthcrafted Stonewood Compound bow, with improved dam/delay, and maybe better range or a nasty proc, and the NODROP tag.  Much like an augmentation, but one that can only be recieved by someone zoning into PoEarth and making it to the NPC alive...<br />
<br />
Of course thats all theory.  But I like the idea.</div></div><hr />

Tunare bless you Lilosh!  What an excellent way to put it.  I take back everything I've ever said about Halflings.  Except Halfling rangers, won't ever take back what I've said about them. :p  <br />
<br />
Great example, especially with the pottery.  Just to pull a random comparrion:  Ceramic Incense Burner of Ro (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=29031) vs. Stonewood Compound Bow (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=29597).  Anyone else see what I see?  Burner: required level of 46 (don't even need PoP expansion to use) and no recommended level.  Compared to required of 61, recommended of 63 on all the elemental bows.<br />
<br />
Speaking as a ranger who has bought an elemental bow, why shouldn't I be able to have one?  I saved the money to afford it (you know how hard it is to say to yourself &quot;OK, I've got 50k in the bank, I'm halfway there... but, oooh, how far 50k could skill me up.&quot;, and then not follow through with the temptation?).<br />
<br />
To reinforce a comment made earlier, other than the elementals being sellable, what is there for a high end fletcher?  Cultural bows?  Riiight.<br />
<br />
Another point:  they only become &quot;overpowered&quot; :rolleyes: with a pretty hefty AA investment.  45 AA's isn't hefty to you or other uber-guild rangers?  Well it is to me, and many others, who for any number of reasons don't have the time/resources/access to the &quot;uber-AA farming zones&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Dvinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">You misunderstand my AoW bow comments.  Back in the day, when the AoW bow was the first or second best bow in the game, it was VERY difficult to obtain.  Only the top guilds on each server would loot them.<br />
<br />
Today, the best bow in the game (stonewood), is easily available to any idiot with enough platinum.  That's the problem, the top bow in the game should not be droppable...period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Daikoku Ashikaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Back in the day AoW used to be a threat, now he is a pick up encounter for  the bored.   Done 5 guild pick up raids, people from 5 guilds doing it on a dull night before server reset.<br />
<br />
compairing  2  expanssion old equipment to current is sad.<br />
<br />
And I do not see any issue with  nonelemental people having access to them.  and there is the time bow, since they added the archery mod to it,,  stonewood is not the est in the game.<br />
<br />

I do not see where someone works and saves pp makes them something less then  some short timer newbie raider picking up rott oot before getting the boot for slackiness. 80-125k  pp does not just grow on trees.  <br />

Stonewoods sell for 60k on my server.  Every 60-65 ranger in my guild has one.  It only takes a few days farming acrylia or spider silks to make that money.  It's a farce.<br />

Don't give me some crappola about time bows, how many rangers on each server do you think actually raid time.<br />
