<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've found out this is a great zone for pelts.<br />
<br />
Bears and wolves are an easy kill for me at 52 (but 2-3 adds can make me bite my nails a bit).<br />
<br />
The cats are tough, probabaly a higher con than alla (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=235) lists them.<br />
<br />
THe really nice thing is the high drop rate of quality pelts (for all 3).  After an hour or two, I had 10LQ, 6MQ, 10HQ wolf pelts, 1LQ, 2HQ cat pelts (only killed 4 or 5), and 7LQ, 11 MQ&lt; 3 HQ bear skins.<br />
<br />
Not bad, but I wouldn't recommend it for antyone under level 50, possibility of adds are high and so far the Wayfarer's haven't been any help.<br />
<br />
So, if you're a last tailoring starter, this may be a good zone to stock up on the usualy extremely over priced bear and wolf pelts (I'd still suggest Stonebrunt or EK for cat pelts).<br />
<br />
Many low level anacondas there, too, but no siginificant drops that I've noticed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good information, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm trying to spend a lot of my spare time now, easy access from any LDoN camp, not many people in the zone now, and usualy a bunch of 60+ toons who don't care (or at least it seems) about all the no-exp green bears and wolves running around.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this zone won't become overcamped like Rathe Mtns. are now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taeyn Kaidyrsi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nedaria's Landing is great for pelts.  But ... it is also good for exp in the 30s.  My Enchanter went from 34 to 39 in Nedaria fairly quickly with dark blue animals.  I'm debating EW or Nedaria for my 33 Necro.<br />
<br />
Northern Basilisks, Grizzlys, Serene Griffawns, and Panthers were dark blue at 34/35, with an occassional white or yellow.  When the bears turned light blue, I moved her south.  The Serene Griffawns below the drop are higher level than the northern griffs.  At 39, the griffs are turning light blue, but the Panthers are mostly still dark blue.<br />
<br />
Anacondas and Basilisks are non aggressive with or without wolf form.  Cats, wolves, and griffs are non aggressive to wolf form.  Bears remain aggressive. Frogs and turtles become aggressive.<br />
<br />
Surprised me that bears remained aggressive as wolf form made Jaggedpine bears non aggressive.<br />
<br />
Animals are not social, but they are highly aggressive.  In wolf form, my Enchanter pulls cats across other cats without adds.<br />
<br />
Animals are not aggressive to druids, so do not discount Nedaria for experiencing if you are a druid.</div></div><hr />
