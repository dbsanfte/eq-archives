Anyone there want to help me out?<br />

Depending on what's needed I may do a Cleric or Druid depending on the need...</div></div><hr />

There are a fair number of tradeskillers on FV, but more are always welcomed.  I've played off and on as various characters, and high level smithing is strongly prized, especially various brands of cultural (human, barbarian, and dwarven, for example), and we still only have a couple Grand Master tailors that I know of.  Check out the FV board - http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie under The Tradeskill Shop to see a listing (at least of people who visit the boards) of tradeskillers.  You could also perhaps pose the question of what's needed there...I re-roll on the server often to try all kinds of role play, and never quite get to a high enough level to see what's *really* in demand.<br />
<br />
However, I can say with sureity, that as a Cleric, you'd be welcomed with open arms, as the server is a bit short on Clerics and almost all the guilds are recruiting them at various levels.  There's posts on the main server board at the same above address about this shortage, that might be of interest to you - although since FV is a roleplay-prefered server, anyone interested in making a character there is always encouraged to pick what race and class they'll like *roleplaying* best.<br />

<br />
If you are new to FV there is also a good FAQ in the general section of the message board for Those new to the server and its unique ruleset and community. I hope you enjoy your time on Firiona Vie :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know that there is lack of Iksar Cultural Armor Smiths.<br />
There is an extreme lack of Human Bertoxulous Clerics that can make the bertox cultural.<br />
<br />
I play evil so i tend not to worry about the lightbringers!<br />
<br />
There are a few GM smith evils, including Ogres and Darkelves. Not sure on Trolls.<br />
<br />
Go with what you want to play. Not with what others need! :twisted:</div></div><hr />
