Now,the EQ RPG has a recipe for this one, as follows:<br />
 <br />
Vial of mana, grapes, sugar, yeast, brewing barrel.<br />
 <br />
Seems they might be putting this one in for the October 8th patch of EQ RPG related stuff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ChaseFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Perhaps our Houses could put our differences aside and work in conjunction to solve this, should such a grand recipe begin to work in our world, Hatechild.<br />
<br />
I sleep until the day you mention, but I will strive to waken on that day, and begin working on this recipe.<br />
<br />
/ooc I have great respect for House Do'Ceannai, as the only surviving tradeskill-oriented guild on FV, but I'm heartbroken y'all are dark-bringers. I'm going back to my guild's boards to see if I can have our enchanters craft a few vials of mana to have ready for me. I'll be out-of-game (RL wedding) until 10/8, but I now intend to be back on that day. I'll be keeping a DNC list, and would be happy to compare notes with you.<br />

<br />
...nothing against enchanters, but they already had a lock on the high end of almost every tradeskill  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
…plus, the cost for mana vials might just go through the roof due to high demand and those tradeskillers who already need mana vials to make their goods will be out of luck unless they can chain a chanter in their basement ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
example: I putter in pottery, so I need vials of Clear mana to skillup on unfired idols, and vials of Distilled mana to make Golden Idols of Tunare and the occasional Faithstone.  I stock up and buy these in the bazaar when the price is reasonable as I don’t want to bother the guild chanters too often, and  my itty bitty chanter alt can only make viscous mana and enchanted clay – I could PL my chanter but up til now my time was worth more to me so I just bought mana vials in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
<br />
Time to PL my itty bitty chanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">And yet another death to alchemy if this goes through with that recipe.   Currently we have increase mana pool potions max 100 to mana pool cost around 70pp per combine duration 20 minutes.  &lt;sighs tiredly&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>YurienStonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ok dumb question. is the drinkable mana basically jsut gonna be something to add a small amout of instant mana? if so then it sound slike its going to be an insanely cost to buy them</div></div><hr />

ok dumb question. is the drinkable mana basically jsut gonna be something to add a small amout of instant mana? if so then it sound slike its going to be an insanely cost to buy them  <br />
<br />
-Instant Mana- ?? <br />
<br />
Personally I doubt it will be instant... Drink the potion, and it will take XX Seconds to consume it.<br />
<br />
THEN... it could be <br />
***Poof*** You have XXX added to your mana pool, provided you were not interupted...<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
***Poof*** You now have a Mana Over Time, fast Regen... like XXX per Second Mana Regen for X Seconds.<br />
<br />
But still either way... it will make who ever can create the bottles a large chunk of cash. And I fully expect the prices will get very whacked out by folks trying to take advantage of the new item.<br />
<br />
Will this &quot;improve&quot; the game or make it worse? Personally, from a Pure melee perspective, it will make the already over-powered casters that much more over-powered... leaving us poor Monks and Warriors wondering why are we bothering?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eleena Transient</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Krazick, I think you misunderstand what these do:<br />
<br />
Increase Mana Pool by 100 <br />
<br />
All it will do is allow you to have 100 extra mana (this is the viscous one).  Currently, any spell or item that adds to mana pool ONLY adds to the cap, not your current.  Good way to see it is when you loot your corpse after a death.  I may be fm naked, but with all my gear, I'm only 30-40% because my current is still 1200ish but my pool is up to 4700.<br />
<br />
To give an example, my cleric had a mana pool of about 4700.  Say she went and healed the group and stuff, dropping down to 50% (2350).  She drinks a viscous potion.  For 2 hours, she now caps at 4800.  She 'still' only has 2350, and will regen at the exact same rate.<br />
<br />
Only use I can see for something like this is to hand to the clerics in a ch rotation so they can last a bit longer.  Staring the fight with 5200 vs 4700 (thats at a cost of 4 rubies, so 500pp) would let me go an extra round or 2 of heals.<br />
<br />
Now, if they made them +1 mana / tick to +5 / tick instead of +100 to +500 to pool, Then they'd be useful (and likely over powering).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Delores Mulva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You wouldn't hand this current version to any CH rotation I know of. Look at the stacking conflicts - they conflict with every enchanter mana regen spell with a +pool component (KEI, VoQ, Tranquility, GoB/GoI).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Changed again on test today.  Now they go from 20 mana to 100 mana.  Considering the cost to make the one that gets you 100 mana, I really do not see a viable market for these, unless you are just wanting to throw pp around.<br />
<br />
just my 2cp on it at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>JMorgana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Also, the descriptions on Lucy talk about increasing mana regen rate and INT/WIS as well...these sound like clarity/c2/KEI/Tranq/VoQ potions in terms of how they work.  I don't see these as a &quot;drink one and have mana to get that gate spell off&quot; kinda thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eleena Transient</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The text at the bottom is likely just left overs from where they used an existing spell for the base.<br />
<br />
Boos_01 &quot;I want 5 spells that raise mana pool, make it so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peon_01 copies VoQ 5 times, takes out the regen and int/wis components, doesn't bother with description, doesn't bother with the buff slot +mana is in (hence the conflicts).<br />
<br />
Peon_01 &quot;ok boss, done&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Changed again on Test, according to Lucy.  Now they stack with pretty much everything out there, except for each other, two rather obscure effects, and two shaman potions.</div></div><hr />

Vial of mana, grapes, sugar, yeast, brewing barrel.<br />
 <br />
Seems they might be putting this one in for the October 8th patch of EQ RPG related stuff?  <br />
<br />
Has anyone tried this recipie yet?  Just curious, as I am almost done with Wu's and have about 100 mana vials or so...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The following were DNC in a Tanaan Brew Barrel:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Cedir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It is possible that the combine will return more than one item.  After all, most brewing recipies that make stat-drinks return more than one item.<br />
<br />
We can't &quot;judge&quot; the per-plat value of these until we know how many will be returned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lixivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i dont want to brew potions, i want to brew drinks with mana on them, i think they are going about adding new brewing recipes the wrong way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well, after looking into this a little bit on Lucy, these are found using the spell search.  Now all we need to find out is if it is actually a new spell for chanters(and the rich keep getting richer) or if it is a brewed item with a spell efect when you consume it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grimina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">This is from the new oracle quest.<br />
<br />
Gave Assistant Jeyular a Tome of Miragul and got back a nodrop lore sugar and the following message:<br />
<br />
An auspicious beginning. To reward your start, I will enlighten you with the secret of palatable mana, which is required to create a phylactery, but also has independent uses as well. Brew it like wine, but include a vial of mana as created by the ablest enchanters plus a pinch of this special sugar as well as grapes that can be grown only by the halflings of Rivervale.<br />
<br />
My guess after that is to add wine yeast and a bottle.<br />
<br />
Only part I don't get, is if a person is gonna have to turn in another book for EVERY bottle of mana, or if you could just request more sugar afterwards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Phabos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">So one must travel down to The Hole in order to get this?<br />

Looks like these are not products that are going to be readily accessible to the general population.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">These look like they aren't even supposed to be used, they're part of a quest to make the phylactery, whatever that is.<br />
<br />
It's just a subcombine for a quest, nothing big.  Any potential use of the item specifically is coincidental.</div></div><hr />
