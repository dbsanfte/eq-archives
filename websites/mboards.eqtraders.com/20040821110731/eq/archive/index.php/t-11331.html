Catapults work just fine... they are tricky because the Shaped Ashwood Recurve Bow must have a hemp string.  If it has one of the other 2 strings it DNCs.  When the bow has the wrong string it still has the same name, but if you look at the stats they are different.  The good news is that if you have the wrong bow you can stick it in a fletching kit with a hemp string and combine (no fail triv 16) to get the correct bow.  Restringing the bow even if you buy a fletching kit will cost only about one plat.</div></div><hr />

&lt;signs on to slap a moron n00b&gt;&lt;grin&gt;<br />

I'll confirm that in a couple hours when I can escape the shackles of the office.  I was just in a good mood in POK that day and someone begged me to do a stack of combines for him for the catapults.  Name of ingredients was right, but I didn't know about the string restrictions.  &lt;sigh&gt;   Thanx again for the insight...boy I feel like a moron now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Whizbang_Dustyboots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not a moron -- this is an extremely (even excessively) complex recipe, and it's easy to mess up this part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can confirm that the recipe still works.  My guild is having a party this weekend and I can contribute the leftover fireworks from making more Meteorological Rockets and Happy Dragons for my Bazaar trader.  :)<br />
<br />
I didn't know about the hemp bow string requirement.  I had assumed people used the hemp string because it was the cheapest combination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Whizbang_Dustyboots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just last night, a got a tell saying this recipe was broken -- same problem with hemp string again. EVERYONE makes this mistake at some point. :D</div></div><hr />

My problem was allowing myself to get talked into being a COMBINE clicker.   I told the person that if they would get the materials I would do the clicking, with the understanding that there is always a chance of failure.<br />
<br />
They got me the wrong kind of bow...and I didn't know about the hemp string thing.<br />
<br />
However, I got bit by this twice.  After I DID realize this and notified him (and consequentially did the combine) he was so happy that about an hour I got a /TELL saying something to the effect of..<br />

Ticonadious tells you, &quot;I need you to make twenty more of those Metorological Rockets for me, but I cannot afford to pay for them ok?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">actually there is almost no reason to make a shaped ashwood bow with hemp string other than this apparently.  the most damaging ashwood bow is just the staff and the hemp string.  the quickest is the shaped with silk string.  silk string is much less than a planing tool so if you wanted something in the middle you would add a silk string before a planing tool.  very few times to you get something besides the quickest bow or the most damaging bow anyway though.  i would have made it with silk string if anyone had wanted me to make a shaped bow for them.<br />

edit oh forgot to add.  if the rockets take this bow and the other components i saw how much does one cost with no failures.  looked to be at least 100pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">OK, I added a note on the Catapult Recipe about the HEMP TWINE. Just to make it a bit more obvious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kritta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Tinkered Catapult (135) <br />
- 1 shaped ashwood recurve bow, 1 sprocket, 1 gear, 1 metal twine, 1 firewater <br />
* shaped ashwood recurve bow: ashwood bow staff, hemp twine, planing tool (fletching, triv 148)  <br />
<br />
<br />
*noddles* yup yup yup</div></div><hr />
