<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Besides the obvious Int and Wis......for the main Tradeskills, what Stats are needed to help with combines and skill-ups?<br />
For example, I heard Strength and Dexterity are needed for Smithing.<br />
Are there other stats besides Int and Wis that are needed for specific Tradeskills?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tricsun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Strength for smithing, dexterity for fletching (i think)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azirux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As per the FAQ on this site:<br />
<br />
Q: What stats are used in what skills?<br />
<br />
A: For ALL tradeskills, the greater of your Wisdom or Intelligence will determine your skill-up rate. In Smithing, Strength also affects this rate, while Dexterity affects Fletching. NO stat changes your rate of success, as far as we can tell. (See the Stats and Tradeskills FAQ (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=19) for further details.)<br />

Edit: fixed the hyperlink (for code and to point to the corrected/updated version) and made it HUGE so people might actually see and READ it. :) ~Lothay</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ahhh I guess they throw in Str in case you are a melee. Thats cool. Thank  you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">dexterity for fletching (i think) <br />

And tailoring as its been discussed before unless its changed.</div></div><hr />

We thought that for a while, but now the devs have confirmed on a couple occasions that dex is only for fletching, not tailoring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tricsun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dunno but i think that dex *should* be like int and wisdom and help with them all.  I mean, what tradeskill wouldn't logically use your dexterity?  You would kinda have to have steady hands to mount a jem in jewelry or mold clay into a pot?  Pfft, just wishful thinking from a warrior with only about 180 wis.  :grumpy:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azirux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Originally posted by zumavt <br />
<br />
For example, my 58 ranger has a WIS suit for tradeskills that maxes out at the displayable WIS value of 255. Is it beneficial to get an additional KEI or improve my gear to gain more WIS or am I truely maxxed at 255?  <br />
<br />
People posting WIS/INT higher than 255 are people above level 60, and/or people who have spent AA's to get a higher Max level. At 58 with no AA's your Max is 255. Your Max wisdom will go up 5 points each level from 60 to 65, and you can raise it to a Max of 355 with AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Beriberi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What about make poison? I seem to remember that dexterity is a secondary stat that affects this too.<br />

B.  <br />

Nope, Devs said only Fletching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Please read the FAQ linked above. <br />

The correct information is in there. <br />
