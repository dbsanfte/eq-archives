<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Utope Eljugador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Made 3 tonight. Just an FYI - it cant be turned into the token lady in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Now I've got an extra one, plus 2 unfired taking up space =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I really appreciate that information because I have the components in bank for a couple tries, but was waiting until my pottery skill got maxed out.  And was REALLY hoping it was something I could get a token for ::sigh::<br />
<br />
One question ... can you do regular M+P combines in it.  Specifically, can you make Celestial Essence?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Utope Eljugador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes. Its nothing special except that its 10 slots, which I carry mine around cause I've always used poison, so it gave me 4 extra spaces for farming say, wailing substances or swirling shadows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, it can be used for anything that works in a regular mortar and pestle, and it can't be token-ized in the Bazaar (it seems that only containers with a weight reduction can be tokenized, which also left out Vale sewing kits and Fier'Dal fletching kits, much to my chagrin).  Still, it's ten slots, so if you have to have a mortar and pestle, you can carry this one around because you can use it for a loot bag when you're not making poisons or celestial essences.  I've made two so far for friends, and they say it's not a bad thing to have, if only because it's the mark of the well-heeled rogue.  And someday, you just know a 7 component poison will come out, and then won't you be popular?<br />
