<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Donbayne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, I'm a half-elf Tunare ranger, I know I cannot make the special Karana arrows using the Surefall fletching kit, but can I equip and or use them? Thanks for any advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Both restricted fletchings (wood elf and Karana) have a set of arrows that are diety restricted and one that is open to all dieties.  You can use the non-restricted set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donbayne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What's a half-breed to do?<br />
*sigh* I see much acrylia in the future......... might as well use up the condensed shadow arrowheads I've been saving. Thanks for the reply!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ChaseFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">*sigh* I see much acrylia in the future <br />
<br />
Don't forget the new arrow recipes from GoD. That will take some of the acrylia farming agony away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Greymantle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ROFL, umm no it will not. Don't know if you have tried to 'farm' the new material to make the arrowheads but i have. Lucky to get 2 drops in 3 or four hours of pulling. Can get wayyy more acrylia and substance in the same time. And the acrylia will allow skill-ups to max to boot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Donbayne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the reply.<br />
Yup good suggestion there, I've just been fishing through the info on GoD fletching. I'm not very impressed with the damage/range that's listed here for those arrows, and that's the only reason I'm fletching.... to make long range, high damage arrows for immediate use.<br />
Thankfully the GoD arrows are neither race nor deity restricted and I'm sure that eventually GoD recipes for some exotic arrows will be found unless I've missed them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ixiola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You say you're a half elf tunare ranger?  If so, you can use (but not make) the tunare only arrows made by wood elf fletchers.<br />
<br />
Karana is right out...)<br />
<br />
A decent alternative arrow to the culteral are the acrylia arrows.  Requires a lot of farming though.  The high end tunare arrow is slightly more range and dmg than the acrylia arrows, but tedious and expensive to make.  I've been meaning to make more for my own use, but can't seem to find the gumption to run back and forth between Felwithe and Kelethin...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Donbayne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yup, Half-Elf Tunare Ranger, level 52, that's me. Nice to know I can use the Tunare arrows even if I can't make them. Right now I'm farming to make Condensed Shadow arrows with Acrylia shafts. Condensed Shadow is easy to farm but it may take a while to get enough acrylia to match the quantity of CS arrowheads I have. I'm not sure of the fletching trivial on those...  above 255 I'm guessing? There's enough in my bank to start fletching but I'll wait until I have one bagful of stacks of each component before sitting down and fletching for an hour.<br />
Oh and I like the new fletching UI, it's saved my wrist already, although it seems I really have to dick around to get the high end recipes to display so that I can add them to my favourites. It's an improvement though and I appreciate the work put into that tradeskill change. All I need now is acrylia...... a familiar story I'm sure. Grimlings beware.<br />
Thanks muchly for the info and replies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The GoD arrows are a complete waste of time and effort. They arent 'farm'able, and the arrows pretty much suck in damage, range and that they arent magical (unless they changed it and i wasnt paying attention). <br />
<br />
You can only make the Tunare arrows if youre a wood elf, religion doesnt matter (a RZ worshipping wood elf warrior can make em).<br />
but you HAVE to follow Karana to both make and use the Karana arrows. Yes. Lame as heck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aerinha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Only if you are making the blessed Karana arrows. Otherwise,  you don't have to follow Karana to use the normal Karana arrows.</div></div><hr />
