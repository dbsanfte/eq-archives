<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I had to post to vent some frustration... went fishin'.. normally a nice relaxing afternoon... figured I'd get those last 3 points to 200 and would attempt the last 3 Blessed Fishing Pole combines I have...<br />
<br />
200 + 60 fishing attempts and still at 197... ARGHH!... and I did fishing to take a break from the torture that is Blacksmithing!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think the last few points took me 3 days to get.  It slowed down tremdeously after 180 or so.  Will have to dig around for the logs ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Fishing is unbelievably slow there at the end.  The trick is to convince the RNG that you really do want whatever is fished up and don't care if you get the skillups.  I spent it in Cobalt Scar, since I had a wealthy customer wanting vast quantities of cod oil.  And I do mean vast.  I think I got 197-200 over six or seven hours straight there on the beach.  Well, aside from dodging some AOEing wyverns when the kiters brought them too close.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Arghhhhhh?!?!  You can buy fishing?!  Why didn't I check that when I bought my research. /Self bonk</div></div><hr />

Let's just say it is so slow at and after 189, that several of us thought it was broken, we all fished in Gunthak for several hours, and didn't get one skillup (and we were all at 189).<br />
<br />
I had tears of joy when I went back there one day just for a stack of jellyfish to get a skillup.  :D<br />
<br />
It's as slow as molases flowing uphill on a February morning (old New England saying).<br />
<br />
Or, as we say here in s. Florida: It's as slow as a northerner here in the winter!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have to admit i caved and went back to RiverVale to visit my guildmaster and gave him money to teach me those last few fishing tips.<br />
<br />
Oh the shame.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>scarbrowed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you call buying 3 points cheating, what about my druid? When I failed on a Blessed fishing pole at fishing 170, I went and bought my way over 190. I figured one less failure paid for the training points.<br />
<br />
The sad thing is I have plenty more training points, and no idea what to do with them. Any skill I care about is maxed, and it seems really pointless to spend money on language points. (The fun of languages is having a language spam group party.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I remember I maxed fishing in PoGrowth whilst foraging for planar oaks. Wish I could forage in WL while fishing in CS now. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Linea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i went from 196 to 200 in six casts :p so much for the 30 stacks of bait i had just bought!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Heh, that's VERY lucky, Linea.<br />
<br />
ALL skills (doesn't matter if tradeskill, combat, spellcasting, whatever), have a very hard learning curve from somewhere around 180 to 200, before becoming saner again.  It can get frustrating, since 200 is a milestone for many things.<br />
<br />
While I've never purchased training for fishing, yes, it is the exception to the &quot;must get experience in the field&quot; rule, since it's kinda sorta and odd duck, erm, fish of a tradeskill sorta thing. <br />
