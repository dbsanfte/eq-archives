Anyone making ceramics yet?  Can I get a price check in aisle 7, please?</div></div><hr />

shield of valor requires 2 metallic liquids (avg 5k bazaar)<br />
<br />
dont think you will see the earth totem for awhile.. the drops are pretty rare as is... but it for some bizaar reason you saw it on a vendor in the bazaar it would probably have some huge PP pricetag.  (over 150k)</div></div><hr />

Well, this one *might* not be too far out of reach, providing someone is even making them.  It would be nice to buff with the Extended Enhancement IV.<br />

An ooc question:  I know Extended Enhancement IV works on spells to level 65, but how much extra does it add?  Is it longer than the 8th shawl?</div></div><hr />

The original thing about the shawl is that is *stacks* with aa enhancement, whereas the items like the pottery-made hammer don't.  Max extension from aa is 50% and if you have shawl (only the shawl, no other items) you can add +20% for a grand total of +70% duration.  Here's a link the the exact data for the enhancement on Lucy's - shows that the hammer is +15% to duration but if you have SCRM (aa for enhancement) don't bother, you can't get more than +50% without the shawl.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wystie</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, here's a link to an enchanter forum where they discuss it:<br />

<br />
Maximum possible duration without your 8th shawl is +50% to buffs (I don't know if items + aa stack or how, for that matter) but if you add 8th shawl, it jumps to +70% duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ilona</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, so without AA points, you can get 20% from shawl, and 15% from item.<br />
You can get 50% (?) extension from AA points at level 55 (?)<br />
<br />
So max in total, if you spend tons of AA points and have the level for it is 70%?<br />
Max in total if you don't have any AA points is 35%?<br />
<br />
Thank you for stopping by, Wystie! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wystie</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well...I haven't tested that so I can't say if shawl + item stack, and in the history of EQ design, oftentimes items like that don't (can anyone say haste?)  <br />
<br />
So, I think I would test that before making the claim of +35% with no aa.<br />
<br />
... and as far as AA extension is concerned, here are a few bits n pieces (specifically for enchanterly aa) copied from elsewhere:<br />
<br />
Adds the +30% to duration:<br />
Archetype (Requires Level 55, and at least 6 points in General Abilities)<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement [Prerequisite for Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery]: Lengthens the duration of buffs cast by you including from items like the enchanter epic, and tranquility pants. Your friends will love long duration KEI when you run by them. Nice on raids particularly for hastes which are often a bit too short for some long fights when you factor in buff time. Side benefit of improving the effective mana efficiency of buffs. (3 Levels) Cost: 2/4/6. Benefit: Increases buff duration by 5%, 15%, and 30%.<br />
<br />
Adds an additional +20% for a grand total of +50% to buff duration:<br />
Class (Requires Level 59, and at least 12 points in Archetype Abilities)<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery [Requires Spell Casting Reinforcement 3]: 120 Minute VoQ, and 1 hour haste is a good thing. Note: I've now tested this out myself, this plus a 8th shawl takes you to +70% duration. Old CW: Why would anyone need an enchanter, KEI lasts 150 minutes? New CW: Why would anyone need an enchanter, your KEI lasts 255 minutes? (1 Level) Cost: 8. Benefit: Increases the duration of beneficial buffs by 20% (with pre-reqs total of 50%)<br />
<br />
...and here's a link to possibly the best write up for enchanter aaxp I've found:<br />

<br />
sword of war 6-9k<br />
shield of valor 12-15k<br />
hammer of justice 9-12k<br />
skull of decay 3-4k<br />
wand of storms 18-22k<br />
totem of the rathe 80k<br />
<br />
its rather odd price range but i think some have pretty rare components so wont see them often for sale.</div></div><hr />
