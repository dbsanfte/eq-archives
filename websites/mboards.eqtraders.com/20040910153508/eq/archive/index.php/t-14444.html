<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eowenna Celerdain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yup, Oscar time is coming up ... and lots of folks want to celebrate. <br />
<br />
As of today, February 23, the party is not yet sold out (I know one of the organizers).  So if you'd like to go, then buy a ticket AT THE PARTY SITE right away!  <br />
<br />
<br />
****Party site link! (http://intothewest.net)****<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, if you want to attend you need to go buy a ticket *the PARTY site,* (not here).  Party organizers will NOT be checking this thread.  <br />
<br />
There is no known connection between EQ Trader's and the Oscar LoTR party ...  except that, since many folks who enjoy EQ also like Lord of the Rings and/or high-quality fantasy artwork, I thought I'd link the party site for your info.<br />
<br />
This way, any interested folks can know about it and get a ticket before they sell out.   :) <br />
<br />
There's a great deal of art and goodies offered for silent auction, raffle, and in a few cases even as door prizes (see &quot;Raffles &amp; Silent Auctions&quot; link along left margin of main page).  Any profit goes to Reading is Fundamental.<br />
<br />
Hope that at least a few of you may be able to attend!   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I will leave the window open and look at it, and dream of what it must be like to be RL-uber like that... and realize that I don't think I OWN anything nice enough to wear to something like that. What is Californain 'formal attire' like, anyway? Probably a dress that costs as much as an entire semester of college, or at least a class. ^_^<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds like uber fun. If anyone goes, give us a report!!!<br />
<br />
-- Sanna <br />
&quot;It comes in pints? I'm getting one.&quot;<br />
&quot;Don't, you've had a whole half already!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>illovich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think in California, formal attire means a dress that is loaned to you by a designer, so that they get free publicity when the paparazzi snap photos of you and publish them in US &amp; People &amp; weekly World News.<br />
<br />
Maybe it would be nice to be real world ueber like that, but my cousin El-P (http://www.definitivejux.net/jukies/el-p)  isn't even that that famous but all the attention he gets really seems to wear him down. <br />
<br />
Like last time I saw him, it was difficult to have a conversation outside without having every other sentence interrupted by someone who wanted to tell him what his album/single/show meant to them, or tell him how he used to be better (that was my favorite), or give him some &quot;new ideas.&quot;  It was really annoying, and it was only like a half hour f my life. I can't imagine it. <br />
<br />
I think I'd like to be famous like the Residents... no one recognizes you without your mask :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eowenna Celerdain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just in case you wondered ... <br />
<br />
If the previous two LotR Oscar parties are any indication, &quot;formal&quot; attire means gents wear suits or tuxedos, ladies in nice dresses (kinda evening-style, not necessarily elaborate).<br />
<br />
So - nope, this does NOT need to be top-notch designer.  ;) <br />
<br />
Please notice -- this is the $60 dollar per ticket party, not the $600/$6,000 per ticket party.  :p <br />
<br />
This one is for *the fans* ... yes, the stars have been informed that it's there.  And yes, they have been invited.  <br />
<br />
However, as of today... none have sent any confirmation of intention to attend.  <br />
<br />
That's not really surprising, since these would not be paid appearances.  Their agents generally have them fairly well booked.  A few have responded that they'd rather go to this party than to the one their agent booked them into ... <br />
<br />
LotR Fan Club members have done other activities with various cast and crew members from the films, so there is an acquaintence level that makes this party more attractive to some of these celebrities than the &quot;glittler&quot; parties that are more about publicity than about enjoyment.<br />
<br />
So there's very little chance of any celebrities being there.  At least, officially.  There's a couple rumors of possibilities, but I was strictly instructed to be clear -- there is nothing certain.  There are always rumors surrounding events like these ...<br />
<br />
If any big names from the film industry *do* poke their noses in, it will be as much a surprise to the organizers as to the attendees.  It's theoretically possible, but extremely unlikely.  :boggled: <br />
<br />
There are, however, some fairly well-known artists in painting, writing, sculpture, music, etc. who will be attending the art show portion and offering their wares (and autographs).<br />
<br />
The point of the party is those who enjoy high fantasy (especially if that includes Lord of the Rings) to get together and have fun watching the Oscars together.   From offsite, a direct tv thing, but nearby.<br />
<br />
So ... if you're inclined, don't be intimidated.  Everyone else buying tickets, or otherwise confirmed to attend, are just people too.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, but I'm a person two time zones and a two day drive one way away from this party. Hence, I leave the window open and wish. ^_^ <br />
<br />
Quartic is looking for a job in Austin. Not a bad city, but that's kinda like looking for work in Felwithe when you were really hoping for Qeynos, or at least Freeport... oh well. I had my fingers crossed for California or nearby, only in part so I could someday go to things like this, but I guess I take what comes, you know? ^_^ <br />
<br />
<br />
Man, it would be fun tho ^_^ and I assumed from the beginning that there wouldn't be stars. It would just be cool to be able to go and just see what a real party is really like. You know? ^_^ I don't think there's a large amount of 'real life' in this town. <br />
<br />
People pay $6k for a ticket?? CRY. That is one semester of in-state tuition here, including class and room/board. These people have too much money and should help people like my roommate get through college. /nod. <br />
<br />
Suddenly I had an odd correlation in my head between people like me, whom have 5kp in the 'bank' (in EQ) and see people talk about having 900kp... I can't even imagine quantities like that. And IRL, I have, probably, life savings... $5k in the bank. And some people are worth hundreds of thousands... millions... I can't even imagine. <br />
<br />
Anyone else suddenly feeling really.... small? o_0<br />
<br />
Life in California must be interesting. ^_^ I hope I can see, someday. <br />
<br />
-- Sanna <br />
who should know to be more careful of what she wishes for... because if she asks for an adventure, she will get it, but in all the ways she wouldn't expect...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eowenna Celerdain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I resemble that remark ... the whole &quot;appetite for steak on a hamburger budget&quot; situation.  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Yes, there *are* parties out there with ridiculously high ticket prices.  I just didn't want anyone chased off by confusing this gathering with one of those.   ;) <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, travel requirements bar me from attending too ... I'll be there &quot;in spirit,&quot; as the saying goes, but I cannot attend in person.  :bookworm:<br />
<br />
Oh well, maybe that will change one of these years ...  <br />
<br />
Yeah, right ... and maybe I'll suddently become a high school cheerleader (unlikely since I graduated 19 years ago).  :boggled:</div></div><hr />
