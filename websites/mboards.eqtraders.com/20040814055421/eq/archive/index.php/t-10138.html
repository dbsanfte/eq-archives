<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Howdy -- I have about 110 berry dyes I made from Honey Beery and I plan to skill up my own tailoring on gold and platinum ribbons.<br />
<br />
However, I'm playing a wood elf, so the finished ribbons themselves won't have any value to me. <br />
<br />
If you are an Iksar who wants to do some LoY cultural tailoring, I'd like to find a price at which I can sell the results to you and cut my losses, while still providing you with a good deal.<br />
<br />
Send me a private message, and I'll reply.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have begun this process and I have a small number (13) of the Gold + Honey Berry ribbons, and a slightly larger number (17) f the Platinum + Honey Berry ribbons.  <br />
<br />
Please, if you are an Iksar tailor, contact me here, or on my bazaar alt (Burrita) and I will try to give you a good deal.  At some point, I'll re-sell to the merchants and that seems a shame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I VTed these recently, sadly.<br />
<br />
I will be making more eventually though so if you are an Iksar tailor, find me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Continuing in my vain pursuit, this morning a would-be customer for a Robe of Misery (is that right?) conteact me, saying if I found an Iksar tailor, to let him know -- he wants to buy a robe.  I am happy to help grease the wheels if it means my ribbons have a customer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kahmon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Robe of Misery requires ribbons made using Maneater Dye, not Berry Dye.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks!  Too bad it doesn't work out quite so neatly. <br />
<br />
Well, we are still looking for a customer for the berry dyed ribbons and someone else is looking for a supplier for the robe, even if, sadly, I cannot help facilitate the latter.</div></div><hr />
