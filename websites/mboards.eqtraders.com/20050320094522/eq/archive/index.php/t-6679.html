<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rewde</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, to start off with, I am a little sleepy this morning.  I was looking at the clock on my vcr and it was saying it was 10:46, and I was like, oh I better go to bed now.  Log out of the game, and my computer is saying 11:46.. doh.  Need to get that clock set.  And then, my 21 month old daughter decides that she has to get up between 5 and 5:30 lately.. urrrgh.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I took a little bit of the tidbits of advice given me in the other post I had made.<br />
<br />
I was running around, trying to kill anything I could that did not /con green to me, hoping for that elusive giant wood spider to pop up so I could get me needed pieces for my armour quest.<br />
<br />
I was sitting by the guards at the wall trying to get my mana back, and watch my health slowly creep back up.  This guy comes up, a higher level druid I believe, and throws some buffs on me, and heals me up.  So, I thanked him, and ran off to go kill some more.  I killed somed shadowed assasins, turned around to run back to the wall, and there he was sitting right behind me.  He said not to worry, that he was there to pl me a little.<br />
So, I asked him, &quot;what is pl?&quot;.  And he says &quot;Power level&quot;.  And I was like &quot;whats that?&quot;  and he said &quot;You run around and kill things, and I will keep you healed&quot;. So I said oh, ok and ran off to kill things.<br />
<br />
I went and killed all the goblins at the camps, and actually found a couple of the Giant wood spiders too.  Unfortunately, they did not have any of the pieces I needed for my armour, just some spider silk, which I found is used for tailoring.  So, after killing all the goblins in the second camp, he was like, &quot;well I gotta go now&quot;, so I thanked him again for his help, and made my way back to Rivervale to sell all the ore and things I looted.<br />
<br />
Oh, I did get forage at 5, not 15 by the way.  So I had foraged 2 misty acorns while doing all of my running around.  So when I was in rivervale selling my loot, and getting my new spells, as I hit level 9, I asked if anybody needed the 2 acorns I had.  Someone said that they would buy them from me, and gave me 5 platinum each  :) <br />
<br />
I now have 32 platinum after all of this, and figured, I would take the advice given and go to the bazaar and see what I could buy.  I took the portal to the Plane of Knowledge, which I had a really hard time getting around in, and I moved really slow, but I eventually found the portal to get to the nexus.  I get into the nexus and am trying to find the bazaar, and this guy keeps yelling that he is casting extended C3 (15% aa), give him the coin and he would invite you.  I was curious as to what that was, but I wanted to get to the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I get into the bazaar and a message pops up that there are something like 300 vendors with around 8,000 items for sale, and I was  :shock: <br />
I pulled up the bazaar menu like I was told, and I looked for a new weapon.  I looked at 1 hand slash weapons, and saw a few nice ones, but did not have anywhere near enough money for them.  As I scrolled down the list of items, I saw a mistletoe cutting sickle, which had really nice stats, but they were asking 2 - 3,000 platinum for them.  So I keep scrolling down and come across a zaxthril forged flamberge, which had almost as good stats, but was only 10 platinum.  So I run over and buy it.  Yay.<br />
<br />
Then I go back to the nexus, because I am still curious about what C3 is.  The guy is still yelling that he is casting it at the top of the steps, so I run up and ask him &quot;what is C3?&quot;.  I got no response from anyone, so I asked him again, and I get the message that I have been invited into a group to click on follow or decline.  So, I clicked on follow, and the guy says &quot;Mana regen&quot;, casts his spell, and then I was no longer in the group.  I'm like &quot;oh, thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
So, I gated back to Misty thicket, got my buffs on, and memorized my new spells.  I run back to the gobln camps and was doing pretty good with my new weapon.  I'm loaded up with a ton of ore, and cloth armour, and I'm killing the last goblin in the camp, thinking I am going to go sell my loot after killing him.  Then out of nowhere this guy named Mooto started whacking the crap out of me and casting spells on me.  So,  I start running away, but I wasn't getting anywhere fast, and my health bar was going down quickly.  Next thing I know, I am unconcious on the ground, and he casts another spell on me, and I get the message that I am slowly bleeding to death, and then I have been slain by Mooto.<br />
<br />
After loading, I go and sell all the stuff that I looted, and that is when I looked at the clock and decided that it was time to go to bed. So, at this point, I am still not sure what C3 is, or how it was supposed to help me.  But, my wife is going camping with our friends this weekend, I don't get to go because of work, so I will get to have a little more play time while my daughter is taking her nap.  I can't remember who said that this was addictive, but they are right.</div></div><hr />

It is sometimes referred to as the Clarity line, because Clarity was the first spell they got in it (originally; they added a lower level one called Breeze when the Kunark expansion came out).<br />
<br />
C3 is short for Clarity 3, which isn't actually the name of the spell, it is just that the spell increases mana regen and is the next spell in the line.  It is really called Koadic's Endless Intellect.  Sometimes people call it KEI for short also.  In addition to increasing your mana regeneration, it adds to the size of your mana pool and increase your Intelligence and Wisdom by 25.<br />
<br />
In the time you were fighting after you got that spell, you probably didn't ever run out of mana.</div></div><hr />

  Please save any Misty Acorns you find for me.  I am also on Povar, and will pay 10 plat each.  :-)<br />
<br />
  As far as C3/KEI  *Sane spell), it is one of the most popular spells in the game.   It allows you to regain 14 mana every &quot;tick&quot; (Which is how the game is measured.   Tick = 6 seconds).   This is 14 in addition to whatever you get from Sitting down and your meditate skill (Which I believe druids get at level 8 or 9).<br />
<br />
All of this mana regaining helps you cast alot more spells without waiting for mana to come back for a while.<br />
<br />
Just don't turn into one of those people (*blush*) who refuses to fight without clarity or c3.   They stand around in the nexus, or Plane of Knowledge, and sadly shout &quot;Is anyone casting KEI?  I will pay!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with KEI, but do not become dependant on it.   <br />
