<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KyrosKrane</div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm rather curious as to how many folks have characters that are married in the game?  I've set up a poll to get some ideas.<br />
<br />
&quot;Currently married&quot; means you have at least one character that is actively engaged in a relationship.  You do married-couple type things, share a last name, whatever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once married&quot; means you have at least one character that was married at some point.  Maybe you divorced, separated, partner quit, whatever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never married&quot; means you never had a character marry.<br />
<br />
If I could make this a multi-vote poll (not sure if it's possible), it would be nice to get one vote per character you play, but if not, assume one vote per user.<br />
<br />

The ceremony was to be held in the Everfrost temple ruin near the giant statue, where he had proposed, but alas those infernal icy orcs moved in just a week before the wedding date.  :shock:  After determining that they could not be kept killed without endangering the guests, we had to move it over to the easternmost ruins along the river.  It was a lovely ceremony nonetheless!  *sighs dreamily*<br />
<br />
Daktor Snowblood ceased traveling the paths of Norrath about a year and a half later, and the wedding ring went into the bank about six months thereafter, but it's still there.  I've only very recently (last week!) realized that I've found someone worthy of marrying, but still need to pluck up the courage to propose. ;) *hopes she's right that he doesn't frequent these boards*</div></div><hr />

I know it's role-play, but I still don't think my boyfriend would like my character marrying someone other than one of his.<br />
Besides, both the pally and the cleric are going to have the surname &quot;Smith&quot; if they ever get to 250, and I can't see my bf taking on my surname! :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
My druid married back in the summer of '99 and poor Tymbra took his surname.... Fallenoak. Yes, that made me Tymbra Fallenoak. (say it outloud and think of a lumberjack) Anyway, it so didn't work out and he quit playing and she's back to her old surname, Moonwhisper.<br />
<br />
As for little Kritta ... well, Kredal plays on the WRONG SERVER ... so no, she's not married and hasn't even been flirted with. *sniffle*</div></div><hr />

  Getting married to someone you have never met is silly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Serenya</div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know at least a couple people who still roleplay 100% of the time after three years.   They are the exception though.   Most of the marriages I attended in-game were in the first year, when more people were actively roleplaying.   (And many though not all of the folk I know who wed in game married RL partners).   My primary spent several months actively pursuing her first and best friend, a confirmed bachelor who was none-the-less sweet on her.   It was fun to roleplay :)   It ended though when she slowly got involved with another character, played by the man who eventually became my husband.   Our avatars wed in-game just before we became engaged in RL (we met in EQ) and my warrior's former love challenged her new husband to a duel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username"></div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have never gotten married in game.<br />
<br />
I have married someone I met in a game ;)<br />
<br />
She never played everquest, met 5 years ago in a MUD called Illusia.  Lived together IRL for 4 years, and next week is our 1 year anniversary.<br />
<br />
I would never even think of overly flirting or role playing a relationship for 3 reasons:<br />
<br />
1.  I love my wife and would feel really dirty.<br />
<br />
2.  I am too busy looking for Phat lewtz or tradeskilling.<br />
<br />
3.  48% of female characters playing everquest are actually male, and I'm not a gambling man.<br />
<br />
That last is the result of a fairly extensive survey and very close to the reality.  So be careful out there.</div></div><hr />

But then, if you're just playing and not seriously interested in something RL with this person, does it matter if they're not the gender of their character?  If it's your character marrying their character, and not anything personal between you two in RL, why does it matter?  Isn't the point of roleplaying to play...well, within the roles?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well...<br />
<br />
A woman accidentially flirting with a woman is one thing.  This is acceptable, and highly encouraged, especially if a cat fight starts when someone finds out.<br />
<br />
A guy flirting with a guy will have to either have to shoot himself, yell loudly to everyone that he knows that he isn't gay, or shoot the other guy.  ;)<br />
<br />
Actually I flirted with a guy online once... once.  At 19 playing Diablo, the first Diablo. After almost being sick to my stomach, and not playing the game for 3 weeks... I recovered.  But it really really woke me up, hehehe. <br />
<br />
To be honest, after I got over that, it didn't matter too terribly much to me anymore, and I flirted with people without caring one way or the other... but I seriously doubt this is very common amongst the manly men playing Everquest, hehehe.<br />
<br />
P.S. My wife still teases me when I flirt with her brother ;).</div></div><hr />

We picked a remote spot (at that time it was remote) because we didn't want to deal with any homophobia and obnoxious hecklers. A year later, the mood on our server was quite different... it was nice seeing gay marriages at the GFay spires... announced to zone, with the Priest of Love officiating!<br />
<br />
Divorced now... ah well. Some friends aren't worth having. *drrrrama*</div></div><hr />

(that chapel is soo cute, small enough that my gnome didnt look tiny yet tall enough for the wood elf to stand up straight and lots of benches in ampitheater tyle seating for the guests)The person behind the character and I were good online friends outside of the game and in game the characters did roleplay a good 95% of the time, you would never see one character hunting without the other. We even created a guild together. Flash to the end of 2002 and the guild still exists but Lauriella is no longer married to him though since he no longer plays and has given his account to a family member of his. <br />
My rl husband and I play together and we each have one character that we play only with each other but we have no intentions of getting married in game</div></div><hr />

So they're sort of married? I have no idea, lol.</div></div><hr />

Our families tolerate each other because only dwarves and barbarians drink that much.  Heartsong is FAR too independent to give up her surname, so it's strictly roleplaying.  He proposed near the freeport docks, with a velium opal engagement ring, which I only stopped wearing to put on a second wedding ring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was kind of fun to actually get to role play my religeous duties as the tribal priest (Vah Shir Shaman).  I dressed up in my black chain armor (loda kai mail) and laid it on thick and heavy with  the do yous.  Had to buy the ring though, The groom was going to use a cheap*&amp;^ copper band, so I coughed up enough for a wedding ring as a wedding present.<br />
<br />
It was pretty sudden or I would have catered the affair,  as it was all I could do was pass around some cheap booze and someone else brought some cake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My second wedding was probably the most fun I've had playing EQ, ever. The GMs were supposed to perform the ceremony but never showed up, so we ended up with a halfling druid presiding. Well between flirting with me, insulting my hubby and the guests, and the &quot;traditional pant-less halfling ceremony&quot;, I think that all in attendance had a very good laugh.<br />

<br />
My RL hubby started playing EQ about a year before I did. He got married in game to a girl who happens to live near us IRL. When I started playing I got to know his &quot;wife&quot; and we became pretty good friends. Well, his's &quot;wife's&quot; RL brother also played EQ, and he and I were close to the same level so we started playing together a lot. After months of flirting in game, he proposed and we married as well. Unfortunately, the friendships eventually soured over some RL issues and guild conflicts, so eventually we were all divorced. Now Idara has decided men are good for play-things, but marriage is of no interest to her. Iriane is married to her profession as a cleric of Innoruuk. And Mundania's more interested in her new sword and next battle than any man. <br />
<br />
As for the issue of RL gender versus character gender, Idara has quite actively flirted with a male character that I was fully aware wass driven by another female IRL. lol, for that matter, Idara flirts with anything that attracts her attention. She's very flighty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh.  I have a ten-platinum bet with my sister over which of our characters are going to get hitched first, if anytime. I say Serelicia will marry first, but she has this strange idea in her head that there are others out there (high elves, wood elves, humans, half-elves...) who think that Jeylec would be quite a catch himself.  I quote from an actual arguement we've had over this subject:<br />
<br />
&quot;A magician's committed to his magic, first off. Most of his money goes for spells. He won't have a big treasure trove for his wife to use up buying jewelry and all that stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jay, he's smart, he's good with magic, and he's not half-bad looking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Serelicia, on the other hand, is a heroic, beautiful paladin, already rising in fame and fortune.  For crying out loud, she's got more platinum the Jeylec ever had at one time... I keep wondering why nobody's flirting with her yet...&quot;<br />
<br />
She walloped me a good one after this. She's like that.<br />

So, anyways, it might or might not be in thier future.  You can only wait.<br />

<br />
Fielan, my druid, has been married several times; the longest lasting was to a ranger (who was married irl) that I believe eventually quit. (I took a hiatus for RL reasons, and he decided the game was no fun once he got to 60)  My cleric (Cadariel) has never wed.. and probably never will.  <br />
<br />
I play with my rl boyfriend a great deal with the cleric, but his surname is Gnollcharmer, and.. I just have a hard time with choosing that for my own last name. ;)<br />
