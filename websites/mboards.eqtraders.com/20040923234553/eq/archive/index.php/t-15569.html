<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sylphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's way too early to post information because the Fanfaire isn't even over.  Also I should mention I was too drunk to drive after the beach party so had to walk home tonight, and left my notes behind.  Nonetheless...<br />
<br />
Rumor: mana regen cap will be raised from 15 to 25 soon.  This seemed to start from players and spread to GMs, with the SOE staff last to hear of it.  So probably false.<br />
<br />
Rumor: Leaving leadership xp turned on subtracts 20% from your xp even when you're not group leader.  Ick.  Probably true.<br />
<br />
Fact: Tinkering by non-gnomes is a five year old bug that will soon be fixed.  Non-gnomes won't even be able to make fireworks or animated bait any more.  But they'll still be able to do no-fail recipes without the new interface, such as recharging items with mana batteries.<br />
<br />
Fact: Someone actually revealed the formula for chance of skillup.  It's kinda complicated and involves two seperate checks so will post later.  Interestingly, successes do give higher chance of skillup on the first check (usually double the chance of skillup as a failure).  Also the chance of skillup on the second check decreases gradually to a minimum of 5% at skill 190 or higher.<br />
<br />
Fact: drop rate of GoD tradeskill stuff will be increased in a few weeks.  But don't expect any new GoD recipes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Franchesca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was at the panel when this info was given too :p, and was brought up that wis/int etc help determine success but not skillup rates (inadvertantly the higher wis the more u succede the more skillups), what i want to know is with this info, would it now be feasably better to do solstice robes after i get my stats to almost nothing with as much alcohol/neg stat gear i can, yes i will sacrafice the chance of successfull combines doubeing my chance for a skillup that round and may have to do 20% more combines or whatever...but failing them more often will i make up for it in saved cash from not haveing to make tons of chains???<br />
<br />
also if any care i talked on the side to one of the staff about the stackability of humming orbs for smithing past 220 and he seemed to agree they should be stackable but has to check and confirm, so cross fingers...<br />
<br />
other stuff was brought up, only thing that perked my interest was the idea of haveing GM trophys be abke to transmute (right click effect become a different trophy) if u have them all, in order to save room, and same for returned stuff that cloggs banks like files, needles, pans etc....fresh idea so even if it goes somewhere dont hold your breath for anything too soon.<br />
Also they seemed to like the idea of a different gm bag for each trophy...wee cross fingers on that too<br />
<br />
anyway more panels tomorrow maybe more info will come out.<br />

That is the exact OPPOSITE of what we've been told for years. Who said that wis and int help determine success but not skillups rate?<br />

I am not at Fan Faire.  Originally this was the case when leadership was introduced; the off button was broken.<br />
<br />
It is no longer the case.  I used Leadership to slow my paladin's AA growth til my cleric caught up.  When they both dinged an AA, I turned off leadership exp, and they progressed similarly, and dinged an AA at the same time.</div></div><hr />

EQII destiny mentioned the new EQ Engine, they said it was quite good, but most of the info was in reference to EQII.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Franchesca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">serious....unless i totally heard him wrong, one of the big tradeskill guys at the panel said only thing that effects skillup is if you succede in a combine you have up to a 100% increase in chance of skillup. meaning if you go from skill 200 to 210 with no failures you will have done probably half the amount of combines that someone did that went from 200 to 210 with all failures. dunno if its really true, can someone confirm/deny this was stated in the panel on the first day?<br />
<br />
either way in general more wis/etc will = more skillups but its only because more wis=more success and more success=more skillups<br />
<br />
anyone else there hear any of this or am i really going off the deep end???<br />

What I read is: if you have leadership exp on and you are NOT the group leader, you *still* lose the 20 percent of your exp that would go to leadership exp, but doesn't, because you are not the group leader.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought that the chances for success had been examined *thoroughly* by numerous tradeskillers, and the empirical evidence showed that stats had zero effect on chances for success, right down to the point where someone managed to come up with a formula - not dependent on stats, only on skill - that indicated chances for success.</div></div><hr />

Im gonna stick with the often and easily proven fact that stats do not affect success rates.<br />

Heres how to prove it for yourself.<br />
<br />
Put on all your gear and get all your buffs on. Do 200 combines of something trivial equal to your skill.<br />
<br />
Then bank all your gear, click off buffs, duel a shaman and a chanter, have them debuff you to worthlessness. Do 200 more combines.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
<br />
Part A above does not lead to Part B.<br />
<br />
In fact, I have the opposite interpretation.<br />
<br />
All this says is if you have a skill high enough to succeed often on an item, then you will get up to DOUBLE the skill up rate compared to making an item where the trivial is 100 points above your current skill.  If you lower the wis/int, the lower the BASE skill up rate (THAT IS DOUBLED by a success.)<br />
<br />
Seems very clear to me, wis/int has no bearing on anything but skillup rate.</div></div><hr />

Higher Triv doesn't = Higher Skillup Rate<br />
Triv closer to your skill = Higher skillup rate<br />

At least with the new piece of info and determining how you interpret it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I only went to one of the tradeskill panel discussions, but it was pretty informative, and well run. Got to ask a few questions, primarily related to high end smithing. Since its Monday, and I am draggin my butt, you get the short version.<br />
<br />
Smithed Plate vs Chain<br />
Theres no real good game balance reason why plate requires more materials to produce than plate. Tae ew is MUCH mroe painful/farming intensive, elemental armor requires a lot more etc. Again, no real reason why... its not like a cleric gets twice the benefit of plate arms over a rogue, so why charge the cleric more. The devs agreed, and stated its on their review list.<br />
<br />
PoP Elemental armor tempers<br />
Tying into this, pop tempers are a pain. The double use of temper ingredients in multiple recipes even further limits this. I noted the incredible rarity of essence of frog and how much is used in farwater, and they took note. They seemed suprised to know that guilds have mroe elemental molds/patterns than pieces of player made elemental armor, so hopefully they will up the drop rate and relax the temper requirements to make some pieces.<br />
<br />
GoD weapons.<br />
These suck. Anyone who has had any melee experience knows that a 12/20 weapon for 500 plat in vendor sold materials is pure garbage. 2 aug slots on a piece of junk item is equally worthless (I think I described it as putting super rims/sound system on a pinto on blocks in the front yard). They admitted they were sub par, the vendor cost too high, and the drops way too rare. Expect to see something happen with these.<br />
<br />
Tradeskill trophy/bank space savers.<br />
They arent able to put multiple skill mods on an item. I proposed a very easy workaround, where you have an item that has a click to transform it to another one, similar to the Vibrating Gauntles (hamer to gloves and back). You continue clicking until you get the skill item you need. I then proposed a similar item for the miscellaneous annoying tools you need on combines (files, chisel, spoons, etc).  and thatr it be a tinkered &quot;swiss army knife&quot; type thing. The devs seemed to like this idea, so hopefully we can get back a few bank slots shortly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">On the int/wis part...<br />
<br />
He was constantly interupted while he was talking.<br />
<br />
the HIGHEST of int/wis (str/dex where they matter) has a &quot;mitigating&quot; effect on the skillup chance DIFFERENCE between a failure and a success.<br />
<br />
Basically he said... you have a better chance of getting a skillup on a success than you do a failure.  this chance is UP TOO (but not always) 100% greater (I.E. the double mentioned above)<br />
<br />
as an arbitrary example.<br />
<br />
Lets say you have a BASE 20% chance to get a skillup on a failure, and a 40% chance to get a skillup on a success...<br />
<br />
With a High Stat (highest int/wis or alternate) you will still have a 40% chance for a skillup on a success... but may have say a 30 % chance of a skillup on a failure.  (remeber ARBITRARY numbers here...)<br />
<br />
becasue of the interuptions his language got confused... and when he said &quot;success&quot; he meant &quot;successfull skillup&quot; not combine success.<br />
<br />
So he is only talking SKILLUPS!!!!!<br />
<br />
Again he was only talking SKILLUPS!<br />
<br />
A side effect of a better chance of a skillup on a combine success...  it means you can skillup faster when you try items closer to your trivial, because you have a higher combine chance when the trivial is close than when it is far away.  I.E. more combine sucesses = faster skillup.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And Jayle, judging from Ngreth's (gratefully received) clarification, you really, really want to have maxed out WIS/INT when doing solstice robes (moreso than other items) because you're trying to get skillups from failures.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
Well 'quick and easy' also takes into account running around to diffrent areas/zones for umpteen-jillion parts, looking up the recepies, selling back made items...<br />
<br />
Fishrolls 1-135 are still probably FAR easier, simpler and therefore faster then running all over the zone for 3 different recepies.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Taushar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Here is what I heard from the fan faire at the session and I verified it after the session with the developer.<br />
<br />
The success of combine does give you better chance at skill up than a failure. It can be up to 100% more with successful combine. However, the stats, like wis/int/dex/str works as a mitigator to this. What that means is that higher the stats, the the skill up advantage factor will lower from 100% down to something a lot less. So, if your stats are low, then your success combine will have up to 100% more chance at skill up than failure. However, as stat increases, the chance of skill up on failure will catch up to chance on success. So at higher level, you are almost as likely to skill up on failed combine as a successful one. <br />
<br />
Another factor is that the skill up rate is different from tradeskill to tradeskill. It seems that the fomula used for the skill up for tailoring is different than one for brewing. So, even with the saem stats, you may see more skill up from one tradeskill than another given that all the rest remain the same. This was also confirmed in an after session conversation with a developer. <br />
<br />
One thing is for sure, you definitely would want to max your stats as much as you can. I wish I had maxed my wisdom to 355 before finishing up tailoring. :boggled:<br />
<br />
Did anyone else hear something else?<br />
<br />

This was also confirmed in an after session conversation with a developer.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You heard pretty much what I heard on that one Taushar.<br />
<br />
I, for one, was pleased to hear it publicly said that your chance of skillup was better on a success or a failure.  I'd been told this by a dev many, many, many moons ago, but had no log of the event. I mentioned it here, and was pretty much shot down, after time, because I never was able to get another dev to confirm this in public -- leading me to believe that I'd misheard it, or that I'd been mis-told something.  I'd given up on it so long ago that I'd never thought of asking Maddoc if he could confirm or deny it.<br />
<br />
Other than that, a LOT of stuff from &quot;the list&quot; here was asked at the two panels, and, in some cases we got responses, and in other cases it was put on the list of stuff that they're looking into. If I don't get too swamped tomorrow, I'll try to do a summary from my master list from both sessions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Aethn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Seems to me the only thing you guys are reporting from FF is the skillup issue.  Is there anything else to report on?  I mean after 3 days that cant be the only thing discussed.<br />

I think the skillup discussion is a :dedhorse: after the official post, so we probably should stop beating on the poor thing and let it be buried.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree that this may be classified as dead horse. However, as far as I am concerned, one of the biggest mystery on tradeskill was just solved conclusively and that deserve a few more posts. This question has been gone unanswered for at least 3 years I have been doing tradskills with many posts discussing possiblities for both. There have been heated argument on this issue. I think now that we know for sure, we can put it to rest but not before saying &quot;it's about time&quot;. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Aethn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">No, Niamai told us this a long time ago, so its was never a mystery.  <br />
<br />
You guys all just chose to ignore a solid, relaible and honest source of information and tried to make a big mystery out of something people already knew was true.  Some of you guys just thrive on conspiracy theories here.<br />
<br />
I trust this site, and I trust its creators.  When they post things, they post with as much confidence as they can that the facts are correct.  You guys, the users, just pick and chose what you want to believe.  Niami has no reason to lie, or make stuff up.  There is no personal or professional gain that she can derive from posting rumors or hearsay.  I dont think she would harm the integrity of this site, one of the last vestiges of honest, unbiased information gathering on the net for Everquest.<br />
<br />
Please, just bury the :dedhorse: and let it get some peace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Originally posted by Aethn <br />
No, Niamai told us this a long time ago, so its was never a mystery.  Well, the version I remember was that success had a &quot;very small, virtually unnoticable effect&quot; on chance to skillup.  I don't know if that was from Niami's posting, or a FF report, or what.<br />
<br />
The point is now we know exactly what that effect is - no more need to theorize and attempt to 1) figure out IF it exists or not, and 2) determine its significance and if it should be accounted for in skillup routes.<br />
<br />
Just knowing &quot;success effects skillup&quot; by itself is not particularly useful -- if its 1/100000 extra chance to skillup, it wouldn't effect the &quot;best paths&quot; much -- but knowing quantitatively its effects allows us to make quantitative analysis of its impact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">It sounds like, if you important stat is high enough, the difference between success and failure is very small, to the point of being meaningless, if your stat is not very high, then you are far better off concentrating on successful combines, as the difference in skillup rate between success and failure is very big.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Am I missing it?  Has the formula been posted?  Or is the &quot;mystery is solved&quot; just that there is an effect?<br />
<br />
Not that I expect this to be the result, byt &quot;the mystery&quot; won't be solved for me until I can look at a combine and a skill level and can determine my chance of a skill up the way I can estimate my chance of a successful combine.<br />
<br />
From the sound of it, that formula is still unknown, and will vary by combine/tradeskill, yes?<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Now I see there is a thread with the details.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />
