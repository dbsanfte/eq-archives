<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fredonia Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I love the quests that involve tradeskills but am not high enough level or belong to a large guild to be able to get access to all the really neat quests so I have come up with my own.<br />
<br />
I have decided to bake every recipe documented on EQTraders starting with all the &quot;Old World&quot; recipes.<br />
<br />
Anybody else ever do this? I am baking at least 2 of everything and when I get a few items done I have a picnic with my husband to eat all the goodies.<br />
<br />
One more run of MTPs should put me at 250 (at 249 right now) and I love to bake (especially in RL!). I figure this should keep me busy for the next few months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Niam Dsparil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow that's a lot of cooking...good luck in your quest :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mr.X</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well I decided, as a ver low-lvl baker, to try and do the same thing.    I mean, what better way to close the gap to 200 (from 41) than to try and just make each thing possible?     There are more efficient ways but this sounds like fun :).<br />
<br />
Currently trying to get ahold of Tundra Kodiak meat (the Wastes are too dangerous right now for me) to make saucy bearmeat with; and passing on the non-food items on the list of trivials(Spine poison and green gill juice).     <br />
<br />
Made it up to sandwiches, but was unsuccessful making owlbear sandwichs with a stack of 6 meats available :(.    Getting Sonicwolf meat sounds very difficult, no idea where to get it unless it drops in Hollowshade Moor.      Wolf meat, the problem being I have to get it out of the newbie zones.      Mammoth meat was not a problem, those sandwiches are what I'm eating now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">what server?  you on luclin?  i would have fun helping you with that goal.  level 46 wizar so kodiaks aren't bad for me now.  your on your own for the snow griffon eggs.  1 week on and off camping them for me to get 4 of the eggs.<br />
<br />
i paid 200pp for dragon meat just so i could make the steaks though lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mr.X</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Cool, thanks for the offer but I'm on Tunare (Hammerbreaker 28th lvl Ogre Warrior).<br />
<br />
I've got a lot of recipes to go 'til I get to those snow griffon eggs :)</div></div><hr />
