<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mewkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've just done about 70 attempts at the solstice robe to get my skill from 200 to 207 (and only had one sucess :D ).  I've got enough components for about 100 of the cultural robs that trivial at 212, about 250 of the robes that trivial at 222, and about 500 of the ones that trivial at 232. I would like to get as many skill ups on the solstice robe as I can before the sucess rate starts to make it too expensive. I suspect I've got enough of the 212 robes to get me to 210 (plus the two free ones). And I should have enough of the 232 robes to get from 222 to 232. But, once I get 212, should I go back to making more solstice robes? If not, and I go straight to cultural robes, are 700 combines gonna be enough to go from 212 to 232? I've heard horror stories about needing 80+ combines per attempt, but I think that applies to velius combines as my 70 attempts the other night yielded 7 skill ups (right in the middle of the hell levels). What kind of attempts/skill up ratio have people been getting making the cultural robes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>qwkhyena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I guess it would depend on how expensive your cultural robe combines are compared to successes of solstice robes.<br />
<br />
When I did SRs from 210 - 220ish I was getting about a 10 - 20% success rate and burned through about 270 combine attempts or so.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, you get to use the new GUI for your combines :)<br />
<br />
Just make sure you remember to factor in the failure rate on Gem Studded Chain (mine was about less than 50% even w/ GM &amp; trophy!)</div></div><hr />
