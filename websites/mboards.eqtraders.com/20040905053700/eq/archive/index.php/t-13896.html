<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Duncan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was looking for some input from all you GMs - Old School or otherwise &lt;grin&gt;.  I (like many I imagine) got my baking to 191 on patty melts, looked at Ohabah truffles and went &quot;ooh - mebbe later...&quot;<br />
<br />
I have slowly accumulated a couple toolboxes full of shrooms, but the idea of the dark chocolate subcominbe with cream sub-subcomine doesn't thrill me - even with new UI.<br />
<br />
I see some of the buttered and breaded new GoD foods are triv above 200.  Do you see a change in the &quot;accepted&quot; skillup path?  Ie. are the new combines so much simpler that I'd be better off doing them than Ohabah?<br />
<br />
Appreciate your input.  And as a GM smith (216 and struggling) I would like to weigh in HEAVILY in favor of the new UI.  It was a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually, the truffles really are the way to go, if you have access to a forager.  The subcombines were not bad at all before the UI, and I imagine they're cake now.  Candied Cockroaches would be a feasible path as well, if you have access to a forager.  The nice part about those is you will forage bread crumbs (for breaded storm salmon) and justice fruit.  I worked my way to 202 on Truffles, but this was before PoP.  As I said, the subcombines for that really are not a big deal.  Subs for other recipes are much, much worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">fish in storms.  can get you to 202 i beleive.  if you need really fast but little farming do picnics.  storms would be better if your just getting to 200 though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Branaman Starbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With GoD recepies, look at the tuna/crab/etc recepies now. I think that the Barbequed Tuna rolls are a nice way to go. BBQ sauce ain't that hard to create and Batwings can be bought in shops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did whatever I could get my hands on.<br />
<br />
Candied cockroaches was the big sone since some of my guild had just stared doing th eplanes, and were spending a lot of time in PoJ.<br />
<br />
ALother one i did quite a few on were Pixie Cinnamon Sticks (3 pixie dust, 1 cinnamon sticks).  Just go and kill all the pixies in LFey *I think they're just south east / south / southwest of the Faeries, north of both LDoNs).  I could easily get 6-7 dusts per pop, and by the time I was done one pop, they started popping back at the beginning, no down time and quick kills. (Triv at 202).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>arturio emerys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As far as truffles go, the sub combines arent that bad.  The creme yields 8 and the dark chocolate creme yeilds 6.  For every single combine of creme, you will then have to do 8 more combines of dark chocolate creme for a total yield of 48.   Nine combines per 48 attempts at the truffles.  No where near as bad as MTPs, 10Lb pies or hero sandwiches.<br />
