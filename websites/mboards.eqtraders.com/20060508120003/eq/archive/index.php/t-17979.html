I have already purchased the face and arms.  I would purchase most other peices if they are better than bazaar offerings.  Please leave me a message if you would do this on comission (amount of plat required) if supplied components or your prices for all pieces if you do not work on comission.   Thank you.</div></div><hr />

I had just about given up.  After calculating the cost at a 5% success rate (93 tailoring) I was about to settle for other gear.  I hope we have a mutually profitable and enjoyable agreement in the near future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know if the chance of a success rate is going to be high enough at my current level to do you any good, or not.  I'm not trying to make money here, because I know my skill it pretty low for these combines, so it's more a matter of what level of risk you're willing to chance. <br />
<br />
I am really hoping, in a week or so, to be closer to, or at 200.  (Then more aas to get past it, ugh)<br />
<br />
I am on most events, or you could leave a message with my husbands bazaar mule, Robere.<br />
