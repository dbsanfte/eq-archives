<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>max76487</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The glitches with the patch made me leery of going anywhere, so I decided to take another run at Pottery, dreading the drudgery, even with the new UI, of those terrible non-stacking unfired ceramic linings. Imagine my surprise when I did the first one and it was stackable :D  Now, I am that much closer to making fun stuff, wheee</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kilyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Doh!<br />
<br />
And I just finished them. heh figures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They started stacking on Tuesday.  *hugs* Maddoc and Tanker! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bebinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">dang, i just did some of those last week.  I'm glad they changed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samoht</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Woohoo!<br />
<br />
I got sick of mining for pelts for the vials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Liandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">lol.<br />
<br />
They had to go and do this a few days after i finished needing them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zoki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">By the way, you dont have to farm pelts for Vials anymore (at least if you have GoD).  Head over to the Abysmal Sea and find the Pottery Vendors.  Buy &quot;Crows Special Brew&quot; and substitute it for any skin/pelt that you would use for your Poison Vial combines.  By the way with my CHA I think they ran about 8G for a stack of 20.<br />
<br />
Hope that makes you happier than the stacking Ceramic Linings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Omg... you too? I was doing the Abysmal pottery refine unlock, and combined it with making unfired ceramic lining and skill up to 199 on casserole dishes.<br />
<br />
Uhoh... I recall sending in some feedback regarding this... why every item in the subcombines as well as the result was stackable, but the unfired wasn't....<br />
<br />
THEY READ /FEEDBACK! OMG! L33T! WOOT!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You whippersnappers don't know how good you got it!  Why, in my day I made cass dishes with nothing stacking!  In fact, when they first came out, not even the sketches stacked!  Hrmmph!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">And in my day casserole dishes weren't even in game.  And you had to go farm zombie skins (for poison vials) because regular pelts weren't stacking either.  So the only way to get stuff for a decent amount of combines was the zombie skins.  Ahhh, you young folks have it so easy these days.  Well...maybe, you also can't hit 102 for 20pp anymore.  &lt;grins&gt;  Either way, it could be worse, it could be better, but I am glad that unfired ceramic linings are stacking for you guys now. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In my day we made pie tins that sold for a nice hefty profit to npc.. um, no wait, I meant we  um, didn't have stackable anything?<br />
/jedi mindtrick These are not the potters you seek.<br />
<br />
Very cool that both stack now however. Big hugs and even bigger beers to whoever did that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>dmuerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Now if they can make the fired versions stack i would be happy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Fired versions have stacked for months, unfired did not, which was rather irritating when trying to figure out your inventory space (but I don't begrudge them, it was worse when I had to do my first toon's pottery and nothing seemed to stack...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Crow's Special Brew works for making poison vials??? When did this start, and how did I not know this!!!! OMG</div></div><hr />

When GoD came out it was found, but it may have been one of the 3000 unsolved recipes.  And it does work very nicely in Abysmal Sea... can leave the pottery vendor open and the wheel at the same time.  Just gotta run upstairs for water.  Or downstairs, I forget.  I just got my enchanter's pottery to 188 yesterday and it was amazingly simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Oh yeah? Well... back in MY day, we didnt even have ZOMBIE skins because those people hadnt even DIED yet to BECOME zombies!<br />
<br />
All we had was dirt and water and we could only make Ashtrays...<br />
<br />
 :irked:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>dmuerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Doh! i had them backwards, woot go planer stiens :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">heh, WTB the ability to make ashtrays.  Then we could have a skill to make smokeable items, and then we could have doctors to cure the cancer that came from it! Oh! A whole new world of tradeskills!  I could open a Brewery/Pharmacy!</div></div><hr />
