<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>reginfred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, I'm looking for help on which class to pick for my first alt, either a ranger or a druid. I know that bards can track and forage too, but I really don't want to play a bard since I like to chat with my friends too much. Anyone care to give their opinions?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It purely depends on your play style.  If you like melee use the ranger, if you like casters get the druid. They are different yet simular in many ways. I would go with whichever class you feel comfortable with. Of course I prefer rangers... ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ancarett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ranger track is far superior (you can sort!) but my playstyle is more caster/healer so I prefer the druid.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>sumamael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well rangers don't need mana to kill mobs, they can melee away, they also have higher tracking cap and can sort and filter the traking list. <br />
<br />
Druids however can port around and that can speed up a lot of stuff. *Port* now I'm at the bank, *Port* now I'm at my farming spot again. <br />
<br />
Bards have the worst tracking and forage skill but they can kite as many mobs with AE songs as much their computer can draw on the screen before freezing.<br />
<br />
If I had to make a choice now I would probably ask myself if I gonna dual box farm and if I do, what kinda char will I have on the 2nd comp. Like if I have a melee already then I would make a druid and if I have a healer then I would make a ranger.<br />
So they balance each other out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nhin Impious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">After 2 years of playing a cleric, I decided to start a druid.<br />
<br />
The filthy little half-elf hasn't set foot outside the bazaar since he hit level 21 months ago.  And he keeps taking a 10% commission on the stuff he sells for me.<br />
<br />
The ranger, on the other hand, seems to get along fairly well with my playing style.  I got used to not porting with Nhinx, so a little walk now and again doesn't bother me.  The only thing I really miss is plate armor.<br />
<br />
Nhinx Aphsion, cleric of Innoruuk<br />
Acthenhar Sl'rinx, ranger of Karana<br />
and Eyith Lemmas, druid and bazaar-mercenary of Tunare</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Silound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Speaking as a bard, bards are the best way to go. Even more so if you plan on doing tradeskills, since we're a complete tradeskill machine. Cumon, how fast can a ranger solo 35 wyverns and a few drakes in CS compared to a bard's 2 minutes? How many more groups wants bards &gt; rangers anyway?</div></div><hr />
