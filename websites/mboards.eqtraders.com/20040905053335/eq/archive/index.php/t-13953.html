<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Celegorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">All this talk of saving me time fletching my arrows got me excited....<br />
<br />
And when I opened a brew barrel , pottery wheel, and forge up - I saw the UI.<br />
<br />
However...when I open my fletching kit...no luck...drat.<br />
<br />
Any ideas what I'm doing wrong ?<br />
<br />
*edit *<br />
This is with a Collapsable fletching kit btw</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">OK was about to ask Which fletching kit (there are several)... <br />
<br />
Someone else reported a similiar issue with the collapsible mixing bowl.<br />
<br />
Try the following:<br />
<br />
Close EVERY CONTAINER you have.<br />
Open your Inventory Window<br />
Right Click your Collapsible Fletching Kit<br />
<br />
(did you see the new UI?)<br />
<br />
YES - Good... problem solved.<br />
<br />
NO -<br />
a. Close the Collapsible Fletching Kit<br />
b. Hold down the CTRL key, and Right Click the Collapsible Fletching Kit<br />
<br />
(did you see the new UI?)<br />
<br />
YES - Problem solved<br />
<br />
NO - Report back.<br />
<br />
Supposedly the new UI is only available on one container at a time.<br />
<br />
But could still be a bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think a few things were buggy. <br />
Right now on Test Server, a Mortar and Pestle doesnt bring up the new UI. I know brew barreal and Forge were working, but  i didnt check anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1. Mortar and Pestle worked on Veeshan.<br />
2. Word has it the collapseable DONT work with the UI you need the regular version of fletchign kit, tailoring kit, etc.<br />
3. Make SURE you try both right click and CTRL right click before posting it doesnt work 90% of problems are fixed by this.<br />
<br />
I did love the WHERE IS MY STUFF!!! I hear din ooc when ppl logged on Tuesday. First I was polite then after clicking my /ooc CTRL right click it macro 20 times I got tired of it and had some fun with people ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Duas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Had the same problem till I realized I was opening it from my bank, as soon as I put it in my inventory it worked fine....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ceinwein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The type of kit apparently does matter.<br />
<br />
My wood elf friend was trying to use his fier'dal kit and got nada.<br />
Switched to regular and violia!<br />
<br />
As of right now cultural fletching is not recognized by the new UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Collapsibles do work with the new UI.<br />
<br />
I have one of everything for me, and I can verify that the mixing bowl, mortar &amp; pestle, sewing kit, and fletching kits all work.<br />
<br />
Right click, summon the kit.<br />
<br />
Put the kit in an inv slot, right click (or ctrl-right click) and open them.<br />
<br />
It is true that you can onyl have one new UI open at a time, but you can open others and do combines with the old method.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Suggestion --<br />
<br />
If you always keep your summoned fletching kit open, destroy it (the summoned one) and re-summon it if it has been summoned since before the patch.<br />
<br />
Might be something in the programming for that, since it's summoned?<br />
<br />
(Just a thought)</div></div><hr />
