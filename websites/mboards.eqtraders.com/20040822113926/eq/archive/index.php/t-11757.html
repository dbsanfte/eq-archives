<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Corril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anybody able to share their experiences with regards to success rates on the elemental bows? Is it something like 1 in 3, or slightly better?<br />
<br />
Personally I am 1 from 1 (stonewood), and am wondering if I should push my luck.. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Osprey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think over the long haul it'll average out to about 50/50. Rarely does Sony put anything in for a tradeskill combine that has less than a 50% success rate - it seems to be the lowest they'll go.<br />
<br />
Now granted this is somewhat anecdotal from reading over various threads scattered across trades and time but I think it's as good a guess as any, given actual statistics are scarce.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pondlife</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For what its worth, with 252 skill (inc. geerlock), I am 1 for 2 on the Thunderbolt which like the elemental bows is &gt;250 trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xyphen Stormleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I do the elemental combines for my guild.  Have 243 fletching with GMFK.  I get bout 50percent success rate on them. <br />

<br />
Now this is still total speculation and possibly luck:<br />
If i combine Shaped Shadewood compunds (shadewood, plane, 2 cams, silk) until I fail one and then combine the elemental bow, i think im 9/10 or so. Only failed one with that method.<br />
<br />
*shrug*<br />
<br />
Expensive, but scuccessful enough for me to keep trying it that way till i see otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>naeadas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Air bows = 7/11<br />
Earth Bows = 7/9<br />
Water Bows = 1/1<br />
Fire Bows = 1/1<br />

250 Fletching with trophy, not doing anything special just equip trophy and go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dayhel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">After getting two 250 a few weeks ago.  I tried one bow for the guild failed.  But 2 bows for guildmates both sucecess.  Of course when I get my parts I probably fail my own bow but atm I am 2 for 3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same way, 4 for 5:<br />
<br />
Stonewood 3/4<br />
Obsidian 1/1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Malodium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">with 250 skill + geerlok i attempted 5 Air bows the other day and only succeeded in making one of them.  Really sucked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Corril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">To follow up on my own post.. I am now 2/4 on Stonewood, and 4/5 on Eternal Tempest. Kinda wish it were the other way around..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Galain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">250 + trophy.  Think I fail about 1 in 4.  I know I've done over 20 bows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ranger_Lahru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd like to see more people post about this .. I have the parts for my stonewood but my fletching is still at 225 + Trophy ... I have the parts for about 200 Acrylia arrow combines so I'm going to see how close to 250 I can get with that ... I'd really like to see statistics on people that have done or attempted to do the combines on these bows Prior to 250 ... so far with a skill ranging form 215 to 225 I have succeeded 4/4 on the Blessed Faydark Thunderbolt which is also &gt;250 trivial</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kongming</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">there is no reason to combine before having maxxed mod skill.  Trust me the money it cost you to max fleching more then makes up for the eazy of mind to even try on a item worth so much.  How would you feel if you tried at modded skill of 240 or so and fail, then you are left to ponder if i spent the 10k to get those last 10 points that you might of had a nice bow in your hands and not nothing.  Remember these aren't eazy items to farm for.  It not like acrilya or something that eazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Iilane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">0/4 stonewood compound bows.. I'm unlucky :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>mistmetunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">currently im at 5/6 stonewoods<br />
<br />
i haven't had a chance to try any of the other bow's</div></div><hr />
