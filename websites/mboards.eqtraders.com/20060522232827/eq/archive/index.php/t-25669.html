Stupid me, I didn't notice that the sleeves I needed to make were SMALL Acrylia Chain Sleeves and needed a SMALL chainmail sleeve pattern.<br />
<br />
Fudge.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just wanted to warn people that regular sleeves don't satisfy the requirement ;)</div></div><hr />

Go go reading comprehension. :D</div></div><hr />

Then after getting it all right I failed the combine!<br />
<br />
Blew over 5 kpp on stupidity and then another 5 kpp on bad luck before I got it right.<br />
<br />
Make sure you get all the right molds and ore/gems combined properly on the GoD combines.  That one hurts.</div></div><hr />

I failed to notice the difference between velium and pale velium of the otherwise same name and made the wrong one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Estebar</div><div class="date">03-15-2006, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, made a large chain mail instead of a large chain mantle.  Had to go out and buy another windstone and essence of wind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quesci</div><div class="date">03-15-2006, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like it is a good lesson to learn with quests.  I'm sure I've learned that lesson three or four times over in my EQ life, and I still do it.<br />
<br />
The good news is that the new Expert trophy quest removed the pale velium longsword and the velium gemmed stiletto.  A second acrylia BP is a strange replacement (making one regular and one small seems kind of redundant but is a welcome change).  The other added item is a magnetic bracer -- easy enough, but I just made one yesterday!  I hadn't even sold it yet.  So I had to go out and buy another cracked bracer.  Again, LOTS better than a velium gemmed stiletto, but frustrating.</div></div><hr />

Hope you don't think I was complaining, big guy.  I got my trophy the same day, so I was very happy.<br />
<br />
Now I just need to find an alchemist for my bola for tailoring and I am done with all trophies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tokkyl</div><div class="date">03-17-2006, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also be sure to check for ALL types of subcombines or FINAL products on the subcombines for a recipe.<br />
<br />
I've been trying to get a Chunk Of Broken Taelosian Stone Worker to make the ceramic bola weight for Concussive Bola to finish my Expert Tailoring trophy for over a week - no luck in bazaar or getting to drop.  One shows up in /bazaar for 2k so I ran and bought it as I finally saw the light at the end of the tunnel.  Tad bit frustrated when a few minutes later I checked and somebody was selling a FINISHED bola weight for 2pp!:faint:  At that point had to make it myself from scratch since paid the 2k for the chunk, at which time I noticed the pottery recipe makes 3 so the 2pp person was obviously successful on first combine!<br />
<br />
DUH!  Hindsight is 20/20.</div></div><hr />

My own stupid fault.</div></div><hr />
