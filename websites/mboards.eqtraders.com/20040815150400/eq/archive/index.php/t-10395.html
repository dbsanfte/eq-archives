<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gwendoline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got 250 Brewing over the weekend, and a set of Shears off Shei this week and figured I'd do some skill up's while raiding and really bug the heck out of the people I normally group with ;)<br />
<br />
Made up some Celestial Essence, bought some Soda and packets of Paeala Sap and I was omw to a raid and tried to do a combine in the portable brew barrel....no luck &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Anyone else try this combine and not have it work or is it just me?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I assume the portable brew barrel is for the Aid Grimel quest. In which case it's not a &quot;brew Barrel&quot; per se. The combine button on the container will only work for the quest combine that you turn in.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gwendoline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">According to some older documentation I had read you could do any combine in the portable one that you could do in a normal brew barrel (it was 'broken').  I'm figureing that it's because the combine for the Etheral Curing Agent must be done in a Tannan Brew Barrel is the reason the combine wouldn't work.<br />
<br />
I later went on to find out the combines have to be done in a Tannan Loom for the Silks and Leathers for ornate.  At least I had some time last night ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the Gratz's :)</div></div><hr />
