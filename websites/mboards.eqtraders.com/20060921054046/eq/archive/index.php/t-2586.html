I just wonder will the gap between the Trail and your currently skill effect the skill up? <br />
the smaller of them will you gain the skill up faster ?<br />
<br />
for example : <br />
I am at skill 100 now, <br />
if I do a trail 110 combine, will I use less combines than do a trail 250 combine to reach my skill 110 ? or simply depend on the number of the combines ?<br />
anyone have idea ? thanks a lot</div></div><hr />

a ) They are cheaper<br />
b ) Components are easier to come by<br />
c ) You dont have to have as many components <br />
d ) You get less of a headache from the start<br />
<br />
If you are at that lvl then do<br />
<br />
crystalline silk armor to trivial <br />
<br />
then go to <br />
<br />
Wu's fighting armor to trivial<br />
<br />
After that there are many opnions as to the fastest and easiest way to skill up and all of then have their own frustrations.</div></div><hr />

Correction:  All of them ARE frustrations  :P <br />
<br />
Definatly stick to things closer to your skill level.<br />
<br />
The only reason people make Ceremonial Solstice robes to skill up past 158 is due to the fact that the only thing you have to farm is spider silk which comes in mass quantities in EK and you only need 6 silks per combine.  Everything else is vendor sold.  HOWEVER, Solstice robes are a horrendously expensive way to skill up, but most anyone would agree that it's the easiest way when cost is not factored in.</div></div><hr />
