Anyway, I think it is time for me to start looking for upgrades to Gore's armour.  While Crusty is nice, I don't think that is what you want to be wearing at level 54 while your dancing with PoP mobs.<br />
<br />
My question, should I look at Fierce Healdic armour or Crimson Darkscale armour as my upgrade path?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kuronekosama</div><div class="date">02-13-2003, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a breakdown for you for a set of each:<br />
<br />
Crimson Darkscale:<br />
353ac<br />
40str<br />
15sta<br />
15dex<br />
10agi<br />
10wis<br />
5int<br />
645hp<br />
215 mana<br />
10 to all saves<br />
<br />
Fierce Heraldic:<br />
327ac<br />
40dex<br />
35agi<br />
15sta<br />
10str<br />
5int<br />
840hp<br />
10 to all saves<br />
<br />
Personally, I think the heraldic is better- more HP and melee stats - str is nice and all but dex helps more for weapon proc and aggro - and can't argue with almost 200 more HP - the increased agi helps offset the ac difference some as well.  Of course I am a lil bit biased as I'm a human smith but those are the numbers ^^ hehehe Can I sign you up for an order? =D</div></div><hr />

I have outfitted every fatty war of substance in our guild initially and never heard any complaints about the mana from them (though I prolly would of beaten em with my hammer if I did).<br />
