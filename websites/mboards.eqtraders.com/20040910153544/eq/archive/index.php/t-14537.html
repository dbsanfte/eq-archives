<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Poohjure</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am in the tailoring drive right now and have gotted it up to 206.  I have a ton of solstice robes sitting in my bank waiting for me to decide what i want to do with them.<br />
<br />
I have 3 options...<br />
<br />
1)  Stick them on a bazaar mule to try and sell for 25-50pp each. The economy is mass flooded with Robes.<br />
<br />
2) Sell them to a vendor for ONLY 17pp.<br />
<br />
3) Give them to my tribute master for ONLY 37Tribute points.<br />
<br />
Is it just me or did the nerfage of tradeskill items go just a tad far?  A 335 trivial item that costs approx 1000pp to make and you only get 37 freakin' points from it?  I just do not understand the logic in that.  I can understand an item like animated bait being worth nothing, but items that require very high skills to complete should give higher reward.  I really dont think my logic is flawed in this.<br />
<br />
Just a tad Frustrated,<br />
<br />
--Pooh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personally I was shocked to see that the Sickles which sell for 1kish on most servers, earn 1.3k tribute and robes which sell for 200pp on servers only get 30ish tribute points. Kind of unbalanced, but I assume this was to keep people from mass skilling on robes to get the tribute points in return. Since the return is minimal tailoring is still a pain or a money pit ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
A Thousand plat?  Ouch!  That seems very high.  Here's what I figure:<br />
<br />
embroidering needle: I made an embroidering needle from metal bits I made myself in 37 tries, starting at smithing 0.  It cost about 40 plat all told, so I put the cost of this at 40 pp, since you can make it yourself for this cost in about 20 minutes and you get it back when you use it, so you only need to do it once.<br />
<br />
gem studded chain: this is tougher, but still it's possible to get it yourself for less than 1000 pp.  Assuming two each of ruby sapphire and emerald, and two worked silver chains (2 enchanted bars of silver and metal bits you'll have left over from the needle), you'll have to pay a total for materials of:<br />
<br />
2 rubies: 270 pp.<br />
2 sapphires: 209 pp.<br />
2 emeralds: 27 pp.<br />
...and about 2 pp for the rest.<br />
<br />
Total: 508 pp.  This assumes the going rate of 50 percent failure on the chains for your jewelcrafter.  Add to this whatever you pay the crafter for the attempts.  For the enchanted silver bars, you can build an enchanter and level him up to level 9 in about two hours, and then enchant your own bars from then on.  Or, you can add 10 pp per chain for the bars that you can buy in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
I also assume you're a good enough smith to make your own silver chains.  If not, then you'll have to buy them, but it'd cost less than 1000 plat to get your own skill up to 100 (about 90 percent success for the chain), so don't pay a fortune.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, the costs per attempt, assuming you fail:<br />
<br />
1 tunic pattern: 1 pp. (rounding here)<br />
3 jars of acid: 2 pp.<br />
6 poison vials: 3 pp.<br />
6 scent of Marr: 9 pp.<br />
6 spider silks: free.  C'mon!  One krag spider can have six silks, but even on the average, four kills will net you this number..  Farm them yourself, instead of spending 10 pp each.<br />
3 emeralds: 41 pp.  Add to this whatever you need to pay to bum imbues.  Remember that wood elf druids can also do this imbue, so don't just harass your high elf cleric friends.<br />
<br />
Total for this, assuming you can convince someone to do your imbues for 2 pp a gem: 62 pp.  This assumes no failures on the sacred silk, but frankly, if you fail the silk too often, you really shouldn't be considering robes anyway.  It also assumes you can make your own blessed dust of Tunare, but as the guides here will show, you can get over 100 pottery for about 30 pp.<br />
<br />
Now, that grand total, assuming all costs for one attempt: 40 pp (needle) plus 528 (chain) plus 62 (disposables): 630 pp.  If you fail, the next attempt is only 62 more.  If you fail 7 times, you'll have spent 1000 pp.  That's a 14 percent success rate, on average.  I leave the formula to those better in math than me, but at higher levels (where you're looking to make the robe, not just skill up on it) I suspect the success rate is higher than 1 in 7.  If it's 1 in 2 like most 335 combines seem to work out,  that works out to (even assuming 1 in 3) 714 pp each, considering the cost of the needle is one-time.<br />
<br />
Or, you can buy them in the Bazaar for less than half that much, but I won't open that wound...<br />

<br />
This is my disagreement, because it doesn't address relative costs, or difficulty except for the combine.  Misty Thicket picnics and Bristlebane's Party Platter have the same trivial.  Shadewood recurve and Nightmarewood compound bows have the same trivial.  Platinum diamond rings and Electrified Earrings of Tempest have the same trivial level.  If these pairs had the same tribute levels (ignore for a bit that the platter is nodrop), I'd be stunned.  By the same token, I'm sure that Solstice robes and storm rider leathers have comparable trivials, but they're not similar in any other way.<br />
<br />
To be blunt, robes are a very cheap 250 plus tailoring combine.  They're a widely used skillup path because of this, and because getting the components is relatively very easy compared to other top-shelf tailoring.  The end result is arguably the worst hand-tailored robe in the game (name anyone who could possibly build it who would ever consider wearing it for more than a minute to see how it looks), and it only has value to players because it's a component in a quest.  Put these things together and it doesn't really surprise me that it's worth a pittance as tribute.<br />
<br />
The big picture does have some flaws in it, but I've found that on the whole, the difficulty to craft an object is only a small part of its value as tribute, and that makes sense.  I think it's reasonable to expect a black acrylia halberd to be worth more to the Tribute Master than a pair of shadowscream steel boots, even though they're about the same difficulty to make.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Reflan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't find the solstice robes cheap at all.  The failure rate on the gem studded chains is extraordinarily high for me even with 250 in jewelry.  I'm also 250 in everything else btw, and recently made 250 tailor.<br />
<br />
But it cost me closer to 400k than 300k, and I imbued my own emeralds, made most of my celestial essences etc., foraged and hunted a LOT of my own components and collected some literally over a period of years of playing.  <br />
<br />
The gem studded chains failure rate was so high that I regularly made only, say, one in six or worse.  I could easily spend 2k per chain, and did many times.<br />
<br />
That's why I was able to sell my remaining stock at 2700 and even 3000pp for the chains.  Chains are notoriously hard to make unless you're a chanter with JC AA's.<br />
<br />
Once you get to a certain level in tailoring, your click to skill up on robes turns extremely often into a robe that is either almost unsellable(some people sell them to vendors, some sell them for next to nothing in the bazaar, and of course on some servers people sell them for a few hundred still).  So you turn what can be K's worth of components into an item that sells for very very little or sometimes nothing.  <br />
<br />
To me it's hard to imagine anyone at all doing solstice robes for tribute value even if they raised the tribute point value 10x or 20x or more.  I know I sure wouldn't.  No way, forget it.  It's a very time consuming, long slow process, from hunting the spider silks and imbuing the emeralds all the way down the line.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, you're right, if you get a failure rate of five in six on chains.  For my chainmaker, who is 250 plus trophy but no AAs, the rate or success is about one in three over the long run (and he's made hundreds of chains, so his numbers are large enough to use for estimation).  Still, the spider silk, which drops off of mobs a fifth level character can tackle, are the only component in the whole robe that can't be bought from a vendor.  Assuming you need at least a friend or mercenary who can imbue the emeralds, that's still much easier than other tailoring combines at this level, which can involve hunting large numbers of creatures that can run level 50 characters to the zone line.  This is why so many people use it for a skillup route.  The other benefit is that until you get to about 200, the failure rate for making them is high, and a failure is cheap as dirt compared to acrylia reinforced gear or Velious combines.  Again, this is why so many people do the robes.  The last effect is that lots of people are making lots of robes that have only one single use, and that use is realistically limited to one robe per person needing it, so the market gets flooded with robes that were made for skillup purposes, not for robe-making purposes.  Therefore, because the robe is not that useful, tribute value is low, and because there are so darn many of them, sell price is awful too.<br />
<br />
All this goes toward your statement that nobody would build them for tribute value, and I agree, but then I don't know anyone who does any high end tailoring of any kind for the tribute.  They do it for practice, or to get the end item.  The tribute is a nice aftereffect, but not an end goal in itself for this skill.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sulkano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Im not sure why this is an issue at all...before GoD, robes were worth zero (0) tribute points, as was everything else. While I will happily join in the argument that Aid Grimel did serious damage to TS'ing as a whole, complaining that they fixed something that was so obviously broken is out of line. If you dont like what the tribute master offers, dont hit accept...its as simple as that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>baody</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have no problem with the tribute price. Tailoring is a trade skill. It should be all about what you can make and what profit you can expect from it, not about being on a trade skill leveling treadmill/ pp sink so you can finish a quest.<br />

Sorry, maybe I just have funny ideas.</div></div><hr />

My new farm target is Blade of Insanity, GE drop post revamp that's easily soloable by a 65 shaman and worth over 10k tribute a piece. Several other nice things drop from the GE trash named too.</div></div><hr />

And how did Aid Grimel ruin tradeskilling? <br />
<br />
Without going into a lot of detail, when supply is increased (by adding more tradeskillers), then prices go down - basic supply and demand.<br />
<br />
In the same way, if you add people that aren't motivated by money (AG tradeskillers) that can distort markets as well.<br />
<br />
Lastly, and this isn't a side effect of AG as such, by making tradeskills potentially profitable, you get people that ignored them as a waste of time to enter the market since it is now profitable to do so, increasing supply and lowering prices.  These are evil undercutters, who may be associated with baby eating ubers, and they must be sought out and destroyed by everyone who knows the top secret &quot;real tradeskillers handshake.&quot;  Or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Between Aid Grimel and the TSUI, servers are seeing more and more of these kinds of conversations: <br />

Skills are being achieved without the corresponding knowledge of the skill. Sure you can have 250 + trophy, but if you don't know that FF5k is BOUGHT... /sigh.

Why would that matter?  I would find the idea of a GM baker buying stuff from me because he doesn't want to make it himself as extremely heartening, since it means there's still a market for lower end goods.  And what difference does it make if someone is a GM brewer but doesn't know FF5000 is a vendor bought item?  Again, it would seem like a business opportunity, not something to be depressed about.  For someone who's always bought Fizzlecutter in the Bazaar, it would be a reasonable assumption that it's brewed, and someone who has GMed brewing doesn't need to know all brewing recipes to do it (for example, how many GM brewers even know how to brew a bile temper?) so put them together and you can come up with someone like the person you sold it to.  To say that person's &quot;not worthy&quot; because of something like this smacks of elitism.<br />

Ah, here's the rub.  Brand dilution, as it were.  The question you have to ask yourself is, why does it matter that there are more GM whatevers than there were before?  If it's because that somehow reduces your esteem with the general populace, then you should do some thinking on why you're a tradeskiller to begin with.  I suspect that, like most of us, you do tradeskills because you love doing tradeskills.  Sure, it's great to turn a profit at it, but did you really do it for profit?  If not, then just being a GM skiller will have to carry you through.  Saying that other GM skillers are somehow less important because they did it for some reason other than the love of this part of the game is really unfair to them.  They did the work, even if it was easier because of the new UI, and even if the motivation was for an earring.  Not only do they not reduce your achievement, they do tend to burn out, leaving GM bakers who buy patty melts.<br />
<br />
In short, more GMs is a good thing.  Anything that helps a broader audience enjoy tradeskilling is a good thing.  Sure it cuts into profits, but again, did you do it for the money?<br />
