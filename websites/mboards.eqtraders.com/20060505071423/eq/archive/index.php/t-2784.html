Having spent much time under the harsh tutelage of Fish Ranamer in South Qeynos, I have successfully completed and received my Grand Master Brewer's certificate! I am available for any and all brewing combines in any quantity! You want 10 stacks of Kaladim Constitutionals for a huge raid? I gotcha covered! 5 stacks of Qeynos Afternoon Tea, because going to the moon makes your stomach hurt? No problem! Need someone to combine that Tainted Avalanche Ale for you? I'm over 10 combines now, and have yet to fail! If you desire anything of me, feel free to contact me, and we will work out a deal!<br />
