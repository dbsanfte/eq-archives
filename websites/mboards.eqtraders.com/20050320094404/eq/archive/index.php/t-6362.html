This is a hard quest.  You can buy some of the items for the merchants in frog City.  The rest of the items I bid you good luck.  These items are hard to find in the swamp.  Plan on spending some time looking for items.  I don't think you should start looking until your at least LvL 15.  There are a few monsters in the swamp that will put the hurt on you real quick.  Most are on the upper part of the swamp.  Make sure you look on this site for the items you will need for your quest.  Bull Ally spines are a rare drop from what I have seen.  Have killed many and only have one right now.  I just found out thanks to this site that the &quot;Amulet from an undead froglok&quot; is the tailsman.  I have complete the gauntlets and the boots now.  You can buy a gaint snake fang or kill a gaint water mocc.  Well good luck.<br />
