<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Foulsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Whats the best/easiest way to get to 220 skill from 148? IM working on the Aid Earring and have spent most of my savings doing the smithing. Any help/tips would be apreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rissenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can do &quot;Casserole sketches&quot; up to 199. Each sketch cost around a plat or so.<br />
After that several options exist, but I would go with the &quot;Opal encrusted stein's&quot; Each combine cost around 20pp and can sell for 20-50+ depending on server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, since you're looking for speed, and you're hurting for money, you have some options.  First, if you prefer farming, doing poison vials (there are three kinds; you want Lined and Sealed) will get you to 188.  Then you can make casserole dishes to 199, or of course you can just make casseroles all the way to 199.  The only place to get the sketches for casseroles is in the Jaggedpine Forest, so if you're evil you'll need to look up going there from Blackburrow or send someone in to buy them for you.  Also, the casseroles require a ceramic lining, so be prepared to do a lot of move-around work on them as well (that is, it'll take more bag space than most of the smithing you did, so have some room to work).<br />
<br />
Once you've made 199, it gets tougher to do pottery without a good bankroll.  You can get to 222 without spending a lot, but that assumes you'll spend a lot and then get it back on resales, so if you're lacking on time to sell the few hundred opal encrusted steins you'll make, it'll cost a lot more.  For the cheaper, but more time-intensive route, look up doing crucibles of escape.  They're only expensive if you fire them, since it's the glaze that costs a lot, so you can make them for about 8 pp per attempt assuming you farm your own heavy clay.  Be sure to look for other information here about farming that heavy clay, since there are good hints to speed your progress in that regard.  Since crucibles go to 236, you can conceivably go all the way to 222 this way.<br />
