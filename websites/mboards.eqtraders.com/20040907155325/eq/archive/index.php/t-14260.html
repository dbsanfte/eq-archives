<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There is a Dark Elf Fisherman in Abysmal Sea on the platform of the boat where we all fish. I believe he spawns and is not there all the time, unless I haven't noticed I could be wrong. <br />
I hail him and he gives a sarcastic comment back (i am a wood elf druid so maybe race specific).<br />
Does anyone know what he is for? He cons red to a lvl 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The fisherman all wander back and forth from the pub to their fishing posts.  Denuval (I think that is the DE's name) mentions the glowing fish with scales like gems when he is in the pub telling stories.  Hakon (I think) is the barbarian fisherman who lost his coin purse.  <br />
<br />
Hang out in the pub a bit and listen to the conversations - they are a lot of fun although I don't know if they are just fish stories or leads for quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is a room where the bakers and brewers hang out on the boat. There is a group of Fisherman representing most of the races. They stand in a circle holding their fishing poles. I am sure these are also quest related but im not sure for what.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>illovich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">there may be a quest involving him, as he sighs, clearly disappointed and looks through a bag for his favorite lure. Perhaps there's some new, unfound lure recipes lurking in GoD.<br />
<br />
Or perhaps, it's just something to ponder while you farm fish and/or plat in AS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rendael Brigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">He doesnt look through his bag looking for lures.<br />
<br />
It says he removes the hook from his line and attaches an ornate fishing lure.<br />
<br />
That is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Azirux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No, it's not all. There are multiple messages. One of which is him emoting what illovich pointed out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KanadWinterstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm very interested in this the more I dig into it, since it looks like there's something we're missing with the fishermen. One of them tells you that you should talk to Chef Chowderly, but he gives the ominous &quot;you must prove your dedication&quot; message when hailed. At least one of the fishermen give the same message, the dwarf.<br />
<br />
Anyone been able to get them talking? I sure haven't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yep each of them tell different stories with different parts when they are in the pub.  They won't talk much outside of it.  I'll try and grab their fish stories from my logs and post them tonight.  <br />
<br />
I am hoping that there is a more involved quest (but accessible) buried in the stories and maybe Chowderly is waiting for me to improve one of the boat factions before he'll talk.  So far none of the boat quests seem to do any faction changes though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tricsun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Maybe after the baking begginer quest?  I noticed that the book that you get from that is written by chowderly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kunriis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No, I did all the GoD tradeskill secret quests and the Chef and the fisherman still wont talk to me. Also the guys who guard the Grozmok Stone over by Morden Rasp wont talk to me. <br />
<br />
I have a theory that all these guys are in the Wayfarers Brotherhood and you must have tons of wins in LDoN before they will talk to you more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">OK here is what I managed to capture from all the fish stories and things the fishermen do (I edited out the bar orders and tried to note repeated lines since the post is very long). I think the repsonses to hailing them are the four at the bottom along with my fellow halfling's desire to see a sea monster. These dialogues were captured over a bunch of days so order is meaningless anyhow - I think they just randomly respond to each other.  (Just edited this to put some continuing tales together.)<br />
<br />
<br />
============<br />
Iawgom Umzzig snickers and asks, 'Is that all? Heck, last week I pulled up this tiny little fish. Didn't seem like much, so I dropped it into my bucket with the rest of my catch, figurin' it might be a delicacy that Chowderly could make into somethin'. After a minute I hear splashing in the bucket. Then the bucket starts to move, bouncing around like there's a tiger stuck in there. Before I can get anyone to come over and look at it, the thrashing stops. So I carefully open the lid and all that's there is a froth of fish parts and that one tiny little fish. I kicked the bucket into the water and went home to rest.'<br />
<br />
Devolnu Solahpeka attaches some bait to his hook and casts his line into the water.<br />
<br />
Devolnu Solahpeka says 'Of all the things to happen. I was pullin' in another good-sized salty when my coin purse fell outta my pocket and right into the water! I have the worst luck.'<br />
<br />
Haon McClure looks down into his drink and taps it on the table before speaking, 'I pulled up the prettiest fish I ever saw today. It was only about a foot or so, but it was all shiny and reflected all the colors of the rainbow. Actually, it didn't so much reflect as it glowed. When I reached down for it, it twitched and unhooked itself. I watched it fall back into the sea. It looked like it was made of jewels.' (Devolnu also said this.)<br />
<br />
Devolnu Solahpeka says 'Why, that's a pretty impressive story, but that ain't nothing' compared to what happened a few months ago. Them magical types will pay a lot for the right kind of squid ink. I was a squid hunter, diving at one of my secret places when I felt a tug on my rebreather. I don't normally need a rebreather, but I was goin' deep after the black-spotted squid. You ain't heard of the black-spotted squid? Well you ain't very educated then. This squid ripped my mask right off my face! I could last ten minutes without it, even fighting with a squid the size of a wolf, so I wasn't worried. Then the momma squid shows up! She was as big as a Drogmor! Well, I had no choice, I crooned to them. Yes, I said crooned. Don't you know nothin' about squids? I just used the rest of my air to make the sounds of the deep ocean. That calms them right down. I slid out of the grasp of the baby squid and started up. I thought about killing them, but it seemed like a shame to kill such a magnificent creature.' (Stu also said this.)<br />
<br />
Barny Magmilg scoffs 'I expected better from you. I'm not saying that what you just said is less than the truth, but only because I know there are more amazing things in the world. Have you ever been ice fishing? I didn't think so. I have, but only once. I was traveling alone in the northlands with my favorite dog, my best rod and an axe. I settled in, cut the hole I needed, and started writin' limericks in my head to pass the time. It was so cold that I had to keep clearin' the hole every ten minutes! It wasn't but an hour later when I felt a bite and gave the line a tug. The line tugged back so hard that I slipped on the ice and went right into the hole! Whatever had me pulled me straight down.'<br />
Barny Magmilg says 'Now, I wasn't about to let go. I never give up. So I started reelin' in the line. It was getting' darker, so I was only a few feet behind the fish when I could see that it was a twenty-foot swordfish! It was swimming hard for the bottom for a few minutes when it suddenly stopped. I could see below it that there was something glowin' down there. They looked like lights in the windows of Freeport when you come home off the sea in a heavy fog. I could swear that I even saw people walkin' in the streets down there, ghostly lookin' folk. Well, the fish was scared an' turned to swim away. So I grabbed it by the gills and pulled with all my might. I got one hand on either side of it, both holdin' on to its gills, and I rode that monster straight up to the surface. There was no hole left! Well, I had to break off that fish's nose with my bare hands to cut my way out. I sorta felt sorry for that fish, havin' ta deal with the other swordfish without his sword from that day on.''<br />

Iawgom Umzzig casts his line into the waters below.<br />
<br />
Haon McClure lets out a sigh of frustration as he casts his line out into the dark waters below.<br />
<br />
Stu Girbnol says 'Thanks for sharing that story. If you were as good of a fisherman as I am, you might have managed it better. Why, a few days ago I even managed to catch two fish on one hook! That's right, I was usin' yer standard hook with a simple worm for bait. I dropped it in where I saw these two fish floatin' around. I dropped the bait between them so accurate that they bit it at the exact same moment. One expert yank on the pole and I had that hook through both of them. Pulled 'em both up and plopped them in my sack.' (Haon also said this)<br />
<br />
Devolnu Solahpeka shakes his head and smirks. 'That's a sad story, pal, but you should be happy to be you today. Me, I pulled up this fine lookin' tuna. Musta been fifty stone! The thing was so heavy that I could hardly carry it and I ain't no weakling. I was takin' it to Chowderly when I lost my grip. Darn heavy fish to land on yer foot. It bounced right off my foot and over the deck.' (Iawgom and Barny also said this.)<br />
<br />
Haon McClure says 'What a tale! If I hadn't experience something even more amazing, I might be tempted to call you a liar. I'll never forget what happened to me when I was just a lad. My family has a long tradition on the sea. When I was just ten I caught my first eight-foot tuna! That ain't the story I want to tell ya. When I was just twenty my pa retired and left me his boat, the Typhoon. On my very first trip out alone I met a mermaid. Yup, one of them women with fish for the bottom half. She promised me three wishes if I would help her. Of course I said I'd help her. She told me that she had dropped one of her pearls into the ocean and had lost it. If I could bring it back, she'd grant me my wishes. Why, I dove right in. It took some searchin' but I found it. The pearl was lodged between the teeth of the largest whale I'd ever seen. That whale was just sittin' there at the bottom of the sea with its mouth gaping open, like it was waitin' for me. I was tempted to leave it there, but that lovely fish-lady needed my help.'<br />
Haon McClure says 'So I swam down and tried to pry that pearl out. The whale surged forward and swallowed me whole! What? How did I get out? Why, I . . . I could tell that it was hungry, so told it that if it would let me go, I'd feed it. The whale wasn't willing, so I had to prove my good word. I cut off my left arm with my knife and let it fall down the whale's throat. That convinced the whale of my honesty and it let me out. It followed me and I swear I could hear its stomach grumble as it digested my arm. When I got to the surface, the fish-girl was surprised to see me. So surprised that I knew that the whole thing was a nasty trick and that she couldn't grant no wishes, she just liked feeding sailors to the whale for fun! So I grabbed her with my good arm and threw her into the whale's mouth. That whale was so pleased by the meal that he gave me the pearl -- let me pluck it right out of his teeth. What? My arm . . . oh, yah . . . well, I'll have to tell you the story of the magical healing fish that I caught one day.'<br />
<br />
Iawgom Umzzig says 'You call that interesting? Last summer, I was working on a deep sea boat. We ran into the largest run of tuna any of us had ever seen. They were moving fast and weren't taking any bait. After a few minutes the whole lot of them had gone. We were starin' at each other wonderin' what had happened, when the boat rocked. The water was calm, so we all headed to the rail to see what we'd hit. As I looked over I saw this large round shield hovering just under the surface. I blinked a few times, then realized what I was seeing. That was when the crew started to scream. Tentacles came over the rail and grabbed a few of them. I had no choice -- to save them I had to jump into the water. I dove in with my arms over my head and aimed right at the squid's eye. I felt my hands pierce the fleshy eye up to about the wrist. All I remember after that was a lot of white water and deep rumbling noises. I woke up on the boat some time later. I'm proud to say that we only lost one man that day.' (Barny also said this.)<br />
<br />
Iawgom Umzzig sighs and looks wistfully out at the door. 'I'd feel more sorry for ya, lad, if I hadn't had greater misfortune today myself. I pulled up this ordinary lookin' salty an' decided to have it for dinner. I was guttin' it to pack into my bag an' take home when this ring falls out. I only had a second to see that it was silver, maybe platinum, with a huge green stone set in it. Rolled right off the deck, it did, and right back into the sea. I'm certain it was platinum.' (Haon also said this.)<br />
<br />
Stu Girbnol says 'That's interesting, but did you see that bottle? I sure did. I was up on the rail in my usual spot when it floated past. I couldn't see it too well, this ship bein' as high outta the water at it is, but I swear I could see a tiny ship in it. I raced along the rail for a chance to pull it in, but there was no hope. I wonder if there was little people on the ship . . .' (Iawgom also said this.)<br />
<br />
Stu Girbnol rolls his eyes and looks disgusted. 'Do you believe it? That fool Grumby had his goons stack a bunch of crates right on my favorite spot! Worse, they wouldn't let me work too close to them for fear I'd snick somethin'! Me! We feed those oafs, after all.'<br />
<br />
Stu Girbnol chuckles, 'You have the worst luck, lad, but then, you shouldn't rely so much on luck. You need to learn how to fish! Why if I needed to, I could catch all the fish I wanted using only one fish to start. Not only can I use the fish meat as bait, but I can build a pole and hook outta the bones and use its guts for line!'<br />
<br />
Stu Girbnol rummages through his box of tackle, looking for his favorite lure.<br />
<br />
Barny Magmilg peers over his mug at his fellows and says in a quiet voice, 'I gots something more interestin' to talk about. I volunteered to clear them traps this mornin'. Told 'im I'd only do it if I got half the profit, an' Ixthiz agreed. Well, when I got to the first trap, there was a huge tuna with its tail fin stuck in the slats of the trap. It musta been eight feet! I was about to kill it when it noticed me and panicked. I'll trim Prexus' beard if it didn't just thrash itself free afore I could get it. Of all the rotten luck.'<br />
<br />
Devolnu Solahpeka lets out a sigh of frustration as he casts his line out into the dark waters below.<br />
<br />
Haon McClure says 'Hmmm. I'm sure you left out the interesting part of that story. Maybe next time you'll remember it. You'd never forget what you saw if you were with me a few months ago. I was in Lake Rathe on vacation, just tryin' to relax. I had been having a reasonable day and had caught more than I needed for lunch and dinner. I was making my last cast for the day. I pulled the line back and tossed it far. Just before it hit the water, a huge dark form swept down and grabbed it! It was a bird! The thing must have been twenty feet from wingtip to wingtip. I stood and watched, absently clutching my pole. Suddenly I'm yanked up into the air! In a few seconds I was so far from the ground that the lake was the size of a mug of ale! It was a lucky thing that I was usin' my special heavy-duty line that day. I had to get down and there was only one way to do it. I started lettin' out my line. It took all my strength, but I finally got low enough to drop into the lake. It was a long swim back, but I survived.'<br />
<br />
Barny Magmilg says 'That's nothin'. Why, just last week I had the misfortune of being bumped into the water by Rensik on his rounds. The fellow didn't even notice and just kept on walkin'. I went under pretty deep, considerin' the fall. When I got my bearings I started up. What was odd was the fact that the sun seemed to be directly overhead, but I knew it was nearly dusk. When I got a few feet closer to the surface I realized that it wasn't the sun I was seeing, it was a jellyfish! Before I had noticed I was surrounded by its poisonous tentacles! I knew of only one way out. I released all the air I had in my lungs, blew it right up under the thing. As the bubbles went up, I went down. I just barely managed to dive out from between the stingers and get up to the surface before I drowned.' (Devolnu also said this.)<br />
<br />
Devolnu Solahpeka says 'Very interesting. I've certainly seen more exciting things. Just a few months ago I was in Innothule looking for some rare fish. What fish? That ain't important! This story is about spiders. I was wading through the muck when I was suddenly pulled under the water! Normally there ain't pools that deep in the swamp. This one was the lair of a spider some ten feet across, not countin' the legs! It pulled me under so fast I didn't have time to get a breath. I was ready to fight, but I had no air. I noticed that the thing was shimmering, like it was in a bubble of glass. I knew what it was and stopped resisting. The hairy monster pulled me in. As I got close I was brought inside a bubble of air! I could breath and that meant I could fight. I didn't have any weapons, though, so I started to breath heavy while I struggled to keep from being eaten. With me usin' up all the air, it started to be hard both of us to breath. Soon, it dropped me to race to the surface for air. By the time it got back, I had escaped!'<br />
<br />
Stu Girbnol looks around him and shakes his head. 'That's not much of a story. Why, just last week I ran into the biggest shark ever seen! I was at the dock settling in for the day when I saw a flash in the water. You know me, I never miss a fish once I've seen it. I hooked it right away. Now I'm stronger than most, but this thing just pulled me right off the dock! I'm a fantastic swimmer, but my pole was wrapped up in my belt! I only had a second to get a gulp of air before it dragged me under. A moment later the line slacked and I figured I was fine, but then I see this glint below me, and I feel the water movin'. Out of the darkness comes this shark! It musta been twenty feet long! I grabbed my pole, still stuck in my belt, and jammed it into the shark's eye. The pole musta gone straight through to its brain, 'cause that shark was dead in an instant. I woulda brung it up, but I saw other glints down there and it seemed best to let the others eat the dead shark than have to kill more of them with my pole.'<br />
<br />
Barny Magmilg says 'There's a tale for ya. Did ya see that shark I nearly landed today? Why, it musta been seven feet of teeth. If this ship weren't so high in the keels, I'd have a new necklace o' teeth ta show ya, but my line couldn't carry the weight an' I lost it.'<br />
<br />
Barny Magmilg says 'Flippin' rotten luck. I had a solid salty on the line an' was reelin' it in when that blasted high elf, Barfy, let go right next to me. Surprised me so bad I lost both the fish and my temper.' (Stu also said this.)<br />
<br />
Barny Magmilg grumbles. 'That's a sad, boring tale, matey. I've seen more interesting times. When I was a lad and in my prime, I was a sailor on the deep seas. One day a fierce storm came up and nearly swamped the ship. While pulling three men to safety, I was thrown overboard. I sank a bit and came eye to eye with a gigantic sea serpent! It was seventy or eighty feet long with huge fangs longer than my arm and scales the color of new steel. It was probably causin' the storm. It came at me, but I'm a fast swimmer and I dodged it. It lunged at me time and again, but I evaded. I was startin' to tire after an hour of this, so I came up with a plan.<br />
Barny Magmilg says 'The next time it tried to bite me I swam at it. It missed me and turned on itself to follow. I dodged again and doubled back. After several quick maneuvers I swam away as fast as I could! It lunged at me one last time and with such force that it caught me through the midsection! I looked down to see its fang comin' out of my belly. At the tip was poison deadly enough to kill a whale, but because the fang had gone through me, the poison wasn't in my body. I pulled myself off the fang and looked back to see if my plan had worked. It had! By dodging and turning carefully, and by making it take one fast lunge at me, I managed to tie the beast up in its own coils! I was wounded, but I could make shore. I don't know how long it took that serpent to untangle itself, but it was long enough for me to escape!'<br />
<br />
Devolnu Solahpeka casts his line into the waters below.<br />
<br />
Barny Magmilg says 'That's the best you can do? Have you ever seen one o' those giant turtles they have on Taelosia? Last week one of them paddled out to the dock and scared off all my fish! I had no choice but to get rid of it. I carefully jumped onto its back. I had to be careful, that thing is full of dagger-length spikes! Once on, I rode that thing for hours until it got worn out and started back to the beach. I suppose I coulda killed it and brought it back, but I was a might tired, and decided that it would be too heavy to try to get onto the boat and let it go. Besides, it mighta been a momma turtle.'<br />

Responses to hails:<br />
<br />
Barny Magmilg says 'Hello. I just caught a huge tuna fish! Have you ever tried tuna? It is very good. I give all the tuna I catch to Chef Chowderly. He is the world's best tuna chef. You should go talk to him!'<br />
<br />
Iawgom Umzzig says 'Hello. Iawgom not interested in talking now. You go.'<br />
<br />
Haon McClure says 'Hello to you. I hope your day is going well.'<br />
<br />
<br />
Stu Girbnol says 'Ahh, it is good to see another fisherman around these parts! Pull up a chair, order some ale, and tell us of your greatest fishing adventures!!'<br />
<br />
=====================<br />
Plus another a fellow halfling looking for the sea monster.<br />
<br />
Higbur Fadalbee says 'They asked for volunteers to watch out for monsters, so I raised my hand. I think I even jumped up and down a bit. Who wouldn't! Sure, I've seen monsters. I'm one with the wall, and all that, but Rivervale has no ocean. I've seen a few sea creatures, sure, but a shark isn't a sea monster. I can't wait to see one! Sure, they'll kill it and that's sad, but at least I'll see one. I can't wait!'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dyllwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am hoping that there is a more involved quest (but accessible) buried in the stories and maybe Chowderly is waiting for me to improve one of the boat factions before he'll talk. So far none of the boat quests seem to do any faction changes though. <br />
<br />
I've been having trouble getting Chowderly and some others to talk to me as well. Anyone have any idea what you need to do? Is it somehow related to how many LDoN's you've completed? Or is it tied to the Taelosian factions? Any help would be appreciated :)</div></div><hr />
