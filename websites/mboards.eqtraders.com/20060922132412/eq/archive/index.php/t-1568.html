<br />
- EXCELLENT sabertooth hides<br />
- FLAWLESS rockhopper hides</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mnemosyne</div><div class="date">12-28-2002, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">for exellent sabretooth tiger hides they drop in Ill omen and Overthere off the cats.  Rockhopper hides- flawless and superb- drop a lot of places.  Dawnshroud when the Hoppers are up, Mons Letalis, Scarlet desert... but DSP is the best place to farm them when you can catch them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mnemosyne</div><div class="date">12-29-2002, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well.. all rockhoppers have a chance to drop flawless and superb except greyhoppers.. cause they aren't called rockhoppers.  and all tigers and stuff that looks like tigers have a chance to drop excellent sabertooth tiger hides on Kunark. its on all their drop tables and its a rare drop... not really a certain type taht drops it more you have to kill them all.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username"></div><div class="date">12-30-2002, 01:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In DSP Flawless hides are 'Not' rare.<br />
<br />
Just have a 50/50 chance of the tibe being up, and if you don't have a high level group, you can't make the Hoppers spawn.<br />
<br />
When they are up they drop either a superb or a flawless every 5th kill or so, very common.<br />
<br />
Since superb are also used in tailoring, and more tailors can use them (lower trivial), their price seems to be almost identical (at least on my server) to flawless.  <br />
<br />
So collect superb/flawless, then either find someone needing superb to trade, or just sell in bazaar at 200pp each, and buy flawless for the same... zero net cost thing, doubles hides.<br />
<br />
Last time I was there in 2 hours I had 50 hides, 10 flawless, 10 superb, 10 hq (sold as backpacks 60pp each), 10 medium (sold in bazaar 14pp each), 10 lq (now leather padding to be used later), well, 11's and 9's, but very evenly split up.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

In DSP there is a cave that either has rockhoppers up which is what tailors want or tribals.  There is a named of each type tribal or rockhopper that when killed switches over the spawns to the other.  When the named Age_Old rockhopper is killed the rockhoppers despawn and the triabls inhabit the cave.  When the name tribal is killed(sorry don't know his name) the tribals despawn and the rockhoppers come back.  <br />
<br />
That is what he meant when he said 50/50 chance.  There is a 50/50 chance that the rockhoppers which drop the pelts you want  will be up and not the tribals.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pockets FullOfGold</div><div class="date">12-30-2002, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The name of the mob to be killed in DSP to respawn the Rockhoppers is called Sambata Tribal Leader Garn.  His PH is a mob called Sambata Tribal Keeper.  He is on a 23 Minute spawn time and can be a pain in the butt to spawn.  I've seen the Leader spawn after killing the Keeper once, and been there 10 hours with a Keeper respawning every 23 minutes.<br />
<br />
Kill the Tribal Leader, you get Rockhoppers to spawn.  Kill the Age Old Rockhopper (they spawn in the same spot), and you get the Sambata's to spawn.  As someone said earlier, Tailors who are working Acrylia to skill up want the Rockhoppers to remain when the Age Old spawns and tend to get irked when their Rockhoppers go bye bye.  I know, I've been there a few times hehehe<br />
