<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>canadian_mofo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Somone was telling me today that they dont get any of the stats shown on their tradeskill trophy when they put it in there ammo slot.  Now is this the actual case?  If so is it the way its supposed to be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Correct.  Yes.  Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>canadian_mofo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well that seems pretty stupid wonder why they did that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why cant you put your tunic on your head? I can take my shirt off and wrap it around my skull just fine. I can even use my socks as wristbands. If i put my steel-tipped shoes on my hands and hit you, im sure it would hurt worse then if i had jsut punched you. If i had an earring and then got a nose peircing, and put it in my nose, would it be considered a face item? How about a nipple peircing? A Prince Albert? If i put my rings in my pocket, or on my toes, would i still get the stat bonuses? If my belt is magical, and my weapon isnt, why cant i take my belt off and beat will-o-wisps with it? My helm has spikes on it, why cant i use it as a hand-to-hand wepaon on it? *bonk!* Can i headbutt monsters with the same helm and do damage? I can peirce stuff with a short sword, all i have to do is sharpen the tip. Why cant i do that? Huh huh huh huh huh? Why do snakes kick? What holds skeletons bones together? Duct tape? Why do wolves like wood elf rangers but hate wood elf bards? Doesnt music tame the savage beast? Why why why? Tell me tell me tell me! How can shissar live in The Grey? Snakes need air too. Why cant the druids build portals in Katta Kastellum Seru or near all the cool places i want to go? I got lots of plat, ill help pay for em. How come i can out run wolves, if i have spirit of the Wolf on? Why do i keep playing this stupid game when nothing makes any darn sense?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>canadian_mofo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thats not the point... the trophys say they can go in the ammo slot whereas a tunic states only chest... so if its able to go in the ammo slot why does it not give the stats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nothing in the ammo slot gives stats.  That's the way the ammo slot is designed.  Its original purpose was simply to hold, well, ammo, like arrows or thrown weapons.  As EQ evolved some other items were allowed in the ammo slot, like trophies or horse bridles/drogmor drums, presumably just to give people a convenient place to put those things.  People who have other items they prefer in their primary, secondary, and range slots might like to put the trophy in ammo for convenient clicky access or just to show it off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naeadiene Needsamap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Splunge your creative answer had me cracking up.  I needed that laugh this morning.  Thanks.<br />
<br />
UGH!  I was so looking forward to getting those cha points in from an item in my ammo slot.  /sigh  I am glad I found out now before I made my spoon though.<br />
<br />
Now if the servers will come up and someone will sell a black sapphire I can try to make mine.  :D</div></div><hr />

You can always resell tink/havers to other players for what you spent on em. You cant do that with a trophy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>vwdiesel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wow am I glad I read this thread. I was about to begin preparing for the push to 250 on two characters just so I could have the trophy and throw it in the ammo slot for the stats. EQTC proves invaluable yet again!!<br />
<br />
And thanks also to splunge for the laughs!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Some thrown weapons also have stats, these only work in the ranged slot but can be placed in ammo for extra storage. <br />

I like my brewing trophy and failed my first smithing one today. It is more the triumph (and madness) that makes me want to do it.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand.....I just got to 248 in brewing and it cost me next to nothing.  Assuming I don't fail on the trophy (crosses fingers), the whole thing will cost me only my time and less than 1k pp.  Granted I could sell the gems for the trophy instead of using them, so lets bump that to about 2k.  Even if I fail once, it will still be cheaper than buying one tink or haversack bag let alone a few.  I just can't bring myself spend 5k+ on a bag.....but that is just me.<br />
<br />
Don't you get one real 100%WR bag and unlimited 100%WR no-rent bags from your trophy?<br />
<br />
If I ever get my hands on a Jacinth, I will be the new proud owner of my trophy. :D</div></div><hr />

Urm...  not to nick pick, but...<br />
<br />
8 velium bars @262.5pp = 2100pp<br />
4 rubies @131.2pp = 524.8pp<br />
<br />
That's about 2625pp if you farmed the 4 gems yourself.<br />
<br />
If you've found a cheaper place to get velium bars, please share with the rest of us. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Healblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Don't forget the corking device.  Those aren't cheap, even if you have a pocket tinkerer that can make it for ya at cost.</div></div><hr />

Oops.....I forgot those.:eek: <br />
<br />
Well, OK....I was counting the corking device, but I guess I am off by 2625pp....I guess I better go back to studying the recipe again. :cool: <br />
So it figures to around the cost of one tink bag. Just hope you don't fail and you get the equivalent of a tink bag plus unlimited no-rent versions for heavy lifting.:angel: <br />
<br />
Thanks for the correction....the contrary argument makes a little more sense to me now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">IF you don't fail.<br />
<br />
3 tries for Brewing<br />
1 failure so far for smithing<br />
<br />
(Yes, I'm going for the 1750 + 7 trophy club :-p)</div></div><hr />
