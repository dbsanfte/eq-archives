2) Pristine Tae Ew Scales.  Currently offering 3k each, willing to pay a bit more than that for multiples.<br />
<br />
3) Disciple's War Gauntlets or Rivetted Joint Gauntlets.  I know they're not Tradeskill items, but I'm willing to pay 30kpp for 'em. ;)<br />

I've arranged to finally have some time to play on Sunday, and wouldn't mind doing a session or two of Mithril Plate... just need an Enchanter. :D</div></div><hr />

If you're making the Imbued Koada'Dal Mithril, and taking requests, I'm looking for the Cloak and Pauldron.  I don't know if you remember, but it's the stuff we talked about making earlier, but I didn't get the Mithril right away, and it kind of slipped to the back burner. :oops: I'll do some digging to see if I can find the remaining supplies, and get them to you next time I'm online.  Just let me know the price.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm only at skill 214 right now, but I'm willing to try some Full Mithril Bracers.<br />
<br />
I've got a few Shadowscream attempts &amp;amp; I'll do the Imbued Mithril Plate stuff first, so I can hopefully get a few skill-ups before trying the Full Mithril.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can enchant the mithril for you too, if you wear Rhyianna out or you can't make the connection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angelsyn</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I managed to pick up the Gauntlets I was looking for (woke up in the middle of the night, checked my trader-wench, sent out my &quot;wtb&quot; and got a seller!).<br />
<br />
I'll be heading in to work on my Smithing in just a few hours... have a lunch date with my fiance first.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angelsyn</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 02:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Drat... no Enchanter today.<br />
<br />
Well, I did get a point of skill on some Shadowscream Smithing anyway. :D</div></div><hr />
