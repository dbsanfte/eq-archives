<br />
In summary, the police arrested Patrick Lawrence, a 22-year-old white male, resident of Dacula, GA, in a pumpkin patch at 11:38 p.m. on a Friday night. Lawrence would be charged with lewd and lascivious behavior, public indecency, and public intoxication at the Gwinnett County courthouse. <br />
<br />
The suspect explained that as he was passing a pumpkin patch he decided to stop. &quot;You know, a pumpkin is soft and squishy inside, and there was no one around here for miles. At least I thought there wasn't,&quot; he stated in a phone interview. <br />
<br />
Lawrence went on to say that he pulled over to the side of the road, picked out a pumpkin that he felt was appropriate to his purposes, cut a hole in it, and proceeded to satisfy his need. &quot;I guess I was just really into it, you know?&quot; he commented with evident embarrassment. <br />
<br />
In the process, Lawrence apparently failed to notice a Gwinnett County police car approaching and was unaware of his audience until officer Brenda Taylor approached him. &quot;It was an unusual situation, that's for sure,&quot; said officer Taylor. &quot;I walked up (to Lawrence) and he's just working away at this pumpkin.&quot; <br />
<br />
Taylor went on to describe what happened when she approached Lawrence. &quot;I just went up and said, 'Excuse me sir, but do you realize that you are screwing a pumpkin?' <br />
<br />
&quot;He froze and was clearly very surprised that I was there, and then looked me straight in the face and said, &quot;A pumpkin? ****...is it midnight already?</div></div><hr />
