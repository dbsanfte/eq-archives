<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have a suggestion on going from 200 to 240 brewing in one night? Or can it even be done? Would be nice to be able to use all store bought items. I saw Hero brew is all stor bought and can level almost to 250 but..... how are the skill up on this? Thinking maybe 1 skill up per 60 combines?<br />
Anyways just curious if anyone has done this before and what ya think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">200-248 can be done in a couple hours with minos.  all ingredients are vendor bought.  halas has them all in 1 room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Quinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well did 300 Mino combines &gt; 2 1/2 hours &gt; 9 skill ups :o <br />
Not to bad since I had no buffs, will just keep on plugging away and skill ups should increase as I get closer to trivial I hope.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rhyianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i just did a run of mhb, probably 3-4 hours of combines over the weekend but spread out due to play time.<br />
<br />
i averaged 1 skill up per 20 combines.  went from 224-247.  now for those last 3 points sometime =)<br />
<br />
edit:  i did this all in Halas, easy since all in 1 room.  and no one there to lag the zone down like PoK</div></div><hr />
