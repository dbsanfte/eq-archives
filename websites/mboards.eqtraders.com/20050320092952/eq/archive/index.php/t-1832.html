<br />
*Backround*<br />
I have had a head cold for 3 weeks now. Just in my nose and sinuses. That is usually how all of my colds are, they never go in my throat. Well 2 days ago this one moved there. I am now hoarse with coughing and have pulled every muscle in my stomach and shoulders area with coughing. I cough so hard I throw up when I am in a steam bath (did that last night).<br />
<br />
I have been gargling with chloraseptic and keeping coughdrops in my system constantly, yet I still have this coarse, wheezing cough.<br />
<br />
My nose isn't really bothering me anymore and it seems to be just this.. however this is making me feel more miserable with every moment I cough.<br />
<br />
I would go to the doctor but through a f-up with Aetna insurance I'm &quot;not covered&quot; even though they are taking the money for insurance out of my fiancee's check (he is also not covered) and the coverage was supposed to start 1/1/03. The ironic thing is my fiancee is now working for Aetna... heh<br />
<br />
So here I am out in the cold with no Doctor to go to without paying $90.00 out of pocket just to see him, much less prescriptions.....<br />
<br />
This thing is killing me.. I have coughing fits when I eat.. sometimes so bad I choke on my food. <br />
<br />
HELP!!! PLEASE!!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nasty respiratory crud going round here ...  I had it, was getting better slowly, then cough started getting worse suddenly.  Finally went to the doctor once I got a 103-degree fever -- aha, had pneumonia, and they scolded me for not coming in sooner.  Someone else where I work was hopitalized with pneumonia as well (bad enough they thought it was heart trouble at first from the chest pain!)<br />
<br />
$90 plus prescription for a doctor is MUCH better than much much much more for an uninsured hospital stay -- not to mention the health risks (untreated pneumonia is dangerous!) and misery.<br />
<br />
If you have a fever... RUN don't walk to the doctor.  Even if you don't, that is some VERY severe coughing (worse than me and I have pnuemonia!) that is not going away, and that scares me -- go to the doctor anyway.<br />

That makes it a ton easier to drink for me, not sure if that will help with your allergy to it or not but it should allow you to drink at least a bit of it :\  I definately sympathize with you... I'm just about 6months pregnant and came down with this junk a few days ago (sore throat, runny/stuffy nose, sneezing, earaches, etc) and being pregnant not supposed to take any meds, to top it off I sprained (or broke, but Im going with sprained.. swollen and hurts like heck) my little toe last night by accidentally hitting the corner with it while trying to make it back to bed in the middle of the night , so I definately know how you feel, miserable :(<br />

<br />
I called the Doc and just got back from the appt. He gave me Albuterol(sp?) because I was low, Advair (to try), Cough Meds w/codeine, and an antibiotic.<br />
<br />
I'll have to pay full $ for meds, but only at first..... in a way I'll be reimbursed, I just don't feel like explaining it at the moment. Thank the Gods for credit cards. These meds are NOT cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noni DeeCups</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Albuterol... I have one at work, one at home and I keep one in my purse. /sigh <br />
<br />
Started from what I thought was just a &quot;nasty cold&quot; then turned into pneumonia... That sucked. Had to get steriod shots to open my lungs... ack. <br />
<br />
Glad you got some meds =) I am taking some too, just got them yesterday. Alegra D &amp; some powerful Antibiotic that I only have to take for 3 days. Woot!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dunthor Warsmith</div><div class="date">01-06-2003, 02:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Albuterol ... I find it a pain to use, but can REALLY be helpful for stuff. (I had to use it for a constricted throat for a while)  Very common and widely used for assorted breathing problems now too - common med = GOOD, hehe (generally more refined formula, fewer side effects, more properly dosed, covered by more insurances, and sometimes cheaper)<br />
<br />
I'm glad you went to the doc - hopefully those meds will help with your illness, and you'll feel better :)<br />
<br />
Goodluck with the insurance ... gods, sometimes that seems to be more of a pain than the illness.</div></div><hr />

I had a nasty cold once and ended up in the hospital for it.  Went to the doctor on a monday for my cold and got meds.  Late tuesday night went into the emergency room. Was diagnosed with tonsilitis, strep throat, pneumonia, and inner ear infections in both ears.  My ear drums on both sides burst after they gave me meds that knocked me out.  2 years later and my hearing still isn;t recovered all the way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since you already went to the doc, yeah, a powerful decongestent (I got prescription Robitussin) and allegra should clear you up nicely in a couple of days.  I was also told to take Tylenol, because I was having a lot of body aches.<br />
<br />
Hope you feel better soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draggar</div><div class="date">01-09-2003, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GO TO THE DOCTOR.<br />
<br />
I fully agree.  I think the flu has come back this year with a vengance.<br />
<br />
People who never get sick (like myself) are getting hit hard by this.  I was on a health roller coaster for over 2 weeks.  Fine one day, sick the next.<br />
<br />
See a doc, or at least OD on the Sudafed / NyQuil.</div></div><hr />
