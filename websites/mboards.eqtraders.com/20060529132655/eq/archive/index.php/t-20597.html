<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kakg</div><div class="date">03-03-2005, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd comment as follows:<br />
<br />
Baking, after 192 I would move on to GoD Tuna and Crab recipes. With the new vegetable recipe making these recipes much easier for non-foragers the effort to fish for crab and tuna is significantly eaiser than the hours of mammoth meat and brownie parts farming that HMP's and Holy Cakes require.<br />
<br />
Tinkering - BAH, don't waste good coiled springs on propulsion units. What a waste of good money and parts. As soon as you get to 122 move straight to making Geerlok Sculpting Tools to get to 215. The Darkclaw Claws are very easy to farm in Shadeweavers and you will get much more skillup attempts for your cash. Scuplting tools are the cheapest geerlok and the easiest to farm parts for, just stick with them and keep churning them out. Brewing geerloks are also popular but I don;t recommend them as you have to go buy the still parts in SH where the sculpting parts can all be bought in PoK. Save all your coiled springs for collapsibles which will make you money instead of costing you money.<br />
<br />
Brewing - I went the Brut Champagne route and at first I too thought it was more expensive until I looked at the most expensive parts.<br />
<br />
1) Price of Yarrow for Kaladim Constitutional = 26pp each<br />
2) Price of Opal and Gold Bar for Magnum = 27pp each<br />
<br />
So long as you can get the gold enchanted cheaply and you make the magnums yourself then the cost difference per skillup attempt is not as wide as it would appear. When you take into account the fact that parts for Kaladims include ground spawns while Brut Champagne is all vendor bought I consider that makes Brut Champagne a better route especially for races that would find getting into Kaladim rather..... hectic.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neebat</div><div class="date">03-09-2005, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alternative path to 300 for Halflings:<br />
Steel Guardian Arrows (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9627&amp;menustr=080060900000)<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, I've commented on this before, but I have to ask... in what way is this a halfling alternative?  Remember, not all halflings follow Karanas, not all Karanas followers have a respectable amount of foot hair.<br />
<br />
Only followers of Karanas can make the fletching kit, regardless of race.  That could limit this alternative to Karanas followers.  I think that's probably what Sony intended, since the fletching kit is no drop.  That would limit it to Karanas followers including many human druids and rangers, but excluding a halfling rogue stealing for Bristlebane.<br />
<br />
The Surefall Fletching Kit Token is tradable.  That either opens it to everyone or still leaves it just Karanas.  Having a tradable token for a NO DROP container sounds buggy, so you might want to ignore it.<br />
<br />
How is this in anyway limited to halflings?  Is there something missing from the database to say these combines are restricted to halflings?  I think tonight I should pass a Surefall Fletching Kit Token to my erudite cleric of Quellious.  If she can do the combine, wouldn't that show that EVERYONE can take that route to 300?<br />
<br />
 :boggled:<br />
<br />
Thanks for the great guide, btw!  We use it frequently for all kinds of tradeskills.<br />
<br />
UPDATE<br />
I just posted a message in the database update area.  My cleric could not do the combine and the message specificly said the problem was diety.  I would expect it to be the same message regardless of race.  So the skillup path using Steel Guardian Arrows is Karana only.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's cheaper and faster (but you need to save the points up)<br />
<br />
ONLY enchanters (so far as I know) REQUIRE a research only spell (mez) at 16, everyone else is better off waiting for 20 to buy their first point. (first point = current level)</div></div><hr />

<br />
because Awareness IV potions are cheaper overall if you count merchant buyback values.<br />
<br />
Elixir of Divine Endurance costs 62 pp per combine including buyback. Greater Mystical Infusion will cost you 66 pp each. Awareness IV potions cost an average of 38 pp per combine when you include buyback, assuming 95% success rate which is the rate I got while skilling up on these. Your success rate would have to be worse than 75% to fall behind on these costwise.<br />
<br />
Benefit/Magic/Cold/Head/Poison Awareness IV buyback value is 126.610 (not Disease, it's worse for some reason)<br />
158.550 per combine for Awareness IV components with no buyback<br />
63.590 per combine at 75% success rate<br />
38.270 per combine at 95% success rate<br />

By using a geerlok (or trophy) the bonus you get makes your skill over 220 - so you can use this mod to skill up on ethereal metal rings for 2 points (210-212) before returning to do more Enchanted Velium bits till they trivial at 222</div></div><hr />

That is a change from 335 to 252 unfortantly. They use to be the way to get to 300 but .. sigh not anymore.<br />

Think that was also the reason for the added cavet at bottom of our Tailoring in reference to the 300 path modified by SoE that is listed in red.<br />
<br />
And in reference to above about the Etheral, also the reason why you see the break in tailoring for the 2 *freebie points* for Swatches at 211 and 212.</div></div><hr />

I personally do Fierce Heraldic Boots (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=7934&amp;menustr=035000000000).  It takes a bit of farming (probably a lot more than sickles).

All the Heraldic stuff trivials at 335 including Fine Heraldic Boots (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=7898&amp;menustr=035000000000), but they only tribute for 2k ish.  Hateful Heraldic Boots (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=7922&amp;menustr=035000000000) tribute for around 6k.  But Sapphires are much more expensive than Jade.</div></div><hr />

Here is my guide to Spell Research:<br />
<br />
0-21  Practice Rune (Complete)<br />
22-41  Apprentice Rune (Complete)<br />
42-62  Training Rune (Complete)<br />
63-95  Journeyman Rune (Complete)<br />

123-142  Expert Rune (Complete)<br />
143-162  Master Rune (Complete)<br />
163-175 Magi Rune (Complete)<br />
<br />
Each rune above requires 2 subcombined runes, (Azia) and (Beza), which require a Concordance of Research to do the combines in.  This is obtained by giving a Greater Lightstone to Smith Tv'Ysa in South Ro (Evil Races) or to Mrysila in North Karana (Good Races).<br />
<br />
You will need the class specific research box for your class to do the (Complete) rune combines in.  These can be purchased at various locations.<br />
<br />
Enchanters:  Tome of Endless Enchantments<br />
Magicians:  Elemental Grimoire<br />
Necromancers:  Book of Dark Bindings<br />
Wizards: Lexicon<br />
<br />
For some spell combines I believe you will need another box, as well, that is the result of a quest in Gulf of Gunthak with Researcher Alvarik.  Simply hail him and tell him what class you are, you will recieve the necessary book for your class.</div></div><hr />

You have to do the book quest as well, but that's nothing. It's different for every race, but it's definitely preferable to Solstice robes, velious tailoring, acrylia or platinum ribbons. I'm getting along happily with it now. <br />

What a waste of good money and parts. As soon as you get to 122 move straight to making Geerlok Sculpting Tools to get to 215. The Darkclaw Claws are very easy to farm in Shadeweavers and you will get much more skillup attempts for your cash. Scuplting tools are the cheapest geerlok and the easiest to farm parts for, just stick with them and keep churning them out. Brewing geerloks are also popular but I don;t recommend them as you have to go buy the still parts in SH where the sculpting parts can all be bought in PoK. Save all your coiled springs for collapsibles which will make you money instead of costing you money.<br />
<br />
Actually, Geerlok Fermentation Devices are cheapest (3 pp per combine, vs 17-30 per for every other original geerlok).  Go from 102 to 215 on Fermentation Devices, especially now that they have made the Porous Mineral Blocks stackable.  Since PMBs are one of the few stackable farmed components for the original geerloks, it's really not any big deal to farm forever, and then take one trip to SH for all your skillups.<br />
<br />
Also, the Planar bow cams are impossible unless you're regularly hunting the elemental planes.  So after the Gauze Press, just better to concentrate on Cheirometric Lockpick Devices(267) or just go straight to Crab Crackers (you can farm both Clockwork Carapaces for the 288-300 climb on Woks while you're farming the Knuckle Joints for the 262/267 to 288 climb on Crab Crab Crackers).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drexxell</div><div class="date">05-24-2005, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll add to my above post...the following is the order that<br />
made most sense to me:<br />
<br />
51-68 Flameless lantern (1.384 pp , no farm, make and destroy)<br />
<br />
69-75 Standard Bow Cam (12.599 pp, no farm, make and give to fletchers)<br />
<br />
76-95 Spyglass (20.740 pp, no farm, make and give to friends)<br />
<br />
96-102 Stalking Probe (15.564 pp, no farm, make and give to friends)<br />
<br />
102-215 Geerlok Fermentation Device (2.841, 1 farm/stacks, make and sell back for a loss)<br />
<br />
216-222 Geerlok Alchemy Set<br />
216-227 Geerlok Automated Pestle<br />
216-232 Geerlok Automated Quill (19.714 pp, 1 farm/stacks, make and sell back for a loss)<br />
These 3 go together...you're really farming for the Silver Tipped Quills to make the Geerlok Quill to 232, but along the way, you'll pick up enough Maneater Roots for the Alchemy and Scorpion Venom Glands for the Pestle that it's worth doing all 3 simultaneously.<br />
<br />
233-236 Geerlok Clockwork Contraption (19.714 pp, 1 farm/stacks, make and sell back for a loss)<br />
This one goes along with the other 4, but don't work on it until you've hit 232.  By then your Gunthak farming of the other 3 items will have yielded enough Waterlogged Riggings to make the climb from 233 to 236 a snap.<br />
<br />
237-242 Collapsed Toolkit (6.495 pp, 1 farm/stacks, make and sell back for a loss)<br />
This is the FIRST time you should be using Coiled Springs for a skillup.  Coiled Springs don't grow on trees and this 6 point climb means a solid 100 or more Springs will be needed just for it.<br />
<br />
242-288 This depends on how much cash you want to spend and how hardcore a farmer you are.  Farming Class 6 mana batteries is hard.  So is paying 105pp for each one.  If you're willing to take the pain of farming or paying for Class 6 mana batteries, then do the Gauze Press to 262 and then the Lockpick Device to 267.  If not, go right to Crab Crackers, and farm Knuckle Joints and do Crab Crackers from 242-288.  While you're doing this, find a mule to hold all of your non-stacking Clockwork Carapaces that you get too, because you'll want them for the 289-300 climb on Woks.<br />
<br />
Do NOT depend on selling Guaze Presses for a profit.  EQ is a dying game, like it or not, and anyone who WANTED a press GOT a press within the first year of the recipe being available.<br />

With DoN, there now comes an entirely new path for skilling up Tinkering.  I personally don't see the need to veer off of the path laid out (above) until you hit 242.  <br />
<br />
At that point, the DoN branch would take you to (if you've got access to high tailoring skill):<br />
<br />
243-248 Master’s Metalofiber Armband (19.159 pp + 1 farmed item from PoI (doable at level 50ish) + 2 farmed items from PoN (doable not before 55, really) + high tailoring needed)<br />
<br />
249-263 Master’s Metalofiber Gloves (20.279 pp + same farming and tailoring as armband)<br />
<br />
264-290 Master’s Metalofiber Sleeves (20.279 pp + same farming and tailoring as armband)<br />
<br />
291-300 Master's Metalofiber Breeches (20.279 pp + 1 PoI farm + 6 PoN farm + high tailoring)<br />
<br />
A similar route (&quot;servolinked&quot; rather than &quot;metalofiber&quot;) works for &quot;high smithing&quot; gnomes instead, but now farming from The Deep instead of PoN.  (Too lazy to type it all in at the moment).<br />

You do NOT need an enchanter.  You DO need a lot of bag space since the &quot;Spell: Enchant Velium&quot; is non-stackable and you need a copy for every combine.  My advice for gate classes is to bind at the Thurgadin forge so, when you run to the merchant NPC to buy the spell copies, you can gate right back to the forge and save time.  Spell is sold by the same Thurgadin merchant that sells coldain velium temper.</div></div><hr />

I actually started this earlier because I was able to buy a ton of silks in the baz for less than 1 pp and had issues farming the HQ cat pelts.. darn RNG.. that makes it comparable to the tailored quiver in price.

<br />
One thing to consider is the *buyback* from vendors on Wu's.<br />
<br />
The cost to make each piece of Wu's is 7.332 pp [1 VoVM (@6.3 pp each), + 4 Heady Kiolas(@0.245 pp each)+Pattern(@0.052 pp each)] plus 2-6 silks.  The *buyback* on each Wu's piece is 5.2-6.2 pp each.  As such, the lost-cost for each successful combine is a pitiful 1-2 pp.  I'm not thick with cash, but I do think losing 1-2 pp per combine (you'll never sell Wu's in the bazaar for more than vendors will give you) is an acceptable rate when going through the 140's to 150's in a tradeskill.<br />
<br />
As for farming, may I strongly suggest going to East Karana and finding &quot;Reaver Hill&quot;. The spiders there are everywhere and drop 2-6 silks each.  I was able to fill a backpack with stacks of Spider Silk in under an hour.<br />

I was taking buy back into account and simply did it faster by paying bazzar prices but since each combine cost me a total of 1.049pp considering the componets are farmed and sell back to the vendors for a little under 1pp... I thought it was a good alternative. I'll have to sell some more and get prices into the DB here. :) <br />
<br />
This all depends, of course,  on farming Spider silk or Crystaline spider silk and the rate at which you can do either. (Reaver hill is where I get silks and tea leaves. :)) Since people are already farming Crystal Caverns for other reasons, it is a valid path.<br />
<br />
Regardless, I wanted to add my two cents here so that people don't overlook this potentially faster/cheaper skill up route.  <br />

243 - 248 Unfired Idol (Amber) (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=4936&amp;menustr=080090900000) - Cheapest is Imbued Amber (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=4091&amp;menustr=) by a Cleric/Shaman with CT diety.<br />
249 - 255 Unfired Idol (Rose Quartz) (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=4937&amp;menustr=080090900000) - Cheapest is Imbued Rose Quartz (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=4090&amp;menustr=) by a Cleric with Erollisi Marr diety.<br />
<br />
Just as a note, if you have access to a Cleric of Erollisi Marr, I would replace all of the items from Unfired Opal Encrusted Stein through the Unfired Idol (Amber) with the Unfired Idol (Rose Quartz). It's cheaper than the amber (16.071p total, failure rates included), and, after looking at the skillup formula, it's cheaper to do overall than the ones listed. Unfired Planar Steins are a shade more expensive (like 1p more), but the success rate at that level makes them the better choice (assuming you can find some Tainted Planar Essences.)</div></div><hr />

136 - 143 Filleted Bear (Keep the result for next step)<br />

192 - 226 Halas 10lb Meat Pie<br />
227 - 242 Holy Cake<br />
243 - 300 Misty Thicket Picnic<br />
<br />
As we need Bear Fillet in cream to make Halas 10lb Meat Pie and they are made from the Filleted Bear, we can make our way from 144 to 152 with them. And with a geerlok, that will be like trivial : 143 + 5% ---&gt; 151.</div></div><hr />

There are similar recipes for lower trivials (255, 202, ..).<br />

Since those all require only one ingredient that is vendor brought, AND they are fairly inexpensive to make while having a fair resale value, I see them as valid skillup paths.<br />

The ingredients are expensive initially, but one success makes a 50pp profit. If you have a 5 in 6 success rate you will break about even. Aligned Ore and Pale Nihilite aren't so hard to get from vendor-farming, or i buy my aligned ore and still break just about even.<br />

<br />
For Shar Vahl Essences, payala fruit isn't foraged.  It's a ground spawn.  If you move about Shadeweaver's Thicket looking for short, stout trees that have blue leaves, you'll find one (that looks like a little bag) at the base of the plant.  Anyone can get them, there are quite a few, they respawn fast and they're free for the taking, so it's a great route for skilling up to 187.<br />

Silverfish<br />
<br />
Just as an FYI, the little bags are *droppings* from some of the beetle models.. collect 4 and turn in for a 2% WR bag -6 slot. The payala fruit look like blue mushrooms. there are 28 groundspawns in a rough circle. (looks like an average 3 year old drew a circle) the respawn is actually decent, normally they are just repopping as you complete the circle. now, if you can forage, then you can also forage these, but as you will also forage everything else on the forage table you might be lucky to get an added 1 per trip around the circle.</div></div><hr />

A lot of people might prefer the shorter but slightly more expensive skillup paths<br />
<br />
<br />
Tinkering:<br />
<br />
2xx-282: Some people prefer skilling up with the elemental plane bow cams (especially pofire cams). Depending on skillup path this would be the skillup of choice for most after the toolbox.<br />
<br />
282-300 Alternative would be yttrium based combines (servolink sleeves 29o/ BP/Legs - 300). Ytrium is a good alternative to nightmare arachnid silks.<br />
<br />
Also woks are usually not used to skillup from 291-300. The clockwork carapace is non stackable and just doesn't drop in enough quantity to make this a viable skillup path. Most people end up making 0-3 points from this if that.<br />
<br />
Tailoring:<br />
<br />
Artic wyvern hide combines would be preferred combine instead of othmir fur caps. Just for faction issues and amount of furs to be farmed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AbyssalMage</div><div class="date">01-31-2006, 06:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently the skill progression for smithing from 163 - 188 is Fine Plate xxx.  May I suggest a new route?<br />
<br />
163 - 165 Fine Plate Bracer<br />
165 - 210 Enchanted Velium Bits *minimum skill needed to do combine as posted on Jan. 31, 2006 on EQ Traders is 165*<br />
<br />
Reasoning behind the change....<br />
<br />
Cost of Fine Plate Bracer:<br />
Leather Padding<br />
  30-45pp if bought in bazaar(prexus server) or Negligible if you farm the stuff yourself.  We'll assume for this article you farm the material yourself.<br />
<br />
Medium Quality Sheet Metal (MQSM)<br />
  (3) Large brick of medium quality ore (20.5pp each x 3 = 61.5pp) are required to make (1) MQSM + some water.  Please also note that there is actually two (2) combines here that can both fail.<br />
<br />
Plate Bracer Mold<br />
  Vendor sold for 6pp<br />
<br />
Smithy Hammer<br />
  Vendor sold for 10pp.  Price becomes negligible as it is never consumed.<br />
<br />
Water<br />
  Vendor sold.  If you can't afford to buy large quantities of water then you probally should hold off doing smithing...Negligible<br />
<br />
So basic price of bracer is 61.5pp(MQSM) + 6pp (Bracer Mold) = 67.5pp - sell back of 26.5pp = 41pp+ an attempt not including failures.  Also note that the true cost is higher as you will fail a few combines while making the MQSM.  And more MQSM's are needed for the Helm (2) and BP (3) wich further increases cost vs. return.  And we assume your not buying the Leather Padding in Bazaar wich will also increase price.<br />
<br />
Cost of Enchanted Velium Bits:<br />
Coldain Velium Temper<br />
  Vendor sold 5pp<br />
<br />
Small Piece of Velium <br />
  Ok, here's where the pricing can get screwy...You need two(2) pieces per attempt.  If you purchase in bazaar, this can quickly cost more than Fine Plate xxx.  If you farm this it is free + you'll actually make money from the other stuff you loot and sell to vendors/players.  Again we'll assume you farm your own as with the leather padding above.<br />
<br />
Spell: Enchant Velium<br />
  Vendor sold for 12.8 (we'll round up to 13pp)<br />
<br />
Total cost is 13pp (Spell: Enchant Velium) + 5pp (Coldain Velium Temper) = 18pp - 0pp sell back = 18pp per combine.<br />
<br />
  So if we compare  costs we save 23pp per combine (41pp - 18pp) if we assume we farm all the material our selves(and no failures).  I also know you have a better chance of skill up for success vs. failure so I'm not sure if in the end this would end up being cheaper but thowing this out there for those of you who may wanna try this route in smithing.  And not everyone likes farming so Fine Plate xxx would definately be faster if you have the PP to blow.<br />
***Please note: I completely forgot about 5% Geerlok so you should be able to start at 162 skill***</div></div><hr />

<br />
*snip*<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Medium Quality Folded Sheet Metal you need for a bracer is made from one Block of MQ Ore @ 20.5p not three bricks @ 20.5 each. <br />
<br />
Large Bricks cost 6.8p and you can make a Block using 3 Large Bricks but since you can buy blocks from vendors there is no point in using bricks.<br />

This brings the price down by 41 plat making this a very cost effective method of skilling up beating EVB's provided you have the leather padding.</div></div><hr />

Large Bricks cost 6.8p and you can make a Block using 3 Large Bricks but since you can buy blocks from vendors there is no point in using bricks.<br />

Thanks for pointing this out to me.  Forgot you could buy the Block of Medium Quality Ore directly from merchant and had a brain fart while looking at the recipe.  Saw the combine section and totally forgot to scroll down a little ways to see that merchants also sold it(with out combines).  Looks like you actually recoop all costs or majority on these combines and only loose money for failures.  Now time for me to go :faint:  for not scrolling down a bit further before opening my mouth :grumpy:</div></div><hr />

<br />
The cost here is in &quot;platinum thread&quot; 209pp and the belt sells back for 165. so costs 44pp per comb.<br />
<br />
Good side is, enthrails might be faster farmable than othmir furs.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, if pp are not an issue, the belt can be used for a further combine 252 making 5 small belts.<br />
<br />
Small belts sell at 47pp each. So cost would be 418 and resell value 235. Making a 90pp cost per combine out of 1 single farmed component.</div></div><hr />

They can kill the fire elementals in lavastorm for bloodstones. bloodstones and a gold bar will make a bloodstone necklace trivals at 156 JC. Sell it back, lose 5 silver for total combine. about 11 plat per fail,There is no need to enchant it (you can if you want to).<br />
<br />
plus as a added bonus you get lava rocks to drop (rare) If your dwarf paladin is like me, I use the lava rocks for don cultural stuff to get to 222 smithing.</div></div><hr />

Smithing: not everyone can do the Aid Grimel quest. You have to be at least lvl 46, and I think have to have a particular flag to get the quest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At almost 210 plat a pop not cheap but very easy since only one compoment (corathus entrail) is farmed and fairly common drop.  Maybe suggest it as alternatve to acrylia reinforced armor which requires a rare drop: flawless rockhopper hide which can yeild just a few drops per hour or 500+ plats in bazaar<br />
<br />
Just my imo that corathus entrail would be easier and possibly cheapr for those who takes bazaar route</div></div><hr />
