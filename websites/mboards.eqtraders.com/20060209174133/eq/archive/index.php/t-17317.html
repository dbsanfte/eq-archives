Anyway. I have approximately a dozen Fier'Dal needles for sale, for anyone who might want them. Contact me here, or send a message to my main char in-game. (That would be Lishveta, yes.) However, due to being in the middle of moving quite a long distance, my appearances in-game will be scarce, so contacting me via the boards is going to be a lot easier.</div></div><hr />
