I have published the information that I have gained so far on the GoD AA's systems. Please keep in mind that this is very early information gained from the Beta. Some of it can be diffrent than what goes live. Some of it might be innacurate and incomplete. I will update it as new information comes in. Please if you see anything that has been changed that you are sure of or have any additional info to add post it here or on the everquestdruids website. <br />

<br />
This looks promising..<br />
<br />
FT5 for 37 points per 10 minutes?<br />
1 point for 1 plat?<br />
<br />
236 points per hour?  Wonder if this stacks with current FT?   Maybe this could push the cap to Aura Of Clarity (Tier 5) + FT15 + MC3.<br />
<br />
<br />
Would be nice.   I'd sure as heck pay 236 plat per hour for that.<br />

He will with a Required Level of 20.  But's it's still cool.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think the Tribute system is just a pp sink for SoE. This is one part of GoD I will not be using as the cost just aint worth it. <br />
<br />
Lilosh, say you play for 4 hours a day, that is almost 1kpp a day you are spending. 5 days a week, 5k worth of plat just for +5FT. I don't think I make 5k a week, let alone be able to afford that on FT5. <br />
<br />
Then you think &quot;I'll stop using it for the 30 minutes between groups/ LDoN's&quot;. So you stop the bonus, then spend more time going back to your home town to start it again? I can see the high lvl players wasting a few k on these, but I doubt the casual player can afford it.<br />
<br />
Lastely, do these smell of solo play to you? <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The simple fact that the description says that you can't -PAUSE- the effect makes it much more of an aggravation that any real value.<br />
<br />
Imagine getting a Group or Raid together... and when you finally think ready to -GO- someone says, &quot;Oh, my tribute ran out... gotta re-charge it&quot;... and run off to get it recharged.<br />
<br />
Or folks complaining &quot;LETS GO!, my Tribute is running out!&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe... JUST Maybe,  if they have a &quot;START&quot; button that you can charge up your Tributes... get the raid/group ready to go, and then hit START, and it goes into effect... and a &quot;STOP&quot; button that then deactivates it till you go and do more tribute to reset it so the START becomes enabled... (so you can't temporarily pause it why AFK).<br />
<br />
Yes, this supports Solo Play, and it supports draining Plat out of the game.<br />
<br />
I doubt I will use it much beyond some initial experimentation. Just so I understand more of how it works.</div></div><hr />

I don't have to imagine with a full generation of KEI babies to cry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">He will with a Required Level of 20. But's it's still cool:D One hour in PC and none of my twinks are below level 20.<br />
<br />
I think this tribute thing will see more use from solo players and lower level characters, I don't think I'll be sinking my plat into it at higher levels, I've got tradeskills to fund, after all.  Still, might not be too bad when it's the middle of the night and you just can't find a KEI merchant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sylphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Cool.  If people will pay 222 plat per hour for FT5 then casting KEI should cost what... 500 pp per person?  Maybe more.  I hope this tribute system has some effect on supply vs demand of buffs in PoK.<br />
<br />
Apparently it counts as FT, just like a worn item, so if you already have FT15 this will be useless to you.<br />
<br />
Also.... thanks much for those links.  Quite a bit of good information there.  I almost missed Felwithe in the first list... but finally saw it hiding behind Halas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">not worth it atm.  i would be tempted to get sh2 but throwing enough plat at it isn't an option while i am tradeskilling too.  i have an id3 robe and an sh2 robe.  singles gets one while quadding gets the other.  i will just buy a different sh2 item when i can get the money.<br />
<br />
it doesn't scale well or maybe it does it too well.  the cost increase is a lot different.  it looks more like a 1-2-3-4-5pp with a pp/tier ratio about the same for all of them.  then they should take out the levels or charge higher levvels more.  at 20 a 10 minute buff and having to run from your home town this is a lot of plat.  at 40 i could keep several of the spells up far longer than that.  seems a bit better for higher levels even though its still capped anyway is what i'm trying to say. <br />
<br />
did anyone see if it takes a buff slot or can be dispelled?</div></div><hr />
