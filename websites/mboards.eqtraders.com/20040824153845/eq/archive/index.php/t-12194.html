<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Silound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I was goingto post this earlier, but due to my own issues (Nasty &quot;virus&quot; took over my system, Norton and AVG didnt pick it up. Found out it was actually a scripting thing imbedded into my registry) I lost a lot of things off my PC. Slowly recovering things back, and it looks like I may have a complete success if things stay well. <br />
<br />
However, before all that, I had used a program a friend gave me that downloaded all information from a website's root directory, re-constructed it, and allowed me to look at it in its entirety offline. So of course, one of the first things I downloaded was the entire EQtraders site. <br />
<br />
Don't worry, I went through Rack9's servers, so I didn't suck your bandwidth Denmom, I know how preciously expensive it can get. <br />
<br />
So assuming I can retrieve all my data (I'm praying because I have some stuff that is VERY important to my business world that cannot be replaced), I can provide you with your entire DB intact. You will have to reconstruct the links, but the raw information is there. ETA on my data is set for 3 weeks from Nov 17, so right after Thanksgiving.<br />
<br />
Whew that was long.<br />
