shows I need to combine for bow in a forge?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This specific recipe, for the Dark Courage Bow, has not been throughly tested. <br />
<br />
It has been reported... but I don't know for sure if it is correct.<br />
<br />
If you have the components... toss them in a Forge, a Tanaan Forge and see. It might be wrong and really need a Planar Fletching kit.<br />
<br />
Since I don't have Drunder's Steel yet, I can't check it myself.<br />
<br />
This recipe, along with the other Dark Courage Recipes, are based off of the Dark Courage Quests (http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q24&amp;menustr=120055000000) Writeups.<br />
<br />
If you can test and report an adjustment, please let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>OberonMiM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">your also combing a bow without a premade staff. Which means combining it in a forge makes sense (but to make more sense it would require 2 combines. One to make the bow staff then another to make the string)<br />
<br />
Speaking of which this bow combine also has no string.<br />
<br />
So basically i guess forge combine woudl probably be the best</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Footsore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The text at the link Krazik provided for the Dark Courage quests contains this statement:<br />
<br />
&quot;All but the bow must be made in a forge, combine the bow and the substance in a fletching kit. &quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ok the write-up (which I did the reformatting of) appears to have a contradiction, but does not:<br />
<br />
When talking to Szrix about the Dark Courage weapons:<br />
<br />
You say, 'What bow?'<br />
<br />
Szrix Hammertail says 'To make the bow, combine Drunder's steel, pulsing blue vial and a file in a forge. This will make a weapon that will cause some worry to the Zeks.' <br />
<br />
later on the write-up says:<br />
<br />
Black Insanities are nicer than Dark Courages since they have higher bane damage. To make all of them but the bow, you must forge:<br />
<br />
    * your Dark Courage<br />
    * a pulsing black vial<br />
<br />
Again, this is trivial at 11, non-trivial at 28, and is probably a no-fail combine. The bow must be made in a fletching kit. <br />
<br />
The first stage weapon that Szrix is talking about is to make the Dark Courage (Bow) that is to be made in the Forge.<br />
<br />
The second stage weapon that is the Black Insanity (Bow) is where you take the first stage weapon, and merge it with the pulsing black vial, which is done in the Fletching Kit.<br />
<br />
Does this make sense?</div></div><hr />
