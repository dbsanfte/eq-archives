<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>keribubba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why exactly does the solstice robe donate for 12 tributes or so while the cutting sickles donate for over 1k tributes?  I'm thinking SOE priced the tribute values according to the bazaar prices for the items.  For some reason people like to sell solstice robes for less than 350pp or so for JCM3 players, or 500pp or so for normal players.  It would make more sense to have the robes donate for 800 points or more.</div></div><hr />

Tribute is 23</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dmuerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So basically if you make the chain and hand it in your an idiot atm?  Sorry soe but giving people tribute that is 1/100 the cost to make the item is retarded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaysha Soulsinger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Same thing applies to the Pottery rings (the Ceramic bands), which have a nuke to them. Green and White Ceramic Bands cost around 25-30pp to create, yet when you try to sell them to NPC merchants the yield is only 1s1c, and the Tribute value is only 12 pts for either Band. I haven't yet tried making the higher trivial ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dmuerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They should add a /cac animation to the tribute masters whenever you hand in a tradeskill item for less then it took to make :)</div></div><hr />

Off to the PSR with ye!</div></div><hr />

It's retarded, too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For you pottery guys out there, don't bother switching to Idol of Quellious, Cazic-Thule or anything else, they net just shy of 0 tribute, not worth firing them.  They are worth 0 tribute unfired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've said it before and I'll say it again.  The reason the tribute value for the Ceremonial Solstice Robe stinks is that the robe itself stinks.  It's one-race, one-class wearable and it's five charisma!  How much would you expect in tribute for something like that that dropped?  Try turning in a fungal fiend robe and see what it nets you.  The fact that it's doggedly difficult to make doesn't matter, and the fact that it's useful in a quest also doesn't matter (the Broom of Air from Najena isn't worth doodly to the tribute master, and neither is a hero sandwich, so why would this robe be?) so it's going to be low on tribute.<br />
<br />
Its value is as a skillup path and as a quest item.  Tribute would be nice, but we've got to be realistic here.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aeght</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Look at it this way...<br />
<br />
The proper means of offering a solstace robe as tribute is to sacrifice it in a forge with the other appropriate times.<br />
<br />
Offering one in any other manner is somewhat of an insult! You are lucky you are not simply struck down! :)<br />
<br />
As for the chains, those are even worse....<br />
<br />
What, you cannot bother to offer a robe in the proper manner, and now you have the audacity to offer a mere part or a robe? <br />
<br />
&lt;Heavy divine sigh&gt; Mortals... at least you are trying... here is a token bit of favour to appease you...<br />
