<br />
I have (finally!) managed to make my GM spoon on The Rathe, after 1 failed attempt at 248, raising my JC to 118 (from 0) this weekend to make my own seals, instead of overpaying in the bazaar, and finally, a successful attempt on Monday night. A most wonderful item. It replaces 2 opal encrusted steins, allows me to max my int while tradeskilling, and the bags are a pretty sweet bonus :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kumulas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Congrats on your Trophy. I made mine yesterday, I was sitting at 239 skill and made the subcombines to do 400 MTP attempts. Loaded up my inventory with half of the ingredients and started to bake. 200 attempt later I had only skilled up 1 pnt to 240, imagine my frustration with that. Went to the bank and grabbed the rest of the goodies and started to bake. For the next 200 combines I went from 240 up to 249..... Yay..... Made more subcombines and hit 250 on the 5th attempt. I then headed to the bank and got my stashed gems made the seal and was successful on my first try at the trophy.... I'm a happy baker now</div></div><hr />

With all these patches I'm having trouble finding a black sapphire anywhere to try making my spoon.  IF I would have bought one any of the bazzillion times I'd seen them on a vendor I wouldn't be having this trouble.  LOL.</div></div><hr />

Now, just don't undercut me on picnics in the baz and all will be right in the world! =D</div></div><hr />
