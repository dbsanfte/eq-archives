<br />
Less costly though? I'd think ornate would be less costly than that.<br />
<br />
I'd guess you looked at this:<br />

Just shields and weapons it appears, halflings don't get much either.</div></div><hr />

At least go through 1 ring ornate perhaps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that'll help lower the cost. If you're in the mid 40's, you could hunt either Hg's in rathe or IG's in Everfrost, get a decent amount of plat and xp, but takes longer farming the FS weaps.</div></div><hr />

There are no goblins in Stonebrunt.  The primary opposition there is kobolds.  I don't recall for certain if they drop Fine Steel, or not, either.  I remember them dropping &quot;Cold Iron&quot;, but don't remember much else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorvari</div><div class="date">01-07-2003, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Highland kobolds in Stonebrunt drop FS Japanese style weapons like the Fine Steel Kusarigama.  <br />
<br />
Also Stonebrunt is the best source of pelts for padding, since cougars do not drop ruined pelts...making all their drops usable for padding.</div></div><hr />
