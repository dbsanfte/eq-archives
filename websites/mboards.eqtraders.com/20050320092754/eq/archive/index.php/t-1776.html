EQATlas (http://www.EQAtlas.com) has there maps for sale in a PDF format (http://www.eqatlas.com/eqatlaspdf.html) to use with the new cartography system. I don't know much about code and how things will work with the game so I'm asking, will these work with the new system? If so I love his maps and would be happy to help Muse out with buying his maps. He is offering his great service at a great price ($9.95 US) so it's well worth it. I'm still upset for him about the &quot;EverQuest Atlas&quot; SONY sold, they really did stab him in the back on that one.<br />
But anyways, if anyone can help me please post with how they might work, thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The new mapping tools uses plain text TXT files for data storage.<br />
<br />
Muse is looking into posting copies of the map txt files that people send to him.<br />
<br />
www.eq-toolbox.com has a set of the map txt files with additional labels and details.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I could throw out those ragged print outs there are laying around somewhere....</div></div><hr />
