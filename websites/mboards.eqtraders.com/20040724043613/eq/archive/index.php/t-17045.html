<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Amethest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just spent an hour doing subcombines for Gruppa's Poppin Ale hoping to get the last 2 skill points I needed.<br />
Database has the trivial listed wrong as there are two different recipes with two different trivials.<br />
<br />
Gruppa's Poppin Ale has a trivial of 202 and uses Fizzlepop (soda; flask of fruit juice; bottle)<br />
<br />
Gruppa's Poppin Ale (cask) has a trivial of 255 and uses Fizzle Pop (berries; bottle(2); Sylvan berries; Aerated mineral water)<br />
<br />
I was using the printed recipe from the database.<br />
<br />
Just didn't want anyone to make the same mistake as I.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">recipe corrections and trivial updates need to be posted to the database updates forum so that they can be updated in the database.  Please repost it there so it can be updated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>CaveDude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just wanted to mention that the &quot;Aerated Mineral Water&quot; needed for the &quot;Fizzle Pop&quot; sub-combine doesn't appear to exist in-game yet.<br />
<br />
 This has been reported in-game by many players including myself. It has also been brought to the attention of the developers through the Tradeskills forum at SOE's EverQuest Live chat forum.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brodder FoamyMugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I believe aeirated mineral water was made thusly...<br />
<br />
  Steamfront spring water (the foraged stuff you get near the vents)<br />
  Sodastone <br />
  Heavy duty bottle/cask<br />
  and finally a cork...<br />
  Then you'd add Sylvn and regular berries making it sweet and flavorful.<br />
<br />
  when they were redoing the recipes that they missed from the diaries, the cheap version of Fizzlepop came out - soda water fruit juices....etc...<br />
<br />
 this broke a few recipes...<br />
<br />
 Including the infamous Gruppa's Poppin Ale in my diaries...</div></div><hr />
