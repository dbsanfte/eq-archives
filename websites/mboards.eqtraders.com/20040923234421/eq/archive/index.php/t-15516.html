<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Towd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was very excited to get my GM Tailor's Needle as it says it's equipable in the primary, secondary, range and ammo slots.  However a little experimentation indicates that I don't get the stat increases in every slot.  Here's how it works with my level 49 ranger:<br />
<br />
Stated: Tailoring +5%,  STR + 10  CHA +50 WIS +10 INT +10<br />
<br />
Range Tailoring +9, STR +10, CHA +50, WIS +0, INT +10     <br />
<br />
Primary Tailoring +9, STR +5, CHA +50, WIS +2, INT +10<br />
<br />
Secondary Tailoring +9, STR +0, CHA +50, WIS +10, INT +10<br />
<br />
Ammo Tailoring +0, STR +0, CHA +0, WIS +0, INT +0<br />
<br />
(sorry for not being able to figure out how to make in a readable table.)<br />
<br />
Is this normal? I expect to only go up 9 in tailoring as I'm at 243 and it's my understanding that we can't go over 252 modified skill.  <br />
<br />
The inconsistencies in the other stats bother me as I was expecting to be able to equip it in the ammo slot for the increases.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>MerlmanTM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The ammo slot has never given any stats. All other slots should give you the stats though. <br />
<br />
I have not ever compaired what the other slots add for me. I always equip it in my primary if I am doing pottery(I have the pottery trophey).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Turlo Lomon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ammo will always give you that result.  However, there shouldn't be any other discrepencies.  Are you taking into account the item you are replacing the trophy with?  That is what it appears to me.<br />
<br />
Based on what you showed, it appears you normally run with a 10 wis item in range, a 5 str 8 wis item in primary, and a 10 str item in secondary.<br />
<br />
But back to the ammo.  The only time the ammo slot ever gives stats is if you have nothing in your range slot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And to me. I get +10 WIS when I equip my Baker's Spoon in the Range Slot (just to be sure, I'll check it next time I login).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Towd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's it.  I guess I shouldn't look at this stuff when I'm tired. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />
