<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>burnttoastv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to thank the posters of this forumn.  Was reading yesterday about what different things sell for spell combines and thought I would try it.  Had gotten my research up to 163 to make my own spells (and blew all my training points doing it).  Was excited to find SOME components cheap, but was more excited by the variety of spells that can be come up with by one class.  After three attempts at Acumen of Dar' Kura (sp?) at 450p each made two good copies (but it's Lore! dangit, glad I put one on my mule before trying the last two combines).  So going to see how well this and two copies of Nature Walker's behest sell to augment my smithing/fletching sales in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Just exciting that this tradeskill was under my nose and I was already had a skill to begin in it (with a research geerlok).  Guess I'll see how much I like it in the near future.<br />
<br />
At least this doesn't have 20 billion subcombines that get very very old like sickles for potc quest.</div></div><hr />
