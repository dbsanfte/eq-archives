<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KiTA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Quick question.  Has anyone ever failed a LDoN plate combine?  I ask because I'm at like 177 skill before my geerlok, and I've made 2 frosted breastplates, a frosted arms, a frosted helm, a frosted greeves, frosted boots, and frosted vambraces.<br />
<br />
All without failing once.  None of these are anywhere near trivial to me, so, either the RNG loves me, or they're nofail... @.@</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can fail them, they *may* just have a high success modifier i think. I remember getting higher then expected results as well. This doesnt mean ANYTHING tho. The RNG is an evil bastage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KiTA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yah, I just failed my first one (on a pair of gothic greaves, to boot) after about 15 successes.  Not bad since my skill is only 177 (er, 178 now, :D) and the greaves combine is like 210.<br />
<br />
I owe the RNG a Mino Hero Brew. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Elyssanda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep, they can be failed. I ran up a full set of Gothic plate for a friend, I failed one bracer and the bp during the run, had to grab a couple more mold and try again.. Succeeded on the 2nd tries for both..<br />
<br />
So far that's the only LDoN plate I've made, I'm sitting on about 460+ tempers though. About to run 2 toons (my main doing all tradeskills &amp; an ogre Warr) through the LDoN smithing phase in their tradeskilling journey. So once I do that I'll keep notes on failures vs. sucess and skillups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Definitely a high success rate on these things... as far as my own experiences.  This kind of stuff discourages me... as it seems like the trivial values vs. skill levels don't necessarily determine success rate.<br />
<br />
an item trivial at 150 with a low success rate might see the same overall success rate with an item trivial at 200 and a higher success rate...<br />
<br />
I don't like the idea of hidden success rates, but I'm not one to doubt it either.  It only makes me shudder of the thought of a &quot;low hidden success rate&quot; on the next item I plan on making.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Piikaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've smithed 5 full sets of plate from LDoN tempers and had only 4-5 failures. Gratz on a good day playing &quot;Beat the RNG!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I love LdoN smithing, currently at 193 skill &amp; rising, and I smith in my hometown (just had to bank a lot of Superb Leather Padding) so that I can give all my successes to the Tribute Master, since they are worth more points than plat.  <br />
<br />
Now that I am combining 3 sheets I am sticking to greaves, they are worth more points than BPs…<br />
<br />
/sigh I should have written down all the tribute values, esp since some different tempered items yield diff values even though they may be for the same slot</div></div><hr />
