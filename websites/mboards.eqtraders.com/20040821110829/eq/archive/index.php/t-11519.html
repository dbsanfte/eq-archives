<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>YurienStonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">is there any real reason outside aid gimel to get over 200 in JC? i have yet to make any enchanted jewelry other then for guildies to be sold. the only time i work on JC is when i get gems from camping and then i combine before i sell them. so should i get 3aa and work over 200 and spend waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much plat for plat bars?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All the PoP combines have trivials over 250. If you ever want to make those items, you'll want the 250 skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">actually if you are patient and enchant everrything, have a geerlock, and use only next gem/triv combos ppl have gone from 0-250 for 100pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>YurienStonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">how can you do it for 100p when the bars of plat cost 105 each?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kronepsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's because enchanted versions of the JC combines will net you a profit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The point is that you would have lost only 100pp at the end. <br />
<br />
 You will need more &quot;working capital&quot; as you go, but the final amount lost from your bank account is only 100pp.<br />
<br />
Note - those are not my figures, just my attempt to explain the earlier comment.  It cost me significantly more than that to get 250 skill in Jewel Craft.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bregalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye, I am the one who went 195-250 in one day, and ended up down 100pp at the end.   You should also understand that I am a lvl 65 enchanter with some hefty mana regen/concervation options, so having everything enchanted is not a problem.<br />
<br />
And I am making decent profit, too.   Wind-worn stones go for 500-600 pp on Xev, storm rider blood 20-50pp.  We are doing lots of hunting in Storms for Diaku and for BoT keys, so I get lots of copper.  It normally costs me about 1kpp to make an electrified earring of tempests, and I easily sell those for 3kpp+<br />
<br />
Again, being enchanter, I can do all requisite imbues, and I can distill/purify mana too.  I made a number of Valorium rings for guildies, as well as a couple bloodmetal earrings.<br />
<br />
Planes of Nightmare, Storms, and all 4 elementals, have full lines of plate, chain, leather and silk armors, plus plane-specific bows.   Every single one of these requires a planar-specific emblem.    Emblems are all 250+ JC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When I did my enchanter's JC to 250, I didn't enchant anything and it cost approximately 10k from 1-250.  Now doing my Druid's JC, I have gotten to 215.  From 200-215 it has cost me 600pp so far, enchanting everything.  I haven't used a geerlok at all.</div></div><hr />
