Second, as I will be staying home, I prefer the time with my family than the possibility of being a statistic to any one of the numerous drunk drivers that will be out toinght, does anyone know if SoE has anything special planned for ingame?  GM events or anything? (though, of course, I have never seen a GM event in the short time that I have played)</div></div><hr />

I hate being out on New Year's, rather sit home and do my Canadian Club and vegetate, but I have to puppeteer 3 shows at First Night.  Fun to a degree, and I get paid, but still...<br />

A safe, happy, and prosperous New Year to all current and former and soon-to-be tradeskillers, and hugs!  :p</div></div><hr />
