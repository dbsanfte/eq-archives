<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Feodor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
<br />
I've been sitting at 200 baking for a while, and noticed that there are some really nice skill up paths with GoD.  I'm about to sink 3 hard-earned AAs into Craft Mastery to max baking, so I have a few questions for the master bakers here.  (Ok, so they weren't that hard-earned -- about 4 hours in Sol Ro/PoE :) )   <br />
<br />
I plan on using Beer-Battered Tuna Rolls to get to 207 (all components store bought or fished in Abysmal Sea), but then i run into a tiny problem....<br />
<br />
I NEED VEGETABLES AND I DON&quot;T FORAGE!  (/shout off)<br />
(Vegetables for new GoD crab/tuna recipes -- hate the idea of MTPs...)<br />
<br />
1)  Is there anywhere I can buy vegetables?  (And, yes, I checked under Trade Supplies, and there are few if any in the Bazaar.)<br />
<br />
2)  If I were to make a foraging alt, what class/race is easiest?  And what zones should I be foraging in?  <br />
<br />
3)  Do any mobs drop veggies?  Say Lumbering Cauliflower?  Or Asparagus Spearsmen?  <br />
<br />
Thanks for any pointers!<br />

1)  Is there anywhere I can buy vegetables?  (And, yes, I checked under Trade Supplies, and there are few if any in the Bazaar.) <br />
<br />
As far as I know, you cannot buy vegetables, except for in the bazaar/from other players. Sometimes you get lucky and find someone who has 70 vegetables for sale, other times there are no vendors. <br />
<br />
<br />
2)  If I were to make a foraging alt, what class/race is easiest?  And what zones should I be foraging in?  <br />
<br />
I don't know that any one class/race is easier than another. I would pick a class that has a foraging ability over a race that has one (is it true that the racial ability to forage has a cap at 50? Or that it just starts out at 50?). Druids, rangers, and bards can all forage - rangers get the ability at the lowest level, I believe.<br />
<br />
<br />
3)  Do any mobs drop veggies?  Say Lumbering Cauliflower?  Or Asparagus Spearsmen?  <br />
<br />
Sadly, I have never seen any mobs drop veggies. Your best bet is to forage, unless you want to spend money and tons of time scouting the bazaar :boggled:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you just want to get into it straight away go with wood elf since they start with 50 in forage. As for where, most old world zones will give veggies, and they are common as dirt forage. Druid or ranger, your choice of which you'd prefer, they both end up capping at same skill. If you know anyone with a foraging alt or main you could try asking. I know I've end up forcefeeding veggies since I get way too many of these common forages.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Zones with as few as possible 'rare' forages. This (http://www.eqtraders.com/sources/source_zbt_page.php?st=Foraged)  is a list of rare forages per zone; ideally you want a zone that is not on this list at all, as then all you will forage there will be from the regular list. You might also find this archived copy of the old (pre-database) foraged items page (http://web.archive.org/web/20030604135706/eqtraders.com/location/foraged.htm) useful. Remember you are looking for zones that are NOT on the list :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wood elf rangers.  I believe forage is an innate ability for wood elfs, and starts at 50.  That will save you the time of getting it up that high (though it will be capped, I think, until you get to level 10).</div></div><hr />

Beer-Battered Cragbeast Steak<br />
<br />
will take you to 222 without veggies or eggs. <br />
Just the meat and store bought stuff.<br />
<br />
I havent tryed to farm the meat yet, and am AFK for next 3 weeks.  But that is something you could try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nanndas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Like any other skill, your chance of a successful forage will be better with a higher level. Last night I foraged while fishing in the Abysmal Sea for 5 hours (4 hours fishing and 1 hour to make bbq sauce and do combines to get to 195 in baking). His foraging skill is 177 atm. I foraged nearly a stack of veggies as well as sandals, berries, daggers, fruit and roots. The sea is on a normal table with no rare items. <br />
<br />
I check the bazaar when I put on my trader. Some days there are none for sale and other days I can buy 2 stacks. Average price seems to be 1pp each.  I now have a backpack full. I've also bought a bag load of fruit which seems to be more common in the bazaar. I plan on doing MTP's so I'm also picking up Brownie parts when they are available at a reasonable price.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">OK prepare to scream.<br />
<br />
The best source for the hynid and cragbeast meat is also foraging.  You forage tons of the stuff in Natimbi.  <br />
<br />
As far as forager toon:<br />
<br />
Wood elves and iksars both get level 50 foraging at birth.<br />
Rangers get the skill at lvl 3<br />
Druids get the skill at lvl 15 (I think - was a long long time ago)<br />
Bards get it at lvl 12 but are capped at 55.<br />
Hobbits get sneak which is kind of handy if you merchant mine unfriendly vendors.<br />
<br />
Be sure to make a foraging macro and tie it to a movement key (look for one of the threads in the forums for details.)<br />
<br />
The easiest thing to do is to ooc for veggies in places where folks are hanging out like PoK.   You can probably find a few foragers who are happy to give them to you (especially if you take some roots along with the veggies.)<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL, foraging????<br />
<br />
Does this seem a little wrong to anyone else?  I mean how often do you see meat lying around while walking through woods or along the beach. .....  Appart from roadkill that is, which dosent make very good steaks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nanndas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I forgot to mention in my other post. I was surprised that it was foraged also. It has to be a small forage table. I was at a vendor last night and half her inventory was Cragbeast and Hynid meats in all sizes and not just one of each. Now that I can go to 222 I'll check tonight and if still there I'll load up to get from 207-222 before switching to MTP's<br />
<br />
Nan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Main part of forage table actually which is why you get tons<br />
<br />
I think it is listed somwhere else, so forgive repitition on my part:<br />
foraged Hynid roadkill - 15 different weights<br />
foraged Cragbeast roadkill - 15 different weights<br />
the regulars: water pod, veggies, fruit, roots, rabbit roadkill, berries, and fishing grubs<br />
foraged other tradeskill stuff: moldy tea leaves, tea oil, ginseng, mint, <br />
junk: purple worms, dolara pollen, darkmatter dust, darkfang mushrooms<br />
quest: broken shore shell<br />
<br />
I know I missed some things in there.<br />
<br />
I would say everything except for the tea stuff and shells seems like it is a common forage in a table that has at least 46 items.  So you get Natimbi Roadkill about 2/3rds of the forages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>hyelaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you are going through the trouble of making an alt.  I would suggest druid.  This way, it will be easier to port around to different zones that have special forages, if you want to later on.  Since everyone is saying wood elf, I guess that would be the class to try altough I've never played one myself.  You would have to lvl it up to 39, if you wanted most of your porting spells. :idea:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Laoghairre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'll suggest it again -- if you want veggies, forage in freeport.  No special stuff to forage up in those zones :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Adding to Laoghairre's suggestion - pretty sure none of the old world starting city zones have anything extra in forage table (Kelethin doesn't count since it is contained in a zone, and Shar Vahl has extra forages in table, Cabilis doesn't have anything extra does it?).<br />
<br />
Oh I was wondering if there are pieces of meat all over the place because of the cataclysm that hit Taelosia.  Maybe whatever exploded was underneath a herd of critters so their remains are blasted into bits and laying all over the land.  You figure those Hynids would weigh maybe 600 pounds a piece, and the Cragbeasts easily go over a ton or two.  It could have partially cooked the meat too so it is a bit preserved.  <br />
<br />
Or maybe the blind dog things are messy eaters and rely out their heat sense instead of smell so when the meat is cold they can't find it.   (I know my cats lose track of treats and toys if they are too close or underneath them - silly kitties.)<br />
<br />
Wouldn't you think the tureptas should be friendly?  They look just like Gamera - well besides that they don't shoot flames out of the sleeves of their shells and spin around flying through the air.  <br />
<br />
OK I have officially lost it.  &quot;Wheeeeeeee&quot;,  I hope I don't find it for awhile.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Woodie Druid. :)<br />
<br />
Foraging starts at 50, and eventually you can port. :)<br />
<br />
That's what I did anyway. My druids level 31 now, and maxed his foraging at 160. :)<br />
<br />
However, since we have the new UI... I'd still say MTP's. :) need a lot less veggies... :p hehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Melinia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Veggies? hmm...<br />
in guild chat: &quot;Anyone have any Veggies they don't need?&quot;<br />
I got a /tell from a guildie in 5 minutes stating an alt had a ton. Ended up with over a (10slot) box worth. <br />
Or maybe become friendly with a druid :-) :angel:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The great thing about a wood elf druid is that at 39th you'll of course be able to get 200 forage and never fail to forage something - and, in addition to being able to port to various places to do said foraging, you'll be able to imbue emeralds for tailoring or pottery if you choose to do that in the future.<br />

That and wood elven women look dead sexy in leather.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe, I did the same thing.  Wood elf druid to 39, forage at 200.  But be warned, its addicting to have a druid bot.  Before long, I leveled her to 44 to get the last group ports.  Then to 46 so she can forage in PoG and PoP.  Then higher so she can forage in ToV.  Then 55 so she can fish in tier 2.  Before I knew it, she is a full blown xp/AA twink bot that can heal/buff/snare/dot/port me.  Next is 75% heal at 58, then PotC at 59, and then and then and then .... now I'm even thinking about get her 8th shawl (will be my third if I actually go through with it) ....<br />
<br />
Save yourself, don't do it!!!! :D<br />

Ok back to the question.  I did some counting, the older zones yield as much as  20% vegetables.  The newer expansion added to the forage table in some of these zones (Plains root to WC, Plain pebbles and tea leaves to EK, etc.) that lowered the yield.  Of the zones I have tested (not too many), Erud Crossing and Dreadlands are still at 20% vegetables.</div></div><hr />

A Druid or Ranger is ideal, and I've heard a Beastlord is in good shape. Griffon and Anaconda meats, and if you can Forage, Plant Shoots can make some nice stat food and get you to 250; plus you can kill the Basilisk Genitors for the Eggs you need for the Casseroles.<br />
