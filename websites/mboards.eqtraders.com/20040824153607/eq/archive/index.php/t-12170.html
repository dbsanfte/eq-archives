<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>curyllic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, I am working up fletching soon past 250 and have been looking at the different options.<br />
I only have about 30k saved up atm so not a lot.<br />
<br />
I thought the Karana arrow fletching (Steel Guardian) would be nice to use but it appears to have no advantage and I should do bows.<br />
Each arrow costs 34pp, assuming no fails on the subcombines, and there is no sellback price listed on the website.<br />
I am assuming then there is no sellback compensation so just destroy the product which would be a minimum of 34pp for each skillup attempt.<br />
The bows are more expensive but seems extremely better because of the sellback to vendor compensation.<br />
<br />
Can anyone clarify if the Karana arrows to sell back for a compensation other than like 5gp! :D<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">sell in bazaar.  might be slow but will work. use them yourself.  make one and submit price to database.  :)  good luck gming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>lonewylfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The unimbued should sell well in the bazaar...dunno about your server economy, but I know ours has a shortage of these arrows (I keep looking for just one for use with eq, and it's frustrating).<br />
You could maybe sell the arrows themselves for 1-5pp each. Maybe just give it a trial run and see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>curyllic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks, I was really expecting the diety to have some advantage in skillup cost, but it appears not. Since I already have like 200 steins I am trying to sell I will pass on the arrow selling method. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Corril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I sell the Steel Guardian Arrows on AB, and have found a very limited market (mostly I assume the EQ rangers filling out their collection). I also found when trying to skillup on them that they give far worse returns (presumably because of the closeness to triv theory). Being a ranger though I have found them fun to shoot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aerinha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I discovered that a few warriors and rogues were becoming regular customers, after a while, for the arrows. At least those were the ones coming back. As much as I am looking forward to getting endless quiver, it is still amusing/frustrating to have a ranger come up and buy ONE arrow. LOL<br />
<br />
I sold my arrows in the bazaar or used them...selling them back to the vendor seemed like such a waste considering how little they paid for them. I'd rather have the cash in the bazaar, or the fun of shooting them</div></div><hr />
