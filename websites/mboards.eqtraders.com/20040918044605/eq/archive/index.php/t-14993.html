<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jylarien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I swear this RNG is gonna give me a stroke.  So I had set up yet another 200 combine run of MTPs expecting the normal run of 4-5 skill-ups and a fairly decent success rate... only to hit 150 combine attempts with a ridiculously crappy success rate and not a single friggin skill-up.  By the time I hit 100 I began wondering if something wasn't messed up on my server due to the patch and was contemplating giving up on my run and saving my supplies for tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Well, just as I was about to call it quits and save 60 attempts for the next day the successes started rolling in like I'd never seen before.  Out of my last sixty attempts I had about 50 successes and skilled up 6 (!) times with 4 of those times being in a row!!!  Thank you SOE and Verant for taking days off my life due to added stress and worrying that I just blew time and money on a dud batch =P<br />
<br />
Anyways, up to 240 now and the server is coming down for the umpteenth time this week, so hopefully with any luck I will be able to GM tomorrow after a final and massive MTP undertaking :)</div></div><hr />
