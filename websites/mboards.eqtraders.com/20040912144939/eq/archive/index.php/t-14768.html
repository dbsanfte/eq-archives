<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can someone explain to me why it was a good idea to pick smithing as my first skill to GM?  I combine at STR of 235, and I'm getting about 1 skill up per 25-30 combines doing EVBs.  Farming velium is taking forfreakingever!!!<br />
<br />
Sorry, I had to vent my frustrations a bit.  I guess I'll do tailoring next, since that one is so much easier (note sarcasm).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Greklak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hey, at least you're getting one of the more difficult tradeskills out of the way first right? haha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did smithing first, and am working on tailoring atm. Of course, I have gotten the rest up to or near 200, when I got frustrated with smithing or tailoring, and wanted to see some skillups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">LOL.  That's not a bad idea.  My JC is the only trade that's under 100 right now (it's 21.)  I was thinking about heading over to the new zones and getting the free points up to 54.  That's a nice way to start out, and it would be nice to see the gains again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sindace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">25-30 combines per skillup is pretty reasonable.  Trying getting a Focus or HoS depending on level to max out your strength before doing combines.  Or if your strength is 235 buffed, strength is easily attainable through items</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>talamariv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Max out your STR.   You're waisting your time, money and sanity otherwise.<br />
<br />
I got to 239 smithing with 255 STR and the global average was about 1 skill up per 20 attempts of soulscream.  I had 1 or 2 hell levels and a couple times I had 2 or 3 skill ups in a row, but that should be about your overall average with max STR.<br />
<br />
I went back to leveling after hitting 239, dinged 60 right to 65 before attemtping again.  With 280 STR, averaged 1 skill up per 16 combines untill I dinged 250 smithing.</div></div><hr />
