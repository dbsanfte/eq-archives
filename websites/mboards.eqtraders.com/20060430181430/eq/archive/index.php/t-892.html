Prices vary per server, and if you're looking to buy or sell, that's where you should be.<br />
<br />
As to how much it's worth? I'm not sure, as an Iksar smith I can tell you that the demand for our cultural, both old and new, is so low I don't even bother making it anymore unless someone orders in advance. Why bother? I've sold one piece of fearsome skyiron since it came out... *mutter*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only pieces of Cabscale I've ever made for someone to wear I gave away to a untwinked lvl 10, with some other stuff I had floating around.  Made his day.<br />
<br />
Remember when I thought it was something really awsome.<br />
<br />
The oldstyle cloak was good, used it until I got a black bear in Kael.<br />

I spend 4 - 5 hours in Ikky jail and get 3 - 4 Iksar Blood. Maybe as many frog blood. They screwed up blood drops in Nurga and in Dalnir. Bandit lord in WW drops it rarely. <br />
If you bring your own blood then maybe someone would take the time to make it. I wouldn't waste my time on it. Rygorr is just as good and the ikky quest armors are easier to camp. <br />
I couldn't sell this stuff when it was actually worth something (right before velious).</div></div><hr />
