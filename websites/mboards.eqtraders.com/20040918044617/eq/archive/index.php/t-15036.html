<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been wondering about this since the patch message stating that &quot;Rainbow Trout should now be tradable.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have never seen any other mention of it - not in the fishing tables or tradeskill items, no listing in Lucy or Magelo at all.  <br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Only thing I can think of is the reference in Abysmal (but no one has ever mentioned catching one and the Battered Crab Traps still gave cloth caps on the 10th):<br />

Haon McClure looks down into his drink and taps it on the table before speaking, 'I pulled up the prettiest fish I ever saw today. It was only about a foot or so, but it was all shiny and reflected all the colors of the rainbow. Actually, it didn't so much reflect as it glowed. When I reached down for it, it twitched and unhooked itself. I watched it fall back into the sea. It looked like it was made of jewels.' (Devolnu also said this.)</div></div><hr />
