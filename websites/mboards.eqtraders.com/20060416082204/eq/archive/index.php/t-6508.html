<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueCanary</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know the Newbie Armour Quests are only tangentally related to tradeskills, but they are, kinda, and the recipies are listed on the main site.  I remember on the old message board we had a thread with pictures of newbie armour fashions - what the colors looked like for each armour type and on different races.<br />
<br />
Rather than resurrect the thread, I'd like to try to put up a page on my website with images of the armours.  I know that many of the armours are available in the fashion section of Allakhazam's...but many combinations of race/class/gender are missing, and some of the pictures, to be kind, are pretty poorly set up.  I'd like to try to get some really good quality pictures - against a contrasting background to the armour color, not at funny angles, all that fun.<br />
<br />
I really love the newbie armour...I know it's kinda sad, but I'm on of those low-level character junkies, so I find doing those quests to be a blast.  I think it's nice to be able to see what you're going to end up with beforehand, and, if you have different options (like half elves and humans) to be able to mix and match color and stats.<br />
<br />
So...if you have an image of a complete or nearly complete set of newbie quest armour, please feel free to email the image to me at psu_slacker@hotmail.com and we can see about putting it up on the site.  Depending on interest, I might end up just doing them on my own and getting as many pictures as possible...I'm weird like that.  *grins*<br />
<br />
Any thoughts, suggestions, links to images I can use, feel free to add them to this thread.</div></div><hr />
