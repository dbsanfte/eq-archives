<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KanadWinterstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night, I failed for the 8th time at 230 skill + geerlok. WHY IS THIS STEP SO MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THAN THE OTHERS?<br />
<br />
I estimate that I've spent 36 hours or more just farming sap for this stupid earring. I hate hate hate that it's not the 30% success that other super difficult (335 trivial) combines are. BECAUSE IT ISN'T!<br />
<br />
Looking more and more like I'll get a corinav earring before I get a marked runed signet. And my guild hasn't even killed him yet.<br />
<br />
Thanks sony, fail #8 made my day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Obsidianwood saps are 50k on my server, by the way, when they're sold at all.  <br />
<br />
And you need three for the temper.</div></div><hr />

That's disgusting.<br />
<br />
They're *only* 15k here on Solusek Ro. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>data9724</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Theyre 20K (if you really lucky) to 30K each on veeshan. Soloing in fire, so hope to get enough to earn in the money for a Stonehide Tunic for my monkey.</div></div><hr />

You  might consider getting your tailoring up to 240 if you are really just using a geerlok (i.e., not shei shears) as that will slightly increase your chances with the RNG. Not much, but with as painful as getting saps is, every little bit helps.<br />
<br />
I personally failed 3 times with 250 tailoring and a trophy...=P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">These were up to 39.5k last night on Quellious.<br />
<br />
At least farming them should be decent exp...just finished getting my waters last night so this is next!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>thrashette</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It is my opinion that Sony messed up the order of the Aid Grimel quest from what the designer intended.  It should have been wash plate, brew drink, craft ring, make urn, bake platter, fletch bow, tailor tunic.<br />
<br />
Consider:<br />
<br />
o You are stuck with a 35 hp 35 mana earring from the time that you do Justice trial until you kill Solusek Ro.  This earring is uncompetitive to people who can kill any of the flag mobs  between Justice and Sol Ro.  Once you complete the Fire tunic there is a trivial farm to the 130 hp 150 mana one.  The intermediate earrings are definitely out of place progresswise.<br />
<br />
o Nobody in thier right mind kills Solusek Ro before they kill Rallos Zek.  The order of progression given out by the Grand Librarian is 'Go kill Rallos Zek, then go Kill Solusek Ro.'  One would think that a quest designer would run with the plot, and allow people to get to the 100/100 earring with the RZTW kill.  But no....We have to wait for FIRE to do the last -4- earrings. Once there, we can jump straight to the last earring with no additional flags.<br />
<br />
o The difficulty of farming and number of components required is higher for the Fire tunic then for any other bit.  As guild banker, I've got air cams and food parts coming out my ears.  Obsidianwood sap, used up at 3 per try, can't be kept in stock.  Sure, it's easier to get to the spideys in Fire than the spideys in Air...but the drop rate is horrendous in comparison.  One Water raid is crab claws for a month.<br />
<br />
o The tunic seems to have a much higher failure rate than other parts, AND tailoring is the hardest skill to raise.  One would think that part of the appeal of the 100/100 earring would be to have something to wear while you get your tailoring up.  But nope, you got this lamo 35/35 one.<br />
<br />
o Bristlebane's Party Platter is worth making on its own, outside the quest.  Any serious water-enabled baker is going to have one or two just to use at raids.  So the time from attaining the 100/100 signet to getting the 115/115 one is almost NIL in many cases.  It was about 10 minutes for me, only because I failed and had to remake a platter.  That ain't right.  A Smart Sony would set it up so traders would be stuck with a 100/100 earring and a 75/75 earring waiting to make a robe.  Again, this places the robe as Part 7.<br />
<br />
So maybe you can sleep better knowing that Sony probably messed it up...and that once you are beyond the hump it is a coast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sulkano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think they did the elemental parts that way becasue, in general, PoFire is the easiest of the elemental zones, followed (again, in general) buy PoE, PoA, and PoW. I'd have put fletching step last instead of baking, for no other reason that I've never seen anything come out of PoA except on a raid...its by far the hardest to move around in. I guess PoE was originally suposed to represent the hope stone step..dunno.<br />
<br />
Now as far as the robe oges..I think its more difficult becasue its either bugged, or intentionally designed as a roadblock to progression. Either way, I to this day wish Aid Grimel were targetable so I could knock the smug grin off his little halfling face:irked:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aiyda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I got it on my 3rd try at 244 unmodified with geerlok :-/<br />
<br />
Hehe on povar the saps sell for 60k to 100k easily. So feel better!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just for fun, I decided to go through the Aide Grimel write-up and see what items I could and could not obtain.  I came up with this list of items.  To make it on the list, the item had to be no-drop and NOT obtainable directly from Grimel himself.  In short, this is stuff you have to farm or quest yourself.  All other items are tradable (so you can buy them in the bazaar) or given out directly by Grimel.<br />
 Coldain Smithy Hammer (Edit: apparently the hammer is tradable! :))<br />
 Etching Tools<br />
 Sacred Water x 3<br />
 Hope Stone<br />
Did I miss any?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The Smithy Hammer is quested but it also tradeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Oh, wow, it's tradable?  Well that makes it much easier. :)<br />
<br />
Edited my post above to note the correction.</div></div><hr />
