<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay gang, whatcha all think of the new smilies?  I've seen em getting some use, which is good! :barb:  And I've heard some comments on the side here and there.  I'm a little on the fence about the green :p and the blue :D myself.  I like the colorfulness but they look slightly nauseated hehe.  And a nauseated person blowing raspberries...well...I wouldn't stand too close. :shocked: <br />
<br />
But they do brighten things up.  I find myself trying to think of something to post about so I can use some of em, like :sing:!  I LOVE that!<br />
<br />
So, any comments, suggestions, etc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Melinia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nothing but praise :angel: <br />
Nothing to rant :steamed: <br />
Just gives me the giggles :D <br />
In every little chat :p <br />

I really enjoy the angel<br />

The guys on my guild-board found this little yellow face that kinda has a serious/disbelieving look on his face, and then he pulls up a flag from behind his head that says 'BS' on it. It kinda gets a lot of use on my guildboard... maybe that says something, I dunno. /shrug, if for some reason you want, I could attach it or something. Doesn't strike me that it would have as much use here, but if :cheers: is allowed to have beer.... /shrug. ^_^<br />
<br />
<br />
:sing: &lt;-- this is SO going to be me on Tuesday afternoon, after my last final. /whew. <br />
<br />

PS: HAHAHAH, the board catches you if you put too many 'images' in! hehehe. This board cracks me up ^_^. <br />
PS again, I keep taking more out... what's the max limit? <br />
PS yet again, still more going and I still can't post... o_0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I noticed those, and thought I was going crazy. :boggled: <br />
<br />
As it turns out, I was not.  :) <br />
<br />
Of course, being as perfect as I am, I'm never wrong.  <br />

Now, to get acquainted with the one I *KNOW* I'll be most familiar with. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqNichola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">: ouch : doesn't work because the engine sees : o and immediately parses that as, well, : o :o<br />
<br />
: ouch : ends up as :ouch:<br />
<br />
Hmm looks like ouch is one of those words that starts to look really odd when you see lots of instances of it in a short time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Good catch, changed it to : hurt :<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I love the new smileys!<br />
<br />
:D :) <br />
<br />
I was hoping we'd get some new ones. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ok, if this gets sent away, i can understand. but sometimes it's just... so... very .... appropriate. <br />
<br />
<br />
Or else we need to modify it to read &quot;DH&quot; for &quot;Dead Horse.&quot; <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hehe, it's amusing but not something we need here.  I'd rather folks find more civil ways to express their disagreement than to call something BS, particularly as it is an abbreviation of an unwelcome phrase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">:shocked: is still my favorite (I'm not much into smileys myself)<br />

<br />
So this bounced around in my head for, um, a long time, and like everything else I procrastinated on it when it really only took, um...... 4 min.<br />

DH = Dead Horse, to be used when someone asks something like, &quot;Do tradeskill modifiers stack?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dshadna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">:confused:  SInce this is my first time..I thought this was a good one..but I won't be :confused:  long.<br />
