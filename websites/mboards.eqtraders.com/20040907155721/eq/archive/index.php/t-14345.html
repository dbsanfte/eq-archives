<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Celestya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There should be two listings for each one. One is to make (for example) a large brick FROM small bricks (ie going up in size). That's the list you have there. <br />
The second (with the same name) is for going down in size eg, a large brick FROM a block. <br />
<br />
Try making your window a bit wider. I believe there's actually a note in brackets saying (from whatever-smaller item) beside the first set of listings that you have mentioned. <br />
You *may* have to do the breakdown combines once first to get them added. But they were working as of last night for me at least.</div></div><hr />

Well, I'll try that. I've been doing this regularly, and have never made bigger out of smaller, so I don't know why small to big recipes would even be on my favorites list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sylphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had the same issue with my favorites list.  These are some of the recipes that got garbled after the last patch.<br />
<br />
I deleted them from my favorites list then re-added them, now they work fine.</div></div><hr />
