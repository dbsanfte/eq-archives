<br />
About 3 months ago I got my smithing up to 171.  Since then I have pretty much just done imbued enchanted chainmail pieces to make a few hundred plat here and there.<br />
<br />
The other day I ran into a decent ammount of plat and I am wanting to get back out there and push my skill up a few points.<br />
<br />
Ive read that I can do shadowscream, acrylia chain/plate, black acrylia, and cultural armors to increase my skill.<br />
<br />
I just wanted some opinions on what may be the best route possible from some people who are there, or been there and done it.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time<br />

<br />
but many will say, do FS bp's to 188, and then do shadowscream/diety/planar armors to 250</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rassy fleetfoot</div><div class="date">12-24-2002, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yup i'd say do fine plate for at least another 10-15 points, then look at other options, aside from leather padding its all store bought and not TOO expensive, chests cost about 80p if i remember right. no messy tempers or anything to worry about either. after that, start saving morning dews and all that, work on shadowscream while you can, and when you get enough stuff to try a few cultural combines, go for those too. <br />
<br />
if you're on xegony..do acrylia..stay away from my shadowscream..ITS ALL MINE! MUAHAHAHA! :p</div></div><hr />

In which case I would suggest going with Shadowscream for skill, and the occasional peice of &quot;old&quot; cultural, accrylia, or whatever for fun or profit in between. Of course, do Fine Steel to 188 first. I say this because it is often impossible to find a level 49+ enchanter who isn't raiding, xping, soloing, farming, or making craploads of money doing KEI's and it's very difficult to find one willing to enchant the ore on the cheap for cultural.</div></div><hr />

I have good success rates with the armor and I sell alot of it in the bazaar, not at the old rates mind you but I do turn around some cash. Plus now I have a Cleric and Warrior both outfitted in nice armor that should last them till they are in the high 30's mid 40's. Just my 2 bits<br />
