<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I consulted the potion stacking chart, which was very useful and seems reasonable but do any potions that have STR as component stack with buffs?  Seems rather unusual as dex, agi, sta, etc all stack with buffs.  Any news on this matter?  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yea, that page never quite came long as I'd hoped it would.  One of these days....  In the meantime, my understanding is that the str component of potions still will not stack with other str effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If I had to guess, I would guess that it will stack with Diaku, but likely not most other STR buffs.  Diaku has the STR in a different slot than Focus and such, and stacks with them.</div></div><hr />
