<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kritta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wanted to take a moment and wish you all a very warm, healthy and happy holiday season. This has been a very, very tough holiday for me as it is the first after losing my father to cancer in August, - but there are many, many players here who have sent PMs and emails with warm wishes that have helped so much to get me through the roughest times.<br />
<br />
Here's hoping you are amoung friends and family this holiday season. Warmest wishes for the new year as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maisie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am hoping the same for you Kritta :)<br />
<br />
I actually just got married in the midwest &lt; missouri&gt; on the 20th and then celebrated and came back the 24th and I am just glad the week is over and I am at home PHEW!<br />
<br />
So wishing you all a happy, stress free season :)</div></div><hr />
