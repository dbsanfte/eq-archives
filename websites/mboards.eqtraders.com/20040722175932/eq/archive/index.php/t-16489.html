<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brodder FoamyMugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any tradeskill issues for SOE this weekend ? Post Brewing ones here only please...others can make the same for their boards. (Me I'm hoping Tinkers get alot of loving these next few weeks)...and that OOW brewing moves away from this SISSY TEA STUFF - PTUI!!!! :grumpy: <br />
<br />
 Need more hard liquors...War means hard times and harder Liquor!!! :faint: <br />
<br />
<br />
 UNDERFOOT WHISKEY (Made with the underfoot brown ale) !!<br />
<br />
 Tail kicker lager and Superior gnomish spirits cover the frog zone and gnomes...<br />
<br />
 Need some Distilled Elven Wine with pixie dust and stuff for the elves ! Sure that'd be something to drink instead of water... :p <br />
<br />
 Dwarfs? Gotta have Whiskeys based on nearly every house special there is!!!<br />
 Bourbons, whiskeys , scotch!! RHAAR!!<br />
 I'm sure the Barbarians mastered the ICE distilling method too!<br />
 That's freezing out all water and impurities and concentrating the alcohol and flavor then aging it in casks!! Heck even redistilling it into used bnrewing casks for more flavor and since wood is rare up there!!<br />
<br />
 Nee the Gnomish Pirate's (Umm Catbik's version non-withstanding ;) ) of RUM's Rum Toddies etc...<br />
<br />
 No more Poofter drinks and teas...teas belong in cooking not BREWING...<br />
<br />
 HEH!  <br />
<br />
<br />
 But anyways pardon my interuption and post in Bullet form any problem spots in the hirearchy of skilling up, recipe problems, missing recipes, clues, and general brewing barrel problems- to include any quests requiring brewing.<br />
<br />
Dankers...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>EQDal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just a couple of ideas.<br />
<br />
Melee types get Grobb Liquidised Meat which is made from materials that are entirely vendor sold. Us non-melee types have to go all over Norrath trying to find those annoying little green leaves to make something to drink. How about a new drink for us non-melee types that is made from vendor sold materials? Something like Fuzzlecutters Brain Tonic. Recipe could be something like soda water, celestial essence, fish oil (fish is supposed to be brain food) and something like Vodka for a kick. After all, this can't be a 'Poofer' drink.  ;) <br />
<br />
Since they recently made PoK available to everyone, even those that don't have PoP, I'd like to see them remove the New Tanaan container requirement from the PoP combines. It's really annoying when I need to make some ethereal curing agent and can't because the only 2 brew barrels in PoK are being used by people that are skilling up. Being able to do these combines anywhere would really help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rayel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Right now, the most desirable drink in the game is Qeynos Afternoon Tea, and the difficulty to get the ingredients for this is low at best.<br />
<br />
The GOD Teas are much much harder to acquire ingredients, and the stats simply don’t measure up (As bazaar sales have borne out.)<br />
<br />
We either need better stats on the GOD teas, or make them a little easier to aquire.<br />
<br />
Also we need more varied stat drinks, and they have to be able to compete with Qeynos tea. If they are harder to get than Qeynos tea, then there must be a compelling reason to make them. Simply increasing one stat to 7 from 5 and then removing 2 or 3 other +5 stats is not an incentive at all, add to that the fact that the +7 is FAR harder to get, and you simply increase the desirability of Qeynos tea. <br />
<br />
And don’t put the ingredients in places that take a raid to get to, you simply eliminate all of the non power gamers by doing that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>lonewylfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The other problem with GoD teas is a lot of people just don't know about them.<br />
The one type of tea leaf is fairly easy to get, the mountain one is in the flagged zones and beyond (though I've actually found a good bit on vendors)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Make brewing slightly more of a challenge to GM<br />
    This may not be popular, but hear me out.  While tailoring and smithing are both almost ridiculous in cost to GM with respect to both farming and/or platinum invested, brewing is their complete opposite.  Brewing is the only tradeskill that one can skill from 0-240+ on a single recipe that uses common storebought ingredients that costs virtual pennies per stack.  There is no sense of accomplishment from dropping a few plat on FE and MHB.  When you hit 250 smithing it's like, &quot;Wow.  I achieved something.&quot;  Same with most of the other skills.  With brewing 250 is just another skillup.<br />
<br />
      - Significantly lower the trivial on Fetid Essence.<br />
      - Signifcantly lower the trivial on Minotaur Hero Brew.<br />
<br />
More varied stat drinks and duration drinks at all levels of skill<br />
<br />
      - A &quot;fish rolls&quot; drink (longer lasting, no stats) for lower skills.  Example:<br />
           ~ Treghost's Sweetberry Flask<br />
           ~ Trivial: 112 - Lasting Drink<br />
           * 1 x Water Flask<br />
           * 1 x Cup of Sugar<br />
           * 1 x Wild Blueberries<br />
           * 1 x Bottle<br />
<br />
      - More low-to-midlevel drinks for +stats, perhaps catering to specific classes/roles, for example: <br />
           ~ Dismal Rage Black Tea<br />
           ~ STA+3, INT+3<br />
           ~ Trivial: 90 - Refreshing Drink<br />
           * 1 x Emerald Tea Leaf<br />
           * 1 x Elven Blood<br />
           * 2 x Water Flask<br />
<br />
- Drinks with varied stats at the high-end of the skill spectrum.  Situational drinks, just like folks have situation gear (&quot;I'm going to be MT for this LDoN...time to switch out my +ATK drink for my +HP/STA drink&quot;), rather than having one or two &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; drink items.<br />
<br />
Give more benefit to consuming alcoholic drinks and make benefits/detriments directly related to the alcohol tolerance skill.<br />
Right now alcoholic drinks are for in-game RP or more of a &quot;Gee-Whiz&quot; than any really useful purpose (no that isn't a knock against RP'ers).<br />
<br />
   - The +STA and +STR effect from consuming alcohol should vary depending on the strength of the brew (A point or two for a simple short-beer, more for some toe-curling nostril-burning concoction from Brodder's private stash).<br />
<br />
   - The blurred vision and slurred speech should be lessened more significantly for folks with higher AT skill.<br />
<br />
   - The INT/WIS loss should be lessened more significantly for folks with higher AT skill.<br />
<br />
   - In addition to STR/STA, add +ENDURANCE as a benefit to consuming alcoholic brews.  Also to scale depending on the strength of the drink.<br />
<br />
Just ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Coas-Emar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">YEa i just made GM brewer with a cork this weekend. its good and all that but one problem .... I DONT GET STATS WHEN IN MY AMMO SLOT !.... sorry but neone sides me see this as a useless slot if i cant get stats in it aswell? i have a nice primary/secondary/range allready i want a ammo slot useable for stats. Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I DONT GET STATS WHEN IN MY AMMO SLOT ! This is intentional, Coas. The devs posted in another thread that the ammo slot is purely for holding stuff and for knowing which ammo to use when you use a ranged weapon. (If you're carrying three types of arrows, which should the game use when you fire your bow?)<br />
 <br />
 Due to a bug with how fishing bait works, you can now get a skill modifier from your ammo slot, so you can get the brewing +5% if you equip your corker in the ammo slot. The stats will not work in that slot, by design.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">AFAIK, since EQ's beginning, nothing in the ammo slot ever affected a player's stats.  We are lucky that at least teh % modifiers now work in the ammo slot.</div></div><hr />
