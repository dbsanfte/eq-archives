<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aznar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think sony/creaters need to come to grips with what we consider desent equipment at certain levels.   And what they have encoraged us to think.   First and formost, all of the items are not creatible untill a person can level up to access Natambi.  As one will notice most of the equipment is marked by higher recomended levels (45+)   On the same note most of this equipment would be concidered sub par at least to those who can access.  I've noticed this with lower end LDoN drops ( under 45 ) and old world for EQ.   Everquest has evolved and all of the world should show that, not just parts.   EQ feals stuffy because many of the zones are WAY more productive to go to.   Until recently with the fabled mobs some of the old world areas have seen little to no action.   <br />
<br />
In terms of Blacksmithing only they took a huge step forward with LDoN armor.   Which marked something that could be productively made and used at what one would expect for a proper level.  I thought GoD crafted weapons would do the same but have been disapointed at the outcome.   The difficulty in making doesn't nearly result in a product you would expect, not until you have access to the 65 High AA Instanced zones.   And believe me.   We just tried our first Instanced zone.   All the members are decently equiped ( Mix of raid droped and LDoN geer )   with 10-50 AA apiece, and we were met with a zone which kept us at the entrance.    About 1/3 of the mobs were WHITE at 65 and made some named in BoT look easy.   Now I'm not complaining about the difficulty.  We had a blast.   But why make such smithing equipment and other GoD crafting items so difficult to get when the final product will only be sold and used by lower characters?</div></div><hr />

Keep in mind one thing, which is something I requested from you guys from the very beginning -- Patience. I've stated this at least once before, but it seems as of late, it's been needing to be said again.<br />
<br />
I have been, and will continue to be keeping an eye on the Gates related tradeskill components and their rarity, making adjustments as necessary. Should everything go well after Fan-Faire and before the next update, you should see some increases in the drop rate some of the components.<br />

Your willingness to dynamically change tradeskill situations is VERY appreciated by .   I apologize for sometimes being one of the less-patient ones.<br />
<br />
Is there any plans to have the stats on some of the non-smithing items upgraded?   I seem to recall the Pale Nihilte jewelry being very unattractive for the difficulty required.  Tinkering seems to have solely gained Mana Batteries.<br />
<br />
<br />
But even if upgrading the stats is not possible, Might I ask that the drop rate of Hynid Blood be looked into , please?<br />

Patience is good. Patience is /always/ always good. But on Aznar's behalf, he /was/ civil in what he said and how he said it. Lilosh and I are probably two of the people most capable of /not/ making civil public statements about things, when then, um, mood struck. But Aznar isn't ranting, just making... a statement. <br />
<br />
A statement is ok to make. It says, &quot;here is my opinion on something that I have considered, and honestly I think it's just not so good.&quot; Of course, Aznar's statement comes after a spread of anti-Gates posts, so I guess it's more of a straw on a camel thing. &gt;_&lt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Believe me (or Lilosh, if you dare : P ), it is unspeakably appreciated that Tradeskill Dev people hang out here and read stuff and speak up every once in a while to remind us you're still here. No one is complaining about that. Maaaaaaaaaaany thanks for that. <br />

It was one of the more calm ones, yes, however there have been a couple threads on the same topic in here, one of which was very flammable, so I used this to post a happy little reminder :)<br />
<br />
On a side note, hynid blood's been increased a couple times, and it's still on my radar. Let's see if the drops are a bit more reasonable after the next update. ;) <br />

You are indeed a gentleman and a scholar, sir.<br />
