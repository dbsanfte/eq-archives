<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kahooli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been doing PoP pottery with skill 252 (with geerlock) basically since it came out, and I just had an unprecedented failure rate.<br />
<br />
Failed 2 ceramic shields of valor...IN A ROW!  Now I've failed combines before, but I've never failed 2 in a row.  Did they change something?  Anyone else notice bad failure rates lately?<br />

241 pottery I made 2 valor shields just a couple nights ago. I'm sure that doesn't make you feel any better, but just so you know.<br />

(If it helps I failed a stonewood bow at 252 fletching :P)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sometimes I hate the RNG.  The other day, I failed a whopping TEN Dragonkin Heraldic Helms in a row.  The odds of that happening at my skill are under 0.06% -- and yet it happened.<br />
<br />
Two fails in a row is nothing special; it happens occasionally.  I'd just guess you've been lucky until now at never having two fail in a row.</div></div><hr />
