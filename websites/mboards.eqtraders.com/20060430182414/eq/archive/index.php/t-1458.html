I have heard many things about cultural smithing being able to be used by worshippers of a certain Diety, ive also heard u dont have to worship but have a good faction with something, which one is BS. its really irking me now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garulf</div><div class="date">12-25-2002, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1.  Only a member of the culture (race) can make ANY cultural item (only Ogres can do Ogre cultural smithing, only Halflings can do Halfling Cultural tailoring, etc.)  Illusions do NOT count, you have to have been born a member of the race in question to use a Cultural Tradeskill combiner (forge, sewing kit, etc.)  No Exceptions, end of subject.<br />
<br />
2.  Imbuing.  The way it's supposed to work, only a Wis caster (Cleric, Druid, Shaman) that worships the Diety in question can Imbue a gem for that particular Diety. There are 2 exceptions to this rule however.<br />
   A. When the Imbue spells were first introduced, there was a bug that allowed anyone of the appropriate class to scribe and cast ANY of the imbue spells, regardless of what Diety they worship.  These casters have been grandfathered, they can still cast any of the Imbue spells they scribed before it was fixed.  Now you can only scribe 1 Imbue spell (not counting the new PoP Imbues), the one for the Diety you worship.<br />
   B.  Solusek Ro has no Wis caster worshippers, instead Wizards that worship Sol Ro can scribe/cast his spell (Imbue Fire Opal).<br />
<br />
3.  Creating Imbued items:  Anyone can create ANY imbued item for which there is a valid recipe (including Agnostic tradeskillers), if the tradeskiller is NOT a worshipper of the Diety in question (or not grandfathered under rule 2A above), they'll have to get the Imbued gems from someone else (who can cast the appropriate spell).<br />
<br />
4.   Use of Imbued Items:  Think of Imbued items as having Race restrictions, Class restrictions, and Diety restrictions, just like you can't equip something that doesn't list your race/class combination, you also can't equip anything that doesn't list your Diety (or has no Diety restrictions).  And yes that's correct, anyone that chose to be Agnostic, cannot ever equip ANY item that has a Diety Imbue, even something they made themselves.<br />
<br />
4.  Use of Cultural Items:  There are no &quot;extra&quot; restrictions on who can use the results of a cultural tradeskill.  If you fit the race/class/Diety restrictions on a piece of cultural tradeskill product, you can use it, otherwise you can't.  A good example is the new Human Cultural smithing, only a human smith can create it, but the list of who can use the results is pretty large. Some Cultural tradeskills (Human Smithing again springs to mind), have an &quot;unimbued version&quot;, the stats aren't as nice (some of those stats come from the gem Imbuing it), but there is no Diety restriction on these versions, so even agnostics can wear them (as long as they fit the race/class restrictions.)</div></div><hr />

i made my war before this was invented, but i never worked on him , now i am and hes up to lvl 17, hes agnostic, should i restart and have him worship a diety, in my case brell since hes a dwarf, or are there better items than cultural i can look forward to</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torm Of Quellious</div><div class="date">12-25-2002, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are much better things, and besides I doubt you will get a skill to make Brellium for awhile if you are level 17 and have no real cash making ventures. <br />
<br />
You can still smith just fine though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cavel</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are Non-Imbued versions of all the tradeskill items I have looked at. Most of the time the difference is one stat, example:<br />
 Brellium Plate BP has AC 51, STA 5, HP 40, mana 40<br />
Underfoot Plate BP has AC 51, STA 5, WIS 10, HP 40, mana 40 <br />
Mischievous Plate BP has AC 51, DEX 5, STA 5, WIS 10, HP 40, mana 40 <br />
<br />
So you see that the AC, Sta, HP, and Mana are the same on all pieces. You only gain Wis and Dex for following a god in Dwarven cultural. <br />
<br />
In Elven Cultural you gain Str for following Tunare but all other stats are the same.<br />

I think they should work some kind of conversion process in somewhere. My paladin worships Rodcet Nife (the great healer). But if my play style tends to reflect Mithaniel Marr type attitudes, why can't I visit the MithMar temple, talk to a missionary or a priest, and convert?<br />
<br />
From a Roleplaying aspect I could be a Kitty that saw the light (heh) of SolRo, or an Erudite that discovered they joys of Bristlebane. Or perhaps something happened to an E-Mar bard and converts to Innoruk. <br />
<br />
Ideas, but that would bring a far different aspect to the deity imbued armors.</div></div><hr />
