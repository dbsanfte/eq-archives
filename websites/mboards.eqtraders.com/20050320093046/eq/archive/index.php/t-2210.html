<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lling</div><div class="date">02-27-2003, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw today what might have been the best-dressed homeless man in Boston.<br />
<br />
As he stood huddled outside Souper Salad, he was obviously a &quot;vagrant&quot;, for lack of a better word, based upon his general appearance and demeanor....except for one thing.....the rather stunning mink stole wrapped around his shoulders. He wore it as proudly as someone who seemed to have otherwise lost any feeling of dignity long ago could.<br />
<br />
I couldn't help but smile. I couldn't help but think that someone had been rather generous when giving to charity.<br />
<br />
And then I thought of my boss. Unlike his partner, he is far from the &quot;little Jewish accountant&quot; stereotype. 6'4&quot;, strolling into the office in khakis and golf sweaters, he has the aura of someone who grew up privledged.<br />
<br />
As I was ready to leave the office one evening, I noticed a coat sticking out of the trash barrel. Being nosey, I pulled it out. It was a nice coat, camel colored wool, complete with scarf. Underneath that was another coat, a puffy jacket with a B.U. logo, waterproof with hood.<br />
<br />
I mentioned to Julian that he might want to put the coats somewhere else so they didn't go out with the trash by mistake. He said, &quot;oh, I threw those out. They've been in the storage room for years. I was going to give them to someone unfortunate - but I didn't know anybody.&quot;<br />
<br />
We have a least three shelters within walking distance of the office. All you have to do is walk outside the office after 8pm to see people huddled in doorways, trying to find a decent camp for the night. With weather hitting all kinds of bad records this year, you'd think you could find &quot;someone unfortunate&quot; if you gave it some thought.<br />
 <br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
It is a very tight economy. We cannot always afford to give money. I never give money to the homeless, but I try to give clothes and blankets to the organizations who help them - and money when I am able. Some shelters just ask for toiletries - if you buy shampoo on sale, pick up an extra and drop it off. Painless. Some utility bills come with a request to add $1 to your bill to help those having trouble making their heat payments. Giving doesn't have to be a big thing, but it is an important thing. Sometimes all it takes is looking around to see what you can do.</div></div><hr />

I would have dropped the Jackets off at a Salvation army or Goodwill, so that I could get the blank reciept they kindly hand out.<br />
<br />
I don't get all warm and fuzzy giving people stuff, because I worked hard for it, and it's mine... all mine... muhahaha (evil laugh from Austin Powers).</div></div><hr />

Very well written.  You are right, if you spend a few minutes to look, you can find an organization that can really use the help.<br />
<br />
A few years ago I was working for a large tech company, about 1/2 hour from Detroit.  Around Christmas time, an employee circulated a plea from his sister.  She worked at a battered women's shelter in Detroit that provided counseling, helped women restart their lives, helping them find jobs, apartments, etc.  She was asking for some help with some of the smaller things that she hoped people could donate, since the shelter had a record number of women with children coming in, and they were running short on money.<br />
<br />
He said that if anyone had any of the following things - toiletries, lightbulbs, blankets, or coloring books - to donate that he would have a laundry basket in his cube for people to put them in.<br />
<br />
The next day, his cube was filled with every imaginable thing - clothing - office clothing for women going back into the workplace, jackets for all ages/sexes, blankets, household essentials, markers, coloring books, colored pencils, regular pencils, you name it it was probably there.<br />
<br />
Long after Christmas people were still bringing things in, giving him money...often he had to forgo his small volkswagon and bring his sister's truck to work, just to keep up.<br />
<br />
None of this was hard - for us, for him, for her.  But I think we single handedly kept that shelter afloat until most of us (including him) were let go.  Even after that, people would just take the donations into Detroit themselves.<br />
<br />
You're right Lling.  It doesn't have to be big to make a big difference.  If everyone gives a little...</div></div><hr />
