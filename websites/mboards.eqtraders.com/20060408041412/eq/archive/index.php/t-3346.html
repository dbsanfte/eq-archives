<br />
- Added new potions for Vah Shir Shaman (and all other Shaman): Shadeweaver Portal. <br />
- Renamed one of two items called Figwort. The Figwort sold in Shar Vahl has been renamed Ground Figwort to reduce confusion. <br />
- Renamed one of two items called Drachling Silk. The Drachling Silk that was once no drop is now tradable and named Drachnid Silk. <br />
- Adventurers have learned new techniques for fighting Cyclopes. These great beasts are now much more likely to have their eye intact when killed. <br />
- Fixed the recipe for the potion &quot;Soul of Incorporeal&quot; to use a &quot;feather&quot;. <br />
- Fixed the recipe for the potion &quot;Troll's Essence&quot;. <br />
- Fixed the cast time on any 5 and 10 dose potions that were inconsistent with their single dose versions. <br />
- General Bragmur in Iceclad should now avoid ice flows that he was having a problem crossing in the past. <br />
- Terrorantula Silk, Feather, branch of sylvan oak, branch of planar oak, Drachnid Silk, and Drachling Silk are now stackable. <br />
- Silicorrosive Grease is now tradable and stackable. <br />
- Potions Aquatic Haunt and Serpents Drink no longer require reagents. <br />
- Grandmaster Alchemist will now have a way to prove their ability. <br />
<br />
Yay us! Maybe there is still some hope left in Alchemy after all :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Collapsible Medicine bag, please.... Collapsible Potion bag please...<br />
<br />
Shadeweaver portal is long overdue since they added the luclin ports, even more overdue since the pottery faithstones. Yay, I hate everfrost. No more everfrost maze runs for me as soon as my warrior twink's 10shot everfrost gate potion wears off.<br />
<br />
No reagents for the eb potion is nice, but what about the lev potion? That's the one I use more often.<br />
<br />
Grandmaster trophies... and I just got my pottery one. Don't know if I'll go for the alchemy one, considering that I really don't need the extra cha as a shaman. But it is a nice thought. Pity the bags are lore, and not tied to the specific tradeskill... so you can only have 1 grandmaster's satchel even if you have 2 trophies.<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, my philosopher's stone will have 5% more to alchemy than the GM trophy will. Kinda sad, we need an alchemy geerlok for those unable to get the alchemist GE to behave.<br />
<br />
Interesting to see what Troll essence, Soul of the Incorpeal, and the cyclops eye potions actually /do/.<br />
<br />
Thanks for renaming figwort, that was confusing.<br />
<br />
How about lowering some of the costs on the very gimpy clarity potions? 110pp+ for breeze is just too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fuudce</div><div class="date">02-04-2003, 07:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm just hoping the trophy will have different stats to normal trophies, like the Make Poison one has +10dex in addition to the str/wis/int/cha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quinner Sparrowhawk</div><div class="date">02-04-2003, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I could be even happier with Alchemy if they would just halve the prices of all the components. Certain potions would still be expensive but not beyond the reach of those who don't buy their plat to make.</div></div><hr />

Potion of Assailing works. <br />
Cyclops eye drops off... hell guess... + bugbane 30pp if you buy from the right vendor. <br />
<br />
Lucy says: <br />
Potion of Assailing <br />
Slot Description <br />
1: Attack Speed unknown calc: 108 range: 30 -&gt; 0 <br />
2: STR unknown calc: 107 range: 15 -&gt; 0 <br />
3: AGI unknown calc: 107 range: 15 -&gt; 0 <br />
2 mins buff, insta click <br />
<br />
Haven't tried it and don't parse, so can't tell the haste.<br />
<br />
Troll's Essence recipe may be fixed, but yabamante still costs 120pp or so so there's no way i'm making these for a 3hp regen.</div></div><hr />

That's all I could find. Now, the servers have been up for half a day and someone has not made the Alchemy GM Trophie yet! Come one people!  :D  Anyways, I hope this is just the begining to much more and better things for Alchemy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gundark Viresdator</div><div class="date">02-04-2003, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The effects on both of these potions look like something people may be interested in.  Expensive, sure, but it is nice to see that we are not &quot;Abandoned and Forgotten.&quot;  I've capped out at 165 now (level 57 shammy) and was really kicking myself for not putting my few plats over the months into something like smithing or tailoring.  However, with this and other small alchemy adujusting patches, It seems that there is light at the end of the tunnel after all.</div></div><hr />
