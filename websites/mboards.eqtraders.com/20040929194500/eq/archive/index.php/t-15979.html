<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nhin Impious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yup, it's time for another &quot;failed my stinkin' trophy&quot; rant. <br />
<br />
After four of these, and one lost trophy that I STILL don't want to talk about on Nhinx, it was time to break the streak of bad luck and try it on my other GM baker.<br />
<br />
So, today Acthenhar Sl'rinx stepped up to the oven, spoon in one hand, seal in the other.<br />
<br />
Fail.<br />
<br />
Hey, my friend's chanter is on (thanks Kiz!) and can make me another mana vial. And I have enough to afford the velium, and have the gems. So let's try that again. I mean, we're talking 50/50 shot, right?<br />
<br />
Fail.<br />
<br />
Yes, that's TWO fails in one day. One more day like this and I'll have Nhinx tied. I just can't afford another day like this for a while.  I'm kind of in a broke way.<br />
<br />
So, anybody else had miserable fail rates on two characters? I can't decide if I want to be cheered up by knowing I'm not alone, or by knowing I'm the only one this ever happens to.<br />
<br />
I'll be the one under the little storm cloud by the oven, with my head stuck in it, if anyone wants to stop by PoK and say hello.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grimina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I ended up taking 9 tries to succeed on Smithing trophy. (granted I started in the 190s I believe and succeeded at 222 or 224).  5 for pottery *groan*  I believe it only took two for brewing thankfully.  Pottery and Brewing were actually at 240 when I tried.  I did baking first on Meawin and got my trophy the first try (at 242) and just about had a heart attack.  So look at it this way...at least your heart isn't in danger of erupting *rolleyes*  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is no spoon.  :)<br />
<br />
(I am surrently saving up for my 4th attempt on a spoon)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Furyrpied</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I pushed really hard to get my brewing to 250 before the new UI came out so that I could say I GMed one the hard way (yeah granted it was the easiest TS, but hey.... Mino Brews the hard way :P)<br />
<br />
Anyway.....<br />
<br />
6 fails in one day on the corker.  :faint: <br />
<br />
Last try with a chanter friend of mine watching over my sorry crying arse, buffed to the bejiggers and praying to Karana to give me the streingth for one.... more..... click....<br />
<br />
Proud corker carrier....<br />
<br />
Now... why my alc tollerance is only at 54, I dunno...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maisie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I busted my hump to get tailoring to 250 and then failed my first 4 trophy attempts...<br />
<br />
It was Grim :(<br />
<br />
Hang in there though! your time is coming!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Serenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've failed 2 fletching trophies so far, at 244 skill.  My brewer has not yet tried, and since my 250 baker is 11 I probably shan't go for the spoon.   Unfortunately, it seems to me that attempts in excess of 3 or more are far from uncommon, which means we are really doing it for the bragging rights.  It would be cheaper to buy a tink bag. <br />
<br />
*hugs*<br />
<br />
Good luck with your next attempt!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It was Grim :(<br />
<br />
<br />
hehe wasn't me :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think I had tailoring in the first try and jc in the third try then decided to wait until I had 1750'ed to get the rest.<br />
<br />
I made up about oh 12 combines (i.e., seals) for th 5 trophies left and went to town on them. Ended needing like 2 or 3 more seals to finish up, but doing them all in a run was much less painful.<br />
<br />
Also did my tinkering trophy on Tart - I think she got it in the first try. It's now her primary item all the time. =)<br />
<br />
Happy to say I use them all regularly. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>data9724</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">6 of mine took 2 tries each.<br />
But the brewing trophy took me 8 tries. And thats the nastiest one, since you need a 1K corking device (thats bazaar price on veeshan when i did it) too pr try. All 8 combines done on same day, prices between 4 and 5K for the seal, so total cost somewhere around 44K or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Compare the 1k cost of the corker + the total cost of 1-250 Brewing to any other tradeskill. Then complain about the cost of corkers again...  :confused:</div></div><hr />
