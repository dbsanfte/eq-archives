<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verdandi</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone here know much about Lucy's item collector?  I've been using it for a while but it has yet to upload an item that I have but isn't in their database, so something ain't right.  The people in their own bugs forum have been, erm, less than responsive.  :P  But I have a new item, durn it, I wanna add it!  The folks on the shaman boards didn't have an answer, so now I'm appealing to my fellow tradeskill geeks. :)  The following is what I posted on Lucy's boards a while back, and it's still behaving the same way.<br />
<br />
At first it was in quiet mode, but taking it out of that didn't help.  So I dinked around with the Network Interface option in the settings. The default that it was on previously was &quot;NdisWan Adapter&quot; while the other option that I tried now is &quot;Intel(R) PRO Adapter&quot;. I tried switching between the two while logged in, zoning a couple times when it said &quot;Desync detected, zone or relog to reset.&quot; Here is the entire transcript, with the port #s turned into XXXX because I don't know if they'd give anything away to unfriendly hacker types: <br />

Each time I zoned after switching to the Intel, I immediately checked and it was already saying &quot;Desync detected...&quot;, so it's losing the connection immediately. The NdisWan doesn't even look like it's trying...? <br />
<br />
Can anyone turn this into suggestions on how I can get the collector to collect?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a setting about using promiscuous mode.  Make sure that is off.  I've actually had it stop working lately. I know this because I've seen items and have the collector running, but they never show up. (6th gnome robe, tae ew plate helm).<br />
<br />
Hopefully the next autoupdate will fix this.</div></div><hr />

I forget why, but I remember that something in the description for it made me decide to leave it off.  Maybe I didn't like the thought of my new PC getting promiscuous. :D</div></div><hr />
