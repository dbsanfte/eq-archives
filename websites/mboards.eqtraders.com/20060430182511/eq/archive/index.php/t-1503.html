<br />
For Agnostic Barbarians, non-Imbued Heraldic Plate exists...  Same AC, much fewer stats, lower HP, more Mana.<br />
<br />
Would've been nice if the Agnostic Plate(s) had just hps (like the Rallos Imbued Heraldic) since 95% of the Agnostic Plate wearers are Warriors! (the other 5% being Bards.)</div></div><hr />

If between 46-60, the stats are not optimum, but are a better option than acrylia plate, certainly.   Otherwise, as other folk have stated above, you'll have to go with gear made by others or by loot.<br />

While the stats might not be as amazing as the PoP armors now in game, the Engraved Royal Velium Field Plate is also within your capability, and it is definitely trivial to a GM Smith.<br />
<br />
While not CULTURAL in nature, it is serviceable INTERIM armor that you can make yourself, and requires no faction/religion on the part of the wearer.  (The smith has to have proper Coldain faction.)  It seems to sell fairly well in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
As a Barbarian Tribunal worshipper, I recently had a Night Terror Chain Tunic made that I'm much happier with instead of the Artificer's Ringmail Tunic I could have obtained.<br />
<br />
You may find yourself (and customers) preferring to purchase the new PoP stuff in lieu of cultural plate opportunities as well even for those with the correct religion for it.<br />

One consolation prize would be Northman (non-imbued) Ringmail if it is  Cultural armor you are looking for roleplaying reasons.  It isn't plate, but it is plate wearable.  But the stats on those are extremely poor in comparison.  Included for completeness only...<br />
