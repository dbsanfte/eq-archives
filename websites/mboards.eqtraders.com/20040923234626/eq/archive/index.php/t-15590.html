<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>faernu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Let me think about this..u get to 240 skill and ur gerloc gives u 5% or 12 more skill and u are maxed.  so you get your trophy and ur still maxed!!  why go to 250??  other than thumb in your armpit and a puffed chest seems like there not a reason.  i just got tailor to 246 and was looking for more material to go to 250 and said wait a minute!!!  why spend all that time and effort not to mention PP when i can get trophy and call it cheapest way out. It would be nice if first of all you couldnt even try for your trophy until u hit 250 and then it gave u the full 5%.  very little would change other than the prestige of getting more skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1. Paragraphs are nice. Also actually spelling out 'your' is nice too.<br />
<br />
2. The only reason to get 250 is to one day be in the 1750 club. Thats it. Its been like that since Geerloks and other modifiers were introduced. You didnt come up with anything new.<br />
<br />
3. Heres your stick. The horse is that-a-way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Healblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">(1) People were able to get to 250 skill in a tradeskill long before Geerloks or any other skill modifying item existed.<br />
<br />
(2) Nobody is twisting your arm to make you get 250<br />
<br />
(3) Calling Sony &quot;stupid&quot; isn't doing anything but making you sound rude.  Quite a few SOE employees, including Maddoc the Tradeskill Developer, read (or at least visit) this board and work hard to address issues that need to be addressed.  We appreciate their work, and I am offended that you would so brazenly insult them.<br />
<br />
I understand that with the ease of obtaining a Geerlok, getting a skill past 240 has pretty much no use.  However, many people (myself included) want to get 250 in their skill(s).  For me, it is a matter of my pride in my tradeskills.  I have spent the past 18 months working my tradeskills, and I hope to join the ranks of the 1750 club this month.<br />
<br />
Please try to respect the feelings of others who read these forums... we really are a nice bunch, if you don't mind psychos who tradeskill!<br />

I am glad you posted that, because I was utterly confused as to what that meant. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>faernu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I never meant my post to be a personal attack on another players desire to achieve a certain goal so im not sure why u sounded like it was personal.  i still think that to provide goals in a game environment that are meaningless is stupid.  In this case even more so since it would be a very easy thing to fix.  How hard could it be to raise the skill limit to give full credit to the trophy?  It wouldnt upset the trivial limits as very few items trivial requirements would fall in the range of 252 and 263 but it would give meaning to getting the trophy at least.  Btw, I'm not a tradeskiller per se but i dabble in it for a change of pace and do have 2 players at GM level and over 140 in every skill except tinkering, poison, and alchemy so i am impressed with anybody who spends the time and effort and oh yes lets not forget PP to get to 250.  I did all mine the hard way and farmed and it took a year to get tailoring done.</div></div><hr />

You should NOT rant like this in the General Forum. <br />
<br />
Rants belong in the Primal Scream Room. <br />
<br />
Check the FAQs.   Read the rules in the Visitor's Corner. <br />
<br />
Labeling this post the way you did violates our long standing &quot;no personal attacks&quot; rule.  Not a good start on your stay here.  Be glad it was me, and not the House Ogre or Denmom who saw this first. <br />
<br />
I've also re-titled the post.</div></div><hr />
