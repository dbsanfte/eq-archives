Tenebrous aliens are good, but wanderers can be a pain.  The Grimling Forest Caves are nice because the grimling miners there are static spawns and are easily dispatched.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pojodan</div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">About the most efficient way is to take over the grimling caves in TM.  You'll get about one peice per clearing, however windstones and a variety of 10pp+ gems drop fairly often.  The acrylia runes are worth keeping too since some sell for 6pp or more.<br />
If you're quick about it you'll have a good deal of time before the grimlings start spawning again allowing you to wander around the general area and take out alien dudes for the occational 3 brick drop.  Just stear clear of the wolfs and bats and be prepared to be rooted a lot.<br />
<br />
Acrylia caverns apperantly has a good drop rate, however it's a much higher level zone with casters galore and no real good safe spot to pull too.</div></div><hr />

Your post says you are a 61 druid, just nab a c3 and have fun.... At 60 most is light blue and blue, but at 61 you are looking at greens and light blues. Deffinatly the best drop rate of any zone in game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First visit or two I got more than I could carry, then went back a few months later, and got about 1 piece in the same time.<br />
<br />
Have you been there recently Narith, if so I might go check it out again if the drops are back...</div></div><hr />

Usually about 2 hour sessions with 4 people, all around 60. We also get Black Acrylia, which sells nicely in the bazaar and can finance buying still more acrylia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bennan</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great to hear, I might pop back in and check it out again !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Narith</div><div class="date">01-23-2003, 03:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems to be random when I hunt acrylia. Some days I can spend 4 hours and walk out with maybe 3 stackable peices and 2 blocks, other days I will have 3 bags full in a little under an hour.<br />
<br />
Deffinatly the faster you kill the more you get so you might wanna bring a tank and another damage dealer with you. People hunting VT shards make great friends, you keep the acrylia they keep the shard.</div></div><hr />

I've cleared that cave before and got nothing for my efforts, but maybe just taking out those spawns that are fast respawns might yeild some acrylia.. the grimlings in hallowshade have pretty horrid drop rates, having wiped out the entire south camp including the area around the cheiftan several times and only gotten away five or six bricks and about as many peices.</div></div><hr />

Man I love this place.  :D <br />
<br />
Can get enough ore to make 60 bonings in a long day of EQ.<br />
<br />
The Deep might have a better ore drop rate than AC, but will need a group.  Problem there is that you have to keep moving as the mobs that drop the ore are mixed in with other ones, i.e. dungeon crawling.  I can never get my guildmates there, to distracted by PoP.  I'm just relying on good 'ole ACaves for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kytelae</div><div class="date">02-24-2003, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do the Grimlings outside the caverns, in the Forest itself, drop as much as the ones in Tenbrous do? Tenebrous is often camped on my server, and I don't really like fighting indoors (i.e., inside the Caverns) when I'm solo, so an alternate outdoor spot would be useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velurian</div><div class="date">02-24-2003, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About the same drop rate between the grimlings outside of AC as from those in TM, from what I've seen, but I've been spending a lot more time in TM than in Grimling Forest, so I might not have gotten a representative picture of GF.  (The one advantage I can see GF having is that there are a lot more static grimling spawns, if you don't count the TM grimling caves, which I assume is what you meant when you said that Tenebrous was frequently camped...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stu Pidiot</div><div class="date">02-24-2003, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have found a weird place to get acrylia: The owlbear caves hollowshade moor when the grimlings are in control of it. The drop rate is not good but the spawns are static and extremely fast respawn. I usually do this as a 2 man operation with another player preferably a caster so they can gate to a forge doing all the looting for me. As soon as u kill one mob move on to the next one. The respawn rate is only a couple of minutes so by the time u are finished clearing away a small group of them they are starting to respawn again. I did this with a guildie that was just inside in the limit to get exp when grped with me and I eneded up PLing her a couple of levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kytelae</div><div class="date">02-25-2003, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I meant the caves in TM are often camped. I hate the wandering stuff in TM cause the bats and wolves are so annoying. Even when I get a TM cave for a while some other poor tradeskiller will soon come along asking when I think I might be done... I don't mind taking my share but if there's another spot I can use without having to worry about campers I'm happy to do so. Plus: one port to Grimling and I'm there, it's a pretty easy thing to reach the caverns.</div></div><hr />
