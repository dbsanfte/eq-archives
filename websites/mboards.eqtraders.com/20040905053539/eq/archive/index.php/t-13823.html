<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Timmie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is anyone else having a problem with new UI recognizing enchanted bars to do combines? I blew out 15 pieces before noticing it was using the velium, bars I had not enchanted. When I enchanted all of them it wouldn't combine...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I haven't looked, but I bet there's two recipes for each JC piece, one enchanted and one non-enchanted.  When I made celestial essences last night, I had to scroll down and click each of about 30 celestial essence choices to find the one with scent of marr.  If you hold your mouse over the items pictured in the &quot;container&quot; you will see it's name.  Check to make sure it's for enchanted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Timmie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I remember only seeing one recipe per item and had to &quot;learn&quot; the pieces I do on a daily basis. It would do combine on recipe with non enchanted bars only. I don't recall seeing for example 2 recipes for Black Sapphire Velium necklace...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brujo Cuatlique</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't know how long &quot;learned&quot; recipes stay on the menu, but after I did a single expiremnt (manual) combine the recipe then showed up on my search list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Timmie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I tried that but still it would only use non-enchanted bars for combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1. Recipe's marked AutoLearn in the database will automatically show up when you have a skill &gt;= (trivial - 50) and you perform a search which the recipe matches.<br />
<br />
2. Searches can only return 100 recipes. If a recipe is not being found, and you know it's AutoLearn, then restrict your search by limiting the trivial's involved, or entering part of the name of the recipe (usually the name of the item created). Note that there's a text message displayed in chat when you hit 100 recipes on a search, telling you this.<br />
<br />
3. Recipe's marked CanLearn in the database will not show up in the recipe list until you perform one successful combine of that recipe in the old interface (experiment). After you have been notified that you've learned the recipe, you can then search for it in the new UI, and use it to perform combines. If you successfully perform a recipe combine in the old UI and don't get the &quot;you have learned&quot; message, then you either already have the recipe due to it being AutoLearn and within range of yoiur skill, or it is not marked CanLearn (for now, that may change later, of course, but then you'll have to &quot;learn&quot; it after it's changed).<br />
<br />
So, if you tried it in Experiment mode and were successful, but didn't learn it, then check again to see if you can search for it by name (it might be autolearn). if not, then you can't learn it right now.<br />
<br />
4. Marking said recipes AutoLearn and CanLearn is a work in progress. A lot of recipes can (and probably will) get marked as one or the other in the near future.<br />
<br />
5. All data about what recipes you &quot;know&quot; is stored on the server, as is the recipe data. You can't find it on your client side... it's not there.<br />
<br />
6. Some people want to switch the Right-click/Ctrl-right-click functionality of Tradeskill containers. Just click the &quot;Use CtrlRClick&quot; button on the new UI, and regular right-click will open the container in the old, bag-style; you'll have to Ctrl-right-click the bag to bring it up in the new UI.<br />
<br />
<br />
maybe its #4.  they just haven't gotten to it yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Timmie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">LOL the ones in the default list were all ones either triv or wouldn't make in the first place. I learned it originally to be able to search it. Then made some items only to find out the auto function was grabbing non-enchanted bars. I then enchanted all of them and tried again from recipe. It said item is missing velium bar. WRONG I had 20 enchanted bars in bag. The recipe was learned and then searched before attempt on auto...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brujo Cuatlique</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Did it say item is missing velium bar, or item is missing enchanted velium bar?  Once you learn an enchanted recipe, it will show up next to the unenchanted version on most search lists that are restrictive enough to completely display.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Timmie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Doh! After thinking about it I did a manual combine and then a search and yes 2 different versions of the item showed up. In my initial haste to make items for Expansion twinks/newbs to buy failed to use new UI properly. I got it down now hehe and others on my server MB also have some interesting misfortunes...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bregalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Recipe learning is bugged.<br />
<br />
I made a Valorium Ring of Gallantry today.   I got a message that I learned the recipe, but it still won't come up in search.<br />
<br />
A shaman in my guild has same problem with Kilva-something potions.<br />
<br />
Enchanted Valorium bar (smithing) added to recipe list properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you're using a colapsable kit to do combines in, check a regular or planar kit.  I'm guessing the recipes *might* show on the lists for those containers. <br />
<br />
The colapsed kits seem a bit wonky at the moment. :)<br />
<br />
Also, be sure to use /bug in EQ for reporting of bugs.</div></div><hr />
