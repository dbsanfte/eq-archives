<br />
I've PL'd up a Gnome to 16th so that I can make bow cams for Fletching.  The cams are trivial to him now but he fails to make them about 25% of the time.  Is that normal for Tinkering?<br />
<br />
<br />
I've done several hundred combines so thats a large enough sample to smooth out any streaks in the RNG.  Am I missing something?<br />

<br />
Raise your skill more. The failure rate will drop.  There used to be a floor on success rate such that you always had a 5% chance to fail (or succeed) regardless of your skill.  That doesn't exist anymore but even then you had to be somewhat above the trivial point to reach it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You don't drop down to the 5% failure rate until you are about 40 points over the trivial level, so keep skilling up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With a geerlok, a 75 skilled tinker has effective skill of 79.  At 79, a 75-trivial combine has a 74.25% chance.<br />
<br />
To reach the 95% level for a 75-trivial combine, you need to reach 95 skill.  This is not that hard, making either spyglasses or stalking rpboes, both of which sell profitably in the bazaar.  You can also vendor the stalking probes at a loss of only 1.5pp per success.<br />
<br />
75-&gt;102: Stalking probes<br />
1 Bottle (0.005pp) at Amalie Pitt at Amalie Pitt @ N290, P800<br />
1 Firewater (0.073) hand-made (get water from Amalie and gnomish spirits around the corner from Caden)<br />
2 Gears (14.7pp) at Tabben<br />
1 Metal Rod (0.787pp) at Tabben<br />
Total Cost: 15.6pp<br />
<br />
Sell back is 14.286 (sell or not depending on your inventory and your bazaar tolerance)</div></div><hr />
