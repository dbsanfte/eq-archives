Because once the the rec/req levels go in we will be left with hundreds of tradeskill recipes that are totally useless.<br />
<br />
Because I already got all my skills up to 200 or higher, but I now have to go back and click through 2800 combines of mid-50's, and lower, trivial items just so I can make the new recipes that will soon be completely useless.<br />

I can also appreciate there is a lot of new tradeskill recipes,  think they went a little overboard (no pun intended) with abysmal sea, now all you have to do is stand in there to TS, no need to travel around any more, which is convenient, but is sort of sad I think.  However, I'm a person who didn't like to see all the pok books, convenient, but it all makes travelling too easy, i'ts part of the game people shoud enjoy a bit more.</div></div><hr />

And when I conciously refer to it, I call it Gates. I think Loy and LDoN are the only ones I refer to by a pronounciation of their anacronym. Partly because the Loy zones don't seem to be their own continent, and ldon is just a bunch of holes in the ground ^_^<br />

Couldn't they have made it necessary to take a boat or port to get to natimbi?<br />
<br />
And to those of you who like it so far, you seem to like it only because of abysmal sea.....If you don't want to experience any of the actual content that the expansion offers then I might agree with you but the mobs and regular content are just way out of sync with the levels that could possibly xp off of them. <br />
<br />
Sorry Cherryflavour but there is no way that you can go toe to toe with a light blue that moves at bard speed, hits for nearly 300 and procs a 550 DD on you practically every swing.  Or has a 6 second stone.  Or 2 different types of dots.  <br />
<br />
Every single mob is insanely MR, and runs at nearly sow speed normally.  If you remember what LoY was like when it first came out then multiply that times 10 and you will see just how bad it is right now.</div></div><hr />

... pwease explain for those of us who didn't buy?  <br />
<br />
Simply put, the holy trinity is warrior, cleric, enchanter.  The Trials in Gates *require* that your group be built around these characters.  Why? Because with 10k tanks, druid heals don't cut it, and no one can mez like an enchanter and SKs and paladins don't have the mitigation to tank the stuff (which isn't completely true, some few of the best geared SKs and Paladins *can* tank the trials - Brael and Askeer for the SKs I know have).<br />
<br />
Or... hm...<br />
<br />
If your tank is not a warrior, you will lose. The other plate classes take damage too fast to stay alive and without defensive will get 1 rounded by the trial bosses.  By one rounded I mean:<br />
<br />
Complete heal lands<br />
Boss flurries<br />
Boss hits you<br />
Boss hits you<br />
boss hits you<br />
Boss hits you<br />
Boss hits you<br />
Boss kicks you<br />
Boss bashes you (&lt;- this represents one worst case melee round)<br />
you DIE.<br />
<br />
Totally unhealable. The boss swings and you are dead instantly.<br />
<br />
If your healer is not a cleric, you will lose - no druid will be able to keep up with heals and if they could they still would not have mana.<br />
<br />
If you do not have an enchanter to mez, you will lose.<br />
<br />
It's possible to do some of the earlier trials with a pal/sk and *2* clerics to heal him/her. This then fills 4 group slots and you better have a boatload of DPS to win. And it's easier if you take a warrior and *1* cleric (leaving 3 DPS slots).<br />
<br />
If this is in fact not overreaction on the part of SK/pal communities, it represents about 4 years of progress in class balance being reversed and ... I'm not going to start.  I've had too many violent fights with people that wouln't understand game balance if it painted itself purple and danced on a piano singing &quot;this is how you balance&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Qutie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, we're decently geared up, not at Time farm mode or anything like that, but getting there eventually.  And, we've done both Vxed and Tipt with other than a warrior And with no chanter.  Sometimes... they just ain't on and you do what you can do with who you have. <br />
We've done Tipt with a monk, rogue, necro, cleric, beastlord and... either sk or pally... I think the win was with a pally. Yes, a 10k pally, but a non warrior. <br />
<br />
Is it easier to do with 2 healers, a 12k tank, a chanter and all? hell yes, but it Is doable with other group makeups... you just have to think a bit more, plan a lot more and use Everything you have to your advantage.</div></div><hr />

Well, we're decently geared up, not at Time farm mode or anything like that, but getting there eventually.  And, we've done both Vxed and Tipt with other than a warrior And with no chanter. <br />
<br />
If those are the first 2 sets of trials... the problem doesn't show up there as markedly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Qutie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">These would be the final 2 of the first 6.  Sewers can be done with pretty much any make up I think, or do the 54 person raid a few times for those.  I've heard that the next section is even worse... <br />
<br />
I don't want to make it sound like it was easy, it was not.  On the one we won, I died 4 times, the rest died less, but almost everyone died at least once.  That wasn't a big fun win, as I'd died 4 times before starting that one... (sighs) <br />
<br />
CR there is the suck.  The fact that I hear they've raised the prices of the invis potions on the boat to 10pp sucks (why are they even there then? why not just have the old ones)<br />
The fact that clerics cannot self invis and you Always seem to run into the See invis mobs Just 2 steps too far from the zone...  makes for a lot of unfun stuff.  <br />
I like challenge, I like learning new things. Having to have one of my alts on a 2nd account somewhere to hand me a sow, levi and some invis pots for CR's (because 1 is almost never enough) makes it a lot less fun than it might be for others.  2 or sometimes 3 CR's when you are running back for a CR isn't fun... but I guess it's one more way to get rid of some of the clerics :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Axterix EnObelix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">By 'reinforces' you mean 'absolutely requires', yes?<br />
<br />
Nope, it doesn't.  The higher tier trials do require some good tanking and most groups bring 2 healers, an enchanter or bard, and a tank, preferably a warrior.  However, those are Time level trials of progression.  They are not xp groups.  They are things to slow down raiders.  That is their purpose.  Raiders will whine about them being difficult.  Just ask them if there should be a single group way to get elemental...<br />
<br />
If those are the first 2 sets of trials... the problem doesn't show up there as markedly. <br />
<br />
Right, not until you're doing the higher level ones.  And, again, these are trials of progression.  They are 1 group raids.  And that's the real flaw with them.  They should have been 2 group raids.  Preferably with some mechanic that stops you from taking more than 2 of any one class along.</div></div><hr />

Sorry I compeletely disagree. GOD is the second best expansion to date. Only LDON IMO is better. <br />
<br />
Now LDoN is not what I would call the best expansion to date.  I mean come on.  Yeah it added diversity and devs thought that they were going to encourage people to pull out old equipment and aug it to make it worth while when to be honest, it is still not as good as what you have.<br />
<br />
Also, talk about a MAJOR time sink.  As if EQ wasnt bad enough of stealing 250 days of my life (=p) now i have to dungeon crawl in zones that gives 1% aa per kill and waste 60 minutes outta my game time for only of portion of the points needed to the actual useful augs.<br />
<br />
Personally the only augs i would use is the Anger3 and hp augs and at 1150 adv points it is just kinda sad the amount of time that it takes to &quot;Earn&quot; one of these.  <br />
<br />
The math:<br />
1150 / 50 = 23 adventures<br />
23 adventures * 60 minutes = 23 in game hours<br />
and no matter how much i try to justify it, 40hp is NOT worth 23 hours of dungeon crawling.<br />
<br />
--Pooh<br />
<br />
PS, btw, best expansion is Luclin by far, was the first instance of true high level zones for the elite guilds.  Ssra and VT are still great raiding zones for accessory slot upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">heh, I'm find Velious and LDoN to be by far the best expansions for me.  The rest are kind of a big pile of &quot;blah&quot;.<br />
<br />
Why?  Because I have used and continue to use the actual *content* of those two expansions.  I spend significant time in those zones, work through aspects of their content.<br />
<br />
The rest of the expansions, I get the tradeskill recipes, the spells, and the gimmicks.  After spells are acquired, no real time is spent in anything expansion-specific.  Sure, I spend time in PoK which is part of PoP, and I've done the Dwarven Ale turnins in Katta.  But those things don't feel much part of the expansion - there's no real difference between tradeskilling in Kaladim or PoK, except that PoK has newer generations of items and is more complete - it doesn't have any PoP-style mobs or encounters, or connection to PoP-based progression.  Farming tradeskill supplies in Luclin accounts for virtually all my time in SoL's combat zones.<br />
<br />
I've spent a lot of time xping, questing, exploring, and/or raiding in SoV and LDoN, and really enjoyed them.  I feel like I've actually started to work at the &quot;meat&quot; of these two expansions, whereas with the rest I've just chowed down on the appetizers and side dishes.<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
I do find time calculations for LDoN curious.  Like the above points out, you could say LDoN &quot;prices&quot; 40hp at 23 hours of dungeon crawling.  Since everyone gets the same points, you have 6 people investing 23 hours each for 6 40hp augs.  So 138 player-hours to produce 6 40hp loots.<br />
<br />
What would you consider the time costs for typical raiding, or a raiding evening?  The number of hours to organize, set up, clear, and get to the targets, multiplied by the number of people involved can get rather high.  And for how much loot?  3-10 worthwhile drops or so?  I'd be curious what the player-hours to loot-value ratio winds up being for mid and high level raiding guilds.  LDoN's numbers game might start looking a bit better ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The math:<br />

<br />
<br />
This WOULD be true, IF you had to farm greens, with no other loot, for 23 hours, to get the points.<br />
<br />
The me, LDoN is nice because:<br />
1) tradeskill items drop there, and are foraged.<br />
2) AAexp at 65 is decent, and on hard adv, is really great.<br />
3) named mobs drop so-so to really nice loot, and are fairly common.<br />
4) Plat drops CAN be pretty nice (seems to have been nerfed with GoD release, or I've had bad luck lately).<br />
<br />
I sort of think of the AP system as BONUS points. Kind of like the stats the adventure stone adds. Every 10 adventures, in addition to exp, loot, drops, and some fun crawls, I get a small bump in stats, and ALSO some adventure points.  Not bad at all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Elyssanda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">To date Ldon is my favorite expansion.. why? I love dungeon crawls. I like pulling a group of people together and going in.. kicking butt, and finishing in a reasonable time. Some groups I've been in do 2 an hour... some take the whole 90 minutes.. whatever.. we're having fun.  And unlike places such as GE these adv. don't require a raid force, and give better XP than a raid. <br />
It's a game.. and due to its very nature people are able to play it successfully in a variety of ways and be perfectly happy with their chosen way.<br />

<br />
The problem is that raid content takes fewer people less time as it becomes more trivial (e.g. &quot;farm status&quot;).<br />
<br />
So an intial Vex Thal run might take 70 people 12 hours and yield 20 or so drops, but that same run later would take 50 people 4 hours with the same drop yield.<br />
<br />
LDoNs don't become trivial (well, sort of) since they scale up and require about the same amount of time to complete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Daikoku Ashikaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">2) AAexp at 65 is decent, and on hard adv, is really great. <br />
<br />
Actually the XP in LDoNs is pretty sad, normals especially, low-mid 50's it can't compare to PoJ even, and PoJ is not good.   At 65, on a normal, I can get an aa in 75-90 mins of adventuring (3 of them in total)  however with the delay timer, which does allow for the usual traveling, remaking of groups in that window, is 45 mins from the start of one adventure to the start of another, so it takes a minimun of 135mins per aa.  <br />
<br />
Alot of it sitting around doing nothing.  I can get an AA in 45mins in a PoE group a PoFire courtyard group group can get one every 1/2 hour easy, I can do better in potactics even.<br />

<br />
Because it's such a great quest place.  Because you can get all of your tradeskills to what, mid 50s?  with quests?  for free?<br />
<br />
My poor berserker died four times trying to get onto the boat from Natimbi before someone nicely told me that there was a boat that went from Nedaria directly to Abysmal.<br />
<br />
There's still content I haven't experienced in Kunark, Velious, PoP, LoY.  I'm not able to sit at my desk for 90 minutes at a shot to do repeated LDoNs most of the time due to family.  And I am just not interested in going to GoD yet for hunting.<br />
<br />
I like the berserker class; I think it'll evolve quite a bit over the next few months, same as Beastlords did.</div></div><hr />

/sigh<br />
<br />
I guess it all depends on what class you are as to how much you enjoy the new expansion.<br />
<br />
But that's just the opinion of a halfling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Aethia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Yes Gates hunting requires you to be able to handle the level of hard LDON with respawn.  I am not elementally geared, not VT geared and not part of the Holy Trio (aka necro).  I don't do CRs in Gates unless it's my group.  If I'm good enough for Summoning Corpses I'm good enough to hunt there.  Having said that, I do get an occasional group there. <br />
<br />
But Gates is a good expansion.  Now many people will argue is was advertised as 50+.  And it is ... to an extent.  Yes, the mobs are HUGE undercons, but then again, this is a game that will be 5 years old.  How many people have 'won' the game and killed Quarm?  They want to be entertained just as much as the level 1 new toon made on Christmas Day.<br />
<br />
How does SOE get new players? Mostly through word of mouth.  By the player that has been playing probably since beta.  And I remember the day my neighbor showed me her druid, level 40 something, kill stuff in Eastern Wastes. I was impressed and went out that night to buy EQ and install it.<br />
<br />
For me Velious sucks (I hate the snow) &lt;g&gt;, Kunark I don't care for (too many sarnak and I don't like lizards or spiders (LOIO) &lt;giggles&gt;.  I love Luclin because of the variety and I don't lag there.  I love LDON because of instanced content.  I love LOY for more bank space.  But I also buy every expansion regardless because it gives me more choices on where to hunt, which means more friends, more new experiences and that for me is more fun.<br />
<br />
Now if only my critical dot affliction was what I had hoped for..... (but pet flurry rocks).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>FeroceFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Original game:  Once they got the bugs out, it's pretty graphically simplistic, but a neat game.<br />
<br />
Kunark: Many will disagree, but I think Kunark was the best expansion to date.  Beautiful zones, a semi-coherent theme (critters with scales, old ruins, dragons here and there), armor that really adds to your class with nifty clickies (I'm 65 and I still use 3 pieces regularly), good zones to xp in, some really neat dungeons, and, of course EPIC WEAPONS (which I would pay good money to have a series of upgrade quests for).  Iksar make for an interesting species to play.  10 more levels.  Kunark took the EQ world and blew it up.<br />
<br />
Velious: Pretty neat.  Nice loot, some of which is still good several years later.  Good quested armor that requires teamwork to get.  Shawl quests.  Ring quests. Some nice dungeons.  More dragons.  The Sleeper and his tomb.  Neat factions and stories to work with... dwarf vs giant vs dragon.  Raid mobs tend to AE, so you need good resists.  Really cool zones.  I'd like to see more racial faction modifiers.  Oh well.<br />
<br />
Luclin.  Graphically amazing, set a new standard.  Mobs cast unresistable AE's, and there come to be certain &quot;tricks&quot; that you need to beat the higher-end encounters.  Takes a well-disciplined force to win, not just a massed zerg charge.  VT keys are a royal PITA.  VT itself has amazing loot, but the zone is pretty uninspired.  Hollowshade is nice, now that it works.  The story of the moon is crazy complicated, most people gave up trying to understand it after the first couple of weeks and just focused on killing the stuff that drove the story.  Beastlords are still considered a bit overpowered, but are cool enough I don't really care (I'm a bard).  Furry boobies.  Cats eat too much, but are kinda nifty.  Horses would be cool, but the whole invisible horse exploit is just stupid.  The bazaar is a game unto itself.<br />
<br />
PoP.  Books make travel too easy.  PoK is kinda neat.  Planar progression is a hassle, but reinforces the pecking order.  Lots of good raiding content, yay.  Nice xp zones, good quests, you get to kill gods.  Neat new armor, you get 5 more levels.<br />
<br />
LoY.  Neat pirate ship zone.  Revemped dungeons are kinda nice.  Armor dyes are good, except for the occasional **** hippy who thinks tie-dyed plate mail is cool.  Yay, more bank space.  Frogs are weird, but I guess I can stomach them.<br />
<br />
LDoN:  Forced people to learn to work and fight indoor crawls, which most people had just avoided till then.  That's good.  Emphasizes movement vs camping.  That's good.  Raids are a big feature that most will never see, since you have to be an elemental-calibre guild to have a shot at winning.  Farstone transport I like more than the books, for some reason.<br />
<br />
GoD:  Seems kinda ho-hum.  No big new features.  No new class or species.  Focussed heavily on the top-tier, largely ignores others.  boat city is pretty.  You can make money fishing, just watch out for trades.  More progression, this time it takes a group.  <br />
<br />
My order of merit:<br />
1.  Kunark.  It made every part of EQ better.  Set the standard.<br />
2.  PoP.  People still define their guilds as elemental or time flagged.  The game revolves around PoK and the bazaar.<br />
3.  Luclin.  For its time, a hugely ambitious expansion, pushed the game in new ways.  Huge technical issues upon release marred it a bit, but it's still a bloody fantastic expansion.<br />
4.  LDoN.  Not so ambitious, but the new reinforcement of grouping, and the scaled content, made for a good way to train people to work together to accomplish goals nicely.  <br />
5.  Velious.  Essentially, it was mudflation++ when it came out.  Some neat ideas and pretty zones, but other than a few quests, it's just not as useful anymore.  It's due for some revamping.<br />
6.  LoY.  This was an expansion?  Mostly a set of features they were planning on introducing anyway, but they bundled them up with a few new zones and slapped a 20-buck price tag on it.  Nice dungeons, but overall, I'm not impressed, playable frogs nonwithstanding.<br />
7.  GoD.  Jury's still out on this one, but it just seems like there's nothing all that new in it.  Mudflation+++++++, a pretty boat city, a few new zones.</div></div><hr />

How can you not love LoY?  I think that's actually why a lot of people don't like LoY - it was an expansion mostly of gimmicks &amp; features, with very little content and loot.  Its a unique expansion in that regard, and change from tradition inevitably generates hostility.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And that common misperception is very wrong.  LOY zones are some of the best coin making zones out there.  Anyone who bothers to go there knows this. Lots of scripted events too deeper in. <br />
<br />
But its out of the way and off the beaten path. Mobs hit hard for their level and you can get killed by greenies very easy if your not paying attention.<br />
<br />
And it was not an expansion SOE on many occasions told so. It was an extension. That is another common misconception. For the money I spent on it what I got was worth every penny.  <br />

But its out of the way and off the beaten path. Mobs hit hard for their level and you can get killed by greenies very easy if your not paying attention. The LoY content I've seen has been interesting, but the mobs are hard - to me its felt like they have very high hp &amp; regen, rather than high damage, but either way, much more difficult than similar level mobs elsewhere.<br />
<br />
I primarily don't like it because its very difficult to move around the expansion: Its entirely enclosed spaces with rather dense mob populations (aggressive as greenies, too), making traditional run-through tactics difficult to impossible (running inbetween mob areas, running on zone/cave walls, pacifying a corridor through, etc).  I've heard you can invis through a lot of it, but I'm not fond of burning tons of invis potions just to move an inch.  I gave up on LoY when it could take me well over a half hour just to get to Dulak from the lighthouse, nearly dieing a few times to all the greenies in Gunthak inbetween.  Thus I haven't seen anything beyond Dulak simply because I can't get there, heh (even with groups, we've always run into some issue working through Dulak)</div></div><hr />

Simply put, the holy trinity is warrior, cleric, enchanter.  The Trials in Gates *require* that your group be built around these characters.  Why? Because with 10k tanks, druid heals don't cut it, and no one can mez like an enchanter and SKs and paladins don't have the mitigation to tank the stuff (which isn't completely true, some few of the best geared SKs and Paladins *can* tank the trials - Brael and Askeer for the SKs I know have).<br />
  <br />
<br />
Heh.  Brael regularly complains in our secret TM channel that a ssra geared warrior can outtank him in GoD.</div></div><hr />

Okay my 2 1/2 cents on GoD.  Number 1 there is no way ANYONE can stand up to a blue mob solo and survive unless they have over 150 AA and are wearing elemental armors and using elemental weapons.<br />
<br />
So enough of the fairy tales there:)  I should know I have 178 AA and SoD and BoC and full Kizrak Battle Armor as a warrior and fully buffed around 8500 - 9k hp not to mention having 5 major tribute skills going full speed all of the time.<br />
<br />
I stepped into what you would call a Class 2 zone which is just one step above hunting in Nitimbi and with a somewhat strong group got my butt handed back to me within (timed of course) 6 secs flat.<br />
<br />
Am I a better than average tank?  Oh yes since 5 years ago.  How long did rest of group last ya ask?  Try about 3 secs more than I did.<br />
<br />
GoD was meant mainly as a continuation for Upper Tier Guilds who have conquered PoTime and such.  Ask those guilds if those zones are a challenge to them.  LOL They are getting wiped back and forth all the time in GoD.  So now imagine how long the average person will survive in those zones? ROFLMAO not that long.<br />
<br />
Now I hear about quests.  Woot about quests the abysmal armors quests for all the classes are meant to complete by the raids who can go into the deeper end zones of which the average person cannot.<br />
<br />
Now on tradeskilling?  Ya can't count the  new UI as it was never part of the new expansion but as an addition outside of it.<br />
<br />
Tradeskills as a GM in all 7 Tradeskills I am not impressed at all.   To have to learn trivial combines once again in all 7 skills bites.  Sure its only for 400 combines in each tradeskill but it still makes no sense.<br />
<br />
From what I am seen coming out of GoD so far for tradeskills the results are sad at this moment.  I hope they get better.<br />
<br />
Sorry if I was blunt but I call them as I see them.<br />
<br />
That was my 2 1/2 cents about GoD and I have seen every expansion since day 1 and this has to be the worst one of them all unless there is a fairy godmother who will pop out any minute and grant us 3 wishes?  There is no rhyme or reason for this expansion that I can see except as I stated above to keep the uber guilds happy of which I would say that did happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You need the AAs, aye, though probably not quite that many.  Just the important ones for your class.  For clerics, for example, DvA, healing gift, and healing adept are all good to have.  You do need to have worked on your gear.  You do not need elemental armor.  BoT, Tactics, and LDoN will provide you with all you need.  Just may take a while to get it.  <br />
<br />
The sewers and the zone you enter them from are about the same difficulty as LDoN hard.  Some mobs hit a little bit harder, but pulling is easier.  Main sucky thing is the time they take if your group lacks DPS.  After that, it's a step up, but with a good puller and use disciplines, you can do the next two.<br />
<br />
I'm loving the fact that the zones are a challenge.  It is nice to see a bit of single group progression, where you actually have to gear and AA up a bit, not swing by the bazaar.  However, this does mean it is not as friendly to the casual gamer as PoP and that many people will take the easy road instead of accepting the challenge.<br />
<br />
Still, if you like a good single group challenge, this is the best expansion since RoK.</div></div><hr />

However, I'm a person who didn't like to see all the pok books, convenient, but it all makes travelling too easy, i'ts part of the game people shoud enjoy a bit more. <br />
LOL<br />
Yeah, running for 15 minutes across Karana sure is my idea of enjoyment!  If you would like to &quot;enjoy&quot; travel, go and play E&amp;B, there you can have &quot;fun&quot; traveling from one place to another, unfortunately the &quot;fun&quot; is already over after like 45 minutes when you reach your destination.<br />
<br />
GoD is a good expansion, only bad thing about it is that it effectivly killed the Pottery Focus item market.<br />
<br />
Edit: About the travel thing.  What irks me the most is when people say &quot;it's part of the game people should enjoy a bit more&quot;. Who the heck are you to tell others what they should enjoy and what they shouldn't.  Just because you would rather spend an hour of real time to get from A to B doesn't mean that everyone else *should* be the same way.  Don't like the PoK books?  Don't use them, you still have the option to spend the majority of your time traveling, tyvm.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I dunno, I like Abysmal Sea. It's a nice zone. Of course if the magus could send you there and take you back it would be of more use. Personally I just bound my druid there so she could pick up any supplies I might need without having to play Kunark2 on other chars.<br />
<br />
The tradeskilled items, meh, so far they're ok I guess. The teas for brewing are nice enough but with the drop rate and considering the prices they currently go for... well if you're a mid level looking for ok stats drinks I recommend you rather buy my cheaper and better stat GLMs or QATs. Baking got a cheap skillup path and some of the food isn't too bad. As for the rest, dunno about them, most of my friends that I group with haven't bought GoD because they thought it was too bleh.<br />
<br />
The actual fight content is probably very nice for the people it was designed for, I really wouldn't know though. I know I see some raiding friends go there but I've yet to be asked to join a normal XP group in GoD. I guess this part of the expansion is of least use to me. Not to say it's without merit, there's some nice items in there that make my raiding friends drool.<br />
<br />
Tribute, I'm not interested in using. It's another plat sink and as a trader still working on my own skills and having buyable upgrades to get I have enough plat sinks to take care of atm, non-expendable ones that are more urgent.<br />
<br />
AA, leadership AA, those seem pretty decent for the most part - later on. There's a couple of skills I'll try to get early on, like RC for paladins but for the most part the GoD AA are of the 'pick it up later when I have the essentials done' variety.<br />
<br />
But truth is that aside from AS there hasn't been much of great use to me in GoD, I mean there's nice things but nothing that makes me go &quot;Ohh, that's pretty neat and I could do that! I should get this expansion so I can go do that with my friends&quot;. I'm not the target audience though, so I'm not surprised. What did surprise me was how lackluster a lot of the tradeskilled items are vs the challenge in getting them. To take an example I could forage lemming furs for my alt's bags starting at 20th on said alt while getting xp and it wasn't too difficult, and to that alt the bags were rather nice even with the price required. The GoD bags don't seem all that much better for the difficulty involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Saleani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Am I disappointed in the reduction in resale for the fish? Sure. Did I think it was going to last? Nope. I have a little char on another server all by itself. Can't twink it. But I could fish while browsing the web or doing housework. So I managed to tag about 2kpp in fish. And with that, managed to buy some reasonable gear in the bazaar. So now, when I want to play, but don't want to deal with buttheads and politics, I play that little twinkie. The fishing was reasonable while it lasted, but now it is gone, so please mellow out.  Abysmal sea is a great spot for tradeskilling, and if you do the GoD flagging, you will be back there more than once.<br />
<br />
My hotkey:<br />
line 1... /autoinventory<br />
line 2... /doability 2<br />
<br />
(ability 2 is fishing for that char). so. while you are reading on the other computer, you reach over and smack that key (errr, all of them were hotkeyed, cus i missed a lot).<br />
<br />
The macroing that makes the folks at sony over react is stuff that can lead to 1000s of pp per hour (and some up to 50kpp per hour). Some of the hacks they do, let them warp around the zone (and sometimes from zone to zone). It was rather wierd to watch a level 1 warrior porting from qeynos to surefall glades and back. Or watching that same warrior warp from forge to vendor and back.<br />
<br />
If the mobs in GoD are too tough, don't go there. If the risk vs reward is too low for you, don't go there. Do I play my level 64 pally in GoD? nope. I consider the new uber loot that everyone is oohing about to be unachievable fantasies. I have most of the defensive AAs that a paladin can achieve, and when you hear about time geared paladins with 2200 ac and 11k hp lasting about 45 seconds on some of these mobs, and elemental geared paladins lasting 6 seconds, I know something is wrong. Tuning encounters to require the defensive discipline means something is wrong. Or that 6 man groups requiring 2 clerics just to last more than 90 seconds in a zone.<br />
<br />
When PoP came out, the complaints were that it catered to the raiding guilds. But as time progressed, most of that expansion became doable for the majority of players. I predict all the doomsayers will start eating their words about the time the expansion is released. We have a couple months before we will be learning the recipes for beer battered crow souffles.</div></div><hr />

-Fin Urgh... you're right.  I hadn't played with the Tribute system before now.  It's great for tailoring which focus effects you want on your character in a particular situation.<br />

My druid is quadding raptors now for experience.  She is adding mana preservation III, extended range III, and mana regeneration IV (flowing thought) before visiting the raptor islands to speed things up.</div></div><hr />

After that unbelievable nerf of the tribute system and my recent frustration with GoD baking recipies I find nothing of value in it.

It was a mistake to buy it. If I could, I would have returned it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But that's just the problem. If you're a person who isn't level 65 in VT or better gear, you want your money's worth from the new expansion just like everybody else. Not going isn't a good option anymore when the world is as open as PoP made it, people want to experience the content.<br />
<br />
With me it's a love hate relationship with GoD... I love the drawn out quests and the unique mob abilities but I hate the excessive challenge. It's only excessive because I'm used to not playing a full group but just duoing with a 65 ranger, and it's frustrating that the little bit of work I can do in the new expansion is going to be forever hampered by the number of friends I can get to come along with me on any given evening.<br />
<br />
GoD is a step in the right direction but it's far from a perfect expansion... I'm still of two minds about the whole thing.</div></div><hr />

So for me it's really wasn't worth the 29.99 price tag to put all the tradeskill items in one place.<br />
<br />
Velius is still my favourite, cos it's the most believable and interactive, and pretty much my home from 32 to 60 as a druid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>casala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">GoD is a fine expansion.  It is a challenge, and one I enjoy immensely.  As a mage, I do find the need for the holy trinity annoying, but at least the lesser trials + the named in the open zones are at doable by a non-holy trinity group.  Make no mistake about it, however, anyone (including SOE) that tells GoD has content for 55+ players is bascially stretching the truth a bit.  Sure, a group of 55s could exp in Natimbi or maybe Riwwi, but start playing in Ferubi / Barindu and watch them get decimated.  Bottom line, GoD is a PoTime+ raiders expansion.<br />
<br />
Overall, however, I do like the content.  I like the long CR runs, I view it as pennance for doing something stupid.  Along those same lines, the higher calibre of people needed to succeed means you rarely have to deal with the &quot;bad players&quot;.</div></div><hr />
