If not, I am surprised to see such little discussion after a new expansion was just released.  Are there just not that many new tailoring recipes again?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bocote</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've got some gripes with the new tailoring items.   Since the expansion came out I've collected enough stuff from hunting, bazaar, and even normal NPC vendor buy back to make 2 whips and almost enough for a bag attempt.<br />
<br />
I did the silly smithing and tailoring work and created a 9/29 whip and another lesser whip.   I don't know a single person at any level that would even consider wanting one of these.  The components drop off of level 60 mobs that hit in the 500s and combines yield essentially crap.<br />
<br />
I've not seen shimmering ore or aged scales yet, but by the looks of things they'll be mediocre at best... hope I'm wrong.<br />
<br />
another thing is I'm running out of space.   there is just too much random no drop stuff all over the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Petercorbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm disappointed too.. its no easy thing to get 5 hynid bloods, a HQ pelt and 5 tea leaf oils just to make a bag thats not even as good as an Evil Eye bag or what not.<br />
<br />
And the 1st tier whips with the regular scales are all really dumb, some of which I paid 5k to make buying the supplies in the bazaar.  At least the smithing stuff so far has 8 int/wis/str etc and is somewhat useable by some classes (well until they put level req.s on it) <br />
<br />
The 2 slots are cool, but whos going to spend points on an aug to put into a 9/28 weapon when theres tons of better weapons you can get for almost nothing.<br />
<br />
Maybe once we figure out where to get the aged scales we'll see something better /shrug oh well its better than no receipes I guess.  But when you manage to get more drops than tailoring supplies and some of them like the FT1 neck are so much better than anything we can make with the stuff.. /shrug  We'd be better off making a couple thousand pp an hour fishing like everyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Murias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I attempted one of those bags and failed, and haven't seen a post with the stats. If you actually made one, could you post the stats? Thanks!<br />
<br />
EDIT: Sorry, I just saw the stats for the steel reinforced hynid backpack. The one I attempted was the bolstered hynid backpack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dyllwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">PeterCorbin posted the results from his attempt at the Steel-Reinforced Hynid-Hide Backpack in the database update submission thread:<br />

All I can say is I sure hope the Bolstered Bag is alot better, the Steel Reinforced is definitely not worth the time and resources to make. I have to say, with all the new bag recipes, I was hoping that they had come up with some way to make bags more interesting then to just play with the size/wr numbers. Maybe a Lore bag with an Aug slot, or some trade containers aimed at doing all combines for a given tradeskill.</div></div><hr />

Is GoD tailoring basically only bags, whips, and bolas? Has anyone come across anything wearable (robes, tunics, etc. etc.).<br />

Not sure what you mean by slots p.  Would you mind clarifying please?<br />

Oh, and so far, it appears that this is going to turn into a rant thread since it appears Sony did nothing fantastic for the tailors; but we'll see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Eidolon Faer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Take a look at Bolas.<br />
<br />
Unless I'm missing something in the recipe, they're damage 36 thrown weapons that can be made with MQ Cat and Wolf Pelts.<br />
<br />
Unless the Stone/Steel Bola Weights are spendy I can see Rogues lusting after these in ways too unseemly to mention.  Crikey, lord knows I've had enough Barbarian Rogues pester me to save every single Throwing Boulder from Fire Giant raids back in the day.<br />
<br />
Once the stats on concussive and explosive bolas are known, these might also become popular.  I just wish the stupid things actually had a snare effect, since that is what bolas were SUPPOSED to do.<br />
<br />
Besides, when they put the recommended level on the smithed weapons, they will become just as irrelevant as the tailored whips.  And thank the Gods you're not into Tinkering.  Whoopee, make your own MANA BATTERIES.  :confused:</div></div><hr />

Here's what I mean. Velious and Luclin tailoring included recipes for twelve different slots of armor, silk and leather (I meant twelve, not thirteen, but I usually think of a full set as having two wrists and was a bit tired when I posted this). Here are the twelve slots of Velious and Luclin tailoring: chest, legs, boots, gloves, cloak, arms, shoulders, waist, head, neck, wrist, mask. Then PoP came out and they reduced this number to seven slots (chest, legs, boots, gloves, arms, head, wrist - Tae Ew tailoring in the new Cazic-Thule also followed this pattern, the &quot;visible&quot; slots only). Then LoY came out and the number of slots you could make was further reduced to one - cultural robes only (silk chest, no leather anymore). Then LDoN took us down to zero slots of new tailored armor. <br />
<br />
What I'm trying to figure out is, are we still at zero slots with GoD? No wearable silk or leather armor at all?<br />
<br />
I wanted to ask that question about GoD tailoring and note this trend, which I personally see as unfortunate. I enjoyed tailoring all sorts of armor, but it looks like Luclin was the last expansion we're going to get where you could make a full set of anything, and PoP was the last expansion where you could make a partial set with anything more than just a silk chest item. Three expansions in a row without new armor to tailor (other than LoY cultural robes, six cultural recipes there if you want to count that).<br />
<br />
Or am I wrong? Is there any new armor to tailor in GoD out there, that anyone is aware of? I mean, I wouldn't mind making bags, whips, and bolas, if any of them turn out to be worthwhile (and that looks like a big if at this point), but that's not the meat of tailoring, to mix tradeskill metaphors. I think I may be the only person crazy enough on Vazaelle (or most servers) to bother making a tae ew whip, for instance. But is this all we got? Can anyone confirm or deny?<br />

<br />
Thought for the day: The Etched Scale Bull Whip (Trivial 172) is pretty much on a par (ratio wise, and it's only slightly better stat wise) to a Fell Blade Cutlass (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=18882)...the Erudite SK quested newbie sword.<br />
<br />
And it's not even like they're a viable skillup route or anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Heartsong_Steelsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I certainly hope this doesn't turn into a rant thread, because I'd rather not move it to PSR. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Combination containers would rock. Especially in trades that use a lot of cross containers. Baking the spit and mixing bowl, the various sewing kits and the jeweler's kits, and so on.<br />
<br />
Or even items that are just 100% copies of exisiting containers that people like except for the icon or color. I would love having different visual clues as to what bag I have. A different icon for a new type of 10 slot giant holding bag would make it easier for me to mentally designate it as &quot;baking implement bag&quot; or &quot;Shadow scream bag&quot;. Even a color change, a black bag instead of brown. Or white bag. Anything that looks more unique, even if it doesn't have the greatest stats.<br />
<br />
Or how about an ammo container for throwing? Like a quiver, but for thrown items.<br />
<br />
Or craftable coin purses like the ones that drop and reduce the weight of platinum a person carries. I know of a few monks who'd love that<br />
<br />
Or silks for the mid level range. Iceburrowers can hardly be called mid level. I'm thinking sort of cultural robes, but each culture getting maybe one or two other slots than robe where they can make an item. Then the other cultures having the other pieces. Like say 3 tiers of them in terms of quality and difficulty to get, on dark elf first tier item is a bracer, second tier is cap, third tier is legs. But end products usable by all like the robes were.<br />
<br />
I don't know if any of this makes sense, but maybe it would help in keeping this thread here and not PSR. There's just so many ideas you could use for tailoring, so much to do with the skill it's amazing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>MoelleKajaky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">OK, let's try and turn this into a happy thread. Can someone tell me something cool in GoD tailoring, of any type at all? Something I might want to make?<br />
<br />
Trying to keep an open mind here...but really the gripes I've seen so far have seemed pretty valid. Let's see some valid antigripes! Let's see someone gushing over some cool tailored item from GoD!<br />
<br />
Can anyone gush about anything they've seen tailored in GoD? Or have the gushworthy items not been found yet?<br />
<br />
The new tradeskill interface is pretty nifty so far, although for some reason it doesn't find tailored PoP recipes even after I add them to it by making them for the first time after it was released. Other than that it seems to work fine for PoP JC, smithing, and brewing. Odd that it doesn't seem to work for PoP tailoring, pardon me if someone's mentioned this already... =P Nothing pops up, earthweave, firehide, firestrand, nada.<br />

Oh well, maybe one of the upper GoD tiers will have some cool stuff, in the same way as you had to wait for elemental planes for the good stuff in PoP (although PoN robes were popular for a bit).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>gnormy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think you need to approach Gates tradeskills with a different mindset.  In previous expansions - tradeskills were something where you went and farmed parts and made tons of items.  Drops being pretty common overall with few roadblocks.  Gates is anti-farming.  Parts will come - but very slowly.  If you are expecting to be able to farm parts - its just not possible.  Even on guild raids killing at will - there will only be a handful of drops.  This means the items that are made from Gates will retain value longer (assuming they had any to begin with).  It also means that rather than saying - today I&quot;m going to go make x number of things to sell, you'll find yourself saying, I spent a day killing in Gates - what can I make with what I have.<br />
Yes - its different - isnt that what an expansion is about?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It also means that, like other rare drops, the price of the components for those unable to farm them will in most cases be higher then the price of the finished product.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I think not.  Prices for components won't tend to exceed the finished good unless the combine is a good skill up path.  Good skil up paths require large volume.<br />
<br />
if the items actually have bazaar demand and if they are rare drops, people will skil up and THEN attempt them once they have a good chance of success.  And then they do this for profit or to get the item themselves, and only the rare folks, who really want to use somthign THEY made, will then pay a premium for raw goods (and a chance to fail) over finished goods.<br />
<br />
Not having yet ventured into GoD's new zones, I don't know, but IF these are too rare to use for skilling up and IF people want them to use, THEN they should behave more like real world inputs, pricing at around the expected value of the combined product, after accounting for scarcity of other resources, like sufficient skill level, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>BuilderOfCastles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Most of the time, people price the TS components at about 100% of the price you would hope to sell one at.  Not accounting for any failures.<br />
<br />
Most of the sellers I have talked to said that this is the price that their friend told them it went for.  (and sometimes, if it doesn't sell in a few more days, (at the high price) I am going to give it away.)<br />
<br />
People see Tradeskill and immeadiatly mark the price high, which gets other people to mark the price high. I have seen this much much too often. (Especially in runes and pages, even though most are of no value)<br />
<br />
Unless some GoD combine produces a good item, the tradeskill items will be vendored, and none will go to the bazaar.<br />
Else the tradeskill items will be set for sale at a rate that most will not be able to make a profit off of.</div></div><hr />
