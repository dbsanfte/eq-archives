I've spent Friday night, all day Saturday and again all day Sunday in Runneye, and cannot find a single femur!  I checked on Alla, and the two goblins they said to look for (bonemender and captain) never once showed up on track.<br />
<br />
I know at one point the quest was broken, but I was under the impression that it had been fixed (I believe they had the wrong femur.)<br />
<br />
I wonder if I should try to get the one in Paineel...</div></div><hr />

Just kill some of the other caster type gobs and yourll get one eventually.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Didn't get play time last night, but right before bed I decided to check track for my friend the bonemender.  Wouldn't you know, there he was.  Trotted down the stairs to the EE prisoners, and guess who was guarding them :)  <br />
<br />
Finally have my book!  The sad part is I may need another one to bring up my smithing as well.  Problems for another day...<br />
<br />
(Now to get tailoring over 200, so I can finish combining the beer-battered cragbeast steaks I started.  Had to stop when baking hit 200 -- no NTCM aa's in my immediate future.)</div></div><hr />
