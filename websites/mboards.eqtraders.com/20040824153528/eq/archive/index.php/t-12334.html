<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LordRahl86</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">MAN I don't know what VI was thinking (I love jewel craft, don't flame, please! [puts on sv fire gear]), but I just recently reached level 12 with my chanter, an alt to my cler, untwinked, and I started on jewel craft. VI gave the enchant silver spell to us chanters at 8, and me, being myself, decided that they were probably right and tried it... starting at 12, because I spent all my level 8 money on spells, heh.<br />
<br />
So, I let my chanter borrow 40 plat off my cler (with a 6 plat a month back pay plan, as I only play my chanter one week a month, for 10 months, hence when I pay the first bit back, it'll be 36 I owe, etc).<br />
<br />
I went to the jewelers in PoK, since that was even easier than Kele, where I went a couple times to put together a cat eye necklace for me to wear, and I of course trained 21 points into JC.<br />
<br />
Using ALL forty platinum I bought silver bars and gems, 10 at a time, selling back the ones I didn't use once I triv'd a combo. I got through Jasper no problem, and since I was getting good skill ups, I only bought 5 carniliens (I don't memorize how to spell them!), thinking I'd triv those out before I used them all.<br />
<br />
I made a dozen, and attempted more with ONE skill up. I skilled myself flat broke. Luckily, silver items (cats eye, bloodstone, jasper, and silver rose engagement) have a good market in Gfay on my server, and I was able to earn back quite a bit. I advertise the price, but after I had sold a little more than half of my wares and earned a dozen pp, a guy sent me a tell asking if I had a pair of bloodstones. I had had two, but one was bought, so I told him I had to make a pair real quick. Well, a bit after I got to the kele bank, he came there... Not only did he pay in full, he quadrupled the price (even though he asked for a breeze and I told him I couldn't give him one, as it's a level 16 spell)!<br />
<br />
After that, I got no tells, and no one came to the bank, so I left and sold the rest to merchants. I ended up about 4 or 5 plat ahead of where I started, which, to me, is pretty cool. I was able to buy all the rest of the spells I needed, as well as get to skill 35 (UBAH! :D) in JC. Oh, except that I forgot to get Bind Affinity... But I can get that later.<br />
<br />
I think I'll wait a while to work on JC. At least till after QH isn't the best pp/hour for me anymore. Maybe level 27 or 28 when I'll be fully ahead on my spells (hopefully). I'll also not be buying Enchant Electrum or Enchant Gold till then, whenever that is. I'm glad I got started early, though. I know more about it now. I just gotta say that from the start, it's a lot more expensive than most tradeskills, though that may be because most of my other chars started in their mid 20's, hunting in HSM for runes and other common items that sell for much more than their rarity would imply.<br />
<br />
I've found shift and ctrl help quite a bit when buying, moving to your JC backpack, and making them. As a matter of fact, when making jewelry, I press combine with my finger on ctrl, for no other reason than just some good luck and what not. Also, I always thank the RNG, as I do my oven/stove/microwave when I successfully make something without blowing up my kitchen (rl, in case you were wondering), and... other facilities in my house, when they work properly. Remember, positive reinforcement beats out cursing any day.<br />
<br />
There are nice people, even people who will offer to upgrade your newbie armor/cloth shirt to high ac/stat robes. You don't always have to take them up on the offer, and every time you do, remember there's someone more needy than you who may need that piece, and they may be next in line if you refuse. Always say thanks, and never be rude.<br />
<br />
And remember that you may be level 65 with 250 in all skills and complete uber armor, but...<br />

When I started jewelcrafting when I hit L8, (pre-luclin) the Int2 rings and WIS2 rings, etc. sold pretty good in lowbie areas.<br />
<br />
So I would sell them in QH, everfrost, EC once I was old enough to get there.<br />
<br />
I pretty much only did combines that I could sell to people  (so skill ups was slow).<br />
<br />
For the most part it worked out pretty good.  By the time I hit 16, I was at the skill to start working with Malachites, same with Gold at 24.<br />
<br />
When I was able to get to Freeport easily on my own (at this time we had Luclin, but bazaar wasn't working yet, so I did most of my jewleing in NFP) my skill ups was increasing in speed and I actually got to the point of using Velium before I could zap it myself, so I had to have others zap it for me .. that sucked.<br />
<br />
If I were to start today, I doubt that I'd be into tradeskills at all since I didn't get a good start at them early, and making good money along the way, not just only &gt;250 combines.</div></div><hr />
