<br />
I am in need of a GM smith On The Rathe Server. The only thing that the GM smith will be needed to do is hit the combine button on a couple of fierce heraldic items, and can be done just about anytime i'm available. PST in game or reply to my message, or even send me an email at crazycujo121@hotmail.com <br />

Thanks, <br />

In my experience this type of reasoning suggests the person doesn't want to pay the smith much lol.<br />
&quot;The only thing...&quot; the smith has to do is level to 250 smithing, THEN &quot;just&quot; hit combine.<br />
Since its virtually impossible to level to 250 smithing this is not so easy to do!!<br />
Most experienced smiths recognize this reasoning, so if what you really meant is that you've collected all the materials and made all the celestial tempers and the medium quality chain jointings and the velium rings etc etc, and that you are paying a fair fee for the combine, you might want to phrase  it that way and you'll get better responses.<br />
If indeed there is a human GM smith on the Rathe...</div></div><hr />

<br />
We actually have three or four 250 human smiths on the server.  Milambus, Abazagaroth.. and one other.  I dunno if they'll do combines for free though.  Sorry I can't help, but I'm a barb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abazagaroth</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">He contacted me in game, I told him the same thing I tell everyone else, to go to my guild message board, to a sticky post with everything spelled out on my policies, recipes, components, component drop location, trivials, prices, etc, even gave the URL. He replied with &quot;My internet is hosed, can you just tell me plz?&quot;<br />
<br />
Not sure how internet access is &quot;hosed&quot; as you are in the middle of playing an online game (or how he managed to come here and post a few hours later), and a simple lie like that was enough to irritate me, he could have at least have been honest and say he didn't want to log off and check. So I told him and I guess my &quot;prices&quot; were too steep. I don't charge plat for combines, but I do tell people to bring 3 sets of components per piece and if any are left over I keep them. I think to this day I've had left over components like 2-3 times. But I guess being able to get something for 1/3 market price was too steep, since he then starting asking in /trade for a smith.<br />
<br />
I generally don't require people I know (or at least people I know *of* enough that I at least know they will use the item themself) to bring 3 sets, especially since PoK portals, but anyone I have no clue who they are I hold firm to that. I don't think that's too unfair considering what other smiths on other servers charge for combines.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would just like to vouch for my actions.  The first thing is about the person who posted the information about 3 or 4 human smiths.  Thank you for the information and thank you for being so considerate and non-nagging about my post.  This next part concerns abazargroth and his post.  I DID send him a tell and I DID ask him what his policy on combines was, he then told me to check the URL that he provided when I then simply replied &quot;My internet is broken atm.&quot;  I meant that my Internet Explorer was having problems, and i hadnt had time to download a new version.  He then got all irrated at telling me his policy , and i had no intentions of being mean or inconsiderate but ive gotten that same setup from other people with three sets of components and i just cant afford that at this point in the game and was looking for another option.  And for the record, im not looking for a free combine.  I was planning to pay 1000pp for a successful combine, but only have 1 set of materials at this point in time.  Well thanks for hearing me out, and if youd like to send me a tell ingame, please feel free to do so.<br />

Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tildareon</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 04:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have been looking into smithing as my fourth mastery, wishing I would have abused ornate when it was still viable to skill up. Tailoring start to finish cost me no less then 510k and a solid month of gaming. Smithing for all intents looks worse, perhaps that's because im on the other side of GM'ing one of the hardest skills in the game. I combined 8 cobalt hide belts today and charged the person 1.5k, I don't need the item and didn't want the hassle of reselling. I succeded on 5 of them. That seems fair as he will make about 7k profit from those belts. Now to me fierce heraldic &lt;items&gt; is on par with me doing a combine for plains tailored garments or the ever popular mastodon fur cloak in that It's damn expensive, It's not trivial and I would be insulted by someone trying to play me for a stooge. The way aba goes about charging for combines seem's just and fair paying him 1k for going blind in front of a computer does not.<br />

<br />
AbaAbazagarothntioned he doesn't stick to the 3 sets of comcomponents he knows the people and or knows that they will use it.  How does he know that?<br />
<br />
By the way, I have contacted Abazagaroth in the past about Heraldic armor.  I was asking about it on my high elf cleric or my dwarf pally in regaurdsregardsister's human pally.  One of us might have been having an off day on our communication skills because I didn't understand some of what he said.<br />
I wanted to know if he did combines for others for 'donations' (I think that was the word I used) and if he did what did he conciter consideree.  He told me he did not he olnly solonlyished products, if he did combinds combinesrs he required 3 sets of componcomponentse kept the extra.<br />
The phraseingphrasing off a bit, plus it sounded like he wanted fee AND the leftovers.  I have lost the website that he gave me to look up his terms.<br />
She has 2 characters that she wants to outfit with the Heraldic, he may not have understood that or I maynot havmay notioned it.<br />
The dieity thatdeityfor, if my information is correct, is rare on this server but she can use her cleric to imbue the stones so that isn't a worry (cleric and pally follow Erolis Marr, StarRose Qustar rosehink).  So we can bring the imbued stones, the enchanted metal, and I think we can come up with the temper material, if not we'd be willing to pay him for the temper in addition to his or her fee.<br />
<br />
I guess part of the problem I have with bringing 3 sets of componets  componentseping the rkeeping that I need as much as possabe madepossiblehat I can bring.  Plus if he fails 2 times and makes 1 componet, whcomponentss fee then??  He gets stiffed since he was counting on them for his fee, or was it that he meant he wanted 3 sets of componets icomponentsn to what he used to make the piece??  (This was some of the problems I was having with understanding him.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Abazagaroth, if you would post your website here so that I may goto it now I would appreciate it.  If you would like to discuss this further in game or in some other form (Only IM I use is EQIM.) let me know please.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time Ladies and Gentlemen;<br />
bdraft<br />
<br />
P.S.  I DID make the offer of 'a couple of Kpp' because I did not know what was a 'reasonable fee', as mentioned previously.  I appoligise if that was an insult, it was not intended to be</div></div><hr />
