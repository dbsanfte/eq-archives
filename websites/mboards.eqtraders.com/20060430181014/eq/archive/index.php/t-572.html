Gotta wonder about the RNG sometimes...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kingbobb</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 06:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Slacker!!???  I was 178 just a few weeks ago  ;) <br />
<br />
All kidding aside, my main help in this whole 250 endeavor (Emmoney) is getting a little burnt out hunting Seafuries all the time, despite the excellent AA experience she's getting, and I'm a little tired of doing nothing but skill burns every night myself.  We may take a few days off and see aobut the rest of this game thing, but I'll keep plugging.<br />
<br />
Oh, and 2 more skillups last night, so I'm at 226.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xorshaik</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hoho! I just got my GM smithy hammer last night on the second try at 188. I'd bought the gems to cover 5 seals, then bought enough velium for 3 seal attempts (none failed) and I have a leftover seal now on trader on Druzzil Ro.<br />
<br />
Anyway, was good to get that done, since I finished fine plate its been a combination of half-assed cultural temper gathering and getting other skills up enough for tempers and the artisan's seal.<br />
<br />
My main is 59, and I just can't stand regular XP for more than a blue at a time.. The above gives me an idea that maybe I oughta work a little on AA at Seafury's, although admittedly on components for skillup of smithing the fished seaweed is what I'm short on. Mebe I should get the smith a couple levels and put points into fishing then have him sit while Xorshaik hunts</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a 5% success chance combine at best with just a geerlok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kronepsis</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lucky!<br />
<br />
It took me 5 tries at 160 Smithing with no smithing modifiers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xorshaik</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think lucky would be getting a skillup from the combine at the same time~<br />
<br />
It was a decent run that night, I had started pottery at the start of the evening as the last supportive skill I needed to get up to make the seals... The first 20 skillups went nearly 1 skillup for each combine. But I guess that's just the early skillups anyway~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lonzrick</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've looked.  I've searched.  Really I have.<br />
<br />
But I can seem to find the recipe for the Blacksmith Trophy.<br />
<br />
Can someone point me in the right location?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kingbobb</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the recipes oage, look under Cross-Skill Items.  You'll see a Tradeskill Trophy link.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe I missed somethng =/</div></div><hr />
