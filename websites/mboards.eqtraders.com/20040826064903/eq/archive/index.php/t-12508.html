<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raskii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, Rask here.<br />
<br />
The only reason I was able to get my brewing up that high in the first place was because I made an alt in Freeport who could gather all the ingredients to make Faydwers...<br />
<br />
Do I need to do something like this to make anything above Faydwer Shakers or is there something that I can make without some MAJOR faction work?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raskii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Umm... Nevermind. :o<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of post 191 Baking. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Doing griff melts myself.  I have a druid farming for me, but I would still think an iksar could get into JPF thru Blackburrow and kill griffs and buy cheese.<br />
<br />
And off JPF is Nedaria's, which also has griffs who also drop meat, and it's mid-30's level.<br />
<br />
Pies just ate up what little bank space I had. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mino Hero's Brew can be made.  Everything needed is found either in PoK except for short beer to be found either in Cabilis or in SH.<br />
<br />
I just ran around Shadeweaver's Thicket and picked up fruit for Shar Vahl Essence instead of bothering with Faydwer Shakers.  Took longer but was easier on the purse and something I could do without making a mule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Another option, which doesn't require any huge amount of factioning (although it does take a bit.. but mostly time)... Neriak.   Have someone help you do the wine quest in 3rd gate till you can do it on your own... then keep doign it till you get to the level you want.<br />
<br />
Mhb's can be made in FQ without zoning, so if you're over level 20, all you need is inner guard and merchant faction (both gained from the wine quest).  Under 20 is a bit more problematic, as there is a guard on the warrior faction standing next to the vendors you need, and he paths to the brew barrel... he shouldn't agro on anyone over level 20, less you sit.  Bonus is, the wine quest also gives outer guard faction.. so you can make it to neriak in one piece by doing this also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sorry, I got confused as to him needing help with baking or brewing.<br />
<br />
I do MHBs in Cabilis.  Granted its an annoyance to zone for water, but everything else is on the vendors right next to the barrel, and the bank is right there, too.<br />
<br />
Faydwer Shakers?  All the ingredients can be bought in Fungus Grove, and they don't mind our scales.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kahmon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My First choice was Thurgadin so that I would not need to zone. When anyone else was around, I would just go to Cablis since it's mainly a ghost town. <br />

Zoneing for Water &gt; Waiting my turn to use barrel.</div></div><hr />
