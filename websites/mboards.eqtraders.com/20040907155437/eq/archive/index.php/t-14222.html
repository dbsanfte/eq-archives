<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">already?  wow you are quick.  :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep, and I already downloaded it and started reviewing...<br />
<br />
errr...<br />
<br />
Page 5, near the bottom, it mentions a recipe between 122-132 that will make you some plat, and pay for your smithing up to that point. As you mentioned in the revision history at the top of the guide, merchants won't buy cultural needles anymore. You just missed one small reference to those needles. <br />
<br />
EDIT: Found a couple more tiny points. <br />
<br />
Page 64, you mention CVT's are purchasable for about 5PP. It's actually just below 6PP. As in 5pp 9gp 3sp 2cp. Not all that significant, and I don't know if it matters but thought I'd point it out.<br />
<br />
Page 85, It says the LDoN adventures are minimum groups of four. It's actually three. You did say three on page 57, but missed it on page 85.<br />
<br />
Hope you don't mind people finding minor things in your guide. I figure you've scanned it so many hundreds of times that you might miss some of the small stuff. I know I have that problem with reports etc. that I author.<br />
<br />
I'll keep reviewing as I can through the day. Going to be doing smithing with a couple characters soon, up to the 100+ range anyway! I love your guide! It's the most detailed and concise smithing skill route that I've ever seen or heard of. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Varyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Page 24 - Third Paragraph under the Fishing heading<br />
<br />
...as ingredients to make clockwork essence of erud essence used to make...<br />
<br />
Just wanted to mention that i have been using this guide for a very long time, back when you had that apprentice project going, lost track of where to get it with a version that had the apprentace about halfway through, when i downloaded this i had hoped to see what happened with that but i see ya took it out, =( just wondering what happened to it and why ya took it out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>etitameh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">another wonderful revision of this guide! just wanted to mention, tho, that contrary to what it says on page 19, NPC vendors no longer keep any stock that isn't visible. anything over 80 (or whatever the visible number of slots is) gets poofed, never to be seen again. so vendor mining has turned into vendor scanning (which can still be very profitable!! i've found numerous great deals, like liquidised earth for 6pp!)<br />
<br />
edit: also found this paragraph: regarding making your own small bricks from small pieces, then making sheet metal:<br />
<br />
&quot;You can use this cheaper sheet metal for projects, reducing your overall costs fairly significantly if you are short of cash. You can even sell this sheet metal for a profit. If you suceed making a stack of sheet metal in this fashion with no failures, your costs will be 7p 2s and you can sell the entire stack for 9p 4g 4s each, or an entire stack for around 19p, a profit of nearly 12p per stack!&quot;<br />
<br />
i'm not sure exactly what you were going for there, but something got garbled. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>merkell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Was just wondering.<br />
When I downloaded ver 6.0 it says ver 5.1.<br />
Is that correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ZealSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">if you combined 3 pieces of ore and sold the end result of a small brick it would sell for the price of components.  this makes a small brick sell back for about 50% what a vendor charges for a small brick so profit cannot be obtained.<br />
a certain recipe with a small brick allows the end result to sell back for 90% of what the small brick is sold by vendors for.  looks ok to testers since you'd still lose money with this recipe, right? but they didn't account for the other recipe so it still ends up profitable overall. that explain it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Munnster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The zipped version currently has the version 6 guide, while the standalone version is the older 5.X version.<br />
<br />
Great Job on the guide.  It has lots of great informtion :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>tomojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually, there are 4 links that can be selected.<br />
<br />
The 2 on the left both download version 5 zip files.<br />
<br />
The top right downloads the version 6 zip file<br />
<br />
The bottom right does the pdf display in the browser.<br />
<br />
Be sure to select the correct link.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mewkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Page 79 where you give hints about making an ore fetcher. It is not necessary to level the fetcher up to level 4 or 5 so they can gate. Any death they suffer (via duel or at the hands of the merchant) will gate them (with all their stuff too). This was very handy for me when I was trying to get blocks of mithril bought in Felwithe to the FierDal forge up in Kelethin. Lowbie buys eight sacks worth of mithril, asks the vendor for a TL (by engaging auto attack), and the vendor TLs my lowbie right next to the forge. :D<br />
<br />
Page 40 where you refer to restocking the HQ ore vendor, another method available for those wizards level 60+ (or with a wiz friend level 60+) can disintegrate the ore vendor to get him to repop (instantly) fully stocked. This does not work on the ore vendor in the bazaar, but does work on the one in Kaladim. Haven't tried on any of the other ones.<br />
<br />
Page 81 regarding where Morning Dew can be foraged, it can also be foraged in Lessar Faydark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mileron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Page 26 you note file molds are available in Halas;  they are not.  See here (http://www.eqtraders.com/sources/source_zone_page.php?article=g89&amp;menustr=110000000000&amp;sz=1055) to verify.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>tomojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Pages 69-70...<br />
<br />
You don't need a friend, and the 'timed' nature of the quest has minimal impact.  This is true if you remember to do one thing; after you attempt a repair on a dented shield, whether it fails or works, pick up new repair orders before going out. This reduces the time needed to complete this quest dramatically.<br />
<br />
If the guard has re-spawned with the shield, simply give him the orders, hand in the repaired shield, and head back to repair the shield just received if its repair is still not trivial and for another repair order.<br />
<br />
If he has not re-spawned, hand back the repaired shield and head straight to a guard you still have to do work for.<br />
<br />
The only road block is when you have three repairs completed. And, that occurs if the repair fails.  In that case, you must wait until the specific guard you need respawns with his dented shield. This is true whether you are doing the quest with a friend or not, and if you both fail when working toward your 4th repair, you are actually slowing each other down.<br />
<br />
The repair requiring the highest skill can be repeated until it is trivial relatively quickly if you get lucky on the repairs so that you don't have to wait for re-spawns between attempts along with not running back for new repair orders between turn-ins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Turlo Lomon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Great job as always, Zera.  One possible option isn't listed, though.<br />
<br />
Aid Grimel Blacksmithing Section<br />
You can repeat the Acid Wash multiple times and it trivials at... 227 or 228.  Dirt cheap way to get a jump start past 222.  Yes, it is time consuming (running back and forth), but it costs about 2pp a combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Suani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Excellent!<br />
<br />
You should consider adding the Vale Sewing Kit (halfling only), trivial 162 and the Surefall Fletching Kit (Karana only), trivial 163.<br />
<br />
With those two and the Steel Arrowheads (Karana only), a halfling druid can reach 188 without a single leather padding.</div></div><hr />
