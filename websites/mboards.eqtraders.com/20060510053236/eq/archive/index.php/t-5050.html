<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bearcaller</div><div class="date">03-19-2003, 04:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I made a bunch of ribbons in order to skill up and I am loathe to vendor them for a third of the cost.  If you are making the new robes (either for skilling or selling), please let me know and I will supply them at slightly below cost (30pp for gold, 100pp for platinum).  This way we can both save a little money on the terror known as tailoring.  I have several stacks of colored gold ribbons already available but since I have trivialed gold out I won't be making anymore.  I still have a good 15 points to trivial on the platinum ribbons and have been scrounging large amounts of dye for pratically every possible ribbon.  So if you need any pre-dyed gold ribbons or specific platinum ribbons let me know...I will happily scrounge the dye material and we can both save some money.<br />

Just send a tell to Bearcaller in game, or post a message here if you can't find me...I play at almost all hours depending on the day :)</div></div><hr />

I made a ton of blue and purple ribbon in both gold and pp styles for use in Human robes. I saved them since I spent 20k on them and hope to sell some at the same price ranges.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bearcaller</div><div class="date">03-21-2003, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can't remember offhand the names of the dyes that I used.  I do know that I made a bunch of the steamfont springwater dyes and also used cursed clover, plant shoots and maybe seahorse roe but I don't remember exactly.  I have stocked up on tons of the dyes and I'm contemplating on just selling it since the dye sells for 7pp a pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Troodon</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you have any of the iksar ribbons (using berry dye and/or maneater dye)?  Would be indigo and brown ribbons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bearcaller</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">unfortunately since I made the post 2 months ago I no longer have any of the ribbons and I won't be making any more since im past the trivial....I gave up after they sat on my trader for close to 30 hours over a 3 week period (I needed the room and the cash).  I do still try to keep my trader stocked with the ribbon dyes however and sell those cheaper than anyone else I have seen (30pp).  The berry dye is fairly common...I expect i'll have a stack or 2 in the next 10 days or so...The maneater dye on the other hand is much harder to get since its from a more out of the way zone (swamp of no hope) and I don't usually go foraging for the dye components myself.  If you have any interest in the dyes themself then just let me know and I'll be sure to let you know when I have a quantity for sale.</div></div><hr />
