<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gummibear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So there I was a Happy Little Barbarian Smither. Finally reached 250 and got trophy.<br />
<br />
I was all set to make myself some helanic tundra armor, had all the components I need for 3 combines on each piece except bracers and have enough for 6.<br />
<br />
With seeing the trivial at 250 I assumed it would be no problem at all. Then I start doing the combines. Failed all but 1 pair of boots a mask, and the greaves.<br />
<br />
Low and behold the trivial has been changed to 335. How do I get to 335? And what is with these outrageous trivials now? Do I have to get GoD to get it that high? And if so I guess I will have to pass. <br />
<br />
I know the Helanic tundra isn't the best gear out there for me, but it was a personal goal of mine to create my own set. I am very disheartened over the whole thing. And I am not going to get GoD just to further sink time and Money into it.<br />
<br />
Between my 4 chars I have 4 trophie, my cleric who is but a mere level 30 is 250 in baking with trophy, and 200 in all other tradeskills. I don't play her so she won't be getting AA's anytime soon. Chanter of course has the Jewelcraft trophy, necro has brewing and Warrior has smithing.<br />
<br />
I have looked for the info on those new trivials, but can't seem to find anything. I guess I just needed to vent :boggled: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sidyenai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You cant get your skill over 250.<br />
When your skill is 250 and you have trophy, then its max you can have. <br />
The trivial for helanic tundra armor was always GREATER then 250. And that means, that before new UI no one could have say you, what the real trivial is for this armor. NOW with the new UI, you can see the real trivial. But there was no change in the trivial of the armor.  <br />
Sometimes its a pain to make tradeskills....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Before the new UI we just knew the trivial was greater than 250, hence the mathematical expression &quot;&gt;250&quot;, where &quot;&gt;&quot; means greater than.  That's all we knew, from seeing that at 250 there was no trivial message on successful combines.  <br />
<br />
Nothing about the recipe has changed.  Now we just know the exact trivial, thanks to the UI showing it to us when we succeed and learn the recipe.  <br />
<br />
At 250 skill you can expect to succeed on 1 in 3 or 1 in 2 of your attempts, although there will be good and bad streaks.  *grumbles about the forge eating five helanic helms in a row this weekend*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was just a bad run I suppose so back to stretchin my arms and having them pop back ;) <br />

Even with BD's being common as dirt as they are, this still hurts muchly muchly.<br />
<br />
--edit: On the plus side, be glad that the components for helanic tundra are so comparitively easy to get, and most significantly of all DO NOT REQUIRE AN ENCHANTER, nor any foraging. Plus, helanic and artificer recipes being nearly identical, it makes the whole process a lot easier to deal with. Be happy, you could be a high elf.</div></div><hr />
