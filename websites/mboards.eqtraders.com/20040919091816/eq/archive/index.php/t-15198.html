<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Atin Brownsuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Whats the success rates on the PoP jewelry like? I want to have an idea before I plunk down 10k for a highly polished stone to make a bloodmetal earring of engagement. I know, that is an extreme amount but that's what they are going for on my server.<br />
<br />
What about the other PoP jewelry recipes?<br />
<br />
currently 245 JC skill with geerlok and no AA in JCM.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input.</div></div><hr />

For me, after my gnome has bought some high-priced PoP jewelry component and my cursor is positioned over the combine button, I say to myself, &quot;Okay, you've got at least a 50% chance of succeeding.&quot;  Then I click the button and either cheer or curse at the RNG.<br />
<br />
And, of course, there is a FAQ on calculating chance of success in the FAQ forum.<br />
<br />
Let's look at the Bloodmetal earring, since my gnome has failed all three of his attempts to make one.<br />
<br />
The simplified formula:<br />
<br />
Percentage = (skill - (trivial*.75)) + 51.5<br />
<br />
Plug in my gnome's skill and the earring trivial:<br />
<br />
Percentage = (252 - (308*.75)) + 51.5<br />
<br />
Percentage = (252 - 231) + 51.5<br />
<br />
Percentage = 72.5%<br />
<br />
So, if I did that right, my gnome should have a 72.5% chance of succeeding.  However, the RNG has not smiled upon him yet in regard to the Bloodmetal earring. :(</div></div><hr />
