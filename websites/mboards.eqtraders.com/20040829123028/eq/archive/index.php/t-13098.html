<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As reported from the devs last fan faire:<br />
<br />
Research drops for lvl 50-60 spells are not entirely zone-specific. Parts that drop off of a mob of a given level should drop off of mobs of that same level in some other zones. They were added primarily to LoY, new, and recently revamped zones and not to all zones across the board.<br />
<br />
That would imply they are also not mob specific.  Figure out where the appropriate level mobs are in the hole, and camp that area.. and hope.  there's only 170 50+ components, eventually you'll get the one you need to drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaycie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">wow i need a runns off screaming in terror emote, as they say wow this is gonna suck =P<br />
<br />
:cry: :zombie:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">by the same token though.. mobs will have a limited selection of those 170, based on their level.. so all you have to do is figure out which levels of mobs drop what you need, and concentrate on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spikehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've got two from the dastardly rascals in PoM, I'm hunting there for the elusive yaeth 73R.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>angeliniasia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dont bother SpikeHammer - it got nerfed recently and page 78 right drops instead. (or if you DO get one, please let us know - its possibly ust become much much rarer).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Unclean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Was clearing out the dastardly rascals (little zorro dudes), 2 boxing my 65 shm / 56 necro. <br />
<br />
Last night I got a copy of 73 right (6 hours camping).<br />
<br />
Night before last I got 2 copies of 73 right (14 hours camping).<br />
<br />
Words I can remember off the top of my head:<br />
<br />
Words of Apparition<br />
Words of Sapience<br />
Words of Exhiliration<br />
Words of Voiding<br />
Words of Revenant<br />
Words of Tenancy<br />
Words of Tenure<br />
<br />
So 2 copies of RGC, 1 copy of Primal Essence, 1 copy of Cannibalize IV. Not bad for a couple farming trips!</div></div><hr />
