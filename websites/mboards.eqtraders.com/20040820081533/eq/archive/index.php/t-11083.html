I didn't keep any stats or come up with any information that would be useful to the community at all.  Just happy I'm done.  :)<br />

Time to refocus on figuring out Brodder's Revenge.</div></div><hr />

Took me quite awhile, but I didn't really do it with maxxed INT or in long runs.  250 brewing had been a long time coming for me.  Basically, instead of sitting down and doing long runs I would do only like 6 stacks of Minos in one night, then run off to hunt.  A week later I might sit down while waiting for someone to log on and do a few more stacks.  And through it all my INT never broke the 200 mark (Even with KEI and what INT specific tradeskill gear I have put together for my skillup suit, my INT maxxes at 188 right now).<br />
<br />
So, it took me several months to hit 248 on Minos.  But my INT was lacking and I never did more than 6 or 7 stacks of ingredients in a sitting...a couple times a week at most.  Sorry that I can't provide what you are looking for.  I took the scenic route on the road to GM brewing.</div></div><hr />
