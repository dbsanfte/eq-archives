<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kalavas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just spent 3 hours in PoI with a level 65 group, killed many hundreds of mobs and didn't have a single pinion or knuckle joint drop. I've /feedbacked this, has anyone else had this problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>tawnos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've noticed the same problem.  A few weeks ago, i started buying all the pinions in the bazaar.  For the past week, there has not been a single pinion for sale.  I spent a while clearing from zi to the trader gnome and a bit past.  In that time, i got ball bearings but no pinions.  Also, a guild group went to spawn the junkbeast and saved all the parts for me.  They gave me 2 stacks of ball bearings from their excursion but did not get a single pinion.  I haven't gotten any knuckle joints either, but i haven't been checking long.  Clockwork carapaces do still drop though as i got one from going to poi.  However, something has gone awry in the loot tables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kalavas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I suggest you /feedback this in game and submit a comment to developers corner, this seems like a major roadblock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>caena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Very odd; pinions used to be far more common than ball bearings, in my experience.<br />
<br />
Knuckle joints are darn rare--I'm always the ML in our guild groups and I've looted maybe 5 of them over the course of numerous forays into PoI.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cerpicio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I haven't been to PoI lately. but I always keep an eye out for knuckle jonts in the bazaar.  They have been pretty rare there since LDoN came out.  I just thought fewer people were in PoI and were in  Adventures instead.  I didn't think the loot tables had been chaged at all, but maybe that's part of the problem too.<br />

All I want is my last stinking point!  I've been at 249 too long.<br />

None in bazaar...none in PoI after 4 hours of hunting....... Has the Drop rate been NURFED??? Bugged?... I will submit a FEEDBACK next time I am online......other Tinkers please do the same if you can...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Friends did the PoI dragon a few days ago and gave me the tink supplies.   Got almost a full stack of pinions, iirc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>tawnos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Was that before or after the latest patch?  I saw plenty in the bazaar before the patch, and zero since it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">was 3 days ago.</div></div><hr />

was 3 days ago.  <br />

Is it possible he already had the pinions from a previous dragon walk? Our group probably killed more mobs that a raid does heading to Xanamech...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Whizbang_Dustyboots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It could well be that the loot table was tweaked and that higher level robots are dropping them now.<br />
<br />
Move in further and try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Arrica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've seen a few drop on entrance area mobs in the past couple days.  Not many, but not like I've ever seen many.  I tend to try and get groups in PoI a lot with my ranger, though, most groups usually are only on entrance mobs, so the experience has tailed off quite a bit (perhaps time to start going AA in PoI), but at least I'm getting tinkering drops.<br />
<br />
<br />
And what's with the Cohesion Gem that mobs in there are dropping now?  It seems to have shown up on the loot table about the same time LDoN came out, and I can't seem to find any use for it, and it's tagged as Magic, Lore, &amp; No Drop, so I'd imagine it's for a quest somewhere, but it seems to be dropping left and right (had a strecth the other night where on 5 straight kills was a Cohesion Gem, with two kills having two each :mad: ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>haim_po</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">On drinal, I havne't seen a pinion drop in a while.  Including 2-3 PoI dragon raids.  Makes it rather difficult to make anizok's devices.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>maedie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Cohesion Gem is used for mage Steel Ralican's dot bracer quest.  (level 61 &quot;Summon Steel Bracelet&quot; spell, must be quested) Apparently the spell is droppable once created? Or maybe can be multiquested. Here's a link to a thread about it.<br />

so, i guess, tell a mage friend that you have the gem.</div></div><hr />
