<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taushar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all. I have finally finished my 6th GM and ready to tackle my last one, tailoring. I usually buy thing in bazaar to do combines or do solstice robe combines but sometimes that's not possible. I would like to ask for some help in maybe farming some high end items. <br />
<br />
I have a druid level 52 and fairly well equipped. I also have a chanter or myself, a cleric, to duo if needed to. I figure I would quad for some pelts. I think this would be fun way to get him leveled and get some pelts at the same time. <br />
<br />
I know how to get Rockhopper hides but I have never really hunted in Velious for pelts and hides. I usually buy Artic Wyvern hides and do my own fishing in CS for cod oil so only thing I know is that they come from CS zone. <br />
<br />
Can someone give me some directions on farming Velious tailoring pelts/hides? What mobs drop those pelts/hides? Which zones do you hunt? Which areas of the zone is best area for quadding? What kind of drop rate do you expect? Can a level 52 druid quad safely in the area or would he need help from higher up level character? Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You ought to be fine quadding in CS. But it's a very good idea to get your CoV faction to non-KoS - that way you can single pull. (I don't think you need to go all the way to ally to achieve this, but it was a long time ago...)<br />
<br />
At 52 quadding wyverns should be very good xp for you too. You could fish while you med. And if you felt so inclined, you could kill the cobalt drakes too, for cobalt drake hides... but remember to keep out of range of their nukes... quadding is not an option for those guys. <br />
<br />
My tips:<br />
<br />
-Work on your CoV faction<br />
-Take lots of bait and a mana regen buff<br />
-Don't attack Yvolcarn (he summons, and you'll be dead in no time)<br />
-Ditto Azureake<br />
-Yvolcarn and Azureake will also attack you if they see you fighting their wyvern/drake buddies. <br />
-If you turn up and it's too busy... give up and come back another time... CS is horrible when it's over-crowded.<br />
-Yvolcarn and Azureake give CoV faction hits.... but the rest don't.<br />
-If you see a bulthar or siren running at you... get out fast. At 52 you won't stand a chance.<br />
-If anyone is quadding othmir in the wyvern area, remember they'll attack you if you're in wolf form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dawnlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wyvern hides come off Arctic Wyverns in Cobalt Scar.  They are on CoV faction (so best to be dubious or better) however you do not take any faction hits for killing them.  (Except for the named wyvern, Yvolcarn and the named drake Azureake &lt;sp?&gt;)  You can quad anywhere up from the druid port in to Skyshrine.  If you aren't KoS you can pull whatever you want with snare and nothing assists (a.k.a. you won't get adds just by running past them).  I started quadding these on my druid at 51 and went to 54 before the xp got slow.  You should be perfectly ok to do it with a 52 druid.  From what I remember the drop rates are pretty common.  If you're looking to kill drakes as well keep in mind not to try quadding them, they're casters.  Just snare/root them, run to max range to avoid their nukes, and dot them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">wyverns assist at amiable.  i discovered this and was very glad for spell haste on gate.  :)  that is a good xp spot for wizard quadding 51-54.  however it is contested quite often because of this.  it also has gem drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Silound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tigeraptors /nod. They're easy for you to kill (I can melee solo as 63 bard single) and my drop rate was 1 in 10 for a hide for velious armor. They also respawn fairly fast. However, they need drake egg oil, but as a forager that's going to be easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm in the middle of this too Tau, so here goes:<br />
<br />
(Relatively) efficient farming in Velious for tradeskill occurs in the following zones:<br />
<br />
For the skin/fur/hide:<br />
Cobalt Scar:<br />
- Wyvern - Arctic Wyvern Hide<br />
- Cobalt Drake - Cobalt Drake Hide<br />
- Othmir - Othmir Fur<br />
<br />
Wakening Lands:<br />
- Black Panther - Panther Skin<br />
- Haze Panther - Haze Panther Skin<br />
- Tigeraptor/Tigesaurous - Tigeraptor Skin<br />
- Holgresh - Holgresh Fur<br />
<br />
Western Waste:<br />
- Velium Hound - Velium Hound Fur<br />
- Ice Burrower - Ice Silk<br />
<br />
For the tanin:<br />
Cobalt Scar:<br />
- Cobalt Cod - Cod Oil<br />
<br />
Wakening Land:<br />
- Yew Leaf - Yew Leaf Tanin<br />
<br />
Skyshrine:<br />
- Drake Egg - Drake Egg Oil<br />
<br />
For the velium:<br />
Velks:<br />
- Spiders - Velium ore<br />
<br />
Here's a little summary:<br />
- Wyvern @ CS are statics but high competition from quadders and farmers, hides drop rate was nerfed so 1 round of all spawns will yield 3-4 hides<br />
- Cobalt Drake @ CS roams in a small area (2 straight paths) but has CoV faction hit<br />
- Othmir @ CS are statics but has Othmir faction hit (Othmir vendor is the only one that sell Brown Algae needed to make Coldain Heater, which is needed to make Coldain Velium Temper (CVT))<br />
- Black Panther @ WL respawns fast but roams north, east and south of the lake among other hostiles (giants, holgresh, and mercenaries), skin drop rate is moderate, may be 1 in 3 has skin, sometimes 2 skins.<br />
- Haze Panthers @ WL are uncommon, roams, and harder to kill, drop is also uncommon, skin drop rate is uncommon, may be 1 in 10 has skin, rarely 2 skins.<br />
- Tigeraptor @ WL are both static (next to Skyshrine entrance) and roams (west of the lake), easy kill and no one farms them, hide drops rate is moderate, may be 1 in 3 has hide.<br />
- Holgresh @ WL are casters, easy to kill if you melee but quite annoying (they nuke, dot, dispells, some has pet), their combines also require distill mana vial (the sapphire x 2 one), fur drop is uncommon, may be 1 in 7?<br />
- Velium Hound @ WW are not easy to farm and track, highly contested mob, the fur is in high demand for shawl, unknown PH, fur drop rate is 1 in 2.<br />
- Ice Burrower @ WW are not very numerous, they are not easy to kill with tons of HP, also highly contested, the silk gear are quite a money maker, silk drop rate is 1 in 3 but needs 2 to make a swatch.<br />
- Cobalt Cod @ CS is high yield, easy to get<br />
- Yew Leaf @ WL as a ground spawn is hard to spot, as a foraged item is rare as heck (1 an hour, may be)<br />
- Drake Egg @ Skyshrine as a drop is easy but mob has CoV faction hit, as a foraged item is high yield.<br />
- Velium @ Velks are common drops from top shelf spiders, rarer on the bottom floor, also drop by gargoyles in zone.<br />
<br />
...<br />
yeah, something like that, I only go farming if I'm extremely bored, I farm bazaar mostly.<br />
...<br />
<br />
[edit]<br />
<br />
Oh another thing to consider:  Velium Boning needs only 1 CVT in 1 combines, Velium Studs needs 4 CVT per 2 studs in 4 combines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can also get Drake, Dragon and some other type of Egg foraging in WW.<br />
<br />
Normally I stay at the SG zone line and forage right there. There does not seem to be any pathing that would take mobs to you so minimum risk. Otherwise ToV also is a good Drake/Dragon egg forage spot. If you are on CoV faction just zone in and forage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Meirril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Personaly I'd recomend spending your time farming velium (velks, crystal caverns, ToFS, SS. Any of the golem/gargoyal type mobs, spiders in velks and SS) and fishing cobolt cod to do Artic Wyvern. Then auction to buy Artic Wyvern hide at a reasonable rate (13pp from what I remember was reasonable. Maybe 20pp each). Usualy quadders get an average of 1 per quad. <br />
While quadding is good xp at the level your talking about, if you want to do this fast the other two components take longer to collect. If you are going to quad wyvern in CS I'd recommend getting to be ally with CoV. At ally wyvern and drakes do not assist each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">13pp is vendor price for AW pelts... personally I didn't like paying over that myself :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Silound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Any velious stuff goes for 100+pp each on Prexus =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mendan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you do hunt tigerraptors, pathers, and haze panthers in WL, Rapticor can make a great pet.  Just charm him with CoK and buff him up, he'll tear through the raptors and panthers.  I don't snare him because it's hard getting him to keep up when hunting wanderers, but at 52 you may want to keep snare on or he could do some lethal damage to you before you can recharm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Taushar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks for the info everyone. I assume that all the mobs do not give faction hits by killilng them other than the Othmirs? I think I will just bring my chanter and DC a pet and go at it in WL. That seems to be the best place for it. Thanks again.<br />

-Don't attack Yvolcarn (he summons, and you'll be dead in no time)<br />
-Ditto Azureake<br />
 <br />
<br />
The only named in CS that summons, is the dragon that's always dead within minutes of spawning by the farming crews on the servers.<br />
<br />
However, the Bulthar Herdleader, King Klan, and Yvlocarn cannot be snared/rooted.  That is the only difficulty in taking them down.  Can't remmember if Azureake can be or not, as a caster he always stops out of melee range anyways :)</div></div><hr />
