heyas<br />
<br />
Ive been hunting velium hound and glacier mastadons in the West Wastes for a while now for the extra furs to use and sell. Also take out the wurms for silks &quot;yay&quot; Then theres Tantor to kill when i have some extra mana. On Maelin Starpyre its never campes practically so i have free rights wooot Druid power.<br />
<br />
Weel ANYWAYS heheh. killed a few of the brontotherium guys and got hides and femurs ( dont know if its femurs or a some bone or whatever) and i dont know what to do with them. I found a recipe to cure the hide but thats it? What are they used for.<br />
<br />
Another question. I also like to quad in CS when its not busy for the wyverns hides. I know the wyverns dont give faction hits but do the drakes? I never heard anyone say they did and i jsut ahve been thinking they would slap me with negatice CoV if i killed them. Just wondering if i could kill all the drakes for some more hides as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help and Moo :cool:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">drakes don't give faction hits except for the named one.  they are supposed to dispell though.  good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Emron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've hunted drakes and wyverns quite often, and have never had a drake dispell.  I've also heard that the wyverns will summon, and I've never seen that either.  Granted, most of my hunting is root/dot, but even still, I've never been summoned or dispelled.<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i know the drakes in sf do and was told the ones in cs do as well.  have avoided upsetting them so not 100% sure.  at ally faction they stop adding/assisting right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>scarbrowed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The drakes in CS definitely dispell. But it can be avoided simply by staying out of it's range, which is a lot shorter than the range of my druids root spell.<br />
<br />
The Wyverns in WW definitely summon, but not the ones in CS. I animal charm a lot there for a while, and charm breaks on Wyvern are nearly always fatal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The dispell is a secondary effect of their AoE damage spell (Frosty Death 2, as I recall) - definitely want to stay out of range if you can.  Also, please try to avoid fighting drakes near the port-in...terribly disappointing to be buffed for a trip to the wastes only to have your spells stripped by 2 drakes that aren't interested in fighting with you... :-)<br />

<br />
NAMED Wyvern in Cobalt Scar summons. Not sure about named Drake.<br />
<br />
All Drakes in Cobalt have cold AE, not sure if named dispells but I've never sene a normal drake in CS dispell.<br />
<br />
ONLY named's in Cobalt give faction hit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also I suspect some confusion.. <br />
<br />
Drake is like a big bat or a small flying dragon.<br />
<br />
Drach is a flying &quot;Dog&quot; with insect wings.<br />
<br />
Wyvern is a walking *Bird* with a long tail.<br />
<br />
And den dere;s da flyin monkies from velious called Holgresh. They can also be found in Miragul's Menagerie (LDoN)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I can say with certainty that the cobalt drakes in CS dispell, after having one of them remove a fresh KEI from my druid.  It was in conjunction with the AE cold though, so it stands to reason if you can stay out of range of that, you'll be fine.</div></div><hr />
