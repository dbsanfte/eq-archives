I have a level 26 Vah Shir Sham alt that just got his nice little Ceremonial Strainer and has almost all the parts for finishing the next part of the quest. I am looking for other Vah Shir who have finished or would do there class quest so we can all get to the next part. Please either post here or send a tell in gameto either Enfiniti (52 Human Ranger) or Entoine (26 Vah Shir Shaman), they are both in Divine Hopazi. I will be more then willing to help someone if they want to do this quest but can't &quot;track down&quot; the right MoBs or such.<br />
If anyone can help, please let me know, thank you and be safe!</div></div><hr />

From what I understand I have to have a Vah Shir make each item, the smithing hammer and anvil I think are only for Shadowscream and not this quest. I'll post to the main section asking if non-Vah Shir can do it, if they can then great! Thanks again for answering me.</div></div><hr />
