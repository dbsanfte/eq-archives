<br />
1. Did the trivial caps change? for instance I see that misty thicket trivial is 300+, is it just that you now know the exact number? or have they increased the caps?<br />
<br />
2. how does the new trade skill interface work, is it supposed to happen when you open up your cooking device? ie, spit, mixing bowl, or what? I just dont understand<br />
<br />
3. Is there any reason anything pre-ldon food is no longer selling in bazaar? i did not see any mtp's or halas meat pies, or obah truffles, are these things now obsolete?<br />
<br />
4. Can we no longer put eq in windows mode, i tried it, but it didn't work, is there a new way to do it now?<br />
<br />

<br />
With the new UI, we now know that trival, and a lot of others that were merely speculated at before.  No, they have not increased the caps, still stuck at 250, 252 modified.<br />

<br />
When you now open the container by right clicking on it, the new UI will always open.  If you ctrl-right click on it it will open as you were used to seeing it.  If you forget and just open it via right click, you can get to the innards by clicking on experiment.<br />

<br />
Most likely the people that had been selling them either a) were all sold out, or b) were not on in trader mode.  Not likely that they will be obsolete any time soon.<br />

<br />
Yes, there is a patch/ .exe that you need to download and run.  that information can be found doing a search at EQlive.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you.  A lot more than that has changed in the past 6 months while you were absent.</div></div><hr />

Thank you, <br />
