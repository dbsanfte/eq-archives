<br />
We here at MaelinEQ have decided on a contest. Many im sure have noticed the new Political and social forum. We have decided that this current forum name does not go along with our board theme.<br />
<br />
So we are leaving it up to the Maelin Community to rename our forum.<br />
<br />
RULES<br />
<br />
All entries must stay withen the current board theme to be considered.<br />
No profanity will be considered.<br />
All entrys must be in before August 15th. 1200am CST<br />
Entrys MUST be PM'd to either myself or Mirsad to be eligible. ONLY PM's will be considered as valid entrys.<br />
You will recieve a email stating that your entry has either been accepted or denied. If your entry is denied you may enter a new one. Once Entrys have been accepted they will be moved here.<br />
Only one entry per person will be considered as a possible winner.<br />
Anon posters will not be permitted to compete.<br />
You must be a member of Maelin Starpyre to be eligible for prizes.<br />
All entries must be original ( no copying other forum names )<br />
<br />
<br />
A poll with the three most favorable choices by Mirsad and myself will be posted. The FINAL decision however will be up to the Admin.<br />
<br />
PRIZES<br />
