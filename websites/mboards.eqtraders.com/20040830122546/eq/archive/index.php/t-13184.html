<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Optimum1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I made a run of 18 combines about 10 days and ended up with 3 pieces. 16 combines 6 days agao for ONE piece. 22 combines tonight for TWO pieces. There's 30kish in BDs alone up in smoke. Im so angry at this point I wonder why I wasted my time getting 250 and my trophy. Anyone else having these kind of results?? Im about to put my sewing kits away for good and make money the old fashioned way....selling smithed BD armor to snot-nosed twinks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bobobn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At about 220 skill(yes i know its not 250), i went 1 for 40 on bracers. But the next run of 60 combines i did i made 27 bracers, that was at about 223 skill.  This junk sells so slow but its another way to skillup for grimel besides LoY robes that i've been doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">wow.  painful.  why not make the caster stuff?  its not wonderful but ok.  the steelweave has competition from all the smiths.  not as much pure caster stuff.  only ice silk from velious that i can think of until pop combines.<br />
<br />
edit nm forget the pure caster stuff. the only peice with int is 5 int on the cap.  other peices give wis.  :boggled: :steamed: now i remember why i didn't like our cultural as a wizard.</div></div><hr />

That is completely not true.  What armour are you looking at?  All of the imbued INT caster Erudite cultural has Intelligence bonuses.  The non-imbued doesn't give wisdom, but it gives a mix of bonuses.  Just put in an imbued gem, and you get pretty good stuff, really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hehe.  wizard=sol ro for me.  rp purposes for a good bit of it.  the only erudite cultural are prexus and quellious.  since i can't wear them following a different god i only listed stuff anyone can wear.  elven chain pwns erudite cultural.  :(  (well cept for the morning dew.)<br />
<br />
the cloak and belt have wis and the cap only has int on int caster only stuff.  its the bd cultural before it was added.  old cultural didn't even have caster stuff with cultural tailoring.  :boggled: <br />

edit ok if i was evil cazic thule is also allowed for erudite cultural.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Elinea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I made a post similar to this in the general discussion forum, and I've seen almost identical posts in the individual tradeskill specific forums. It leads me to conclude that there has indeed been a silent nerf for PoP combines. I can't believe that the RNG is just simply hating *everyone*! Those combines have either been silently nerfed, or they're broke :( <br />
<br />
Thats my opinion and I'm stickin to it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Optimum1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The upside to this mess is that terrorantula silks are now priced through the roof so Im not buying any and my human smith has been getting outrageous success rates on heraldic since i moved all my celestial tempers over to him. Not to mention the enormous money Im commanding for the finished product. Much much MUCH more than steelweave. Oh and yes, the caster stuff sucks oats. I have finally just gotten rid of the last few pieces I've had since I was using BD as a skillup tool ages and ages ago.</div></div><hr />

With a 250 tailoring skill...<br />
I failed 10 combines in a row on Velium Mastodon Fur cloaks...<br />
(at an average cost of 2500 each)  Happily, I have succeeded on my last 4.<br />
<br />
I recommend multiple halfling sacrifices to the tradeskill gods.  <br />
I believe I have finally appeased them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Optimum1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">8 attempts to make some deity-specific rigid legs tonight. so, uhh, 15k+ for those legs. Let's see, they sell for uhhh 10k on a good day..../sob</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sluggo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have had absolutely Horrid success rates with all of my Stormreaper Armor. (Halfling Cultural). Last fall I had decent success rates, BD's were cheap, I lowered the prices across the board on all of it. Now, Like others are reporting, It is completely pointless to make. I have had upto 20 failures in a row. I will no longer be making any of it. I kinda wish Sony would let us know when they change the way success rates are calculated. I typically wait till I have over 100 Blue Diamonds prior to start. Just because if I start with less, I may end up with nary a piece of armor to show for my tens of thousands of plat worth of supplies used.<br />
Haversack seem to be combining OK, (of course 251 trivial makes them fairly east to make). Is it me or does anyone else notice that despite my 200 skill level in brewing, smithing and Pottery, I get an abnormal amount of failures on the Blue diamond dust, Celestial Temper and Infused Threads? My skills are well above trivial yet I still get an average of two failures per stack at each stage???? A few months ago when my skill levels in Pottery, smithing and brewing were about 160-170, I would get a one in twenty failure. Very Strange!<br />
See Ya! Sluggo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Seedling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Erudite cultural... I think anyone will agree that it's one of the shoddiest pieces of non-work the Devs have delivered so far... <br />
<br />
Regretably, tailoring and any form of new manaregen are 2 things the devs won't touch with a 10 foot pole... and there aren't enough Erudites out there to nag the Devs... :boggled:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Craftah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I just hit 250 on Erudite culteral.<br />
<br />
Right after the patch I did a bunch of combines and had really high failure rates. A few days later I did some more combines and had much better success.<br />
<br />
335 Trivial for the imbued stuff. Wow!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My skills are less than yours, Sluggo, and I get roughly the 5% failure rate on the powders and infused threads (I have my husband do the brewing as he is 250 with his trophy), and don't seem too streaky. Rates on haversacks are streaky but generally good. It's nice to have a skillup path that pays for itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kaenine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I miss Verant so much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kanstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I did some GM smiths yesterday.  The UI showed my effective skill at 252, and yet 4 of the 5 combines failed.  The final made, and updated my collection of makeable items with a triv of 335. :shocked:<br />
<br />
I read some formula explaining success rates, and this would equate to being 33% or so when before I was under the impression it was meant to be 50:50.<br />
<br />
Oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>baody</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I noticed high failures on the last set of arctic wyvern I did. I haven't done any lately because I've been saving my supplies until I hit 242 in tailoring. Has anybody noticed anything similar?<br />
<br />
PS, what is the market like for halfling cultural tailored armor? Is it worth doing?<br />
<br />
Baody, 241 tailor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Razj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hi all -<br />
<br />
I've noticed no deficits or decreases in steelweave successes...  At 247 + geerlok (I won't make a trophy until 250; it's my personal reward thingie), I'm running about 60% on regular (rigid) steelweave combines and around 75% on Serene Steelweave.  Call it 60 combines of regular and 10 combines of Serene since the UI change.  As always, YMMV.<br />
