<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nyetro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...it is tradeskill flagged.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know it is used in a few faction quests and a quest where a npc will make a poison for you.<br />
<br />
I went to Qeynos to check on the Lion's Mane about the brawl, although i didn't find any info, i did find a stack of Crow's special brew and bought it. It is tradeskill flagged, but you don't make the combine for the poison quest. As for the faction quest, you just give it to the npc. So is the flag new? could this be something to do with BR or lewena?<br />
<br />
The npc also said that more than a few would make him ill, so i tried to give to the drunk and lewena, but neither wanted. Probably not part of any unsolved quest, but the flag on it threw me.</div></div><hr />
