Two Bazaar bots have two Idols selling for 2000k and the other for *GASPS* 10k!  :shock: <br />
<br />
What is up with that?!  Did it get nerf'd?  Or are these two trying to &quot;Get Rich Quick&quot;?</div></div><hr />

I use it to *try* to prevent that extra death while on raids.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't  :D</div></div><hr />

I remember getting one of those as a relative newbie off that guy that never drops a pack...<br />
<br />
Sold it for 500pp on my bazaar mule and was excited for weeks.  It actually went fairly quickly thinking back, I may have been able to get more.<br />
<br />
I think it fluxuates, at the time I asked auction what it was worth and was told anywhere from 50pp junk because it is only one charge to 2000pp absolute must have.<br />
<br />
Guess it depends on what they can get for it, like anything else put it at highest you hear, and lower til it sells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correct.<br />
<br />
But sheesh, 10k though!  I think somebody is dreaming.  I'll go and mindlessly sit and camp the dang thing before I pay out even at the low price of 2k.</div></div><hr />

I'd stumbled over one of these not too long ago when the silly orc attacked me on my way through to turn in some goblin ears.  I've been saving it for a slowing agro emergency, but keep forgetting that I've got it.  Mayhap it's time to save this until we start doing PoM.  Hmmm....</div></div><hr />
