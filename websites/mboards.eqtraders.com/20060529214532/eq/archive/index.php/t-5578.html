<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnastassja</div><div class="date">04-01-2003, 02:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While creating a 1750+++ Club database for the online &quot;Story Window&quot; for a number of friends and former guildies I decided I may as well include the Rogue Poison-making Skill. Only, uhm, I've never worked on the Poison skill (having never played a rogue beyond L17 in lives-past). So might someone please explain to me the effect details (below) of Spinebreak.<br />
<br />
• Spinebreak = effect: movement 95, speed 50 (see: EQTraders on Make-Poison (http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_poison.htm) for context if needed)<br />
<br />
What does that actually mean? Is this a BUFF:self or de-BUFF:mob application and is 95/50 (respectively) a %-number or what? <br />
<br />
I'm sooooo confused! :oops:<br />
<br />
:D Thanks a ton!</div></div><hr />

IE: none of the products made are ever a BUFF-effect for the rogue? gah :!: talk about  &quot;biting off more than one can chew&quot;  :oops:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">04-01-2003, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spine Break in particular is a 95% snare and 50% slow.  Follow the link to Kiky's from the poison page here, it's a lot more detailed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnastassja</div><div class="date">04-04-2003, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks a ton! for all your replies to enlighten this daft wizard. YOU all are the greatest. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tokensmoke</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, There is no poison for rogues out there that has a slow effect for mobs.  Spine rend is simply a 65% snare.  If there were slow poisons out there, rogues would be the solo'in all over the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zallarenya</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, from a non-rogue even (but I did poisons for the database), Spine Break and Spine Rend are two totally different things.<br />
<br />
Spine Rend is a Tier 2 PoP poison (the spell buff proc kind). From the lucy spell data base, Spine Rend (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1185&amp;amp;source=Live) is 55% snare (with poison counter so it can removed with Cure Poison).<br />
<br />
Spine Break (the topic of the original poster) is an old-world poison with effect Paralyzing Potion I (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1833), which is a 95% snare and 50% slow (with small poison counter) and lasts for 7 ticks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tokensmoke</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 04:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My appologies, your right, 50% slow...wow!!!  Guess im gonna be crankin out tons of those..!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">squirtle</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 07:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are poisons that enhance your target at the same time as they damage.<br />
The Brittle Haste line has delusional swiftness, xegony's curse, paradoxical peptide... speeds the mob and decreases AC and STR<br />
The Berserker Madness series increases STR and AC while doing DD/DoT damage.<br />
<br />
Use them for those situations where you won't be in melee range (i.e. never except to make and sell to vendor for skilling up)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tibis</div><div class="date">04-27-2003, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't forget, Tokensmoke, that the 50% slow / 95% snare poison is from the original (I call 'em &quot;Classic&quot;) selection.  That is you apply it and it's a one-shot effect at the very first attack.<br />
<br />
Those effects are still useful in certain circumstances though, especially PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tokensmoke</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye my friend...After readin that post, I blew the dust off my &quot;Classic&quot; poisons book....found out i was wrong and kicked myseld in the azz..!  Here's somethin I wanna test later on..Can u apply an old world poison and have a PoP poison applied at same time..Im thinkin u can since PoP poison is more or less a buff....will test later and post..!</div></div><hr />
