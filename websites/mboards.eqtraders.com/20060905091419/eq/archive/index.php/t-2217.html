I killed 23 Voracious Brutes in DL and got 2 , I killed 30+ Brutes in FM and got 0.  What other zones are there for getting these?  I am sure there was probably info on this in the old boards, are they still accessible?</div></div><hr />

<br />
In D.L and F.M, I always have experienced about a 1 in 10 drop rate...<br />
<br />
You can also hunt in Warsilks Woods, in the tunnel leading into Dalnir, there are two caves one with 3 brutes and another with 2 I think.  Anyways, the point is they are all static, and non-social so you could just kill them for H.Q brute hides, instead of running all over the zone hunting them down.<br />
<br />
Expect a drop rate of around the same as D.L and F.M but....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PinyonTreedotter</div><div class="date">01-14-2003, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The drop rate for the brutes outside Dalnir is about 1 in 10 as well.  All my alts spent levels 24-30 there, and I would normally get about a stack of HQ brute hides.<br />
<br />
The brutes outside Dalnir have been social for the past several months, although their range is not tremendously large.  Careful pulling is possible, and they run away from the other brutes when they run.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last time I was there was a good 6 months ago at least...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Farnyr</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 02:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They used to disappear on me at times too. But what I would do was to run all the way out of the tunnel system and they would find me outside. I think they would either raise up above the tunnels and would on top, or would fall beneth world do to the dips in the road(thank you Z axis! /rude). If that doesnt help you, just zone into Dalnir and then zone out. Now that im 56, i dont think ill be running from them anymore, hehe.</div></div><hr />
