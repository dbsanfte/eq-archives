<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everyone! Took my druid's baking from 0 to 250 in 8 days. 0-191 on day one, and 2-400 MTP combines per night after that. Also got VERY lucky and made his GM spoon on the first try!<br />
<br />
Luckily, as a druid, I could port to steamfont and track/kill mountain brownies for brownie parts. I of course, foraged as many of the fruits and vegetables as I could. I did end up buying quite a few veggies, as I just couldn't keep up with the need foraging, but fruit I managed to forage on my own, no problem.<br />
<br />
Here's the data<br />
<br />
1965 total attempts, 445 Successes, 59 skill up's, which gives me a skill up rate of 1/33.3. I could have wished for a better ratio, but don't really mind much. :) Longest run without a skill up was 128, followed by 3 other runs in the 90's. Shortest run was, of course, &quot;1&quot; which I managed to pull off 3 times, along with &quot;2&quot; attempts, which also apeared three times.<br />

I was dying on the last 4 points! Last 5 really, for some reason they were very disproportionate to the skill up rate I was getting used to. I've been selling the MTP successes in the bazaar, and with over 400 left on my trader, I still paid for all my baking, and then some, Including the trophy!!! I noticed a doubling of successes when I topped 210, and the success rate steadily improved to almost 50% at skill 240 <br />
<br />
All in all, I'm very pleased! This has funded quite a bit of new stuff for several characters on top of paying for itself and the trophy.<br />
<br />
Good Luck! And Happy baking! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Finae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Congrats !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cannyar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">wow. consider yourself lucky i think. i've been working for weeks, at least 2-4 hours a week, finally hit 215.. lately i've been making meat pies. maybe its time i switch to mtp. sounds like you got very lucky with skillups though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heck yes switch to MTP's!<br />
<br />
Veggies, Fruit, Brownie Parts, and eggs are the only parts not purchaseable in Shadow Haven (where I did all my MTP combines).<br />
<br />
Veggies and Fruit can be bought in the bazaar, often for less than 1pp each. Same for Eggs. you only need 1 egg per 100 MTP combines, which means I basically used 1 stack of snake eggs to get to 250. *shrug*<br />
<br />
Brownie parts can be problematic, mostly because of the OBSCENE price gougers in the bazaar! :steamed: On Xegony, they're all up for 50PP each in the bazaar! WTH? That's why I ported to steamfont to kill my own. If they had been reasonable in the bazaar, I woulda just bought em. Same as with eggs, you need just 1 brownie part per 100 MTP combines.<br />
<br />
I literally prepped 200 combines in less than an hour, and cranked out those 200 combines within the duration of a single cast of brilliance. (Used to get me to 255 WIS) 45 minutes I think it lasts. /scratches head<br />
<br />
My skill up rate was pretty average, but that's with 255 WIS. Lower WIS = slower skillups.<br />
<br />
I'd strongly recommend MTP's for anyone skilling up past 200 in baking. Despite the subcombines, it goes very quickly, due to the high yeild of said subcombines. :)<br />
<br />
Good luck with your baking!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>cannyar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well i switched over and clicked away for some 3 hours. went from 215 to 231 in that time. not too bad. had to run around a bit to buy the parts, the humans in SH won't sell me frosting and the like. anyone know an easy way for a high elf to gain faction with them?<br />
<br />
only 24 points to go. wasn't going to try for the GM spoon until i hit 250..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There's a &quot;Haven Amulet&quot; quest in SH.<br />
<br />
It's in 2 parts. One is to run something to the Bazaar from Commisioner Henry and return with a piece. Then he sends you to the outpost in Fungus Grove to give something to someone out there, and bring something back to Henry. Takes about 10 minutes, and gives you a 2 CHA +faction necklace for SH. Everyone will sell to you if you wear the necklace. :)<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

thanks for the info. information about the quest can be found here http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1449<br />
<br />
i did it in about 15 minutes with my 57 high-elf magician. hardest part was locating the npc's. the first is in SH in the building over near PC. the second is  in the building in the bazaar, first floor, against the wall in the middle. the last is in about the middle of the camp on the left hand side (as you come in from SH) in a building and room by himself. i temporarily bound myself in SH and it made zipping about quick and easy.<br />
<br />
merchants won't sell to me without the amulet on (neck slot) but are happy to sell to me once i am wearing it. i'll keep iaround just for good measure but i finished baking mostly in PoK.</div></div><hr />
