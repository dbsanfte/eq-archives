<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>casala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wow, I love doing ribbons.  I was wary about having to make a little dr00d to forage the components, but I'm glad I did.<br />

This will never happen again, so I'm loving it atm.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ldymech</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I find the plat ribbons awfully expensive for my 42 cleric (main).  In fact, I find tailoring awfully expensive even with my lower levels farming/foraging.  <br />
<br />
My tailoring is at 182 now, but will be awhile before I can continue do to lack of plat and high level character to farm.<br />
<br />
I do tradskills for enjoyment, but the cost is taking the fun out of it.  I want to craft alot of the higher level stuff.  Wisdom is over 200.  I've been tradeskilling for over a year.  <br />
<br />
If anyone has any suggestions, I'd be happy to consider them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>illovich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The only suggestion I can offer is to wait a few levels until you can effectively farm your own stuff to get you the 240s (acrylia reinforced, unless something else is better with the new expansion). <br />
<br />
Of course, you can probably farm the money to buy the pelts faster than you can farm the pelts, once you can efficiently farm the pelts. <br />
<br />
Did that make sense?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dalren Fieryblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I honestly don't see these ribbons as worth it, I can barely make plat as it is.<br />
<br />
My opinion that making armor is better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Silound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hrmm, you shouldn't have too much trouble as a cleric getting LDoN groups. Although slow, they are indeed a fairly steady income of cash. farming anything tradeskillable and selling it will be your fastest cash cow. Spider silks work well, as do velium, which you cna farm in CC at 41 with not too much trouble (may be slow but you can)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">While ribbons were a great alternative for me, I started an enchanter who can now make her own vials of visious mana.  :)<br />
<br />
Considering the costs comparing on Wu's to Ribbons, Don't forget with WU's you'll need 4 vials of visiouc mana, at about 8PP each, that's 32PP per combine, plus silk.<br />
<br />
Ribbons are 35PP for the gold ribbons plus foraged items.<br />
<br />
Seems pretty even.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually you only need 1 mana a combine. =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doh!  It's been a while.  :)<br />
<br />
I was probabaly thinking 4 silk swatches for some of the combines.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fulminate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Its been some time since I worked on Wu armor, but I (and my wrist) still remember that its 4 heady kiolas that is needed for every recipe.<br />
<br />
And up to 3 swatches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I did wu's until I exhausted my supply of silks, and after about an hour of farming said 'to heck with this', and took my butt down to Gunthak to do ribbons.  I just triv'd on gold ribbons, but my bank account is looking too shoddy to start on platinum yet.  I'll have to poke around the recipes and see if there's anything I can do with what I have in the bank (odds and ends of pelts and hides) that'll take me a bit farther for cheaper. &lt;3 ribbons though.  Even though the new UI makes it easier, heady kiolas are still a pita!</div></div><hr />
