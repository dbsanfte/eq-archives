<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lelienea</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 12:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's been a very, very long time coming - just wanted to post some thoughts and thanks along this epic journey.  I never realized that once the Velious recipes came out, I'd ever have the tenacity to take this road.  From the very first arctic wyvern mask created in CS (after about 25 failures) to heart-stopping haze panther combines in the 200's, all the way to the last few black panther clicks, it's been a fantastic ride.  Special thanks to the following individuals who all made it worthwhile:<br />
<br />
Liina - without your moral support, this would not have been possible.  You were always there to help me find extra supplies, customers, and quite simply, act as a &quot;one shaman cheerleading squad&quot;.   :D  *HUG*<br />
<br />
Lenen - back when you started taking up the post 158 route, I challenged myself to try my best to keep up with you.  It was very exciting to check EQT every day to try and catch a glimpse of our progress.  Even after returning from a 6 month absence (9/11 deployment), your success still inspired me.<br />
<br />
Lexya - your dogged determination on everything from smithing to shawl quests to pottery really rubbed off on me.  When the chips were down, you were always there with C3 and a smile.  *HUG*<br />
<br />
Special thanks and undying gratitude to my wonderful wife for enduring countless nights of coming to bed late after farming greens until my eyes popped out.  Your enthusiasm and willingness to spend unspeakable amounts of time to help me in this endeavor will never be forgotten.<br />
<br />
Additional thanks to wonderful people such as Kwedaru, Sakz, Blevins, Halag, Holster and several members of my extended family (aka Firestormers).<br />
<br />
<br />
And lastly, but certainly not least, big hug to Denmom and her helpers for such an incredible community/resource here on EQT.  Without this vast &quot;library&quot; of knowledge, I would have never made it past silk swatches.  <br />
