<br />
$12 and 30 minutes later, I have great reference points like<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=660871 available now when I need to find something and don't want to log on mule after mule to find it.<br />
<br />
Best $12/year I've ever spent.<br />
<br />
Hmmm-wonder if I can get a kickback for the flood of subscriptions this should bring in  :twisted:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EnfinitiStarr8</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I love Magelo, and have been a Premium member for quite a while. I have never thought twice about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lonewylfe</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can set Magelo to show your bank contents, and even set it to where only you can see them.</div></div><hr />

I've since fallen in love with the ability to synchronize, yum!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I paid for it when they added synchronization, and every patch my husband goes through withdrawal when it breaks.  SO nice to figure out which alt on 5 accounts has the velium bricks......</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
But Nightgod, you need to organize!<br />
<br />
(I miss mule organizing..../sigh)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aandaie</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love the certified authentic magelo icon too.<br />
<br />
That means that if someone wonders if you truely are a 250 skill in something you can show them.<br />
<br />
When the heck did I master troll anyway? Ahaha, I love it for stuff like that too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varlik</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 03:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I've been trying to get to Majelo.com, but just get a grey blank page no ads, not titles, nothing. What am I doing wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lothay</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 04:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The site is almost entirely composed of Javascript and other scripting languages. <br />
<br />
If you have those diabled in your browser, all you're going to get is a blank page. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kentarre</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple of suggestions for ya Varlik,<br />
First off, it's magelo.com -- with a g not a j as you typed it... (not sure if it was a typo, but it certainally makes a difference)<br />
Second, if you happen to be browsing with a Macintosh (like i do), the only browser that displays the site is Mozilla.  :roll:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lothay</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point Kentarre.   Silly me, I forgot about the platform from which he might be browsing.<br />
<br />
Again, it comes down to how the scripting language is handled by the browser. <br />

Click on Advanced.<br />
Scroll down, and put a checkmark in &quot;Use HTTP 1.1&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tabrizia</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also if you are using a firewall, you will have a lot of trouble with Magelo, I ended up turnign off my firewall when ever I need to go there, because of the trouble it causes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dunthor Warsmith</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Magelo does not work in Netscape 4.x at all.  Netscape 6-7.x and Mozilla 1.3 work mostly, although there are occasionally problems and some aspects of pages are not displayed.<br />
<br />
If I remember right, IE 4 works as well, but haven't used that in ages.<br />
<br />
Magelo is a blank page in Lynx :(<br />
<br />
Since I used NS 4 for ages (and still do about half the time), I was a late comer to magelo, and still barely use it.  But figured I would share some of my compatibility findings ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NightGod</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chenier....I AM organized...frighteningly enough.<br />
<br />
1 mule has all tailoring stuff<br />
1 mule has baking/smithing/a few assorted bits<br />
1 mule has quests and old items I just can't bring myself to sell<br />
1 mule has coldain heads (for that giant faction run I'll eventually get around to....no, really)<br />
1 mule has bone chips (don't ask)<br />
1 mule has research bits<br />
<br />
You should have seen how bad things were before I organized everything 4 weeks ago!!!!<br />
<br />
And I prefer to call it a testimonial, not an advertisment Lothay =P I honestly have zero connection with magelo, just love the product now that I figured out a handy use for it =)</div></div><hr />
