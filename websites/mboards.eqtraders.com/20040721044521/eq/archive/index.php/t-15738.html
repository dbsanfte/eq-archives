<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hilbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know what is going on with the Magician's Tower? Keep getting fatal link errors and my links all worked yesterday. Would hate to see this site go away, it was one of my favorites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From the main page at http://www.magecompendium.com/  seems like they're aware of it.  I'd noticed they'd been fooling with the boards lately (before the boards were accessed with http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/ but as of this week, the &quot;/tower/&quot; yielded a permissions denied error, and the boards were at http://forum.magecompendium.com/ instead), so probably some tinkering went a little wrong.<br />
<br />
The people running those boards do seem to know what they're doing - I have confidence it won't die off :)</div></div><hr />
