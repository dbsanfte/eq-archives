<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Qutie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think the new baking will just be an &quot;easier&quot; path to skilling up for those that haven't done so yet.  <br />
<br />
The meat is found on vendors rather cheaply, you can take the boat to Abysmal and load up on all the lil extras you need. <br />
<br />
Other than the emote of eating caesar salad and drinking lemonade.... (sighs)  there really isn't a lot of point to it.  Maybe (hopefully) there will be other amazing foods to make as in the Tormentor Stirfry, BPP (way yummy).  But, I don't see it yet... maybe those icky gnomes are busy making new weird baking implements that will change things....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, I don't have the expansion, so I won't be making anything either, unless someone runs and gets me the supplies I need;) <br />
(something about having to be level 50)<br />
<br />
But, my suggestion would be to just use the foraged stuff to make yourself some nice food to forcefeed.<br />
<br />
Though the new foods aren't as good as the Justice Fruit Pies, or Picnics, (with cost permitting (cost/yield ratio)) I can see them as being used by lower level toons until they can afford to buy the better stat foods.<br />
<br />
Just a though, though.</div></div><hr />

I dunno, I am pretty impressed with the stats.  Made beer battered cragbeast and hynid steaks last night.  Cragbeast had, among its other stats, +7 WIS, and Hynid had +7 AGI.  Looking forward to seeing what the tuna and crab steaks have.  For the price and availability of the components, I think GoD baking is really a great new addition.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Good for skill up - those beer battered steaks are a lot easier than making a bunch of Halas Meat Pies.  Other recipes in baking seem like they may help the skill up options without being so boring.<br />
<br />
None of the recipes with accessible items in GoD seems like they would make anything with high demand in comparison  to other things.<br />
<br />
I doubt there is a hidden and new MTP - that is an unwieldy but easy to do recipe for a very nice stat food.<br />
<br />
We'll see what drops in the inner zones and what recipes come with them - but like PoP most of us just aren't going to have access to the ingredients for most of the good stuff.   I had to laugh when I checked the bazaar for taelosian clay component and someone was trying to sell it for 40kpp when the only thing known it can make is a subcomponent for the bolos.  <br />
<br />
So nope, so far nothing that would be highly desirable for a 250 skill baker to want to do, and much less for some of the other skills :(   We'll see what time will tell but at least baking has new recipes - pottery has been all but skipped the last two expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are a lot of thing I like about GoD, don’t get me wrong, but the new Baking recipes bother me.  Basically, they put in x# of new meats, cooking styles/sauces, types of dishes and then gave us a recipe for almost every permutation, no matter how nonsensical (lemon-buttered “&lt;insert meat here&gt;” soup ?)  It has a very “cookie-cutterish” feel to it…variety is nice, but this was a bit much, lol<br />

Ah well, I'll still make em once in a while to have fun things to eat that are different that the usual fish rolls.  <br />
<br />
I wonder if SOE would consider making it so that  some of these could be combined into a picnic or platter type of meal, with high trivial level, nice stats (although not BPP stats) so that people would be able to make a nice stat food that did not require elemental flags....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>cannyar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i hate to say this, but &quot;what do you expect?&quot;<br />
<br />
seriously, as far as stat foods go, SoE is sort of limited in what it can offer. you can't offer food items with high stats without making it difficult to create (and look how easy MTPs have gotten with the new UI). that means either many subcombines (which isn't a big deal now) or rare items, which anyone is unlikely to get. if you make it a rare forge someone who does forge it and doesn't know what it's for is just going to trash it. once they do figure out what it's for it'll be sold in the bazaar for a few k pp. can you see paying 5k pp for one ingredient of an &quot;uber&quot; stat food? no. can you see asking your friends/guild to go raid some hard monster to get an ingredient because you want to make a &quot;holy twinky&quot; that has +5 to all stats? no. not to mention the fact that one day you're likely to consume the item and have to start all over again? you don't have this problem with smithed, tailored, JCed items.<br />
<br />
SoE has sort of painted themselves in a corner when it comes to creating new ideas for food and drink. new items are going to have a new name and a pretty new icon but i doubt we'll see much stat wise. with all the things they have added they can offer us a few thousand more combinations though.<br />
<br />
off to open up my fish 'n chips stall..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have always considered baking to be a &quot;character&quot; improvement, rather than a stat improvement.<br />
<br />
I mean, when you eat a tasty Barbequed Crab Sandwich and gulp down some Chocolate milk... it says something about who you are...<br />
<br />
For example, my Iksar is constantly munching on Hot and Spicy Toelings (regardless of what a waste of time they are to make) simply to scare off little halflings, or as a joke to others.<br />
<br />
yah, you can carry around one MTP and suck down rations and roots all day... but I play my character as a noble Iksar... regardless of the evil within him and his primal instincts, he would never munch on anything unless it was prepared by himself or an equally skilled chef.<br />
<br />
Remember the days when baked goods had NO stats?  Yah, I miss those too sometimes... but at least you can cook up a variety to eat while holding on to your precious Party Platter...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Velaraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Make Party Platters. How much better of stats are you expecting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would like to complain about the tea. (Yes, I know that's Brewing, not Baking, but food and drink go together) <br />
<br />
For the tea, you need to go forage it in the hunting zones, which  is all well and good if you're a high level player with uber gear. <br />
<br />
I want to make the tea, but I don't have a high level foraging character, and I don't have the levels or gear to go hunting in those zones. (Expansion for 50+? yeah, right!)<br />
<br />
Question: Could I safely send my lvl 15 Druid to one of the zones using the Magus, throw up camo, and sit there just foraging for a while, or are there mobs that see through invisibility? <br />
<br />
And can the Wheat for baking be foraged, or is it just dropped? (Ive completed the Baking quest, but not the Brewing yet)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Using the Magus, you could easily get your level 15 druid to Natimbi, and I have not encountered any MOBs that see thru invisibility.  <br />
<br />
But be aware .. Natimbi has a HUGE HUGE HUGE forage table, and at level 15 and the associated foraging skill, the odds of getting the items you want anytime this week are low :)<br />
<br />
I have not foraged wheat in Natimbi (only zone beside the boat I know how to find), and don't think it has a use outside of the baking quest anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The Taelosian Wheat and Taelosian Tea Leaves are NOT in the forage table - the other items you might need like mint (never foraged one yet personally), moldy tea leaves, ginseng, twigs, etc. are foraged.   So you can't make any of the &quot;special&quot; new recipes without mob drops or a lot of luck vendor mining.  (This is true of all of the recipes that use the progressive component.)<br />
<br />
I think the forage table in Natimbi is about 50 items (30 are cragbeast or hynid meat) - and of course you never forage what you want to get.  Things near the zone in don't seem to see through camo/invis but a bunch of others do like the restless souls.  Not sure if the Cragbeast Queen will eat everyone at the zone in - I always zone out in fear at the sound of the roar in the distance.  I would suggest fishing in Abysmal to make money and vendor mining there to look for the new components.  The lower level dropped components seem to go for about 3pp on a vendor, never seen the higher level ones or for that matter the pottery or smithing components.<br />
<br />
/cries over being a disappointed potter/baker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Meh. Well, seeing how the new zones are mostly geared to lvl 65s with uber loot, I guess I'll have to resort to vendor mining and checking the Bazaar and seeing if there is anyone selling who isn't out of their mind. :(<br />
<br />
I really want some of that tea.....<br />
<br />
I bought some Cragbeast and Hynid Meat off one of the Alchemy vendors before I logged off this morning, but that's all the Cragbeast and Hynid Meat I've seen on vendors. Someone was selling Cragbeast Meat in the Bazaar, but wanted too much for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You would have no problem foraging bags of the cragbeast and hynid meat in Natimbi as long as you are careful - and I am guessing the reason you can't find much of it on vendors is because lots of folks are destroying it.  I am sure if you just ask for it foragers would be happy to give you all you could carry.  15 different weights on each type means 30 inventory slots just for meat - I convert mine to the 1lb stuff as I forage it - but fill up almost as fast because of the yield on the heavy pieces.<br />
<br />
(Which for the tinkerers means that collapsed mixing bowls should be in very high demand now.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>aaer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">As my main doesn't have forage skill, I moved a lowbie alt to Natimbi. Halfling Ranger, the innate hide skill is very useful.<br />
<br />
Get close enough to water and fish and forage without breaking hide. Local roamers doesn't see through it. I guess the risk lies in that people tend to train wayfarer camp, and some of them might see through.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Qutie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Elinea gave me a stack of meat to experiment with, then I found about 18 pieces of assorted types and sizes of meat on one of the POK vendors... and now I've got stacks and stacks to play with :)  It's fun stuff, but nothing to ooh and ahh about. <br />
<br />
Other than brewing chocolate milk and lemonade!  ;) cookies and chocolate milk are great raiding noshes :D <br />
<br />
I took a quick look at the recipes, but mainly checked the ones I had gotten meat for.  I see the boat vendor sells assorted peppers and ooh, wow! nutmeg!!  among other things .... <br />
<br />
Will there be some dessert recipes that we haven't found yet, you think?</div></div><hr />

  <br />
<br />
I don't think that will work.<br />
<br />
Until you are Level 20, you won't get the message to come talk to So-And-So in your home town about the brotherhood.<br />
<br />
You can't become a member of the Wayfarer's Brotherhood, until you talk to So-And-So, and then the folks at one of the Camps. (Maybe you can talk to him before Level 20, but I didn't try)<br />
<br />
And until you are a member the Magus will ignore Port Requests. I did try at level 10... and was ignored.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe I should try again with a level 1... I just think that is the level restriction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">No it's definately level 15 that the whispers start. I've just rolled a new Halfling Ranger alt specifically for foraging and skin farming for my main and took him through Level 15 just a few days ago.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm wondering about that wheat.  You need to do progressive quests to be able to grind it and bake it... but what do you bake it into?  Quest NPC said something about making bread with it. Mabye someone could use the flour made from the talisoien wheat instead of normal flour to make bread? Then who knows what you might be able to make with that stuff.<br />
<br />
And the stuff is a royal pain to get too, I hope it's actually worth something instead of just a worthless quest.  After all, if you have to do the quests to use it, then it isn't used for anything, what's the point of the quest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Beatleguise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Personally I think the new line of GoD Baking is very nice.<br />
<br />
Example, I like Barbeque Crab Recipes. These recipes are easy to make, with easy accessible ingrediants. <br />
<br />
Also I was able to use this line to max Baking over a weekend ten times faster than Ive done on other toons, and when I was done I had more money than I started with.<br />
<br />
The Barbeque Fishrolls cost about 11 to 12pp a stack to make, and can be sold for 14 to 16pp a stack, depending on your Charisma.<br />
<br />
Because of the ease to make this stuff, it also gives you something much more fun than Fish Rolls to use as general food on your characters.<br />
<br />
On the Talosian Wheat, I am ebtting that it gets used for an unpublished high end Stat Food. <br />
<br />
I have done the first set of quest , the one swhere you simply do recipes and turn them in, gaining the unseen faction hits. I have started the second set, where you need the Foraged stuff for turn ins. <br />
<br />
I am hoping maybe when its over to have a recipe for Talosian Wheat bread that can be used to upgrade other recipes that use normal breaf. Perhaps Talosian Hero Sandwiches, or soemthing of that nature.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Serenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">My 250 baker is a character I never ended up playing.  I like the convenience of always having her charisma gear on, and being able to use her entire bank for baking stuffage, but I've toyed with taking another baker from 0 to 250 using the starter quests and the tuna/crab recipes only, just to see how it works out.   I'm forcing myself to finish off everthing for shawls and my epic first though :angel:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jarak_akn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I did 0 - 200 baking with AS fish and the TS quests and found it very easy and cost free.<br />
<br />
I also ended up rasing my Brew from 0 - 141 for the sauces and it still cost me nothing (Including the fact I bought spits and potted bowls etc.)<br />
<br />
The most annoying part for me was that during the newbie quests I skilled up faster (much faster) than I made the 100 sucesses. This could be partly due to 255 Int :-)<br />
