<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Binkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I finally succeeded on the 7th shawl.  And after all the failures, I can't even get excited about it.  All I have is a huge feeling of relief that the ordeal is finally over.<br />
<br />
The only thing I have any feeling of satisfaction about is that out of frustration I did a big tradeskill push and got nearly all my tradeskills to 199.<br />
<br />
Time to go fix my Dain faction.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Having recently aquired Tormax's head, I just went through the joy that was bringing my Yelinak faction up from max KOS (less one Tormax kill, still scowling though) up to high kindly.  I bought every single storm giant and frost giant toe in the bazaar for about 3 weeks along with every single giant warrior helm, except for that greedy ******** that had one at 950pp.  I killed the giant killers in WW 7 times to get the faction hit from turning in their heads, couldn't use the pauldrons from the quest.  I collected mercenary brooches to turn in 3 at a time for the faction hit, and a potion I couldn't use.<br />
<br />
I finally got to where he would talk to me, and got my ft2 boots, then ran over to WW and killed a dragon.<br />
<br />
I can't check here, but as I recall, the first steps of the shawl quest give you positive hits to dain faction, so, get busy...<br />
<br />
Oh, and when you are done, kill the dain, it's very therapeutic.<br />
