<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Coramel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi Everyone, <br />
I wanted to know what is the best recipe that does not cost much and is very good but not higher than 100?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your question is vague, at best. Are you asking for a good skillup path, or something that could potentially make you some money?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beatleguise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">GO to one of the numerous Bat Camps, and stock up on Batwings.<br />
<br />
Take 5 gold and go to Ocean of tears.<br />
Make sure you have a Tacklebox, and a Skinning Knife.<br />
<br />
Gunthak Mackerals can be skinned to get you five baits per fish.<br />
The 5 gold is for the sole purpose of buying fishing poles.<br />
<br />
In a weekend, you can have Fishing Maxed, and by making Fish Rolls. (One Fresh Fish and a Bat Wing) You can have Baking to 135.<br />
<br />
Additionally, since you will not have space for everything, your 5 gold will have multiplied. Depending on your intel/wis for skillups, you can easily have 100pp by the time you are done, to put toward the next step of baking. <br />
<br />
At this point you go to Abysmal Sea, you should have lots of bait left over from OOT. Your going to use Tuna and Crab, and follow the Barbeque Recipe line.<br />
<br />
Using the 100pp you made, you will be buying ingrediance to make Barbeque Sauce.<br />
<br />
Starting with Barbeque Tuna, you will make Steaks, then Rolls. <br />
This will get you to 196 in a couple hours, and the 200pp you started with will have once again grown becoming about 500pp.<br />
<br />
If your bored, you could spend a weak making Barbequed Tuna Rolls to build up cash, and use this money to get ingrediance to take you beyond 200 pts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">what is the best recipe that does not cost much and is very good but not higher than 100You forgot the most important piece of information: &quot;best&quot; for what purpose?  To eat?  To give stat?  To sell to make pp?  To give away as gag gift?<br />
<br />
Oh and why tell people to fish and to farm when fresh fish and bat wings can be bought cheaply?  Has been for years....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beatleguise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Because with only 5 gold, you can max Fishing, Baking, and Brewing all to 200, and have 500pp to show for it when your done.  :)<br />
<br />
Even with an Ogre who has low int.<br />
<br />
The post sounded to me like someone was interested in doing trades at the lowest cost. well this is it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Coramel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thank you for all suggestions.<br />
If you have anymore post and I'll read them.<br />
Oh and thanks for the fishing recipe, I'll be sure of doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Cora there are dozens of threads in this forum with ideas for skill up paths, etc.  Try searching a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Coramel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I realise that but I decied that I would do a thread here to get everyones opinion of what they think is the best recipe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kalysto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you go HERE (http://www.eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_quicklist.php?rsa=Baking&amp;menustr=080020900000) you will be able to find all recipes that are 100 and lower trivial and click on them to find the stats.  ( If by best you mean what has the best stats for under skill 100 anyway. )</div></div><hr />
