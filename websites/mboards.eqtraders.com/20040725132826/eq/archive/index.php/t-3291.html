<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MasterRanger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Interesting points. I rarely do quests. This may be why I missed the point of these collapsible things.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaradis Stormcaller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The point is for those of us that have multiple tradeskill items that we don't have to have our entire bank full of just tradeskill containers.  I regularly use: Sewing Kit, Glaze Mortar, Jewelry Kit, Mortar and Pestile, Medicine Bag, and Bearskin Potion Bag.  Thats 6 containers taking up bank space using the non-collapsable ones.   Now if I have the tinkered ones I can put all 6 in a single backpack, and just summon the ones I need at that time, only needing to have a single open inventory slot.  For people that have even more containers is even better.<br />
<br />
I have a single main inventory slot open all the time anyway, how do you do quests that give you a container if you stuff all your inventory slots full of bags?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MasterRanger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Someone please help my poor head igure this out. Bonk me if I'm wrong in the following statements:<br />
<br />
You buy a collapsible alchemy sack to save a primary inventory slot.<br />
<br />
Yet when you summon an alchemy sack with it, you have to put it in a primary inv slot. Therefore you have to keep a slot open anyway. <br />
<br />
If I have a collapsible anything in my bank, and all my bankslots and inventory slots are full, then I have to destroy a container to put in the summoned alchemy sack.<br />
<br />
So why the heck should I shell out 400PP for these things?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>EbinaHB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Got a question.  What's the difference between the Folded Medicine Bag and the Folded Bearskin Potion Bag.  They both do Alchemy right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arbigger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Potions are created from herbs in the six spot medicine bag.<br />
<br />
Bearskin potion bags combine potions into 5 and 10 dose versions of the same.<br />
<br />
GM alchemy bag should allow you to do BOTH in one bag, but I seriously doubt they'll ever impliment that. I'm not sure if it does either</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Solonaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A lot of people have some sort of right-click item in a general inventory slot.  For example, since we're talking about shamans and alchemy here, many shamans have Black Fur Boots (right-click SoW) in a general inventory slot.<br />
<br />
So when you want to do tradeskills, toss the boots in a bag and unfold the appropriate container.  The rest of the time you have the right-click item at your fingertips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thornwald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I made both the callapsiable medicine bag and the potion bag but I have not been able to combine anything in either bag  :? Hopeing they will fix this soon.<br />

Um, I'm wearing mine. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>UbercyrusForbeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ya know, I never wore those. I always had them in an inventory slot, ready to clicky. <br />
<br />
And I too have mucho collapsible stuff, it's nice to have wt. reduction bags and so forth instead of tradskill containers. You just create the bag when you're ready to use it and boom... you're ready to go.</div></div><hr />
