<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>etitameh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">everyone else who's smarter than me (well, or has more access to tae ew meat than me) probably already knows this, but a heads up: candied tae ew now sells for much less than it used to... something like a few gold per, as opposed to the 18pp or so it used to sell for. i never considered the old pricing an exploit, so i don't mind talking about it (considering it required a relatively rare dropped component), but just wanted to let all aspiring bakers know that you won't make money buying chunks of tae ew meat to candy anymore.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
