The best idea I came up with was to break my lifelong allegiance with the Othmir and collect some fur. (side note: It took me 94 kills to go from ally to dubious.)<br />
<br />
In the first 40 kills I looted 9 furs.  Not bad, about 1 in 4.  In the next 54 kills I looted 2 furs.  <br />
<br />
Can anyone who has exp at killing the othmir confirm or deny this drop rate?  If its this bad I’m going to go back to PoP for exp as the exp is slow in Cobalt Scar in comparison.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Liwsa</div><div class="date">01-16-2003, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night killed about 58 warriors, a few shaman(3 i think), and a few shell collectors(hate when greenies agro)(less then 10) and got 11 pelts. So it was 11 out of 71 kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rendlin</div><div class="date">01-16-2003, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the info, escpecially that the green ones drop furs.  It took me 142 kills of warriors/shaman/named to get my first stack of furs, so 1 in 7.  I went to Threateningly after kill 126. <br />

Level does help in farming though.  If you are a druid and have Karana's Rage lvl 62 AE spell then farming them isn't to bad.  I do remember it taking awhile to get a stack even using my method.<br />
<br />
Note: do this only when not many are in the zone, it tends to upset people who can't do it.  I believe in positive PR for my guild and my class.<br />
<br />
Single pull the shamans and clear them from the Chief's camp and the one over by Bulthars.  Med up if needed.  Harmony the Chief and snare pull the entire camp, including pups.  Being KOS here helps as it's always easier to pull the pups in mass to snare in the open.  Run over to the Bulthar side camp Snareing any of the Othmirs in between (think there are 2).  Snare pull that camp.  At 62 there was no need to Harmony the 2 guys there you don't want.  AE at will and collect your drops from the little bodies strewn all over the beach.   :) <br />
<br />
Some AA into Fury of Magic and Spell Casting Fury makes this fairly mana efficient.  KEI is a must but is easily paid by all them gem and armor drops.  There are finer details of technique not discussed above, but you can only figure those out by doing, like making sure you avoid being pounded on by 19 or so Othmirs.  :idea:</div></div><hr />

I got little over 10 stacks of Othmir furs for that. I grouped for a few times during those levels, but most exp came from quadkiting Othmir.<br />
After that they bugged CS so that Chief Kalan aggroed every time I aggroed any Othmir in zone. I think they have fixed it tho. :P<br />
<br />
<br />
I think I'll go skin the little furry things again someday.</div></div><hr />
