I spent about 4 hours foraging with my halfling druid last night (with a 125 foraging skill) and found 1 acorn outside the zone to the halfling city. <br />
<br />
Also for those of you who are trying to forage Plains Pebbles, Try foraging in the river between East and North Karana. The last time I worked on my swimming I tried foraging and got pebbles about 1/2 of the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Foraging is done using a zone foraging table.<br />

Location in the zone DOES NOT matter for foraging.<br />

Of course, Misty Acorns can be a ground spawn as well.  <br />

<br />
just like the theory that some towns are better for imping in certain skills..i have never ever imped tailoring in freeport on my wood elf..in rivervale it flies up..i dont know but do ya think im wasting my time in freeport? hehe</div></div><hr />
