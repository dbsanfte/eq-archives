But I'm back now :) Still waiting for the DSL line at the new house but that should get done pretty soon so come the new year things will be back to some semblance of normality at Nichola's Smithy.<br />
<br />
BD prices seem to have halved since I was last playing, which is interesting, so it looks like Heraldic will get cheaper. The PoP stuff still isn't impressing anyone much, so I have no idea what my combine fees will be on that. More concrete info once I have had time to do my research.<br />
<br />
As ever, tells to Nichola in game, Nicolana my afk bazaar mule (once the dsl line is up), or mail to mailto:nichola_tunare@hotmail.comnichola_tunare@ho  tmail.com&lt;/a&gt;</div></div><hr />

Not impressing much? :) Check out the elemental bard armor.</div></div><hr />

I was impressed by the stats on the bard armor, while Nichola's context was within the smithing realm. Sorry for the confusion.</div></div><hr />

You can distribute it to your guildmates, make a hobbit warrior, whatever.  I have a human pally friend who has pretty poor equipment, so let me know if this interests you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eqNichola</div><div class="date">01-06-2003, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK I'll see what you make that I can use :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuatro</div><div class="date">01-07-2003, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'll go in on this deal too if anyone is interested...i can craft the high elf, wood elf, half elf wearable cultural armors. (for casters i can make High Elf, Human wearable chain).<br />
<br />

<br />
Please find any Sykes in game.  I can make the tempers needed, but I just need the combines done.  I will also just pay for completed items if you are not in need of the tempers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was interested in purchasing most visible pieces of fine heraldic, and maybe a couple non-visible pieces as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eqNichola</div><div class="date">04-07-2003, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure am, not on much except weekends but still a chance of finding me around 9pm-midnight BST (that's 4pm-7pm EST etc etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lanerien</div><div class="date">04-11-2003, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excellent, will look for you then</div></div><hr />
