<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Goresmash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Is there any kind of time frame with this request or just ASAP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lunira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Have Fulorian look me up - 200 potter and 250 brewer here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I believe he wants 'em ASAP... I'm sure he'll post a note up when he's got enough.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fulorian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have no idea how many people will respond to this and with how much.. its less a matter of time frame than volume. We'll see. Your probably not going to exceed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm assuming you'll be needing them for the foreseeable future right? No real time frame? I've got a couple characters that are ready to level in CC, so I'll be able to start collecting and saving for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Last time Fulorian came by, he told me his bank was full (too many Enchanted Bricks).<br />
<br />
What he needs right now is... someone to help him with the Celestial Tempers.  I'd do it, but my Pottery isn't very great (only ~120).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fulorian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Currently, yes. Anyone who currently has been gathering for me please post here so I can know who all has been... trying to get it consolidated and bought soonish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've got 36 Velium Rings and 30k sales profits for you on Adelie.<br />
<br />
All that I have left of yours for sale are the Night Terror Vambs &amp;amp; Greaves, though that might have changed today.<br />
<br />
If/when you're ready for me to sell more Heraldic Plate, just drop it by.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lenedien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Fulorian, I am waiting until I get alliance then I can go down to Thurg and buy some CVT. After that (barring failures) I should have 4 rings. Though unfortunately, my play time has been cut down tremendously lately so I may have a little trouble getting it very fast. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fulorian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">4 rings isn't so much of a worry, and I'm in good shape for a bit, Ceggon delivered 110 rings to me yesterday and theres a few others with 100 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Night Terror Greaves sold... you're up to 54kpp now.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xiggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It is nice to see Fulorian getting lots of plats for his efforts.<br />
<br />
I remember the posts from our various high level smiths complaining that they were all broke. <br />
<br />
Our best tradskillers should be fat and happy. :)<br />
<br />
PS That was NOT a sarcastic post!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ever</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Fulorian do you still need? Ya told me you didnt the other day ;(</div></div><hr />

Well...<br />
<br />
Gammy's not quite getting great profits yet... but that's mainly because he keeps dumping all his plat back into Smithing. :D<br />
<br />
I'm still making some spare change from the last of my Acrylia Plate... gonna see if I can't make some cash (and more importantly skill-ups) with some Acrylia Chain.<br />
<br />
If anyone out there needs a Vendor for their goods, please feel free to look me up (Adelie).  I think I'm going to replace my backpack with a Trader Satchel and just not price the fishrolls &amp;amp; fuzzlecutter drink in the top two slots... that way I'll have even more room to sell stuff.  :D</div></div><hr />

You know you can just put your food and drink in the bank for when you're running around now.  When in trader mode, you no longer eat or drink anything.  Guess it was to stop people from eating their MTPs :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Goresmash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hey Fulorian, you still need rings?  I gotz 20 and should have another 20 in the next day or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Khaarq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Fulorian,<br />
Look me up.  215 pottery.  I'd be happy to assist you with your Celestial Tempers.  Also 200 in brewing, in case Lunira isn't around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fulorian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have the skills for it, just not the patience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Xiggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">A 250 Smith lacking patience...that seems like a study in contradiction.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, he fits perfectly in the guild!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Fulorian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I had the time and the patience to get 250 smithing, THEN came the guild Xig =9</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Xiggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">He he - that is so true, Fulorian!<br />
<br />
Enjoy your vacation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Goresmash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Um iz Mr. Fulorian still playing EQ and is he still wanting to buy rings?  I got like 3 stacks to sell to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Xiggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Despite that I am NOT Fulorian's agent or business representative, please allow me to provide an insignt into his calendar.<br />
<br />
The mighty Fulorian is currently on vacation for the holidays.  He was supposed to be gone for one week but decided to stay for two weeks.<br />
<br />
I heard a vicious rumor that they have some nice strip clubs in his home town :)  Could that be the reason?<br />
<br />
Seriously, just hang on to the rings and he shall be back with his fat wallet full of pp.</div></div><hr />
