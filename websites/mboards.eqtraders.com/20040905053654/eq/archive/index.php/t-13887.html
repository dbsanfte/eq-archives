I've fished up a couple of no drop keys in Abysmal named &quot;Kutin's key&quot;.  Has anyone seen a Kutin anywhere, or found mention of a missing key?  <br />
<br />
There is a Kutin Pyskar (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14359) in Abysmal Sea.  Try giving the key to him. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Touched</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Took a while but found him , yup he was much appreciative  and i look so pretty now ;) <br />
<br />
<br />
   hint: if you are looking for him look  near where all the wayfarer's are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wuwu! Way so purty now!  {snickers}<br />
<br />
Funny thing was, that when I was standing right next to him with my druid, he STILL wasn't on my tracking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Truda Getlow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just finished doing some fishing in this zone.... Kutin's keys also give a bit of XP when turned into him. I think the XP gain is marginal however. I know the fishbone darts are made obviously from fish, has anyone experimented with that yet from the fish caught in Abysmal Sea?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can eavesdrop on folk's fish stories: One of them lost his purse overboard while Delovar (or something like that) tells a story of a small shimminering fish that looked like it was covered with gems.  Anyone every fish anything up besides tuna, crab, kutin's key, and regular fishing trash?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ive been swapping constantly between fishing and tinkering, using the cash from fishing to pay for my tinkering skillups. Over the last 4 days fishing on the Queen of Thorns I haven't seen anything other than Carb, Tuna, Kutin's Key and the occasional bit of trash.<br />
<br />
I too have been chatting with the PC's and they say that they won't dive down to empty their full fishing traps because they are afraid of the sea monster. I thought that this was just a bit of local colour until a mage cast Summon Monster on the landing stage and up popped a very large Gallapagos like lizard - probably the sea monster.<br />
<br />
That leads me to suspect that the fishing traps are real and that the gem covered fish you hear about might be trapped in one of them.<br />
<br />
So I'm now busy working my tinkering even harder to be able to make a rebrether for a look see ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Curiouser and curiouser - so far have found 3 of the reported 4 crab traps - they are close to the both prows and then back a bit where the hulls are first bridged.  Have only found crab meat or nothing at all in them so far, but I will go deep sea diving again and hope that the sea monster doesn't eat me if I unleash it somehow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Are the Fishing Traps near the landing platform on the boat in Abysmal sea? I heard a npc talk about teh traps....I was curious how to find them.<br />
So what lvl is this sea monster?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Crab traps are on the bottom of the sea floor near the front of the ship, not as far back as the landing platform - I'll post the locations when I next chcek them.  <br />
<br />
So far no one has seen the sea monster except for the mage summoned monster version so I don't think we know the level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grimsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The key that you turn in to Kutin for the Illusion Troll potion that would sell to merchants for around 57pp and Shamans could use them to make 5 and 10 dose potions from them have change today on Test Server.<br />
<br />
When you turn in the key you now get an Illusion Troll potion that is Lore and No Drop so you can only have 1 and can't sell it anymore.<br />
<br />
Look for this coming soon to a live server near you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have a 145 skill at fishing and have never gotten the key after days of fishin in abysmal sea. Fellow fishermen got several......now they are nerfin it?<br />
Why do they hate us fishermen so badly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tower</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Today at noon (CET) they changed the potion to a nodrop potion (still troll illusion), so no more selling it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Lore AND No Drop?<br />
<br />
What's the point of this change?<br />
<br />
Why go to such lengths. If they didn't want us to make money off the potion, why have it in the first place.<br />
<br />
Illusion Troll is normally a perfectly useless item especially for my main who is a chanter. The only good thing about it was the fact it could be sold.<br />
<br />
If you can no longer sell the potion there must be another reason for that item to exist? Maybe Kutin's Key and the potion you get for it is just part of a larger quest we haven't yet found?<br />
<br />
I'm still completely gutted of course. That key made me quite a bit of cash while I was able to sell it and that cash in turn was used to boost my trade skill abilities by paying for my tinkering and tailoring parts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On production or test?  Am I going to be sorry I didn't take the time to turn in the dozen or so keys I had fished up yesteray?  Ironically, I actually deleted the first few keys I had because I assumed the potion was no drop, and I didn't have much use for an illusion troll potion, so I'm not particulary upset, I expected it.  But I'll admit I liked the cash when I turned in 2 dozen keys on Sunday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Qutie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">hmm... what happens when you have a bunch in backpacks? ;(  I had 4 or 5 potions... so will they just disappear when this goes through on live servers (if it hasn't already) ?  heh... selling them for the 57pp would finance the invis potions needed to do CR in GoD.... (sighs)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tower</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Sorry about that, the change was on AB so a &quot;live&quot; server</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Justicator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yes, it's true, we have been nerfed!  You can still hold multiple keys, but the potion you get from trading in a key is now lore, no drop,  and thus it is now not sellable :(<br />
<br />
Least we got a few days to enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Later!</div></div><hr />

I'm glad I got a bunch of 5 to my shaman who made me a nice 5 dose one before the nerf.<br />
<br />
And this potion is not useless. It will allow any good character to get into Neriak, Ogguk, maybe Paineel, and the outpost in the Overthere, whch has a feew advantages, none of which will I bother to illuminate here. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only if you are agnostic and I stand by my point that to my chanter who already has Illusion: Troll in his spell book, it's not a huge amount of use is it? Certainly a lot less use than 57pp a pop was. :)<br />
<br />
BTW an illusion alone will never get you into Paineel. If you weren't born there then you have to work your little socks off in the warrens to gain enough faction to even get the key out of the guards never mind survive more than a few seconds once you exit the lift. My DEF necro alt learnt that lesson the hard way. Even my chanter with Erud Illusion and the advantages of his faction spells couldn't get past indifferent with the guards without working his faction.</div></div><hr />

:D Now there is a recipe that is sadly lacking in EQ - We've got tea, we've got beer, we've got vodka but we don't have any coffee?</div></div><hr />
