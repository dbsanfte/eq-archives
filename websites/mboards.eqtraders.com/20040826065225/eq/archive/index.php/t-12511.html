<br />
<br />
I'm new to the EQ realm only been on for 4 months or so, well I really liked the baking skill so I thought I would try for it, after consulting the EQtraders library on newbies going into trade skills and looking at all the baking choices I chose to start making fish fillets till they where triv,<br />
<br />
Next I got a fillet knife and a few other items for baking, then I proceeded to thurgading to make filleted bear and lion meat, after making that triv I chose to go for patty melts... but to my dismay of looking for cheese for a week on websites and asking people where I get cheese I couldn’t find it, plus with EQtraders recent crash it delayed me even further, <br />
But then a gleam of light, I was told by several reliable contacts that I can get cheese in SH (I should have known because cheese does come from the moon ) <br />
Well 30 mins later after checking all the merchants that liked me I still had not found the Cheese and now I was getting a little mad because I can make every other type of cheese peaty easy but I cant make the normal stuff, and to my further dismay I find out that the merchant that has the cheese doesn’t like me......... AHHHHHH :mad:,<br />
<br />
After a good yell my search for cheese continued, then I found out cheese is found in jaggerpine forest (so I guess it grows on trees then) Note: this was after EQtraders came back up and I could finally find it) but to my frustration my atlas and lack of knowledge I didn’t know where exactly jaggerpine forest was... ...<br />
<br />
Well then I took the guidance of a few trustworthy guys in pok and set off to the jaggerpine right when I got to the teleport stone thing I thought to my self I may have killed some bears before and my atlas said people from this land kill people who kill bears so I shrouded myself in invis and zoned... <br />
<br />
Well to my surprise there was a small town of what appeared to be gnolls ... after backing away from the town and seeing the gnolls cond white and yellow to me and ready to rip my head off I proceeded to find the second guy on the map using loc system (wich I did with the first one but a gnoll was standing where he’s suppose to be) <br />
<br />
And 1 hour later and with the help from the people in the zone I found out that some one activated a quest that slaughtered the whole town... ... AHHHHH... and the second guy was nowhere to be found either.... so I waited a good hour or so (basicly 2 hours in jaggerpine forest) and finally the people of the townm started to repop and I bught 20 stacks of cheese,<br />
<br />
Me and my friend had a good laugh (he couldn’t believe cheese was so hard to get and he almost died laughing when ever I said the word cheese, and he still laughs when I talk about, well since I have gotten cheese I spend my free time making patty melts,<br />
<br />
I'm a lvl 44 mage on the stromm server (I was lvl 40 when I attempted this) and I learned cheese can be found on the moon and grows on trees</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds to me like a case of bad Cheese timing. Somebody was doing the Qeynos Badge of honor quest turnin. This triggers the Gnolls to attack the village and take control of it for a while (few hours) My guess is you caught it during that time. As for Cheese JPF is the only place to get it for patty melts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spirish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So, who is the merchant in SH who sells the cheese..YOu never said.<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As far as I know there is not Cheese merchant in ShadowHaven. There is a guy who sells rennet for mature cheese but not quite the same thing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mewkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Cheese is only sold in Jagged Pine Forest. Well, the cheese used to make patty melts is only available there. I've seen other cheeses elsewhere, but those wont work for patty melts. The easiest thing that I've found to do is make an alt and park them in the room with the cheese vendor and banker. Then when I need cheese, log out, log in alt, buy cheese, put in shared bank slot, log out alt, log in main... presto cheese in bank. This is particularly useful for my Cazic Thulian Troll who isn't exactly like too much in JaggedPine.</div></div><hr />
