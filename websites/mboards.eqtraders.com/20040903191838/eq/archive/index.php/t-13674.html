<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello All,<br />
<br />
My gnome quickly bought two Haze Panther Eyes from a Bazaar Trader who was selling them for 50 plats each.  He succeeded in making two Gnomish Vanishing Devices.<br />
<br />
For maximum profit, should he just sell the two GVDs or attempt to make advanced Clockwork armor?  (Oh, who am I kidding?  He's going for the thrill of tinkering the armor. :rolleyes: )<br />
<br />
What sells better, the Clockwork Observer Breastplate or the Clockwork Shadowwalker Tunic?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cerpicio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I didn't think any of the gnome cultural armor sold well.  How many gnome plate-classes do you see?  There might be more rogues to use the shadow walker gear, but it seems like there's better gear out there.<br />
<br />
But that's just me.  I did make some plate gear for alts and friends, though.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the GVD has a wider user base.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd go for selling the GVD.   It's  useful.<br />
<br />
<br />
But if I had to make armor, I'd make Plate.<br />

Gnome Clerics are UBAH.   Invis, SoW, and self Haste (For when they get their ubah hammer).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you can use the armor yourself, attempt it. Otherwise its too risky. High failure rates on em. Youll be lucky to get one BP out of em, which will be on sale for a good while to a niche market and not sell for what you want it to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh yah, if you do make armor, dont make chain. Gnomes have 1 chain class, rogue.. and they dont need Invis, they have sneak/hide. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Laearya Lifeblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">GVD's all the way, I couldn't sell any armor to save my life when I made it...sold it all for a loss at what it even cost me to make the pieces I did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Timper Tantrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Everytime I put up a GVD it usually sells within the hour for 5k<br />
<br />
I wish i could find some eye's for 50p hahaha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If it sells real fast, rse the price. If it doesnt sell, lower it. Pretty simple way of finding a good price point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thank you all for your advice.<br />
<br />
My gnome is having too much fun tinkering, so I let him have one of the GVDs to attempt to make a Clockwork Observer Breastplate.<br />
<br />
He succeeded in making a Clockwork Watchman Breastplate for the first step in the process.<br />
<br />
Next time I get a chance to log on, my halfling is going to see if he can use the new tradeskill interface to take his brewing skill to 200 to give him a slightly decreased chance of failure in brewing some celestial tempers for the infused gears.<br />
<br />
Let's see... 15 stacks of malt, 10 stacks of short beer, 10 stacks of water, 5 stacks of yeast, and 5 stacks of casks in 5 deluxe toolboxes will make 100 combinations of Minotaur Hero's Brew.  I think I'm going to like this new interface. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Postscript:<br />
<br />
Well, my gnome couldn't resist trying to make an Clockwork Observer Breastplate.  He succeeded, so I put the remaining Gnomish Vanishing Device and the breastplate up for sale in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
The GVD sold quickly for 8,000 plats.  The breastplate started at 18,000 plats and finally sold for 10,000 plats this past weekend.  It took a few months, but I knew someone would finally appreciate the fine crafting that went into that breastplate.  :D  (Boy, I wish SOE would allow more races to wear our tinkered armor... seems like halflings, at least, should be able to squeeze into it.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kritta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">GVD, sells for 5k in less than a day<br />
Observer BP, sells for 12k about once a month<br />
SWalker BP, sells for 12k about once a month and a half<br />
<br />
 :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cubwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Is there a list of what the effects do on the Clockwork armor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">5k? You guys need to raise your prices. I can easily sell them for 9-10k (that is, when I can get haze eyes; will pay up to 2k each for them in the baz if I can find them).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kritta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">*chuckle* I also notice you're not on E'Ci. ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hmm, my view of pricing is all messed, it seems, as the Rathe has a different economy. Stuff costs more (and earns more). Dunno why.<br />

Oh yeah, poor Tart. She's parked up in ToFS, much against her will. She says hi. =)<br />

(&quot;And HEEEEEEEEELP! Lemme outta here!&quot;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Celestya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">:D Poor Tart. Tell her she only has 5 itty bitty more skill ups to go....but then who am I to say. I've only had 3 skillups left in tailoring for the past 6 months.  :boggled:</div></div><hr />

Forgive me, but why is your tinker-wench in ToFS?<br />
<br />
I checked EQTC, and all that drops there is Velium.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">She's there to xp. Not great xp, but it's quiet and everyone can use velium.<br />
<br />
And now that ToFS is a &quot;hot spot&quot;, hopefully will be a bit better.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, those last stinkin' 5 points. =P Been thinking about blowing the jar of greases I've been making and saving up, but I don't wanna be out in case I need more specific elemental cams.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dumpty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Clockwork Watchman Greaves AC 13, 10 charges of Grease Injection (18 min SOW) <br />
actually its not sow, its 40% movement or equal to run4, costing 5pp a charge to use, they are effectively worthless as sow potions also are 5pp a use for 55% movement increase and 3x the duration.  I wish the duration if nothing else was longer on them.</div></div><hr />
