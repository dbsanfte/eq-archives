As I was saying, many of you who join the channel will see me screaming &quot;Screenshotted that!&quot; and youved wondered &quot;What the heck is he doing?!&quot;. Well here is your answer!<br />
<br />
Ive compiled a large collection of screenshots of the chat in the channel. Please note that while my comments are purely comical, I have not altered the shots in anyway, nor have I taken them out of context(I swear!). <br />
<br />

So on with the show!  :twisted: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeanx Madpath</div><div class="date">04-27-2003, 05:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't been in SW.eqtraders since before I quit playing... which was a few months before I caved and started over. After making it a month and a half without touching a tradeskill (er.. a real tradeskill anyway. I maxed research awhile ago. Thanks practice points), I gave in and brought pottery to 123 and baking to 143 in one night. I also brought smithing to the mid-20s making a filleting knife, because going to bazaar to buy one would be too easy. <br />
<br />
So, I might have to start joining the channel again, though I'm afraid I might be a bit behind on things. Tell me, is everyone still making wok puns?<br />

Actually, if you look closely, he cut and pasted most of the lines individually.  :)</div></div><hr />

I'm not there even 10 minutes and I get to hear it.  :shock:   Fortunately for me, it doesn't irritate me. However I do have to say one thing: Swamp flavored Ice Cream = YUCK!!!! I've spent LOTS of time in swamp water and I know what that tastes like. YUCK!!!!!  Even WITH whipped Cream! That stuff is so foul it takes 2 glasses of port to kill the flavor (and even then I'm not sure if the flavor is gone or my taste buds don't care anymore.)</div></div><hr />

I told someone just this morning (in eqtraders chat no less LOL) that I'm almost as addicted to the channel as I am to tradeskills in general.  I KNOW that I wouldn't have the patience or strength to keep plugging away at those skills if I didn't have all my understanding friends there to poke fun and ridicule me before the combine, and to give their true feelings of happiness for me when the combine succeeds, or I get that skillup.  *much dorf lubbin for ya'll*<br />
