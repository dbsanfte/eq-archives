My harddrive had died a bit ago and I haven't been able to find the site again - could someone please post or repost the link to the site?<br />
<br />
Many thanks!</div></div><hr />

there is a free download for &quot;pop up stopper&quot; it's ok.. gets about 90% of the annoying bastards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have it load up everytime my computer turns on and go directly into EQ with no hassle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KyrosKrane</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Panicware's Pop-up Stopper myself, and while I love the program, it has one annoying side-effect that you may not expect: it will auto-close ANY new Internet Explorer window that may open, &lt;i&gt;even if it's you double-clicking the icon on your desktop!&lt;/i&gt;  So if you use it and find yourself completely unable to start IE, it's likely that you have it activated.  <br />
<br />
One time, I forgot the program running after I'd ended my browsing session and closed all the IE windows.  A friend tried to use my PC to browse the 'Net.  He was utterly befuddled when everything he tried to do to open IE resulted in zilch.   :D</div></div><hr />

Every new popup window you have to flag manually, but it's easy to remove accidental adds to the database.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doomspark Deathfire</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use CrazyBrowser's front-end that wraps around IE. It's available from www.crazybrowser.net (might be .com; not sure).<br />
<br />
It works fairly well; I've only run into one problem with it... it sometimes will close windows that you WANT open. Since it wraps around IE, it picks up all your favorites, internet settings, etc.</div></div><hr />
