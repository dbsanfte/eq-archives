<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have created a barb bst on my wifes account, which I am going to get up to my current level so I can 2 box with it.  I want to GM smithing with him, as he has some nice cultural things he can make, like the black lace stuff for himself.<br />
<br />
Now, I was thinking of doing banded until 115, and after that, doing ornate chain, cultural and possibly LDoN ringmail until the point of doing FP.<br />
<br />
Now, the question lies in that, should I just skip the midrange stuff and tackle the FP?  I have about 300 hides to turn into padding.  And then do the EVBs to 222, as they are realatively cheap to do now?<br />
<br />
Or, should I do the midrange ornate until FP, then do FP until it trivs, then do the EVBs?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance for your input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Save those paddings... 300 Paddings might get you far but not to the top of the trivial range by just doing fine plate.<br />
<br />
Here is my suggestion:<br />
Banded till it trivials<br />
LDON Chain till it trivials <br />
Then Fine plate.<br />
<br />
Now I would do this only because getting the LDON tempers has been fairly easy for me (Lots of friends that Forage). Making the highest trivial single ring item till it is trival then moving on to the 2 ring etc... This seems to me a good way to go IF:<br />
<br />
1) you can forage or get foraged the temper material<br />
2) you do not mind breaking down FS weapons or are planning on PL'ing your BST where unrefined ore drops.<br />
<br />
You need HQ ore to make the Rings, FS broken down will make HQ ore, needed to make HQ rings for the LDON stuff. Baring that you can do the restocking quests for the HQ ore vendors with the unrefined ore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't know much about the barbarian cultural stuff, but for wood elfs, it was easier, faster and cheaper to do cultural than ornate.  It actually allowed me to skip ornate completely.  I did fier'dal sewing kits until 163, and then fine plate from there.  I had about 180 leather paddings, and I finished FP with one or two left.  The best thing about FP is that if you succeed on the combine, then your cost is almost nothing.</div></div><hr />

Zara's guide man! That's all that need be said! :):D :cool: <br />
<br />
Check the Tradeskills Guide part of the message board for the link to the new 6.0 download. :)<br />
<br />
Definately do ornate into the 150's then move to FP. 300 padding won't get you as far as you hope. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Already past that level, besides, I have not picked up GoD yet, and probably won't until I am well into my 50s.<br />
<br />
Oh, and a correction, I will be doing condensed shadow arrowheads until 116 (for later use with my pally).<br />
<br />
Yes, I have seen Zera's guide, when it was 5.1.  That is some serious read time.  Not too sure I want to download the 6.0.  I'll have to give it some thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>yawp64</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Rewde!<br />
<br />
Follow Zera's guide. Or at least read it and make an informed decision to vary from it. The guide's advice is practical and well-considered. As a bonus, it's entertainingly well-written, too. <br />
<br />
If the length of it is putting you off, there are other, shorter guides available from the Home &gt; Learn A Skill &gt; Smithing page of this site.<br />
<br />
Good luck in your smithing! Remember to keep your fingers away from the hammer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/sigh  I guess I will have to break down and read it.  I did not have this kind of problem when I did it on my main.  It was simple.  I did bits, file, studs, condensed shadow arrowheads, vale sewing kits, then steel arrowheads to 188, then did some EVBs to the point I am at now, which will continue till 200.</div></div><hr />

If the thought of reading that guide makes you shiver because of it's length, then I would suggest staying away from smithing.  Getting to cultural levels is a long hard course and many hours of combines.  Either way, good luck to you on you journey.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually, with barbs, the cultural starts very low.  They have weapons they can make, which are cultural.  I did the Northman throwing axe, until I ran out of bag space, but had not hit the trivial yet.<br />
<br />
I have not followed any of the guides here, rather, I have gone off of the quick triv lists, and devised my own skill up routes from there, which have done me well so far.<br />
<br />
I appreciate the fact that everyone is refering me to Zera's guide.  I was more or less looking for input on the general route that I had outlined in the original post.<br />
<br />
I might take the LDoN chain suggestion into consideration, as I can easily get the tempers myself, and from some guildies.  Plus, I can take my BST to farm FS weapons to break down, which would minimilize the costs on making it.<br />
<br />
That being said, this looks to be the current route:<br />
<br />
condensed shadow arrowheads to 116<br />
LDoN chain to trivial<br />
FP to 188<br />
EVBs to 222<br />
sickles and cultural to 250<br />
<br />
Does that seem like a reasonable route, or are there changes that you would make?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would not do EVB's, I hate the stuff but Shadow Scream will serve you much better for skill ups... Yes Farming the Stuff is painful most of the time but less expensive than EVB's and Sickles.<br />
<br />
If you notice my skill is at 228 and I am Still working the HSM war to try to get increases from SS armor... I think however I might wait for a bit till they fix the Favorites.<br />
<br />
I will not go the Sickle route due to cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Even though I could make some of the money back doing the Shadow Scream armour, I am not too fond of the PITA I have read the farming/war manipulating to be.  The velium is easily gotten in CC, and broken down there into pieces, so I could stay until I decided to leave, then, it is just a short jaunt, port via vial of velium vapors actually, to thurg to get the other needed components for less than 20pp a combine, and, I can do the smithing there.<br />
<br />
Sickles, though expensive, can pay for themselves in 2 ways, as I see it. 1) I can try to sell them in the bazaar, individually or in EoS kit form, 2) I get GoD and use them for some nice tribute points.  Win-win situation as I see it.  But, that is just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />
