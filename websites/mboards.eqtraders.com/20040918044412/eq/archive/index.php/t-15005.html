I have had the hardest time finding the jewels for the seal to prep for my trophy.  Anyone have any reccomendations to finding the materials (gems in particular) that I need.  People in bazaar are selling jacinth for about 2k a piece and black saphires for 1k a piece and money is a little tight.  I prefer to farm my own.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually those bugs in seb were nerfed a couple months ago and their drop rate really stinks now.  Those gems seemed to have been nerfed in dungeons as well.  These gems only drop in high level zones and they are really rare drops now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tower</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I got the gems for my trohy in TM at the vampire castle, i am a paladin so i just love killing undead :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rezilaturb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sigh, I ran into the same problem. First I was very hopeful that with 250+geerlok I will make the GM trophy, but I failed. Then I needed more Jacinths and I can't even find in bazaar, guess people buy them up even for 2k per. Heh, reminds me of the times when BD used to go for 1500 in EC tunnel. Farmed Seb, but only got Black Sapphire and not a single Jacinth. Gonna try a few other places, like Kael arena and who knows what else, but this gem situation is really pathetic.</div></div><hr />
