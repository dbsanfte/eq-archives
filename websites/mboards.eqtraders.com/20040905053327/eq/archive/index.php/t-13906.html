I've been trying to find out where Taelosian wheat is found and so far i've hit a blank wall. Has anyone found it? Or has anyone done the turn in to the NPC Odrin in Abysmal as yet?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any info you might have...<br />

I think I foraged up some in Natimbi.  Hope this helps.  :&gt;<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
I now believe I bought it off of the merchant in Natimbi.  I was not on as my forager when i got it.  Sorry for the miscommunication.</div></div><hr />
