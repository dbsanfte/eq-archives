<br />
I'd like to apologise to the owners and moderators of this forum. I asked a foolish question here (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=11763) and  should have anticipated the first response I got.. ie read the faq.<br />
<br />
The person responding could have been much ruder about it (and maybe rightly so) but wasn't, so I'd like to thank them for that.<br />
<br />
I I thought that was the end of it and certainly didnt expect the firestorm that followed this exchange.<br />
<br />
I had no idea I was brushing on such a sensitive topic.<br />
<br />
This site is an awesome resource and I feel bad that it has brought so much stress to those running it. :(<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />

The decision has been made and is not likely to change.</div></div><hr />
