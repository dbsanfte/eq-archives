<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">qdmented</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would like to hear some cost quote(s) ideas for what it would cost to get some pieces and/or a full suit of imbued enchanted koada'dal mithril plate armor.  I'm looking for my 49th High Elf Cleric (still wearing newbie armor and a few guild owned imbued chain).  I have a  &quot;few&quot; imbued emeralds to donate for the process, as well as access to a &quot;few&quot; essence of shadow.<br />
<br />
Please feel free to contact me in game via Faliena or Qdmented, or send me an e-mail at qd@dmrf.net, icq 882786.<br />
<br />
Thanks all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mik 7thcav</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Uhm, the Koada Dal is for High Elves and needs Essence of Moonlight (from the mobs in Mistmoore).  The Tier'dal is for Dark Elves and needs the Essence of Shadow from Shadow men (various zones).<br />
<br />
Also, the Koada Dal that you are asking for is the NON blue diamond imbued armors (ie, the old cultural).<br />
<br />
Just making sure that you are seeking the correct pieces.<br />
<br />
Seventh Cavalry has a couple High Elf and Dark Elf smiths that I can contact to see if they are still making the old cultural.<br />
<br />
Your best bet, if seeking the old cultural, is to obtain the various parts and look for a combine, as the enchanted ore (either mithril or adamantite) is a pain to acquire and will not be cheap if supplied by the smith.<br />
<br />
Just some observations...</div></div><hr />
