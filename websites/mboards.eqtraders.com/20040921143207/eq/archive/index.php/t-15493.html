<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK....I am skill 115 at tailoring after following the path on this website. But when I check my UI, the recipes are all blank. My learned ones are blank, and new ones are blank.<br />
Is there a reason why I would have zero recipes in my UI ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maelina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Are you searching the recipe, then hitting the add button on the bottom of the UI after you learned it?  Otherwise, all UI will come up blank if no recipe is added to favorites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I recall Baking having recipes in the UI.....even though these were recipes I never did before. I never did hit add for tailoring...but how did Baking give me recipes then if I never hit add for them either, and  they were recipes I never even did.<br />
How is it supposed to work....the baking wasnt blank, just tailoring was...so it is very confusing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>scarbrowed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I believe the post from the developers mentioned 3 types of recipes: AutoLearn, CanLearn, and unlearnable. I've not checked much myself, but it could be that more baking recipes are AutoLearn, which would always show up when you search. I know at my level, most tailoring recipes are CanLearn, which means you have to succees once before it shows up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How do you get the ADD button to be highlighted? I make a combine, but the ADD button never gets highlighted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Inien of Vazaelle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You need to search for the recipe, then select it, then you can add it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>lilwan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I noticed ( and please correct me if i am wrong or it has changed) that any No Drop combines a made were not added to my success list.  <br />
<br />
I noticed this when making engraved royal velium armor.  There are a few No Drop combines along the way.<br />
<br />
<br />
hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'd expect that no drop combines are largely quest recipes.  Quest recipes, which you in general only need to succeed at once, are not added to the UI.</div></div><hr />
