That may be because of one person buying all the lower priced BDs and selling high (550pp currently) This person has almost 150 BDs up for sale right now. There are another 36 for sale on other vendors, so I'm not sure if we have a shortage or not. Could be that no one is buying at the inflated price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No shortage on my server (The Rathe). I see them for sale in the Bazaar all the time, and I find them on vendors, too, but they're not even worth buying to resell.<br />
<br />
I've got one BD I bought off a vendor several months ago, and I haven't been able to sell it in the Bazaar, even though I'm selling it for a low price. <br />

If my guild had a high-level Jeweler, I'd probably have it made into some resist gear for an alt.....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No shortage on Nameless. I have enough stacked up in the bank now that I only buy them in the bazaar when they are 250p each or lower, and that keeps my stock about even with my velium acquisition.<br />
<br />
However there is at least one guy who buys up all the small pieces of velium and resells at a higher price, and i admit to buying up underpriced BD Cultural to resell for my price so that's entirely possible that someone's doing it on your server too. Nameless has quite the cut-throat bazaar culture so I just expect to see folks making a killing on various things. That's why I say, &quot;shop early, shop often!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ambrya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">On Tribunal there is a definite shortage of BDs.<br />
<br />
It started with the vendor reset a couple months ago.  There was one vendor, in particular, who had a nearly endless supply of Blue Diamonds and I could get them for 262p with my CHA boosted as high as it would go.  Once in a while I would also see them on spell merchants in the library in PoK and in the Lighthouse in Gunthak.  Once I discovered vendor farming, there was no going back for me as far as buying them in the bazaar was concerned, since the cheapest they ever sold in the bazaar was 350p, and usually were around 400p.<br />
<br />
These days, I can go to every merchant in PoK, PoT and the adventure camps, and Gunthak, and not find more than 1 or 2 blue diamonds.  There are, at any given time, a maximum of 8 or so being sold in the bazaar, and those are being sold for 500-750p each.<br />

It is a players right to charge whatever they wish, it just really hurts my profit margin when I have to pay that.  If it means I cannot make what I want to that day, well... there is always LDON to go play in if I cannot do my trades :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, tell me about it...that sort of thing REALLY annoys me.<br />
<br />
Twice, I was in the bazaar buying acrylia, and when I search the bazaar for acrylia, I usually sort by price and work my way down the list starting with the lowest price until I have all the acrylia I need.  Well, there was one trader I bought some acrylia from, completely cleaned him out, then when I refreshed my vendor list, saw someone else had acrylia for cheaper.  By the time I got to the person selling it for cheaper, the guy I had just bought some from was there, buying the guy selling it cheaper out, and then GENEROUSLY offering to set up shop for me again.  Ok, fine, it was a fluke, right?<br />
<br />
Not even close.  Three days later, I am in the bazaar buying MORE acrylia, and just as I hit two traders back to back, that same guy is there and already buying them out.  He sends me a tell, thinking its just HILARIOUS that he's always &quot;one step ahead&quot; of me.  I sent him a rather blistering reply about the ethics of price fixing and taking advantage of tradeskillers who are hard put to afford the items they need anyway, and put him on my ignore list, refusing to buy from him ever again, even if it means paying more for my acrylia.<br />
<br />
There's a bloody good reason price fixing is illegal in most civilized places.<br />
<br />
And, BTW, someone on Tribunal is now selling BDs for 1000p each.<br />

<br />
There is a &quot;shortage&quot; on Drinal as well, but you can still get them for under 500 in the Baz.<br />
<br />
Most likely people have shifted to zones that drop things other than BD's so there are fewer that get sold to vendors.<br />
<br />
All in all EQnomics is too hard to really anaylize, so I don't usually bother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gryfalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Erm, that's not price fixing.<br />
<br />
Price fixing is when a group of sellers decide on what the selling price will be and make sure that everyone sells at that price.<br />
<br />
When a single seller finds out 'people will pay X' for an item, and sees someone selling it for 'X-Y' PP, it's good business to buy from that other person and sell for the 'Y' profit.<br />
<br />
There's nothing even remotely unethical about it, and it's stunningly common in a situation where there is a standard amount of a single good hitting the market (velium can only be farmed so quickly) and a demand for that good.<br />
<br />
Now, sending you something of a childish tell wasn't the best plan ever (good plan, make fun of your customer), but your lecture was incorrect, at least as you describe it.  If you don't think the price that HE is reselling at is correct, then farm it yourself.  But it seems both you and others keep paying it...<br />
<br />
Gryfalia</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Madbakerhobbit2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As far as BD's going, it is most definitely not a shift.  One player is simply buying them all up.  I refuse to criticize her for it, as she is taking good advantage of a situation that exists.<br />
<br />
That being said, I can refuse (and do refuse) to pay her inflated prices.  Sadly, someone is doing so, as I constantly watch her stocks fluctuate, and I have even tracked when I **think** she is logging on to buy them.... Well, two can play that game ;)<br />
<br />
Either way, I am a huge fan of the bazaar and the way prices work.  I made a lot of money on the buy low, sell high premise myself, and on many of my tradeskill items I still sell at a price that was good (teas for 12pp ea on Bristlebane) before this insane inflation set in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Footsore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">For some time now, I have been doing a considerable amount of re-selling in the bazaar. The main factor I’ve seen influencing the price cycle of BDs has been demand. I might go for a couple weeks without selling many BDs, and then suddenly I can’t keep enough of them on my mule. Each time this has happened, I’ve noted that the same person is buying most of my BDs. Of those that have responded when I’ve asked what they are working on, the answer has always been BD cultural. The few times I’ve noticed another trader buying my wares for resale has been when I’ve marked them low for a quick sale. (Which is just fine by me!)<br />
<br />
The folks on this board know better than most how many BDs it takes to raise skills going that route. It only takes one skiller to suck the market dry. I think the cycles are influenced less by the supply flow and much more by the demand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I used to be able to find BD's on vendors, but as of late...nada and I mean nada.  Go to bazaar and there you have it..500 pp to 1000 pp for one.  At first I thought they might not be dropping as much, but now I know its someone buying and reselling for profit. <br />
Good for them =) But bad for us that need them for our skillups hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ixiola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think you're right.  On Cazic-thule, I've noticed the price has creaped back up to 500+ now, with one person having well over 100 BDs at 700 ish platinum.  I refuse to pay that even if desperate.  I can still find BDs rarely on vendors (even in the bazaar!), so I just don't buy from players.  Making a reasonable profit for providing a convenience is one thing, but I think the current levels are a bit much.  )<br />
<br />
What really amazes me is people who sell normal diamonds for more than 210p.  Regular diamonds are extremely easy to find on vendors at 210p with 130 charisma.  Even worse are the people who sell store bought gems for more than vendors do!  I can only think their customers must be people who aren't aware of vendor prices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I've encountered a fair amount of arbitrage myself, and I confess that there are times when I take advantage of it, but I never do it in the Bazaar.  If I find something on a vendor that I can mark up, I'll do it, but I don't buy out Bazaar vendors and mark it up.  My answer to people cornering the market is simply not to play the (seller's) game.<br />
<br />
&quot;Farm it yourself&quot; is always a good route to take if you're a buyer.  Blue diamonds, for example, do drop from creatures, so if you need them, going somewhere and killing for them is a valid approach (and with BDs especially, don't forget that you can go places like the Plane of Hate or the Plane of Innovation, get experience for your kills, and get armor/drops that can be turned in for gems).  It's slow, but it's a lot cheaper than buying at inflated prices, you can get experience while you farm (in most cases) and if demand falls, then prices will follow.<br />
<br />
I know there are a lot of people who will complain that farming is dull, but I must respond by saying that if you don't want to spend time farming, then you need to spend money buying.  It's stinky, especially when someone sends a jerky message about being one step ahead of you, but the ultimate last laugh to that, in my eyes, is to know you were considering buying a bunch of his stuff, but instead you just got it yourself, and it's his loss.<br />

Well, for 262pp you can go to Nerandis landing and buy as many as you need.  Not sure if we are allowed in the zone yet, or what not, but the trader there at the new wayfareres camp has them for sale.  Or atleast did a week or so ago.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Footsore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">A little more of my observations as a &quot;professional&quot; NPC vendor miner:<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure &quot;cornering the market&quot; doesn't work. I buy my wares almost exclusively from NPC vendors (though I'm not above buying something from trader that is grossly under priced at the current market - it just doesn't happen often).<br />
<br />
There was a time when I would try to match other traders when they boosted their price. My experience in doing that, however, shows that sales slow down and eventually stop when the price is too high. Yes, one or two might sell at the “too high” price, but not often - certainly not often enough to justify the price. Most people seem to exercise their consumer rights and just won’t buy if the price gets too high. <br />
<br />
The “acceptable” price does change over time – sometimes higher, sometimes lower – for BDs. When no one is skilling up on BD items, I’ve seen the “acceptable” price drop briefly to 300. Probably lower, but I just stopped mining when they wouldn’t sell at 300. I'm not wasting my valuable inventory slots on something that has a mark-up that low. Not when I can sell other stuff consistently at 500% mark-up. <br />
<br />
I’ve never seen them sell fast at higher than 500 (on Zeb). When I’m pricing a regular supply at lower prices, the person(s) trying to corner the market inevitably ends up dropping their prices. (I've even had one of these folks ask me if I wanted to buy their entire stock at half what they were asking in trader - was still too high though.)<br />
<br />
The laws of supply and demand are obviously at work, but I’m still sure that demand is the dominant force. Don’t buy at the higher prices and they WILL come down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Taushar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Problem with farming for BD is that they nerfed a few places where BD used to drop a lot, for example in Seb Guard camp. It seems that one of those plat selling companies had a couple of high end characters camping those camps 24x7, probably in shifts, so they decided to make the camp not drop BD at all. This is what I heard not what I have seen so take it as is. However, that camp, along with couple of other camps, were the major sources for BD and they nerfed it, I can see why the supply may have dried up.<br />
<br />
Taushar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kaysha Soulsinger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'm not sure if that's the cause. In the first year of PoP, there was a huge influx of Blue Diamonds and Diamonds, as they dropped plenty in the lower Planes. The initial rush was easily soaked up by a parched crowd, thirsty for them. As they got quenched, more and more remained on the market and prices fell.<br />
<br />
With LDoN, many people shifted their hunting grounds to areas that didn't only provide exp, but also fun. Furthermore, in that year a pretty large population also moved from the lower level Planes into the higher ones, only rushing their alts through the lower level ones. I remember that Plane of Nightmare had a population of 40+ around the clock a year ago. Last few times I went there recently, there was hardly anyone. The same counts for other Planes. And I don't have the impression that Blue Diamonds drop as much in the higher Planes, they are replaced by other money drops.<br />
<br />
A third aspect might be that people complained that Blue Diamonds were too common and that SOE nerfed the overall droprate of those gems - but I doubt they would tell us, if they did this.<br />
<br />
As a result of the well drying up, the amount for sale drops and thereby the price goes up. This is clearly visible on Lanys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>FeroceFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Bazaar price for BD's on Firiona Vie is less than the vendor price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ixiola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Alchemy, my guess is you got lucky, as someone had apparently sold several stacks of BDs to a vendor there.  On a lark I checked in that zone on my server last night and found nothing, as I had suspected.  As far as I know, BDs are a dropped gem only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>qralt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Yeah one guy is attempting to keep the market cornered on BD's.  Fortunately a small trickle of BD's are comming in so that I get them 1 or 2 at a time for under 500pp.  Time consuming, but less so than farming them.<br />
<br />
I used to find BD's on vendors all the time and all over the place.  Esp on the magus in adventure camps.  But no longer!  Although adventure groups will usually let me buy the gem from the group, I never find them in the camps.  I refuse to try to mine that merchant though.  Way too many folks selling stuff there at all hours to safely mine it.<br />
<br />
I actually had stopped picking up BD's off merchants because they were so easy to buy in the Bazaar in quantity.  Wish I had stocked up at the time, I blew through my last stack and have been slowly building them back.<br />
<br />
As far as buying low and selling high?  It's all fair.  If the market will support it, why shouldn't you buy it and use your knowledge to profit.  I've made more money this way than any other way in EQ.</div></div><hr />

I did that too &gt;&lt;  I had 3 stacks of BDs, a stack of Celestial Tempers, and a stack and a half of infused brellium - basically 110 blue diamonds in one form or another.  There were tons more available - in the bazaar for 240-260pp (yes, less than vendors sell itfor), and all over the place on vendors.  So I stopped buying, figuring I had enough cash tied up in BDs.<br />
<br />
Soo wish I had those BDs now lol, either to use or resell for a hefty profit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>oerin trubble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I've noticed the prices rising and wondered if they had been nerfed back or cash hogs buying them up.<br />
Even still at 300 - 500 pp is expensive.<br />
But they used to be 1800 - 2200 pp<br />
anytime i had a bit of cash and saw one or two for 2k or less i'd buy and play the diamond market, selling for 2200.<br />
10% profit wasn't unreasonable and at the time a handful of gems cost all the cash i had.<br />
Then came the planes and the bottom dropped out of the BD market. I saw 4 at 1800 and grabbed them quick. Next day BDs were selling for 1600, and every day a little less till they stabalized at about 300. I crushed them into powder and took up smithing.<br />
<br />
I'm getting curious.<br />
At one point today there was ONE BD in the bazaar. It was going for 399pp. A bit later there were 8 total on 3 vendors, one had 6 the other 2 had 1 each ranging in price from 350 to 499pp.<br />
I made a quick tour of the LDON merchants and zero BDs for sale.<br />
Was in a group last night and 2 dropped so they haven't dried up.<br />
<br />
So what's going on? Either some guilds are on a big resist gear binge, or cultural smithing frenzy. Or perhaps in a form of money laundering some that became cash rich with the recent exploits are diversifying to hide their coin.<br />
Buy em cheap, hold em till the price rises and sell em off slowly for a tidy profit.<br />
<br />
If you see these or some other item on a bazaar mule with a huge quantity at an outrageous price it's one of 2 things. Either a guild bank holding mule with no real intent of selling them, or some greedy bastage with more pp than morals who can afford to hold them till someone else with more pp than sense is willing to buy them.<br />
<br />
Hold out and the prices will come back down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Cedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">There may have been a shortage on Drinal before.  But not any more.

You are forgetting pottery and tailoring.  One of my GM skills is Tailoring, and I honestly go through as many of these as I can find on BB for less than 500p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Dawnlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">/agree Kaysha whole-heartedly.  For the longest time I bought them all from vendors and saved them, knowing I'd need them for cultural smithing and tailoring on my halfling druid as well.  After I got to 5 stacks I stopped.  Now I've ran through all those, and can no longer get a stack or two a day from vendors in PoK/PoTranq.  Ever since LDoN came out people aren't farming PoP zones anymore and LDoN drop rate on BDs is terrible.  On Fennin I've came to the conclusion that it's this combined with the people that buy from vendors just to TRY to resale for 500-600pp each.  Makes me sick really =/  I refuse to pay that much from people in the bazaar.  <br />
<br />
I also hate the way they nerfed vendor shopping a few months back.  Everyone knows what I mean, used to you could buy cheap stuff off vendors and open up those 10 hidden slots of merchandise to see if anything useful was there.  Now what you see is what you get.  I miss finding hidden stuff =(</div></div><hr />

At level 65, they drop frequently in LDoN adventures, and are fairly common in LoY zones.   In one adventure last night, I counted 6 Blue Diamond drops.   I've been known to farm 2 or 3 in some LoY zones. <br />
