40 stacks of heady kiolas and 31 stacks of silk swatches.<br />
not one item to show for it. and yes I used the pattern.<br />
<br />
I have a skill of 153 in tailoring so I think I should have made at least some of the items. Made the heady kiolas and the silk swatches tonight. Even made some of wu's fighting armor. As it is for my monk I am not that mad as I can get the stuff easy.<br />

My main concern is that the trivial has changed. If it has not then I would have to say I have been<br />

Something's seriously screwed up if that's what happened... and last I recall the trivial for cured silk was around 60 or so...<br />
Even if they did raise the trivial to 250 (Yeah right.. we wish), you'd still have made at least  a few out of 800 combines since there's still a 5% chance of succeeding a combine even with 0 skill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cured silk trivials have NOT changed as of last week.  I zipped right through them with some of the silks i had stored up from my teenage days in EK (good times :) ).  It seems really odd that you had a zillion or so failures on such a trivial item for you.<br />
<br />
Also, not to hijack this thread or anything, but has anyone else had trouble logging on to their EZ board account?  I tried just a minute ago, and it refused me - repeatedly.  Oh well, didn't have many posts under that one anyway :)<br />
