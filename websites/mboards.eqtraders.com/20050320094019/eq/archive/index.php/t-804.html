I have recently started receiving &quot;undeliverable&quot; type emails.  I have checked, and the originals are NOT in my sent folder, though I suppose that could be misleading.  Why am I asking here?  one of them was undeliverable to eq2news@stratics.com.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jessamyn Sunweaver</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's very possible you may have a virus...<br />
<br />
Number one question, did you recently send anything to any of the people who you are receiving the undeliverable messages from? If not, then I'd start to worry right there. Also check your address book and see if those people are listed there.<br />
<br />
Second, what email program are you using? I know Outlook Express has a habit of saving email addresses of everyone you send email to. Which means they end up in your address book.<br />
<br />
How email viruses work is they tend to go through your address book and do a mass mailing to everyone there. So basically, your friends, family, and everyone you know gets a copy of the virus, courtesy of you =(<br />
<br />
definitely may want to Update your virus definitions and run a full virus scan on your system. And if you don't have a virus scanner....get one! Every computer should have one installed, or around so it can be installed when needed (least IMHO).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heartsong_Steelsoul</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Netscape for email, and I've never sent any email that I know of to the people the undeliverables were sent to.  I have about five emails in my address book, since I rarely use it, and netscape DOESN'T save them.  I did use Outlook for a short time, but given the one I mentioned (the eq2news) would be very recent and that was some time ago, I would imagine it's not running through that, assuming that the virus could run without my starting the software.<br />
<br />
I have, um, *ponders* I think it was AVG, the freeware one the House Ogre recommended, and it updates itself.  I'll make sure I rerun it tonight, but I have this sinking feeling it's NOT my computer, so I can't fix it that easily.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the advice, though. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lothay</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thing to know about e-mail virii - <br />
<br />
They often use someone else's e-mail address to delay detection. <br />
<br />
Example: <br />
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Infected user a victim@someplace.org has an e-mail virus.  <br />
&lt;li&gt;His computer sends out 2,000 copies of itself, but changes the From: field in all the copies to some address victim has in his address book. Maybe yours. <br />
&lt;li&gt;2,000 recipients blame &lt;b&gt;you&lt;/b&gt; for sending them a virus, or &lt;b&gt;you&lt;/b&gt; get all the bounce messages.&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
<br />
The best thing you can do is to ensure that &lt;b&gt;YOU&lt;/b&gt; have an up to date virus scanner and firewall installed on your computer, and get everyone with whom you exchange e-mail to &lt;strong&gt;do the same thing&lt;/strong&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyrdlan</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you use Netscape the odds are very very low you actually have a virus.  Most likely someone that has YOU in their OUTLOOK addressbook has a virus.<br />
<br />
<br />
Welp, fess up. Who out there has Heartsong and EQStratics news BOTH in their Outlook address book.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heartsong, if you post the FULL headers from the emails that bounce back to you, we can very likely track down who actually sent the email, or at least rough idea of their description.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also posted this over on the PoM board I moderate, but I imagine even fewer people there have my email...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats the person with the virus<br />
<br />
<br />
I have to deal with this weekly as my site get flooded this person and others. I have a list of 85 people who have or had a virus on thier system that have hit my site and the one listed above is on my list.<br />
<br />
send an e-mail to abuse@rnc.com with the header that you posted with the subject line VIRUS SPAM DETECTED from (24-148-68-228.na.21stcentury.net [24.148.68.228])<br />
<br />
They will inform the person and either a remove thier cable access untill they get it fixed or b turn on virus detection for thier mail servers.<br />
<br />
or if the person with IP Addy 24.148.68.228 happens to read this board then they can fix it before then :)</div></div><hr />
