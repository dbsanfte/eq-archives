<br />
I'd love to go, but it was a financial choice between the trip and a new computer. The new computer won a bittersweet victory.  :?</div></div><hr />

I'll be in the middle of my last trimester of college (YAY!  :D  :!: ) and I work a full time job (Resident Assistant for the school) as well as a part time floor manager at another school's dinning hall so I can go. If there is another one in the New England area I'll be going to that one, and hoping to meet a lot of people for here. But whoever goes be safe and have fun!</div></div><hr />

I live in Phoenix and we could drive up there. We have EQ friends flying out from West Virginia to stay with us that weekend and thought it might be fun until we found out it is $ 100.00 per person and last 3 days. Can't do the 3 days :( and the 100.00 on top of hotel etc... gotta pass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for being 3 days, well, I looked at the schedule and most everything happens on Saturday so if  you didnt think the $89 / $100 was too much too spend for that you could probably drive down on Saturday early and stay the night that nite - just a suggestion :)<br />

I'll definitely need a break by then, since I intend to have my new site up by that weekend (hopefully Fan Faire won't require any complex motor skills as I will have cropped hundreds of risque photos and drawn a ton of comics and illustrations by then... I'll be lucky to still have hands).  I don't quite know how I'm going to swing everything, financially, but the airline tickets are paid for and I've pre-registered, so I'm sure I'll manage the rest somehow.</div></div><hr />
