<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thicket Tundrabog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been quad-kiting extensivelyl in Halls of Honor, and get a lot of Hero Meat. I bake these into Hero Sandwiches which are one of the best stat foods available. I keep what I need and have the rest on my Bazaar mule.<br />
<br />
I checked out a few sources. It seems that 70pp is considered a fair price per sandwich. I check the Povar board... There are 3 - 4 sellers all priced at 140 - 150 pp each. One trader is selling for 250 pp each.<br />
<br />
*Shrug*. I don't usually like getting into an undercutting battle, but who would buy Hero Sandwiches at 140 pp or more? I put my price at 100 pp each.<br />
<br />
After a week, I've only sold 9 sandwiches out of 100 (all sold to one person). I expected the other traders to drop their prices, but nope... they are still 140 - 150 pp and one die-hard is still at 250 pp.<br />
<br />
I think I'm going to drop my price to 70 pp each. I've got enough hero meat for at least another 100 sandwiches.<br />
<br />
What the heck is the point of having a bunch of traders keeping prices artificially high, when people won't buy at those high prices?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frerin the Smith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you are mistaken that people won't or don't buy them for that price.  Yes, to buy them for stat food it is a phenomonally high price, but to buy them to complete the Aid Grimel quest... well, by the time they need to make the party platter, they have already invested a ton of time and plat, so what is a few hundred more plat to not have to go hunt the meat yourself?<br />
<br />
It's like hurricane temper.  I would never buy it for 5k to make hurricane armour from, but they sell for that much to people doing the Aid Grimel quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The one thing you need to consider, is you may be pricing these against something like MTPs.  These items are very low in price.  The Hero Sandwiches do not sell to this same market.  Hero Sandwiches are bought by people who force feed.  These people do not buy as many as say the MTPs, that many do not bother to keep around by forcefeeding.  <br />
<br />
In short, lowering your price will not force them to sell faster.  They sell slowly because of the nature of the food, they are not considered a &quot;consumable&quot; product, and thus the demand is diminished a ton.  I have tested this with other spendy foods, and they sell as fast at 500 as they do at 50, its a matter of use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Serenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On the Tribunal I've been selling them at 300pp each for several months now (I will pay up to 100pp for the meat, as I can not hunt in HoH).   I started lower, and actually raised my price to match another seller.  I've noticed that usually someone will buy 30 or 40 from me at once, and sometimes my entire inventory gets wiped out in one or two nights.  Other times I can sit on them for a couple weeks without a sale.   I always sell out though.  It helps that my merchant is in for all but about 4 hours per day, seven days a week, and I'm usually the only seller.  If I saw someone selling them at 70pp I'd buy them all and drop them on my merchant, but that's just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I also quad in HoH and make sandwiches to sell.  I price them at 150 and they sell very fast.  I would price them higher, but my husband likes 150.  They are one of the best foods in game and worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Agreed, it's a totally different market from MTPs. The people I know who use sandwiches make them last a lot longer than the average player makes my MTPs last due to rigorous forcefeeding. Half a stack can last them for months. The meat is perhaps not too difficult to get but it is more effort than picnics, the product is used by higher levels than picnics, and they buy less volume but make it last longer. I'd call the MTPs a common product but hero sandwiches a specialty product. It'll sell a good deal slower but at a higher price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Liandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Normal price on VS is 200-250 each.  I put a stack up at 175 each and it sold within minutes.</div></div><hr />
