Hey, Denmom, feel free to ask us users for help in running these boards and other things.  That might help you feel less burned out.<br />
<br />
My question is:  Are there any programs or tricks you can use to move items from one container to another and combine them?  Even if it violates the end user agreement, I would consider it!  I spent hours last night just making heady kiola's for tailoring, and it sure was a pain.  I'm hoping there is some way to speed up the process. <br />
<br />
All I can really now do is to move all the containers so they are next to each other, and organize my inventory to make searching for components quick. <br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

EQTC considers the use of macro programs cheating.<br />
<br />
EQTC will not allow the naming of any macro programs on these boards, nor specific instructions on how to use existing macro programs.<br />
<br />
What we will allow is discussion of this issue.  If you follow the rules above, and the rules for all forums, you can talk about it all you want.</div></div><hr />

4) No it doesn't matter whether it violates the EULA anyway unless you are willing to sue.<br />

Using google you should find what you want pretty quick.  I'm not going to tell you what to look for though, out of respect for Ngreth's rules and wishes.<br />

<br />
PS I just looked myself and it's harder to find the program on google than I thought if you don't already know the name.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It appears to me if you are at the monitor actively playing the game macroing devices if they don't interfere with the software are ok. <br />
<br />
Anything if it gives you an unfair advantage over your fellow players is cheating. And rightly so. Hence a viable skillup route for fletchers was laid to waste due to cheaters. A tradeskill with a very small market and low amount of profits to be had was made more expensive to skill up.<br />
Cheaters ruin multi player games.<br />

&quot;FEAR THE BIG BROTHER, OCTOBER 9, 2000 <br />
Source: Everquest General Discussion Forums.<br />
<br />
VI is slowly turning into big brother. They are starting to seep into every faccet of any gamer's life. Before I go any farther I like Everquest. It is a good game and I enjoy it much. The problem is that it is hard to just ignore some of the things that Verant does that seems rather irrational and facist thinking. A good example is the recent banning of Mystere. First off it was fiction which basically means that it has no real relevance to the real world. Sure, they story might be twisted and demented but just because you don't like what someone wrote about this game doesn't mean you ban them. That is like someone giving a bad review and making it so they can't play anymore games that you make. <br />
To me that sound kind of ridiculous but oh well. The other example is EQ Macros. It is a very cheezy program that basically cheats. If people want to cheat that is thier business. If you ban EQMacros you might as well ban twinking. Twinking is a form of cheating so why not follow suit and ban all the twinkers. I think Verant thinks that it means well. They think it makes sense to ban somone who wrote a story about the game that is a little lude or someone wrote a program that makes the game easier so they force to close down the site. Instead of hiding behind lawyers and PR tatics they should just come out and explain thier motives. As consumer I believe we have a little right as to why the company does certain things that affects a fellow consumer. I maybe ranting but I am shocked at VI's actions lately. <br />
<br />
Right now they are ruling this game with an iron fist that makes it impossible to do what you believe is right. <br />
<br />
Abashi then commented on the players issue of cheating: <br />
<br />
No, it's the business of everyone playing the game. One of the reasons some people play MMOGs is for the competitive aspect. That aspect means nothing if people are able to gain a competitive advantage through means not available to other players. <br />
<br />
Single player games contain cheats because it is truly only the players business in that case. Massively multiplayer games have to get everyone playing by the same set of rules for them to be successful. <br />
<br />
If cheating were truly only the business of the person cheating, people wouldn't get worried about things such as dupe bugs, ebayers, showeq users, or perceived favoritism from the GM staff. It's obviously something that everyone is concerned about. <br />

CLARIFYING MACROING, MAY 29, 2000 <br />
Source: Everquest Gameplay Forums.<br />
<br />
Also, such macro programs assist disabled people who can't easily work around the limited interface of many such programs. I know you don't intend to limit these people, but that is what you would be doing. What if someone came up with an interface that responded to voice commands to play EQ because they were limited on what they can accomplish with a mouse? You want to ban such people from your game. <br />
It is absolutely not our intent to limit the access of disabled people to the game. The suggestion and subsequent elevating of this concern is misdirection of the issue at hand. There is no hidden oppresive meaning in the original or subsequent statements. <br />
<br />
After thinking about the wording for a while, here's some wording that might be less open to misinterpretation: <br />
<br />
In reference to &quot;macroing&quot;, we're opposed to any software, device, or contraption, used by a player to perform tasks in-game while not at the computer. This is considered cheating. <br />
<br />
I think that this wording should substantially eliminate the concerns of the disabled or those with impaired dexterity. It looks like it should also address the specific device (dunking bird, solenoid actived keyboard depresser, etc.) questions that people have mentioned. <br />

THIRD PARTY PROGAMS ARE NOT TOLERATED, MAY 27, 2000 <br />
Source: Everquest Gameplay Forum.<br />
<br />
Hello all, <br />
This is just a friendly reminder that using 3rd party programs that somehow provide you an in-game advantage over those that do not use them is not allowed per your license agreement. <br />
<br />
In light of news of some new programs of this type coming on the market, we just wanted to let you know that we will vigorously investigate these issues as they come to our attention. Anyone found to be using such a program (macro programs, packet sniffers, etc.) will be immediately and permanently banned from EverQuest. <br />
<br />
Please, let's play fair. <br />
<br />
Is a program like roger wilco (a way to talk to friends over the inet while playing a game) considered a cheat program? I hope not, because i use my PHONE to talk to my friends, or is that considered an unfair advantage as well?? Can i be banned for using AT&amp;T??? <br />
<br />
No, Roger Wilco is not included in the definition. It does not interact with the EQClient, nor does it provide an advantage (beyond what a phone could do), so we don't have a problem with it. <br />
<br />
I want a yes/no answer. I play a bard. I use a macro program to make song twisting easier. This is mainly for downtime in groups (during fighting normally requires a very active twist). I am never away from my computer while using this macro. <br />
<br />
Are you going to ban me?<br />
<br />
If we catch you, yes. <br />
<br />
If macro programs are illegal, does that also include setting up a joystick (MS sidewinder is a popular one) on turbo and leaving it on overnight to raise a skill like sense heading, mend, instill doubt, etc. ? <br />
<br />
Yes, this is included in the definition of a 3rd party program. <br />
<br />

(In a game that was originally written for a much earlier version of DirectX, it's a lot more work than many would think.) Soon, it will behave in a manner similar to other applications that support both full-screen and windowed mode and can be toggled back and forth. As a part of this change, the account bans related to the use of third-party EverQuest windowing applications have already been reversed. <br />
<br />
<br />
I give em a month before macros arent a violation of the EULA, and a ton of 'omg we are so sorry' ban reversals.<br />
<br />
<br />
I, however, am still miffed at other bannings, namely the ones based around blaming the player for horrendous coding.  Much like banning you from a message board for noticing my sig is bad, and telling me how to change it.</div></div><hr />
