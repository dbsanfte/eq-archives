Hey all, <br />
<br />
First time posting as I have just recently began my expedition on tinkering. Love my gnome and have always wanted to be a tinkerer. <br />
<br />
Got a question though. I am currently at a skill of 122 after doing glove combines and am about to start on Geerlok Brewing Devices. I plan on farming a large quantity of porous mineral blocks in the area of roughly 500ish over the next week or so. My question is: <br />
<br />
With roughly 500 combines starting at a skill of 122 with a 251 int, bout how high do you think that will take me. Am I going to be potentially looking at maxing out Geerloks? so long as I don't hit on a stretch of 100-200 combines for 1 pt? Just kinda curious. <br />
<br />
I plan on doing other combines in there just so my trader can open up his market of sellable items ( ie...other geerloks, a few happy dragons, meteorlogical rockets, spyglasses, collapsables, etc etc ) but I plan on skilling up major using these Brewing Devices. I've also got about 3-4 backpacks full of the belts of leathery fungus which I'll use after farming should I not hit that 215 number. I've been having some good luck. I went from 50 - 122 last night in about 2 hrs using about 1.2kpp or so. <br />
<br />
Great site, have been reading over it thoroughly the past few days. Thanks! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A good average for skillups is 1 skill up in 20 combines. It's a good benchmark and many people believe this to be a consistant average. With 500 blocks using the 1 in 20 ratio you can expect 25 skill ups on the average. I will give this advise however, the RNG (Random Number Generator) can be streaky. It's also not unusual to go 100-200+ combines on a skill point a few(or a dozen) times on the path to 250.<br />
<br />
just remember the RNG is random your personal results will vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Smyrt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's very streaky. It took me over 60 combines to go from 234 to 235 last week, then it only took one more combine to go to 236.<br />
<br />
Regarding PMBs, good luck on the farming and may the RNG be kind to you. I believe the Netherbians are on a 20-minute timer but there were a couple of times when I could have sworn they all repopped as soon as I killed the last one. As I recall I was averaging about 10 PMBs per hour, but that was a while ago.<br />
<br />
Also, the PMBs don't stack so make sure you have plenty of bag space.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sindace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm guessing that 500 pmbs will take you to around 160 or so.  I averaged probably 15 combines per skillup until the 180s then it seemed to double from there on in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You might want to consider the newly found Flame Bolt recipe.<br />
<br />
See:  http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=13421<br />
<br />
For some discussion.  At 122, it'll be expensive (you'll fail a lot), but you might want to do some of the other combines to boost yourself a little higher and save some of the PMBs for post-195 skillups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fulminate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I guess I was lucky.  I averaged 1 up per 12 5/6 combines from 148 to 215. (860 combines, 67 ups)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ceno65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well since servers are down, parsed my gnomes logs.  1590 combines to get from 50-250<br />
<br />
less than 8 combines per skill up</div></div><hr />
