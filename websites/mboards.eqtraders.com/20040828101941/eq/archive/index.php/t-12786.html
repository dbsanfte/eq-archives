<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dalur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anybody seem to have problems with these?  I seem to fail more than I succeed on these overall.<br />
<br />
I have 250 pottery, with GM pottery trophy, wis of 280 (not that wis matters for this anymore).<br />
<br />
The other day I bought 6 metallic liquids and 3 raw diamonds and 3 shards of stone and had the diamonds imbued and then went to make shields and failed all 3.<br />
<br />
Considering the metallic liquids go for about 3500 to 4k each, I lost a ton of PP there.<br />
<br />
Anybody else noticing that things just seem to be way to high on the failure rate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ixiola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm 2 for 2 on these (at effective max skill).  But I think I got lucky.  That, and the combines were for fellow guildies not myself, so Brell was blessing my generous combines.  I'm fully expecting to fail several times when I get around to making myself a shield.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">3 for 3 at 244-246+Geerlok</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ferrix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">These things are wierdo for me.<br />
<br />
First 4 or so I failed.  I was SO ticked.<br />
<br />
Then I have made about 26 of my last 30 attempts.<br />
<br />
Which makes me rather happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kahmon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm about 80% overall out of about 30 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fyste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">250 skill potter with GM trophy<br />
<br />
I failed the first two, the made the next two... so I'm exactly 50 / 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bearcaller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">240 + 5% so effective 252....<br />
<br />
I've gone 6/7 I think.....I know I've only had one failure so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've only failed one out of 10 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>StarrsongEverlost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For the first few months I was making these I got completely spoiled because I only failed about 1 in 10 (at 250 skill and with trophy).  Sometime before Christmas I had a huge run of fails (6 in a row!).  I was in shock!  I thought I was bugged or there had been some horrible nerf.  I even checked my skills box to make sure it still showed me at 250! hehe<br />
<br />
Since that bad streak, my fails to success rate has been about 1 in 4.  I don't know if I was just extremely lucky in the months prior to that, or if there was some nerf-age.  I did raise my normal price from 12kp to 15kp to make up the difference.  They still sell like hotcakes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>EQDal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">At 250 + trophy, Ive gone 6 for 7.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Iagoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just adding info.  With 240 or better skill and geerlock I've made 9 of 13 which is about 70%.<br />
<br />
Just adding up numbers here:<br />
Iagoe 9/13<br />
EQDal 6/7<br />
Starsong 13/21 (estimated from post)<br />
Tinile 9/10<br />
Bearcaller 6/7<br />

Rorgg 3/3<br />
Ixiola 2/2<br />
Dalur 0/3<br />

Total is 100 successes of 134 tries or approx 75%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sunfire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So far I've had 3 fails in 8 combines - the last one was really painful as I bought all the components except the stone shard for a total loss of about 12kpp :(.  These only sell for 18-19k on RN so it takes me 2 successes to make up for 1 failure at that rate just to break even (although sometimes I get Liquid dops which helps).<br />
<br />
Oh - I have 250 skill + trophy and 280 WIS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dalur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well add 2 more failures as of last night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've succeeded 5 in 7, I think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lazurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Myself I'm at a poor 2 from 5 so only 40% success rate.<br />
<br />
I've been at 246 + Trophy for all those combines and have 295 wisdom these days when skilling.<br />
<br />
On Xegony you are lucky to get a metallic liquid for 6k thanks to the price gougers and I know a potter who sells his shields at 18k.<br />
<br />
I don't have much luck on the ML liquids which I tend to farm as I can xp at the same time and hope my combine luck will increase soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Umatilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">3-for-3 on shields<br />
6-for-6 on planar combines overall.<br />
<br />
Still keeping wisdom at 255.<br />
<br />
Gave away a lot of my strength items off my GM smith and have a LOT more failures on high-end stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sabine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have never failed a PoP pottery combine (it is odd indeed).<br />
<br />
2 for 2 on shields of valor<br />
2 for 2 on justice gavel<br />
4 for 4 on incence burners of ro<br />
4 for 4 on shackles of torment</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sunfire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">These just got ridiculously nerfed - this isnt the RNG I've heard this from multiple people in the last two weeks.  The drop rate on metallic liquids was reduced so prices have shot up to 6000-8000pp average and the difficulty was increased - I have now failed more than 50% of the time (4/9) since these changes meaning I'll never even break even much less profit on these anymore.  FU SoE thats all I have to say.  I hope no one ever plays EQII, I hope something better than EQ finally comes along and no one ever goes back to another SOE product again ARGGGHHHH SOOOO MADDDDDDDDD - I hope someone finally realizes it isnt a crime to reward people who invest hundreds of hours doing tradeskills in your game with a little profit. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Sunfire... try decaffinated.  The RNG is the RNG.. over large batches of combines, you should come out roughly with the average success rate.. which probably is around 70-75% (with a 295 trivial.... 335 trivial seems to be a 50% rate).  In smaller batches, you're rate will vary a lot, as a single fail is a much larger percentage of the total.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Pointee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've had pretty good luck with elemental pottery and especially valor shields.<br />
<br />
I have only failed 2 out of 15 valor shields. Only recipe I've had problems with are the Rod of Storms. 0 for 2 on those guys. But I was very lucky and found the 2 stormwatchers stones on a vendor in PoT.<br />
<br />
Liquids are indeed pretty rare now-a-days. I camped LC in Valor for around 10 hours and got 1 liquid for my efforts. I have bought the other 29 liquids I have used at 3k each. Bazaar prices are usually 4-7k. I just wait til I see someone /ooc in Pok selling liquid and offer them 3k. I've only been turned down once. Large shards of stone I find constantly on PoT vendors. <br />
<br />
I think I enjoy pottery the most out of all tradeskills. It's probably because I've been studying pottery in RL for 5 years. <br />
<br />
Relax Sunfire, no one is out to get you :) You've simply had a streak of bad tradeskill luck. It happens......quite frequently in fact.....keep throwing things on the wheel, I think in the long run you'll have quite a few successes.</div></div><hr />
