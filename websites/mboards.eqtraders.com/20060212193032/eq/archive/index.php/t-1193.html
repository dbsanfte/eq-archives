My big day on EQ is allways Sunday's Aussie time 9am - 5pm <br />
This roughly equates to Saturday 4pm - 12am LA time and 7pm - 3am NY time.<br />

I am a solo type person so anytime im ready to go do something : )<br />
<br />
Hope we can all get together one time soon : )<br />
<br />
Also if you need anything farmed leave a reply here you will be amazed how fast I get farmed items I have a real knack for farming : )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenidina</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Venril Sathir's Remains are easy, find out who has VS, when he died, and the remains will spawn 12-18 hours later on.  When I did VSR for my druid epic I think we had 6 groups, when I did VSR for my Ranger epic we had 2 groups, and the 2 groups were overkill because of new weapons and AA skills, etc.  With the new POP levels and AA you can easily do Faydedar with 1-2 good groups (I know people who did it with 2 groups pre-pop)<br />
<br />
Good luck on your epic.  If you need another druid to help out, send me a tell, wouldn't mind smacking Faydedar around some more.</div></div><hr />
