I'm not going into details, as I've already posted it to several threads, including one tonight (12/21/03), but do picnics, in Shadowhaven, and buy the foraged/farmed ingredients in the Bazaar.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aftering doing Mistletoe Sickles for a goodly bit of my smithing skillups, I utterly and absolutely refused to do any baking combines that would take lots of subcombines.  I ended up hitting 250 baking without doing a single MTP or HMP, though it cost me far, far more than either would have.<br />
<br />
My solution was to vendor mine the heck out of PoK and (to a lesser extent) PoT and Shadow Haven.  For about one or two months before I decided to break 200, I saved up every single bakable planar bit I could find.  Once I started skilling, I'd bake just about anything.  I ended up with about 18 or 20 baking utensils (including geerlok and collapsible spit), five bags of bakable parts, and a MUCH simpler skillup route.<br />
<br />
Planar recipes are far simpler than picnics or pies.  The second-worst of them (justice fruit pies) only has three subcombines: two celestial essence and one clump of dough.  Some of them, like Vann toes, don't have any subcombines at all; you just buy two ingredients and toss them in the oven or spit with your toes.<br />
<br />
Save your hero parts until you hit skill 230 or so.  The hero sandwiches sell very well indeed -- I was able to price them at 150pp each and the buyers never blinked.  At 230 skill, you balance your need for skillups with your desire for success -- not to mention that that this is the one planar recipe that really does have a whole bunch of subcombines.<br />
<br />
At the time, I didn't have much planar access either.  Almost none of my ingredients were farmed directly; I just auctioned to buy them in PoK when I could; I mined them off vendors; and I bought up the cheaper items in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Hope this gives you a few ideas. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did mostly PoP combines over 200 as well.  I mostly found mine in bazaar and would buy when the price was good.  &lt;3 Boar chops! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">over 1600 picnics here.  they work and a run of 200 is quicker than anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">while picnics do have 8 subcombines, keep in mind that most subcombines yield 10 items meaning you just need to combine them twice per stack. i do them in runs of 60 (cuz marmalade sandwiches make 12 /boggle), still, and i don't think they're that bad.<br />
<br />
i used about half each jaggedpine &amp; picnics to get to 250. <br />
<br />
that said... now that planar recipes are available, i would probably go that route instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lone_War</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you are on a server with a few planier guilds ignore the planier stuff unless you have DEEP pockets.<br />
<br />
Most planier foods will run ~30pp per combine attempt.<br />
MTPs (Not counting 1 brownie part per 100 attempts) runs about 30pp per 20 attempts.<br />
<br />
And the nice thing is, is set up for 100 combines for MTPs takes about 45 minutes, whereas finding the same number of combine attempts using planier items can take DAYS in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
And there are only 3 items that are not merchant bought for MTPs, Fruit, Vegetables, and Brownie parts. Fruits and vegetables can be bought in almost unlimited quanity in bazaar at 5gp each, but brownie parts are rarer and cost me 50pp each... (Boohoo, I was paying that for ONE attempt at a planier recipie, versus the ONE HUNDRED that 1 brownie part gives me...)<br />
<br />
So after doing 200 to 226 in planier and doing 227 and 228 in MTPs tonight I will say I will NEVER make another planier for skill ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">mountain brownies in steamfont.  also a guildie gave me a stack of brownie parts because she genocides them for vengence.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kumgum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am currently hateing the MTP's.  Out of the last 32 stacks of them (640 combines) over the last few days, I have gotten 7 skillups... going from 200-207. :steamed: <br />
<br />
They are a lot easier to make then it looks like when you read all the subcombines.  and are really really cheap to make.  If they werent so cheap and easy to do I would probably be screaming my head off the next run of 160+ combines without a skillup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">ow i only had a couple of 100+ points.  you average 90 something.  i averaged 40 combine per skillup and when i did other stuff like 180 jfp combines it didnt change.  good luck.  255 int here though.  what are you at?  might have some problems with that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kumgum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My int is 280, (65 wiz).  I found 6 stacks of boar meat for sale in baz and used them all to get to 215, then did another 50 stacks of MTP's to get to 250, wich was a much more acceptable skillup rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've been buying up Vann Toes and Jord meat whenever I see them on merchants. Very easy combines and the trivial level is high. I just do a run whenever I get about 100 total combines saved up.</div></div><hr />

Timed myself yesterday and in 53min I set up 200 combines. What other skill (ok mino brews) can you get so many combines in such a short amount of time.<br />
<br />
And I did this for only 234PP. Druid friend gave me a stack of vegies and I had a stack of brownie parts ready to go.<br />
<br />
I got lucky and got 6 skill ups, usually I would only expect 3, but still this is good return for the PP/time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have cash, buy stupid amounts of meats in the bazaar.  This gets pricy.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you don't, hunt griffons til you hit 220 (as both my skill ups and successes were horried pre 220 modded)<br />
<br />
<br />
After 220, MTP is the way to go.</div></div><hr />

As others have said, the fastest way to level baking to 250 is Misty Thicket Picnics. You can try the planar stuff, but while you do less combines it will take you a longer time doing them. One person suggested MTP's in SH, I was always partial to PoK myself in order to bounce to Rivervale to pick up the Jumjum stalks.<br />
<br />
Now, the combines themselves. The way i did them was that i used 7 inventory slots of space. 1 slot was a general tool slot. A place where i could put the collapsable mixing bowl, collapsable sewing kit, etc. Whatever i had to open to do the combine at hand. 3 slots held 3 10-slot bags with the supplies that could make 200 MTP's. Yes, it all fits in 3 bags of space. Then 3 more slots were for 10-slot bags of which 8 slots of each bag would have a stack of 20 of each component used in making a Misty Thicket Picnic, 60 picnics per one-third of the run. Start by simply running the combines from the 3 main bags into the sub bags until you had 60 setup. Making sure two of the bags were on either side of the oven, hold down the ctrl key and pull the right side comps from one bag and the left side comps from the other into the oven. Hit combine. After 20 times of doing this, switch the bag slots so that the bags trade positions. Repeat 20 more times. Then work the third bag until all 60 had been combined. Make 60 more. Then 60 again. I found I usually always got 180 combines out of the deal because invariably you'd have a subcombine failure or two. Figure it takes upwards of 2000 MTP successes between 190-250.<br />
<br />
One of the other things I do when setting up to do ANY recipe in mass is make what i call a grid map. Once you identify all the components you need, try to fit it in as few bags as possible. When you shrink them as far as they can go and get a setup you like, take a piece of paper and draw a 2x5 grid for each bag and put the initials or something you'll remember for each item. In this way, you can, and I have run the entire process without ever looking at the recipe. I did 100's of MTP's at the time without ever even pulling it up. Not sure how well this will turn out, but the grid map for MTP's:<br />
<br />
+------------+  +-----------+ +------------+<br />
| JJC   LB    |  | LET VEG  |  | FRU FRO  |<br />
| JJC   AM   |  | FEN JJS   |  | BP    FRO  |<br />
| BAR  HOP |  | EL   FRO |  | JJS   CD    |<br />
| BOT  SPI  |  | BM   BM   |  | CR   CMB  |<br />
| WF   JJS   |  | REN  DS  |  | WM  SB    |<br />
+------------+ +------------+ +------------+<br />
<br />
Key:<br />
JJC = Jumjum Cake(non-slice)<br />
BAR = Barley<br />
BOT = Bottle<br />
WF = Water Flask<br />
LB = Loaf of Bread<br />
AM = Apricot Marmalade<br />
HOP = Hops<br />
SPI = Spices<br />
JJS = JumjumStalk<br />
LET = Lettuce<br />
VEG = Vegetables<br />
FEN = Fennel<br />
EL = Eucalyptus Leaf<br />
FRO = Frosting<br />
BM = Bottle of Milk<br />
REN = Rennet<br />
DS = Dairy Spoon<br />
BP = Brownie Parts<br />
CD = Clump of Dough<br />
CR = Cake Round<br />
CMB = Collapsed Mixing Bowl<br />
WM = Woven Mandrake<br />
SB = Steel Boning<br />
<br />
Prepare simply by putting a stack of each stackable item in its spot. The bags are also setup roughly by subcombine. So I would draw squares around the combines like around BAR, HOP, BOT, SPI, WF, and JJS to indicate it was one combine. Since its pretty apparent with hops its a brewing combine, it should be self explanatory as to which it goes in. Just run 6 of these combines to get 10 Jumjum beer each to get the 60 needed for the 3 other bags where you are setting up the final combines. Doing it 3 times takes 18 sets of comps, just under the 20 you currently have available or allowing you 180 combines. Once again, with perfect success rate on subcombines you could do an extra 20 combines, but that rarely if ever happened.<br />
<br />
In cold storage, this allowed me to dump the parts i absolutely had to save and couldn't buy on vendor, like brownie parts, vegetables/fruit, or the utensils in 2 bags in the bank. I've heard of people who have every single component stored in bulk on alts, and sorry, but 2 bags is enough of my space to take up thanks, especially when doing 6 other tradeskills. Plus, I don't have to switch out to an alt except to dump the excess MTP's that I succeeded on. Basically, if you want to be any type of professional tradeskiller, and do sets of items in bulk, you'll need to have something akin to a plan in order to get a handle on inventory control and material flow procedures. If you don't, it'll take you 5 times as long to do everything and you'll burn out pretty quick. Find out what works for you, and run with it. Thanks.<br />
