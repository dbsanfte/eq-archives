<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>writher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently a 162 Tailor (from the shawl days) about to start the tailoring portion of the Aid Grimel quest.    I am very much dreading it even though I do have one thing going in my favor: the Shei Vinitrias 15% tailoring mod item which I got a few weeks ago for a relatively small amount of DKP. Is there anything special I can do now that I have this? Will it help my skillup rate at all?  Are there any other words of encouragement you can give me?  Also, I read that doing the LoY ribbons might be something to look into, but that requires a foraging class.  Is it worth training points into foraging to sit in stonebrunt and try to forage the pieces?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>writher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks, is it not possible to make the swatches before then?<br />
<br />
Also, what do you mean &quot;with the shears&quot; I can do them at that number?  Is there a certain required mod number to do them?<br />
<br />
Thanks, and sorry for the newbie questions.<br />
<br />
Edit: Nevermind, did some research and realized that yes they do require a modded skill of 220 to even attempt.<br />
<br />
Also,   What do you suggest combining before then?  Acrylia armor? Ribbons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cleben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did ribbons to 187, then different items, mostly acrylia and velius to 192.<br />

Thanks, in one day so far I've made it from 162 to 200 Tailoring.   Once I get the AA's I should be able to hit 212 pretty quickly.  <br />
<br />
Thanks  <br />

i hate you:steamed: ...it's taken me forever to even get to 188, and flawless hopper hides are 500p per and any size brick of acrylia is 125pp on prexus. solstice robes require hundreds of subcombines, and after two days of farming wyverns, i have 25 hides...it's going to take me a year to get to 220 for the quest</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>writher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, I went from 162 to 212 in 2 days of tailoring.  Just did about 20 rockhopper/acrylia combines and got no skillups :-(<br />
<br />
Oh well.   I'll try again tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Saleani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I also have the shears.<br />
<br />
I did ribbons to about 187, then I did cultural robes to 193. I have vague memories of not being able to combine the swatches at 192, that I needed 193. Oh well. To get from 192/193 to 212 took me 2 days (kept running out of the strands). I then made more robes to get to 233 tailoring.<br />
<br />
I have not finished the pottery part of the earring quest, and am not elemental flagged yet, so I have not gotten to the tailoring part yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>writher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I hit 215 and did 30 acrylia reinforced boot combines before I realized that I could save acrylia by doing bracers instead.  I did 25 bracer combines.  So total of 55 combines and no skillups.   Is it possible that my tailoring shears are *HURTING* my skillup rate because my modded skill is either close to or above the trivial of the acrylia? (I think my modded skill is 247 right now).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I went 1/4 on the tailoring combine, and so did my friend.  We both did it with a skill of 224 (or so) (modified to 235)  Just from seeing what has been posted here, I think this combine is between 25-33% success at this level.<br />
<br />
Most people here have reported about 50% success at skill 252.<br />
<br />
Use the info as you see fit.  For me it was worth it to make attempts, rather than keep skilling up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>TeriMoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">55 combines without a skillup at 200+ tailoring is a run of poor luck, not a function of your shears, IMO.<br />
<br />
The only time I didn't use use a skill modifier is when I was combining solstice robes.  As a money saver, I didn't really want to use up those chains very quickly, so I choose to try to minimize my successful combines.  No idea if it helped my pocket or how much it hurt my skill-up rate, but that's what I did.</div></div><hr />
