I'd just thought I'd share my way of looting with everyone, which also makes sure that I collect accurate information.<br />
<br />
Firstly, the preparation.<br />
1. Make sure that your log file is turned on (/log on)<br />
2. Set yourself up your own chat channel (/join &lt;your name&gt;)<br />
3. Make yourself a hotkey that reads as follows:<br />
<br />
/target a  (this automatically targets a mob beginning with &quot;a&quot; - most monsters)<br />
/pause 5 (allow the server to respond to the first command - you may have to adjust this dependant on how good you connection is)<br />
/1 looting %t (this tells your chat channel what you are looting but will not annoy those around you with spam)<br />
/loot (to actually open up the loot window)<br />
<br />
Having done this you only need to stand near a body and hit this hotkey and it will target it and open up the loot window. Very useful in LDoNs to get mobs that have fallen in walls or by the zone out. At the end of the day you just need to trawl your log file and you will see your chat channel comment in the log immediately before the list of what you have looted.<br />
<br />
I just cut and paste from the log onto the message boards to make sure that I have the correct spellings.<br />

================<br />
Unless your character's name also starts with &quot;A,&quot; in which case you will target yourself everytime. (As my dwarf cleric Airkk found out many years ago...)<br />
<br />
If that is the case, the first line of the Hotkey should be:<br />
<br />
/target a_</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Remember to replace the /1 with whatever # you personal chat channel is, mine is /2.</div></div><hr />
