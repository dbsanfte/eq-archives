<br />
I'm just working on my tailoring skills and reached the point at which Wu's Fighting Armor is trivial (125 Skill).<br />
Now, i'm not sure how to improve further.<br />
Perhaps you skilled tradeskillers have some nice advice for me?<br />
Thanks for your tips!<br />
<br />
Greetings,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wu's should trivial at 158.<br />
<br />
That said, on the front page is a link to &quot;learn a skill&quot; which has a variety of guides that can be used, or there are many (read.. many many) threads in this forum with detailed answers to your question already.<br />
<br />
Just browse down the list, and read away... oh, and recheck your wu's trivials, each different piece (well, most all of them) has/have a different trivial level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Silamael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hm, then i have read something wrong.<br />
I'll check the guides then.</div></div><hr />

/em runs off to look.<br />
<br />
/em comes back<br />

Ok i was 1 out<br />
<br />
Crystaline silk tunic = Components: crystalline silk swatch(3), silver thread, tunic pattern<br />
Triv = 131<br />
<br />
I used to farm the spiders deep in Crystal Caverns.<br />
<br />
I know its only 6 points, but anything without Heady Kiolas is a bonus at your skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Silamael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the hint. I hope i'll get some time at the weekend to camp some stuff for further tradeskilling :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Myrron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My tailoring guide on the main site was recently updated, so it should have a few ideas for you.  It's not very detailed past 188 but it does outline the most popular routes.<br />
