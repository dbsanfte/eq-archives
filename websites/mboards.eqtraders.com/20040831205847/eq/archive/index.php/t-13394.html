<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Finae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where is best place for a 65 mage to farm Velium dont wanna kill my faction in SS so thats off, I have 300 wyvern combines i need to do but no Velium to do em, thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know TS in Velks has decent drop rate.  Someone said castle area in Velks but I've never been there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">do a search for velium.  (i love the search feature)<br />
<br />
your answers anyway.  <br />
<br />
1. CC is easy to farm, has a forge in zone<br />
bad because it is a pretty fun dugeon level appropriate and you will take all the kills<br />
<br />
2. skyshrine have heard good drop rates, also has forge<br />
bad faction for cov and since you are in a cov faction &quot;town&quot; that hurts.<br />
<br />
3. velks  heard decent drop rates if doing shawl can get threads here at same time or crystalline silks for newbie tailors<br />
bad harder to farm as mobs are lb and high green so slower kills<br />
<br />
4. ToFS heard nice drop rates and rare competition<br />
bad it takes keys to get up but not really hard to get, and well you can gate out fully loaded but kinda annoying to get too.  if you have gotten 300 wyvern hides from cs instead of bazaar you prolly have a porter on speed dial though.  <br />
<br />
answers good enough?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Finae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks am gonna try tofs atm see how it goes if not back to cc hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't recall much velium dropping in the ToFS.<br />
<br />
CC is your best bet.  The MoBs are pretty low, and there's a dwarven outpost, and a forge there.  On my server, it's not very populated.  Now if I could only figure out where the dang spiders are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Finae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Spiders are down past the city near the Geos. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Geos?  What Geos?  LOL.  <br />
<br />
I'm at the city now.  Found a decent place to fight miners near the city gates, so I can load up, and then hit the forge to break them down into small pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Moonlilly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">5th floor of ToFS.  If you can 2 box Finae take a mule up with you. Smear everything on the floor and loot everything. Once you've filled up. Trasfer everything to mule zone it out and sell at the pirate outpost.  Run back and CoH mule back to 5th floor. Rinse and repeat. Can get a decent amount of cash that way since your there anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Heartsong_Steelsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The trick is that the spiders and geos are PAST the town, though be careful in the geonid area as there is a one way zone out at the top.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Deedolith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Basically, any &quot;crystalline&quot; type MoB on velious can drop velium, exept in crystal cavern</div></div><hr />
