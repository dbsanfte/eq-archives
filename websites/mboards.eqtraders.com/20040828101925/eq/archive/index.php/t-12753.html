<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Adainae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am at 232 brewing and I wanted to hit 250 today.  I did a mix of hero and KC up to now and decided to add in some demi-sec today.<br />
<br />
I had my enchanter (250 JC +trophy) make 200 champaine magnums and get everything ready on my druid and start combining.<br />
<br />
Magnum<br />
2 grapes<br />
soda water<br />
wine yeast<br />
 <br />
I'm getting demi-sec champaine BUT also getting cannot raise skill!!<br />
<br />
What am I doing wrong?  I spent a lot on the magnums so I really hope I can use them for skill ups.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's odd... I do specifically remember when I hit 248 (with Mino's Hero Brew) I did make champagne to get the last two skill points.<br />
<br />
I don't recall which one specifically I did... but those last two came pretty quick, less than a stack and I was happy.<br />
<br />
Maybe... the Trivial for the Demi-Sec Champagne is &lt; 232...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Adainae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">whew, nm it was user-error <br />
<br />
My window was scrolled up to where I was doing the soda water.  Its fine now :)<br />
<br />

Edit:  200 combines 11 skill ups from 232-243 and only 7 fails!!  Great run :)</div></div><hr />
