<br />
Your all probably aware that my own INFINITE CRUSADE is obtaining my epic weapon (Druids Farming Tool). You are also probably aware that I'm <br />
the guild leader of a very nice TRADESKILLERS guild who doesn't have the fire power to kill all the mobs needed for the above epic.<br />
<br />
Well a group of really excellent folks who subscribe to our own Karana eqtraders market place went above and beyond the call of duty to help me obtain the coveted JADE REAVER (which dropped on 1st kill :)<br />
<br />
I would Like to thank personally these people who unselfishly came to my aid<br />
<br />
Doranur <br />
Locutous<br />
Gaereth<br />
fyremyst<br />
Kefo<br />
Daranaf<br />
Ivat<br />
<br />
Thankyou Thankyou I really appreciate the great help/company of you guys and I pledge to do unlimited combines for all of you in any trade I'm skilled in :) also as a solo druid you can call upon me anytime :)<br />

<br />
&amp;lt;start sanys story&gt;<br />
<br />
It was another glorious day under the norathian sunshine, My current responsabillities had me posted in The wakeninglands where it was my role to help the geonid people cull thier own population which has gotten out of hand due to the new shaman recipe under test called (virockra)..<br />
<br />
HEHe well I was farming like mad and powerlevelling our guilds cleric when a message arived from another guild member called lanuvan.<br />
<br />
Attention all guild members I hate (start of code I could not decipher) #%@$ Karnors Castle. Its empty now how my going to level :P<br />
<br />
I send a response Hello dear lanuvan By any chance would Venril Sathirs Remains be up ??<br />
<br />
Hi Sany yes hes up : )<br />
<br />
Hi lanny can you ask for a camp check if no one call it on my behalf ??<br />
<br />
OK we own the camp : )<br />
<br />
Well we drop everything and head toward the castle of karnor at lightning speed : )<br />
<br />
On the way our group of guild folks sent message to there friends asking for reienforcements (come on folks what real chance did a druids cleric and ranger have against the evil Dr VSR Muahahaha)<br />
<br />
Any way a group of friends had rallied to our aid as we arived at the doorstep of KC.<br />
<br />
Terrascar (Ranger)<br />
Daranaf Guild (Cleric)<br />
Chewbacka (cleric)<br />
elnome (chanty)<br />
Lanuvan Guild (ranger)<br />
Rikyn (Kitty Kat Tank)<br />
Sanyareena Guild (Druid)<br />
<br />
Thankyou Guys from the bottom of my Heart : ) I love you <br />
<br />
So anyway I go gung ho fol me pick up 100 adds and poor lan dies from congestive heart failure and we all have to escape : P<br />
<br />
Hence my NickName Sanyareena Traindriver *sik<br />
<br />
Any way we regroup under the expert leadership of a mighty warrior called rikyn who showed us what it means to TANK.<br />
<br />
Finally we make it to VSR room where we see VSR having a quaint chat to two folks. So we say Oki finish up your chat we have business to do here :P<br />
<br />
So we all stand around VSR and I say &quot;Hey VSR weas about to do Smackdown on your hiney&quot;   VSR says no not neccisary im a peace loving ghosty could you spare a globe of fire flies its a bit dark in here.<br />
<br />
I was taken aback all i could here was 3 letter's over and over I think this was sponsored by sesame street brought to you by the letters W , T and F <br />
<br />
<br />
So Me 1 not ever to kill an unarmed soul say sure and pops him a globe<br />
<br />
* Pooof** All I hear is Muhahahaha dumb @$$ Druid you fell for that <br />
then he was gone but in his place was the Ghost of Venrill sathir<br />
<br />
Bah I go then I say &quot;Hey Ghost of Venril Sathir weas about to do Smackdown on your hiney&quot;   Ghost of Venril Sathir  says no not neccisary im a peace loving ghosty could you spare a resurrection spell So I can rezz the real VS so you can smak his hiney instead ??.<br />
<br />
Holy crap Gimme Gimme Gimme is all I hear from this place Bah oki <br />
<br />
I give him the scroll *pooooof* <br />
<br />
BANG  BANG BANG no time for thoughts Venril Sathir was putting the smakdown on our hineys OUCH<br />
<br />
Well Our main Tank quickly picks up agro and yells assist me when i say <br />
<br />
So we all stop what were doing and watch the tank cop a beat down<br />
<br />
ASSIST comes the cry <br />
<br />
I don't know what the others were doing but man he hit the dust Fast less than 1 minute I would say <br />
<br />
I had just enough time to Fury of ro Breath of ro and 3 Wildfires before he was dead : )<br />
<br />
