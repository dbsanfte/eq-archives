My guess would be however much the charming halfling tailor who makes them feels like charging you. <br />
<br />
<br />
Keep in mind they take 240ish skill, 3-4 BDs, and more tufts of fur then rivervale has on its collective feet.<br />

Just passing through, <br />

You're going to have a hard time finding these at any price, most likely, so don't expect much in the way of bargains unless you're providing all the components and find the tailor in a good mood and on a lucky streak.  ;)</div></div><hr />

The only failure I have had on the 6 slot so far was the first, without using a geerlok.<br />
<br />
I am selling these all over tunare server for an asking price of 2500pp. <br />
<br />
Send me a tell in game if you want one or if you have any tufts of dire wolf fur your looking to unload.<br />

My brother's level 62 druid is a 250 skill tailor, around 200 other tradeskills.<br />
He quit, so it's my character now.  Look for Moore or Pointy in game, Pointy is the GM tailor, Moore is my druid.  I'm rarely on as Pointy, so it's best to look for Moore.  I work from 11am PST to 8pm PST, so I don't play very much most days.  I'm off Tuesday and Wednesday, so that's the best time for me.  I can also be reached at keribubba@adelphia.net.<br />
