<br />
From a quick look at the costs etc. it seems that jumping straight from Class 1 Wood Hooked Arrow (Triv 102, cost 330) to Class 1 Wood Silver Tip Arrow (Triv 182, Cost 414) is actually cheaper than doing Class 4 Wood Point Arrow, Class 1 Ceramic Point Arrow and<br />
Class 5 Wood Point Arrow in between.<br />
<br />
This is assuming 255 Stat and no geerlock.<br />
<br />
I imagine that the results would only get better with a geerlock and more stats.<br />

<br />
The chart was made by some weirdo ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jarak_akn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep by that was guestimation done before the one true formular (ok 3 formulars) were know.<br />
<br />
I do however have to retract my orriginal statment as I had the wrong cost price for silver arrow heads :-P<br />
<br />
So much math such a waste of time if the number you first thought of was wrong :-(<br />
<br />
I will try to re run the numbers next week.<br />
