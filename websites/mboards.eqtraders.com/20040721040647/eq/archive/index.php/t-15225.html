<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Benthair Dunthat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Spent three and one-half hours in Acrylia Caverns last nite, ending up with 28 blocks/bricks of acrylia. Back to the Rivervale bank, pull out 28 Flawless hopper hides, 28 Paeala bark tannins, 28 water flasks. Open up the the sewing kit, click on Acrylia Reinforced Maks, and go to it. 28 attempts later (about 10k worth of stuff) - 1 skill up from 192 to 193. :&gt;(<br />

I must be crazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1 skill up in 28 attempts in the 190's (aka the hell levels) is GREAT! Be happy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dalur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree.  That is pretty good ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I was skilling up on tailoring I always waited til I had 30-40 combines. Each run of 30-40 usually net 1 or 2 skill ups. Anymore and I was happy, any less I was someone miffed, if it fell into the 1-2 skillups per 30-40 combines I put the knife away and my wrists spent another day intact ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Carmaris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd kill for that kind of success rate.  413 combines to earn 10 points from 187 - 197....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Of course you're crazy! You're tailoring, aren't you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rorlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I must be crazy getting 250 tailoring.. and I thought I can make a profit farming Elemental drops and buying up Saps, silks, Metallic Substance.. etc.. that I can find and fail rate on that is SOooo high... Totally wasnt worth it in my eyes..  spend so much time and money to get 250 and fail on my last 6 combines.. 2 PoE robes and 2 PoF robes and 1 Firehide legs and 1 Earthweave legs..    Im really upset at the trivial rate being so high, doesnt make tailoring worth it for me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>AB-girlie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">thats why i only do the so called &quot;small&quot; combines, even though i have had 250 for quite some time.<br />
black panther skin armor, ice silk armor, tae ew leather (when i can find some),haze panther, ect.. but i only do elemental armor on request.  <br />
