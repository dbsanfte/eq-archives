<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Phaedran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently started farming acrylia ore to create some studded acrylia armor, raising tailoring.  This requires the generation of acrylia studs which are, of course, derived from Acrylia ore I farm. Now the ore itself drops in a couple of forms: blocks, small pieces, large bricks, and small bricks of ore.  The small pieces are what I use to generate the bits and then convert those to studs.  <br />
My problem is that when I happen to get a block to drop, I must chisel it down to a large brick, then a small brick, then a small piece in order to work with it. Now upon chiseling down a block to for a large brick, the return is 1 large brick plus my chisel. However, according to the database on EQ traders, in order to create a block of acrylia ore, it requires the smelting of 3 large bricks into one. So where did the other 2 bricks worth of ore go when I chiseled down the block? Theoretically, down the chain of chiseling, one block of ore should yield a great deal more acrylia per division. <br />
I feel very cheated by this due to the time it takes me to personally farm these ingredients.<br />
Why is the conversion ratio only working one way?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Reasons:<br />
<br />
1. The act of chiseling a block of ore, means chipping away in small pieces to a smaller chunk of ore. Some of the material is lost in the dust.<br />
<br />
Yes, it might make more sense to convert one block to two large bricks... but that is Sony's Decision.<br />
<br />
2. Sony chose the breakdown in that fashion.  Sorry.<br />
<br />
Suggestion.<br />
<br />
Provide an INGAME /feedback to Sony requesting that the Large Block chiseled down returns more than just a Large Brick... maybe 2 Large Bricks, or 1 Large Brick &amp; Small Brick, or 1 Large Brick &amp; 2 Pieces...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its more like the Large and Small Bricks arnt stackable and two items of the same kind on the cursor just doesnt seem to work. So it returns just one of that kind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Horanaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't know, it always seemed to me that breaking down a brick of ore into a smaller one would yield at least a little leftover material.<br />
<br />
I think that brick+smithing chisel=smaller brick+1 small piece would be both reasonable and logical. After all, it takes 3 small pieces to make a small brick doesn't it? So where does the extra small piece worth of ore go when breaking it down?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This has been the stupidest bug in all of EQ since day 1.<br />
<br />
The only way to lose half of a brick of ore by chiseling it in half is if a freak wormhole in the fabric of the space-time continuum opens up and little green men from the planet YGbVtGYG spirit half of the ore away as its broken.<br />
<br />
But they dont seem to have any intention of fixing it, so all you can really do is /rude</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>OberonMiM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">dont forget the fact you can FAIL to break down ore (how you fail to break something is beyond me)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nanndas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Related question about bricks and blocks for the experts.<br />
<br />
I do vendor mining regularily. Every time I see a brick/block/piece of velium/acrylia/condensed shadow I have this habit of hitting &quot;Buy&quot;...<br />
<br />
I'll be honest, my trader's bank is filling up due to the fact that some don't stack. With Tailoring at 105, Smithing at 122 and not ready to throw a lot of pp at either skill in the near future what should I do with the bricks and blocks? I know I could break them down to pieces as mentioned above. But with so many ways to skill up in ts's that need them would I be better off creating another mule and transfering them over to him. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This is actually kinda an interesting thing. Way back in the day ore used to break down into 2 peice when you where breaking down. Problem was the cursor couldn't handle multiple of the same item that weren't stacked so the second one would basically poof. If you did the break downs with some one in group tho they would see that you had created 2 of them. block was 2 large bricks, large bricks was 2 small bricks. People complained at the time and rather than fix the cursor stacking issue they just decided to change the receipes so they only produced one brick. Problem solved.<br />
<br />
Now that they have since gone in and fixed the cursor stacking issue they still haven't gone back and changed the combine to result in 2 bricks. Kinda ironic but if we just hadn't complained in the first place the cursor issue would have still been fixed and we'd be getting 2 bricks when breaking down now.</div></div><hr />

Its more like the Large and Small Bricks arnt stackable and two items of the same kind on the cursor just doesnt seem to work. So it returns just one of that kind.  <br />
<br />
Ever used mass clarify/ Mass Imbue / Mass enchant (insert metal here)?<br />
<br />
Two unstackable items, be they the same or not can both be on your cursor at the same time, but of course not through multiple tradeskill combines. How else do you get your file + acrylia studs back? Also for example, summoning bread, I've had nearly 2 stacks on my curosr at once (summoned in sets of 4 pieces) before putting them into my bags.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was added fairly recently, specifically when the Mass Enchant spells were added.  Prior to that, two non-stacking items of the same type could not be held on the cursor at the same time.  In fact, the Mass Enchant Spells ate 4 of the Large Bicks for the first week or two after the spells were released. <br />
<br />
The wonderful fellows at Sony made changes to code that allows mulitple instances of non-stacking items on the cursor in SPECIFIC cases.  The Mass Enchant Spells.  Items returned by NPCs.   But not smithing's ore conversions.  <br />
<br />
As it stands now, the recipe's yeild is ONE brick of the next smaller size.  It's not a bug.   It's working as designed, and while it may not be the result we'd all like to see, saying it is a bug won't make it change. <br />
<br />
If you'd like to see it changed, you should use one of the means of submitting feedback to Sony.   They have provided the /feedback command in the game, and links on their web-site.  Please don't use the /bug command for feedback.  <br />
<br />
Maddoc, Tanker, Brenlo, and Absor have all stated in the past that the feedback and bug-reports submitted do get read and considered.</div></div><hr />

Ever had 4 rubies eaten because you didn't clear your cursor?<br />
<br />
This is pretty new.<br />
<br />
I'm in splunge's camp on the breakdowns.  Very stupidly done.<br />
<br />
But I'd rather they fix the $%#$%$#@% temper requirements for PoP stuff before fiddling about with ores.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats not true. There are any number of situations where you can get multiple non stacked copies of the same item. Foraging come imidiately to mind as one you missed. I beleive breaking down the star metal now properly yields 2 for another one.<br />

<br />
This is actually whats happening with smithing. They changed the receipe rather than fix the bug way back in the day and now we're stuck with the receipe.<br />

<br />
Poorly articulated? I'm scratching my head over the whole post, I don't know WHAT you are talking about :zombie: <br />
<br />
I remember a time when if you let foraged items build up on your cursor, you'd only ever have one of each item when you finally put them in a bag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Suutar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The ability to have more than one &quot;stack&quot; of an item on the cursor at once (where a stack may be 1 or 20; it's just a cluster) is relatively recent. This is why the magician &quot;summon shuriken in quantity&quot; spell (They also have an arrow spell, and food/drink/bandages; I have the most experience with shuriken) originally summoned 3 _different kinds_ of shuriken, that wouldn't stack with each other.<br />
<br />
Now admittedly, &quot;relatively recent&quot; in this case does mean a year or two (I forget the exact date). But it's still a durn sight more recent than the introduction of ore-splitting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Taushar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">This question was asked again at the Vegas Fan Faire and the answer was &quot;no, we will not fix it since it is working as intended&quot;. I guess if we keep at it, they may consider it in next few years. ;) Seriously, I don't think they are going to fix this any time soon. <br />
