<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aquila Swiftspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello Tailors,<br />
<br />
I'm at the point of starting Velious Leathers (187 skill), since, for me (65  Woodelf druid, detested by CoV--making Skyshrine my relatively competition-free playground) the ingredients are much easier to come by than Acrylia and Rockhoppers (which are heavily pharmed on Prexus).<br />
<br />
As a younger druid, I remember drooling over the Cobalt Drake Hide belt.  While I was able to get other armors better than CDH for most slots (or close enough and significantly cheaper then), the belt seemed very good for a long time.   Similarly, the Tigerraptor Cloak stood out amongst the ranger gear as filling a slot quite well for a long time. <br />
<br />
That is, these two pieces were good enough to compete with the other gear options I had well into my mid-50s, say.  I imagine these two pieces could still compete reasonably in the market for folks gearing lower level characters or alts.<br />
<br />
So, when I work on my Cobalt Drake hides, I'll probably attempt belts, and for the Tigerraptors, I'll probably do cloaks.<br />
<br />
I've never played a rogue, monk, or shaman though, so I have no idea which (if any) Velious leathers pieces MIGHT be worth trying to sell for folks these days.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if some of you have specific suggestions for armor slots which might actually be worth making rather than masks (though I expect to make my share of these as well), I'd appreciate it.  (I expect to do a ton of the masks before I ever have a chance of succeeding on other leathers, but it gives me small hope to think ahead a little.)<br />
<br />
Here's my list so far:<br />
<br />
Cobalt Drake Hide Belt - 2 boning<br />
Tigerraptor Cloak - 4 studs<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help; if you have other suggestions, too, I'd appreciate them greatly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Boning is cheaper to make than studs, since it requires less velium and fewer tempers. Don't count on much successes. At 216 I still rarely succeed on any velious combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">cloak<br />
legs<br />
tunic (looks ok)<br />
wristbands<br />
<br />
just look for the stat stuff.  <br />
int casters at least have major problems getting arms and legs with decent items.  <br />
ice silk cap is awesome<br />
<br />
thought tiger raptor boots looked good too.<br />
<br />
be sure to look at what acrylia offers too though.  that is normally the biggest velious stuff competitor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm now doing a fair bit of Velious tailoring, concentrating on the leathers. I'm also getting enough successes now to make it profitable!  :D  I'd urge caution attempting at 187 skill, as you will go through a LOT of failures for each successful combination.<br />
<br />
I too make mainly Cobalt Drake belts, as they require only 2 boning. I have made Tigeraptor cloaks and tunics though, but they don't seem to sell as quickly, probably because they are single-class items.<br />
<br />
What does sell well, at least on my server, is Black Pantherskin. I make tunics, leggings, sleeves and boots, and I sell out overnight almost every time. These too take boning rather than studs, so are more cost-effective to produce than anything that takes velium studs.<br />
<br />
Good luck with the tailoring, and happy trading! :wave:</div></div><hr />

I would suggest actually hitting up every Velious animal fur, pelt and hide you can get your hands on. Wyvern hats and sleeves are good for cheap twinking shamans, cobalt drake hide belts (how many tries did we do trying to make you one of those?!), of course, are good druid belts...<br />
<br />
And actually the haze panther gear is awesome, but unfortunately, super rare spawns.<br />
<br />
I agree, the ice silk hat is a great twink int-caster hat, but probably not good for a skill up recipe since it requires the 4 ruby mana vial.<br />
<br />
Anyway, kill anything and everything, farm your velium, forage tempers, etc. and just mix it up.  Though it will feel like you get further if you stick with velium boning as opposed to studs...</div></div><hr />
