<br />
I can't seem to find any jacinths or black sapphires for sale, and if I'm going to be attempting 6 trophies, I'm thinking that if I try to get a stack of each, I'll be okay for a while.<br />
<br />
Or alternately, is there any place that drops these regularly, that a level 56 druid can solo?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

Thurgadin, Shadow Haven, PoK, PoT, and the Bazaar sometimes have them if you spend time checking many vendors.  Unless you're in a hurry, you should be able to get all you need this way within a few weeks or so, and much more cheaply than they're sold by players in the Bazaar.  That's how I got all the jacinths, black sapphires, and diamonds for my smithing trophy attempt and three attempts at the alchemy trophy.<br />
<br />
It's amazing what you can find on vendors tucked away in obscure corners of otherwise busy zones.  Blue diamonds, rare (and I do mean rare) spells, tier 3+ PoP drops etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried running through PoK yesterday, and did a bit of checking. No luck so far :)  And I'm not in a great hurry, heh.  Taking it nice and easy for few days.  I used to hate vendor minding, but now that I discovered that the alt button works to label all the NPC inventory, it goes much quicker.  I knew about alt, but I thought that was only for your own bags ;)</div></div><hr />

I already found all I needed, since I got really lucky on my trophy attempts :)<br />
<br />
Had 11 extra jacinths when all was said and done, and now I'm the proud owner of all 7 GM trophies :)</div></div><hr />
