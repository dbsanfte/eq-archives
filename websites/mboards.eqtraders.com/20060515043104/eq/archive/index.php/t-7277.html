<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanna</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A long time ago, and as I recall on another board (but we all know how fast my memory is degrading these days), someone mentioned that Corpse Potions had become NoDrop. <br />
<br />
I cannot get anyone I know on Sullon to tell me anything about CPs. Where you get them, are they player made, why now NoDrop, etc. <br />
<br />
The only real piece of information I may have connected to this is the elusive rumor of the NPC in Pok you are supposed to give the Coins to, the ones you get when you kill an even-con PC and loot. <br />
<br />
I know the Sullon population here is low, but gosh darnit, I hate being this out of the loop. Maybe someone will know. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Turn a greater insignia of an evil into a retriever, recieve a summon corpse potion.<br />
<br />
Get greater insignias from killing an even con lvl 51+ person.<br />
<br />
They were made no drop because people were transferring to stormhammer and selling coprse potions for cash.<br />
<br />
There is a retreiver in qeynos near the clock.   Thats about it</div></div><hr />
