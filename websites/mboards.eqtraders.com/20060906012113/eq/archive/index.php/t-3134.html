<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lunaire</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just had a quick question for the sages here;<br />
<br />
I'm about to trivial quivers at 115 in the next couple of days, and would like some advice on the next step.  I hear horror stories about wu's, and was wondering if I should use the 2 and 3 swatch combines of crystalline silk to trivial at 128 or so before I move on.  The two limiting factors for me are farmability and cost.  i.e. i don't mind farming if I get decent return rates, but I'm looking at purchasing several (possibly all :( ) of the components for a solstice earring so I consider myself flat broke right now.<br />
<br />
From looking at levels of monsters, most of the crystalling spiders in CC should be green, hopefully meaning that I can solo pull them to the entrance of their cave.  If so, I can probably farm them at a decent rate.  <br />
<br />
Any advice from you all would be greatly appreciated.<br />

Not to mention the time and brewing skill involved in making Heady Kiolas... or the money paying someone else to do it for you.)  And if you have any leftover silk you can sell to other prospective skiller-uppers also.<br />
<br />
The spiders are often farmed for that reason, but I found them often open in the mornings, before I had to go to work.  I was a bit older at the time than you are now so was able to keep the hall clear easily, and the silk dropped quite often; just a few morning sessions and I was ready for Wu's.<br />

I even trivialed Crystalline Armor at 131 BEFORE going to Wu's because of the time it takes to make the Heady Kiola's and the Viscious Mana's.  But then my Wis was alot lower when I was doing those so getting skillups took alot longer for me.<br />
<br />
Remember though, that you will spend a few plat getting the Silver Thread that you will need to make the Crystalline Armor.<br />
<br />
At level 41, you will find that some of the Spidders will give you exp.  There will be a few that may even be yellow or red.  I'm not totally sure as I was around 55 when I started up on Tailoring again and did Crystalline Armor.<br />
<br />
The choice is yours.</div></div><hr />

They are more expensive per attempt, but I found a buyer for them.  Some people initially approached me to imbue emeralds, but I offered to do the entire STS combine for the skillup.  The approximate cost is like this:  emerald 16pp, 2 scent of marr 2pp each, acid and celestial solvent &amp;lt;1pp each, plus the silk cost 0(farm) - bazaar price.  You can sell them for 30-40pp.  So you can easily cover your failures.  Or you can just keep them if you plan on doing robes later</div></div><hr />

according to alla's, the highest level for spiders is 34, drachnids 36 and the queen at 40.  I hadn't planned on heading back to her room though  :D If its not being camped, I'll most likely stay near the entrance of the spider tunnel and pull to there.<br />
<br />
By the way, thanks for advice!  This message board is by far the most active and beneficial one I read.  On a side note, only one more griffin egg till i can attempt a souffle (them griffins are recluses when it comes to their unborn   :cry: )<br />

Pretty easy when you are 62. Just load an AE spell and cram yourself into a corner. BOOM.<br />
<br />
Pretty decent ratio on the silks and alot of Messenger of the Queen to the newbies in Butcherblok ;)<br />
<br />
Pop back to Thurg and make all the armor you can. Or stuff the bank with silver threads and sketches. When you have 40 silks, head back to bank and start tailoring. If that's not easy, then I don't know what is....<br />
<br />
I will use the patches until the armor combines are trivial. Wu's is much more troublesome, those **** kiolas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sacred tunare silk is a very good option also, altho probably more time consuming than crystalline silk armor to make</div></div><hr />

Wu's is a pain in the a**.  Do the Crystalline Silk stuff first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Liwsa</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spiders drop about 1 silk per kill average(some you get none others you get 2-3).  Farming spiders at 41 will give you very good exp and you get the silks as a bonus.  The best thing in the world is getting your components off mobs you get exp on.  Of course this is not the case on level 60 mobs hehehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zebroxks</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would also reccomend doing Crystaline silk till it trivials. out. If your high enough i power leveled a monk there soloing for exchange in silks. Its by far better than Wu's. Heady koilas are a pain to brew</div></div><hr />

I wish I had done that... making/buying them now is not fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meirril</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">actualy, if ya have a source of imbuned emeralds I'd make the tunare silk and sell it. The lower level you are the less cash you have available from hunting, the more you need to make in the bazaar/trading to keep doing tradeskills. <br />
on the spiders: try soloing, don't be bashful about running for your life. The spiders should give good xp at 41, if you can handle the constant threat of adds (lots of wanderers, and the crystaline spiderlings should be annoyingly green. Luckly they still drop silk). If you can manage the initial break of 2 spiders, you should be fine. Also, you'll make enough cash farming the spiders to pay for a few threads. Bringing bandages, food and water to sell to people doing Geos would make some extra plat (as would charaging for ports from there). If CC is an active place on your server it could be very good to you. One little suggestion: spend a few hours and kill enough orcs to use the vendors in CC.</div></div><hr />

Queen is Lb to lvl 60 and she sux. Imho i couldnt take her down with me 55 bard (dam indoor zones) Queen sux, and at 41 you'll be getting decent exp from these things. Most DB some Lb. I know cause i went from 36 to 40 at Geo's and was constantly tracking for there pops and the whole time spiders were on the list. from 36 to about 38 i would get occasional even cons then from 39 and up nothing but DB. Some will be Lb to ya at 41. <br />
Shouldnt be a prob for ya unless ya get more than 2 or 3. (ouch) <br />
FYI im not sure if coldain will kill spiders. I know they dont touch Geo's and pretty sure they dont touch the (big white Stalagmites) Anyhow FYI you might not wanna train there as u probably wont get much help. Plus if your not KoS to Geo's (You shouldnt be at lvl 41) You could just as easily zone to EW fyi watch out for the ring spawned rogue who spawns there he hits upwards of 180's and will backstab ya like a beast. He usually isnt up but if he is he'll be up right in front of zone out. Its also a one way zone outa CC from Geo caves so ull have to go back in through fort. <br />

Those are basics hope it helps.<br />

They kill spiders and terrors.  One time when I was fighting in CC with my monk, someone had trained the Historian down to the top of the spider hallway.  Was a good thing when i got too many, but was a bad thing to the ks'ing little &amp;%$&amp;^$.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lunaire</div><div class="date">02-03-2003, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the help and advice... it helped a lot.<br />
<br />
Breaking the double spawn at the entrance to the hallway was easy for me.  At 41 (dinged 42 there - woohoo!) at least half, and closer to 2/3, of the spiders I saw were light blue, so i could head into geo hall invis, and root the one that can be seen from there.  If the other of the pair was light blue, it would not aggro until the other spider broke root.  If it was dk blue, it came over right away.  From there it was a simple case of root and nuke, reapplying root and moving as necessary.  I fought in the little room at the entrance to the tunnel, and never once got aggro from the stalag terrors a little farther up.  With KEI (and Aego - got lucky and someone MGB'd while i was getting crack) I had no problems clearing back to the 3-spawn of spiders.  I consider my gear mediocre, but I could still kill 4 or 5 spiders before running oom and needing to harvest and med.<br />
<br />
One other thing of note: a coldain WANDERED down into the spider hall.  He wasn't trained in, and was called Scout something-or-other.  Conned light blue, but beat the piss out of 3 spiders before a group took him out.  I kind of used him as a meat shield while i nuked ones he wasn't fighting  :D <br />

<br />
As a 55 Pally, I was able to farm silks in CC for an hour or two, plus /ooc buying stacks of cryst silks 75pp and pretty easily and quickly get 6-8 stacks of silks.  Other than when I pulled the queen at half health w/ no LoH and she killed me.  DOH.  Stupid dorf.<br />
<br />
With 227 WIS, I skilled up from 115 to 130 on approx. 40 combines.  I was very happy w/ the rate, and know it won't last LoL.  Didn't get the final skill up to 131 but I'll pick it up tonight easily.<br />
<br />
Wu's is next...  Have friend making vials for me, and buying kiolas in Baz for 1p a pop.  Wish me luck.</div></div><hr />

I can make stacks for very little money. A good place to do it is in South Qeynos, at the Fish's Ale tavern I think, you can buy Kiola sap and right across from it in the next building, you can buy water and bottles.<br />

We all know they're simple to make, but tedious. Tailors gain a special type of irritation from those mind-numbing trivial combines, but if you like making them, GL and toss some on a trader to share your joy with the rest of the Norrathians   :)</div></div><hr />

Yeah its tedious but so are a lot of th eother carpel tunnel skills, like baking. I am only at 81 in tailoring and beginning to start Quivers but if the only reason NOT to do Wu's is because of the tediousness in Kioals maybe I should visit Kelethin again and start selling them in bazaar. Perhaps a profit is to be made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chenier</div><div class="date">02-18-2003, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, you trade kiola's for celestial essences eventually, which may have less components, but you need way more per real tailoring combine.<br />
<br />
I cringe everytime I'm doing a &quot;precombine&quot; day in EQ and my boyfriend asks me if I got any skill ups. &quot;No dear...just doing precombines.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think I hear him say &quot;You're nuts&quot; under his breath as he walks away, but I can't be sure...<br />
<br />
***<br />
I agree, do the crys silk before Wu's. If you had a ton of cash, then yes, make sacred tunare silks and either save them (if you tend to go higher than 158, then save them) or sell them (you don't intend to go higher or you're broke). But if you don't have that kind of cash yet, then stick with crys silk and then move onto Wu's.<br />
<br />
Dang, Wu's seemed like soooo long ago...</div></div><hr />
