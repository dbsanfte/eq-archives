Any clue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bearcaller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most interesting....never seen that one before.  Working 3rd shift tonight but will give it a shot on my tinkerer in the morning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ilona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Looks like something with levitate effect - that would be cool!<br />
<br />
Any idea where the large black lodestones come from?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Purchased in POK, the female gnome in the room above the smithy house. like 80 or 130p or so, not cheap.<br />
<br />
The item has no effects, stats, anything. Looks like a quest item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just made one yesterday. Hm, maybe it's a component for a new recipe to make levitation devices? The other one, Fizbin's Guise, looks interesting. But I've had no luck trying to find any reference to mottled cloak anywhere. Pickbringer's gloves at least show up on lucy, so presumably the flame bolt recipe can be done as is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mavick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Perhaps this is a unit that will need to be powered by (read: combined again with) a battery or (dare I say) a force module.  We've already seen that with the air pump and steam pump for the Maximizing and Minimizing devices.  <br />
<br />
Also... this is the first recipe I'm aware of that uses the Lodestones.<br />
<br />
Mavick- for Props who still hasn't tinkered a stool tall enough to reach the keyboard!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wild speculation here on my behalf (because tame speculation isn't as much fun) but the name for the guise that was in the tinkering list reminds me of the illusion guises. Perhaps some sort of an illusion device powered by the shaman potions? If not, any stray SOE person wandering through threads is welcome to use that idea. ;)<br />
<br />
Either way I seem to recall them mentioning something about putting in more tinkering recipes and making tinkering more useful so I'm thinking we'll see more goodies to make in the game in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Libbie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would guess that the mottled cloak is a tailored item perhaps? <br />
 There are mottled spiroc feathers in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lyron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Likely the ani-grav unit is a levitation device, and they just havent gotten around to putting the effect on it.<br />
<br />
Fizben's Guise sounds a lot like a gnome illusion mask.  IS ther a dropped one in-game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>caena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah.<br />
<br />
It drops in Sleeper's Tomb.  <br />
<br />
So not exactly awfully common.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Gnome illusion mask dropped off one of the warders in ST pre awakening.<br />
<br />
On 95% of servers it doesn't drop anymore.<br />
<br />
Its tradeable though if you have a lot of cash and really want one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I must admit, however, that it would be very very very cool to be able to tinker a Gnome Illusion item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Arrica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hate to dig this one up, but, I had a lightbulb click earlier while at work.  What if the Anti-Grav unit is &quot;working as intended&quot;?  Granted, this is a good bit out of left field, but knowing Sony, you never know.  My thought is:  What are the chances it's a weight reduction device; either placed in a top level inventory slot, or similar to stat food, the very first item slot.  I would try this, but for the moment I'm at a friends who doesn't have EQ :eek:.  May try it when I next get the chance.  If anyone tries before then, please post results.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Update:  Tried it out this morning, no change to amount of weight, had to log for a few hours to do some errands, about to log back in, will try identify, see what that says.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Giordiino</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">anyone try casting identify on it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dyllwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Originally posted by Arrica <br />
or similar to stat food, the very first item slot <br />
<br />
Just wanted to point out, stat food/drink doesn't have to be in the first slot, it just has to be above any other food/drink in your inventory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well, yeah, just I used fewer words to say it. :D  That, and I always keep them in first slot anyway, that way there's no worries. :) <br />
<br />
Back to the original topic, I did try Identify on the Anti-Grav, just gave me:  Item Lore: Nantiks' Anti-Gravity Unit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aryse Andenter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Did anybody ever do any more experimenting with this, or turn anything up? Haven't heard anything about it for a while, but I still have one in the bank, taking up space and making me curious.  :)</div></div><hr />
