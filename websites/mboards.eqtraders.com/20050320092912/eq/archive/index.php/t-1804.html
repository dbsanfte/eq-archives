<br />
The new quest system where it lets you track it is awesome...<br />
<br />
Being able to ask a guide where to go and follow them for the next part of your quest was just fantastic.<br />
<br />
I, being lazy, went out shortly after exploring to twink myself.  Put on approx 300pp worth of stuff, another 300pp for new twink to buy spells etc.  Also a couple borrowed items that cost nothing because I already had them, but worth maybe another 1500.<br />
<br />
So I attack a guard, go back home and start killing things.  There are literally hundreds of new froggies, but spawns are very very quick, and I can find spiderlings and harvester snakes enough to keep me going....<br />
<br />
So I go to the vendor near the spawn point and notice spiderling silks... being me, I had to buy him out... at 1.2pp per stack...  the guy had 370 or so.<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
I keep hunting, and check back every twenty minutes or so, and sure enough another 2-3 stacks from the hundred newbie frogs farming for me.<br />
<br />
Ended up with over 600 before I decided to leave the zone for better pastures.....<br />
<br />
120 sold for 400pp, so my little toon has already paid for all his &quot;twink&quot; gear that was bought, and made up for some of the cash given him unspent.  Not to mention the almost 500 spiderling silks left... <br />
<br />
So basically had a fantastic time, and in 4 hours my twink more than paid for himself.<br />
<br />
Just gotta get rid of the rest of that silk before the market crashes, darn bazaar bug only allowing people to buy 1 from a stack of items :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phabos</div><div class="date">02-25-2003, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about all the folks who made plat selling dyes? I bought 10 and sold 6 for 500pp. According the serverwide.eqtraders, not only was I on the far low end, I didn't log on until far late in game. Some people were claiming several thousand pp profit after just a few hours after the servers came up. <br />
<br />
Then, as always, the market came crashing down, and people were selling at or just above cost. :( If only I had skipped class...<br />

Any suggestions for a sig?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Selling spiderling silk slightly under the average price in bazaar isn't, IMHO.<br />
<br />
;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, but it was still kinda fun...<br />
<br />
Like I kind of said somewhere else, &quot;Never give a sucker an even break&quot; + &quot;There's a sucker born every minute&quot; = More Profit for me. <br />
<br />
Someone didn't want to get brewing/alchemy up, I was more than willing to relieve them of their plat. <br />
<br />
But that's just me. :)<br />
