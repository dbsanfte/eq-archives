As a ranger, I rather liked this effect.  And the arrows sticking into the walls were kinda neat too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mileron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most vendors in PoTranquility are broken, and keep falling through the floor or pathing back and forth at their spawn points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ah, is this serverwide?  I saw it on Veeshan and assumed someone had aggroed the merchants, causing them move out of their default spots and not be able to return.  I petitioned hoping to get the merchants GM-killed and reset.  However, if the problem is serverwide, that suggests that a change to the collision system has caused them to be unable to reach their previously-assigned spot.<br />
<br />
Is this happening in any other zone, or only in PoT?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cubwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I only saw it in PoT. If you're persistent, you could activate the fidgety vendors by targeting them and spamming the 'U' key until you catch them at their spawn point. Was unable to use the ones that were falling through the ground, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kcalehc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What was wrong with the collsision system before anyway?  All I can see is that things are worse now that they have 'fixed' it...<br />
<br />
and that ****ed autoduck thingy, depite having it turned off my character still ducks upon reaching barriers that in the past I would simply have run straight over (eg that little hand cart outside of Dogle Pitt's bank in PoK, used to just run clear over the top of it no problems, now I duck everytime I hit it.  Very irritating).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What was wrong with the collsision system before anyway?I've heard that the new system takes much less processing power.  It should help people's systems run more smoothly.  So I've heard, anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Saw a case of this in PoT as well.  Some folks were trying to do the 500pp Ornate hand-in to Bor Wharhammer.  Nobody could find him.  I stood near his spot and did a &quot;/target bor&quot; and was able to target him, and if I stood near his spot I could hail him and he would respond, however it seemed he was stuck under the floor beneath his normal spot.<br />
<br />
I tried aggroing him to pull him out into the open, but of course that didn't work out (PoK/PoT NPC combat rules).</div></div><hr />
