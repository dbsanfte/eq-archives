Somebody is selling 50+ of them for 500pp each. <br />
<br />
Trying to collect another 100 hides for my next tailoring run after I triv the first Eurdite robe. I'll pay 150pp for any hides, but can't see paying 3+ times that amount for each hide. <br />
<br />
I know prices sometimes goes up if the tribals are in charge, but I normally see the hoppers up anyways. Plus its been like this for two weeks now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angelsyn</div><div class="date">04-27-2003, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why?<br />
<br />
Because Tradeskills are on the rise again. ;)<br />
<br />
Or, at least people think tradeskills are on the rise again.<br />
<br />
It's just like why you'll probably rarely see Hero Sandwiches or Justice Fruit Pies for sale anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axly</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't ya just love it? People selling old research materials (Specifically Rune of Inverse and Words of Ethereal) for 300-500pp. And we get to turn these into robes that only sell for 250 or so. What are these vendors smoking? If it weren't for my guild keeping an eye out for these drops, my tailoring wouldn't be going anywhere.<br />
<br />
And don't even get me started on Dye! It sells well at 75-100pp because people are willing to pay that much. So why do vendors come along and price it at 42-45? They're just screwing themselves out of cash and reducing the value, in most cases, of their hard-earned trade skills.<br />
<br />
It just makes me laugh anymore.<br />
<br />
At least blue diamonds are getting cheaper! I've never seen so many at sub-400pp prices. There's one thing we can be happy about.<br />
<br />
Thank you all for letting me rant and de-stress today. :twisted:</div></div><hr />
