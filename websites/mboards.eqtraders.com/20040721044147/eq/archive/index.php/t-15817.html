<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just had a quick idea....<br />
<br />
If they are looking for a way to 'iron out' tailoring.<br />
<br />
Lower the triv on Velious stuff.....<br />
<br />
Instead of 300and whatever, make it 255 or something like that.<br />
<br />
Wouldnt outballance the skill.... or bring loads of new gear into the game cos we still create more than could ever be used at the moment.<br />
<br />
It would just make that 220 to 250 stage a little more ironed out???<br />
<br />
Discuss.....&gt;</div></div><hr />

(wow the message has to be 10 characters  :( )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Personally, I don't see a problem from 230 to 250.  There are lots of different recipes you can use for skillups -- Arctic Wyvern, Cobalt Drake, Reinforced Acrylia, Tigeraptor, Holgresh fur, Othmir fur, all these just off the top of my head.<br />
<br />
I do see an issue in the 190-230 range, though.  If you're not of a race that can make the LoY robes or cultural tailoring, there isn't a whole lot you can make around there for skillups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>tibbwini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh, definately. ^^^^^^^<br />
<br />
180-200 is proving to be pure pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Heartsong_Steelsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just remember, while we occasionally see developers post on these boards, never assume someone might read things here.  You may want to take a look at the re-expanded Sony boards as somewhere to post.<br />
<br />
I will, however, leave this open unless someone starts actually bashing developers and the like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't think lowering the velious armor will help tailors much.  They will still be the same amount of annoyance to farm for.  You will just end up making more of them, and who needs that.  To make a real bridge in tailoring, new recipes need to be added that do not require the same ingredients.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This was just a quick idea i had when i was about to leave work so i didnt give it a lot of thought or spend much time posting it.<br />
<br />
Some extra comments may help you see where i am coming from with this....<br />
<br />
1. It wouldnt make tailoring too much easier as the velious stuff is still a pain to collect components for.<br />
<br />
2. The market would hardly be flooded with new stuff, cos A: we tend to make the one stud/boning items that arn't much good. and B: nobody uses the stuff anyway.<br />
<br />
3. Adding new recipies.... if new things are added i would presume the stats are going to reflect the level of the overall game as it is now (or in the next expansion).... and that iwould be better stats than Velious.<br />
<br />
4. So i asked myself why are velious level armor just as hard (triv) as POP???<br />
<br />
<br />
So in my head i seemed that if a way to iron out the 200+ tailoring was beeing looked at, lowering the triv on velious stuff would be a simple and effective way of doing that.<br />
<br />
AND, if you wanted new recipies, they could be implemented (with usable stats) and the triv on them jacked up to the current velious level (335 or whatever it is)<br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
Anyway, it was a quick idea that i wanted to try out on my fellow tailors and get a discussion going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">From that perspective, it might then make sense to drop the trivials down to about 230 or so on SOME of the Velious leathers (not all), and add new items as a skill-up route with trivials around 335.  If you make these items usable (like the Velious leathers were back when they were released), that might make for a valid strategy.<br />
<br />
I'd have to think about it a lot more, though, before I could endorse it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Maybe spread out the trivials on Velious...<br />
<br />
230 for 1 stud/boning items<br />
240 for 2<br />
250 for 3<br />
<br />
?????</div></div><hr />
