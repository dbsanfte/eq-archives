<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My lvl 6 Beastlord can no longer kill things well enough with his Dagger*, so I went to the advanced search to see what a dwarven smith can make...<br />
<br />
I clicked primary slot, Iksar, and BST, and left the 'title' field blank (thus, in theory, returning anything that an Ikky Beast can hold in his right hand, even things that weren't weapons...)...<br />
<br />
and got 9046 entries. <br />
It looks like it's dumping the entire database at me.... <br />
<br />
o_0<br />
<br />
Ear Elf Druid... same thing. <br />
Ear Elf Beast...  rinse, repeat. <br />
<br />
Did I break something? Did something else break something? Did the search function never function this way, and I merely hallucinated for a while?  If I put 'dagger' in the search field, it does work as anticipated...  but that's a rather 'narrow' search... esp if i were to try to make a 1hb... or... well, do you see? <br />
<br />
So, do I take the fairly long way in finding a better weapon, or did I really 'killzor' something nicely here? <br />
<br />
/apologies if I messed somethin' up...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That is kinda odd.  Experimenting, I put chest, dwarf, paladin in.  If I put &quot;plate&quot; as the search text, I get boots, bracers, molds, and whatnot as well - and its the same number of hits as just putting in &quot;plate&quot; into the regular search engine, without the slot/race/class checkboxes.<br />
<br />
I tried it both with the radio buttons on &quot;or&quot; and on &quot;and&quot; and got the same results, if you're curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There seems to be a glitch with the advaced search for mobs and items. <br />
<br />
Ngreth is looking at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">bah.  It is not consistant.<br />
<br />
This my take a while, and I may need more instances to fix it.<br />
<br />
I got it to do it ONCE...  the rest of the time it did proper search.  So if you get a &quot;full hit&quot; search... just start over and try again.</div></div><hr />
