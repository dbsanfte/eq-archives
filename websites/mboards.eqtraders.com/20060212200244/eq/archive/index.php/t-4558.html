<br />
I'm a broke 51 Necro in dire need of coin. The over-camping and bickering associated with farming gear drops is driving me insane. <br />
<br />
I figured I'd drop by here and offer my farming services to anyone that needs tradeskilling ingredients. <br />
<br />
What items would ya'll be intrested in buying in the bazaar instead of makeing/farming? How much would be a fair price for those items? <br />
<br />
If you need something and I'm in-game, just shoot me a /tell. Or reply to this post with an order, outlining the items, price you'll pay and when/where you'd like it delivered. I'll respond to confirm and we can go from there. <br />
<br />
I'm off the level grind until I can upgrade gear . . . and that will be a while . . . so give me your grunt work and we'll both make a little coin in the process. <br />

<br />
You farm Velium Hound Furs and Velium Blocks and I will make you the armour for you to sell in bazaar or where ever.<br />
<br />
3 Blocks and 1 fur is needed for each part some parts less but Ill keep the change oki : ) I can make you all the parts except BP and LEGS.<br />
<br />
All I ask in return is some Griffon or Anaconda meat from JP Forest lets say 1 stack per item does this sound fair ??<br />
<br />
Look in bazaar for Engraved Royal Velium Armour and see what prices it goes for I think you will be happy<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dynaen</div><div class="date">04-10-2003, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hiya Tiddo.  )  If you're interested, there's a few things I'm looking for as well.<br />
<br />
Velium, and lots of it.  Fairly easily farmed in Crystal Caverns, drops of orc miners.  I'll pay 15pp per small piece, or 30 per small or large brick, or block (I just chisel them down into pieces).  I'll buy as much as you can get.  If you have a so-so smithing skill, you could chisel the bricks down yourself in the dwarf area of CC to make room and just make stacks.  I'm looking at needing at least 18 stacks of small pieces.  )<br />
<br />
Spider Silk - Paying 4pp per silk, 8pp per swatch.  I'll buy up to at least 30 stacks of swatches (60 stacks of silks).<br />
<br />
Drop me a tell or post here if you're interested.  )<br />
