I've got about a dozen blocks of velium, and 5 complete stacks of small pieces of velium.<br />
<br />
75 plat per block, and 500 plat per stack ONRO.<br />
Post reply here, PM me here or at www.pwned.com or send me a tell (GMT timezone).</div></div><hr />

Your prices are about 5X too much.  You are being underbid constantly.  I would be willing to buy the small pieces off you for 200pp per stack.<br />

Was I wrong?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no way i would buy stacks of velium at 500pp, I am skint enough as it is.  200 yes i probably would pay, just the thought of the 4k needed to buy Velium Temper to turn your velium into studs make me shudder!<br />
<br />
Banditfist : If you dont buy this gentlemans Vellium, let me know, I will....  God i am beginning to think i will never get my tailoring up.</div></div><hr />

OK, fair enough. I'll try hawking them cheaper in the Bazaar for a bit, and I'll keep an eye out for you two.<br />
<br />
Reason for selling is mainly to clear out bank vault for lots and lots of spider silk/crystalline silk, btw, so I'm beginning to understand the fun you can have with tradeskills :)</div></div><hr />

Oh, and I've got about 3 stacks of leather padding going at market rate (whatever that is at this time :D) and more to come.</div></div><hr />
