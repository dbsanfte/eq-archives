<br />
I was just wondering if you were still ammendable to selling your combine services for some steelweave armor, specifically a bracer and belt.  I've collected a few combine components and am currently working my brewing up to make the tempers and am also trying to get the imbued topazes.  I hope to have everything ready next week.  If you are agreeable, may I ask what your pricing policy is?  Thank you very much.<br />
<br />
Also, please feel free to contact me in game.  I noticed that Ucchan was in Plane of Water last night and didn't want to bother you with tells on a possible raid.<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />

<br />
As for pricing since you are getting the ingredients. What do you think is an appropriate amount. I was looking though some of the pricing threads and the only one i saw was some guy charging 1K per silk .</div></div><hr />
