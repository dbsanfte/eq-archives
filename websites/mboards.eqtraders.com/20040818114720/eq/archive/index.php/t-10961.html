<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">made 329 heady kiolas using the bottles from faydwer shaker skilling up.  sold for 1k.  now + money for tradeskilling.  :)  dont think it will happen again for a long time.  thankfully ore drops for ornate in blacksmithing.  gonna bite when i have to buy the folded sheets.  also did the restocking ore quest for money.  about 32 for 4 large bricks off merchants and get 44pp from the quest.  anything to get to 2k. only about 300 away now.  i just so happy.  wanted to share.  bonus a bud bought 2 stacks of 2x brewed 2x stout dwarven ale, 43 faydwer shakers, and 36 skull ale for 50pp from me.  paid for the skilling up from 151 to 165 so far.  i just happy i breaking even on tradeskills atm.  take so much time from everything else its nice when they make a little money for me.</div></div><hr />
