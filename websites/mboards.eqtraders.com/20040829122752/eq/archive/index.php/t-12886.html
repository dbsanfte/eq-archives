I've been attempting to lvl up my 24 chanter in jewelry.  He has 231 int.  Once I reached about 180 I found that he skillups totally died.  Runs of 160 combines with no skillup seem to be the norm and as you can imagine it is getting a tad costly.  <br />
<br />
I don't recall this rough patch when I went to 235 JC with my pally or I leveled her to gm smithing.<br />
<br />
<br />
I skilled the chanter from 5 to 205 yesterday, but man is this painful.  I guess I just want to know if this is the norm or if I've just hit a bad run with the RNG.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, any info would be good.  I'm primarily skilling up so he can have the trophy... and make stuff for friends.<br />
<br />
Hehe, guess more than anything I just needed a place to whine hehe.<br />
<br />
Merry Christmas :angel:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Trade skills usually have a difficult bit from the 185-212 range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">lothay is correct but the snage cn hit as high as 249 though it is rarer.  good luck and merry christmas.<br />
<br />
if you use geerlock and stay next to triv you can get gm in jc for 10kish without too much luck involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye it can happen, Overall the RNG has been good to me I guess, although I believe alot of that is Karma from my 1200+ combines to get from 199 to 200 in brewing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mdaisy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just spent over 15K goring from 192 to 220.  Think the 10K figure is out the windows with these latest patches.  Taking over 60 combines per level so far.  Although from 192 to 215 was about 80-100 combines quite a few times...  Looking at spending another 45K to get to 250 if this keeps up.</div></div><hr />
