<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How I hate that it takes 4 Tempers to make a 1 sheet Plate item for pop armor! may the gods themselves be brought down for making it this way... Ohhh wait that is the point of PoP... Well I still hate the fact that I have to collect so many Tempers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have made a few pieces of plate, and last night agreed to make hurricane chain sleeves. <br />
<br />
Having not made the chain, and not really paying close attention to the recipe, I was almost surprised when I only needed TWO tempers TOTAL for a two ring item.<br />
<br />
The decrepancy between the plate and the chain is kind of ridiculous. Ok, fine, require a temper to make the sheets, but COME ON, TWO tempers to make a @#&amp;%*% chain jointing.<br />
<br />
The plate shouldn't require over twice the tempers to make. Its not that much better.</div></div><hr />
