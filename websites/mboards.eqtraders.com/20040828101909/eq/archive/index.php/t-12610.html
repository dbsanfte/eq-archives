<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aellas_Vesshan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Below is my guide for baking I hope you all like it would appreciate feed back and if the people at EQTC think it is worthy I hope it makes it to the learn baking section.<br />
<br />
            Aellas Guide to Baking your way to 250<br />
<br />
This Guide is how to power bake your way to a gm baker but baking getting your baking to 250 is not easy.  So if you still want to be a gm baker or even get your skill up to 191 be prepared to spend a lot of time with your spit or oven.  Oh and just for reference on combines items such as filleting knifes, non-stick frying pans, pie tins, pots, and casserole dishes will be return on combine with a success or a failure.   Also a tanaan oven is an oven in Pok and combines can be made in collapsible spits<br />
<br />
<br />
Skill to 143<br />
Bear or lion meat filets<br />
1.Buy a lot of Bear or Lion meat which is sold in Shadow Haven (the merchant is near the bank)<br />
2.Get filleting knife (player made smiting)<br />
3.Combined one piece of meat with filleting knife in oven or and viola bear filets<br />
<br />
Skill 143-191<br />
Patty Melts<br />
1.Buy our old friend bear or lion meat<br />
2.Buy loafs of bread<br />
3.Buy Cheese which is sold in Jagged Pine Forest by Chef Brargus (he is a dark paw gnoll)<br />
4.Get Non-stick frying pan (player made smithing cost bought 100pp in bazaar)<br />
5.Combine 1 bear or lion meat, 1 loaf of bread, 1 cheese, and non-stick frying pan in oven or spit<br />
<br />
Here is where things get tricky up to here you have been able to get skill ups without farming now you must farm or go to bazaar, or constantly shop the vendors.  I see pop baking as the best way to hit 250.<br />
<br />
Skill 191-202<br />
Candied Cockroach<br />
1.Get Cockroaches (foraged in Cod)<br />
2.Cup of Sugar (sold in Pok)<br />
3.Water flask<br />
4.Combine 4 cockroaches, 1 cup of sugar, and 1 water flask in a tanaan oven and viola 4 candied cockroaches<br />
Candied Cockroach: Snack sv disease +5 weight .5<br />
<br />
Skill 202-250<br />
Assuming you can hunt in Bastions of Thunder you have two options Jord Meat Pie or Vann toe stew<br />
Jord Meat Pie<br />
1.Jord Meat (dropped by Jords in Bot)<br />
2. Clumps of Dough (player made baking) recipe: 1 egg( snake, drake, avaik dragon¡_..) , bottle of milk, and cup of flour combine in mixing bowl<br />
3.Get a Pie tin<br />
4. Combine 1 Jord meat, 1 clump of dough, and a pie tin in tanaan oven and viola one jord meat pie<br />

Vann Toe Stew: Feast Str +3  Mana +45 weight 1.0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i prefered fish rolls cause they lasted longer and make great filler food for later to force eat.  halas meat pies are just anoyying but them and mtps are also good recipes.  i understand you you were going for a route for peeps 46+ and planar though.  :D not bad though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aellas_Vesshan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yuk I hate fish eeewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww :boggled: but yes fish rolls are not a bad option.  Also fish rolls trivial at 135 and filets at 143 that is why i like them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thought it was 142? oh well no matter.  up to 212 now and still have some fish rolls on alts i find every now and then.  about to start using Halas pies for alt filler food.  bazaar is still 3pp for them.  at 4pp or 5pp i would sell them.  3pp is kinda insulting considering the amount of time in them.  they will go to friends and guildies and alts first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you're got PoP access, you can also do some other planer combines, all triv at/over 250:<br />
<br />
Swamp Rat Crunchies=frosting + swamp rat parts + skewers<br />
Boar Chops = Boar meat + garnish + spices<br />
Mephit Sandwich = Dressing + loaf of bread + mephit meat<br />
<br />
Personally, I enjoy fish rolls.  Of course, I'm an Iksar, so I'm partial to fish.  Of course, you have to make sure you don't cook it too long or you ruin the flavor.  Give me my fish Fresh and W-w-w-wriggley!<br />
<br />
And I also like pasta.  One spices + one noodles + one jug of sauces to get to 191.  Farming for eggs, but that's it and it's way cheaper than the method you put forth.<br />
<br />
To each their own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aellas_Vesshan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well  the idea of the guide is to do as little farming as possible.  Also a lot of people are not do not have acess to plane of tactics and other elemental planes.  I just got acess to tactics tonight,:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cragzop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I disagree with PoP being the way to go at the high end. Call me old fashioned or plain stubborn. I chose to click subcombines rather than farm for cockroaches etc. But then again, I can't forage.<br />
<br />
I opted for MTP from 190s to 250.  Easy ingredients, useful stat food and a decent money maker.<br />
<br />
An hour killing brownies in LFay (brownie parts), an hour killing basilisks (eggs) in Jagged Pine, easy bazzar items (foraged fruit and even eggs if you want to skip JP) and then never leave SH. Everything else is right there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aellas_Vesshan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">another option for reaching 202 is Ohbah Truffles they are better than cockroaches and i am sorry i didn't put them on the list cause i found that they are cheaper to make and much easier to get the ingredients since only mushrooms are foraged.  I will post a updated version of this guide after i see options the new expansion gives bakers for skill ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">pp was a prob for me.  mtps paid for themselves a good bit.  i can't forage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>couyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">well i just spend a great deal of time baking the fish roll - patty melt - halas pie route. while i was doing the halas pies, it hit me with the &quot;here`s your sign&quot;. sure you can make fish rolls till 135 then move on but like he said to make meat fillets instead, is a good idea. esp. since your gonna need them later. so instead of spending plat. on other items. look at the high lvl recipe subcombines and plan your route from it and make those items to raise skill and save for future use. it might take alil more time to get up there but it is the same plat. you will spend on those subs later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aellas_Vesshan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There are some wonderful options for skill up now that God came out.  I add these and more things to the guide as soon as i learn more recipes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Setral</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">GoD has definately given some nice alternatives, since all of the meats are fished or foraged. So alot of it gets dropped onto vendors, then add to that the other ingredients are all found on the Queen of Thorns =)<br />
