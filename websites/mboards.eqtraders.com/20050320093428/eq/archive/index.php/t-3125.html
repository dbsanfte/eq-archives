<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Larong_Alsou</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 05:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings all,<br />
<br />
I recently levelled an enchanter to 16 and stuck a point into research. However, I am a little confused as to how the skill increases.<br />
<br />
I have read all there is on Casters Realm, and Xornn's excellent Enchanters guide, but I still dont appear to be getting any increases in the skill.<br />
<br />
So far I have gathered, in one way or another, enough components to make 30 each of the two entry level runes (Practice Azia/Beza, &quot;trivial&quot; at 21) and combined these (one of each, just to clarify) in my enchanters Tomb of Endless Enchantments, making 20 complete practice runes (which dont stack... ARGH!)<br />
<br />
Throughout the whole time, both during making the practice runes and the completed ones, I never once saw a skill up.<br />
<br />
My Enchanters Int is at 157, fyi.<br />
<br />
Is there something I am missing? According to both CR and Xornn's site, research should increase pretty quickly, and I thought the whole purpose of the Concordance of Research quests was to assist that, thus saving the spell pages for when you have a better chance of making the spell.<br />
<br />
I ask this here as I know that there are a few Pure Casters out there who frequent these boards, and any advice offered would be appreicated.<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curufea</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it's pretty simple : <br />
the maximum you can reach in research skill is level dependent : <br />
at 16 you can train 1 points and you get to 16<br />
<br />
After that you need to wait untill 19, then you can train up to (lvl-15)*5<br />
<br />
You just waisted all of your time practicing =(<br />
<br />
on the other end, enchanters have an advantage in this skill : <br />
vendor farm for &quot;faded&quot; pages and combine them alone in your tome of endless enchantment. they trivial well over your current skill and costs a couple of gold each on merchants, giving you cheap and easy skill increases.<br />
<br />
But you *need* to wait 19 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Larong_Alsou</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I guess I can get back to levelling again now. Probably buy Levitate and Disempower and just save the pages for Mesmorisation till I feel lucky ;)<br />
<br />
Atleast I hadnt invested too much time and money into the skill.<br />
<br />
Again, thanks for the response<br />
<br />
.... will have to re-read CR/Xornn's to see if I missed that little tidbit of information there ;)<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username"></div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been there... done that :(<br />
<br />
Spent an entire day gathering compontents for research quest, and all the guides said skill-ups are quick, like almost every combine.<br />
<br />
After a stack of combines, no skill-up, so I say &quot;What gives?&quot;<br />
<br />
I searched and found the formula lvl - 15 * 5 i think, meaning at lvl 16 you can have a max of 5, but train instantly to 16.<br />
<br />
Like the guy said above, you can't get better at research until level 19.<br />
<br />
I think there should be a major warning... as it is very sad to see this much time wasted by relatively smart people :(<br />
<br />
Research isn't worth it IMHO, I did end up making most of my spells, but for the time it took I could have bought each in bazaar and saved a whole lot of energy.  Most medium level research spells show up for 20pp or less in bazaar... which isn't much more than you pay for the vendor bought spells anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Clementine</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Urgh I hate research, such a pain to do! Unless you absolutely need that spell and have not been able to find it in the bazaar or /auction I wouldn't even bother doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cubwynn</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I always hated about that particular spell is that if you use it at the level you can cast it, it's pretty much a death sentence  wink  (though now that you can overwrite mezzes, I'm sure it's much more useful)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shatuk</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont understand something.  as a fletcher on my ranger I can right click and open the kit, then type in a word to find recipies for different arrows and bows to make, the components all show up for the recipie selected, showing me what I need to buy.  But my chanter's Tome of Endless Enchantments doesnt do that.  Is it suposed to? Im at a skill level of 28 at level 30 now, am I missing something?  I thought I could type in &quot;Spell&quot; or Spells, and have a list come up??? Whats up with that?  Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ngreth Thergn</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No spell is &quot;automatic&quot; (like some archery.  Automatic recipes are recipes everyone knows.<br />
<br />
all spells must be learned.  So you must &quot;experiment&quot; first, and actually make one, then you should be able to search on it.</div></div><hr />

Next time, come here first and read that skill's FAQ.<br />
<br />
From EQTC's very own Spell Research FAQ (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/showthread.php?t=6718) (found in the Spell Research forum):<br />
<br />
Q: I just put one point into research, and it wont let me train anymore! Why? <br />
<br />
A: The formula for the cap on research is 5 * (Your level - 15). At 16, you can only have 5 points in it. At 19, the skill cap is 20. This is why it is generally recommended that even though you can train research at level 16, you wait and put a point into research only at level 20, since you will automatically get a skill of 20 and can still skillup to 25 (skill cap at level 20.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nolrog</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing to note, that I don't think was mentioned above.  You can train research all the way to {edit: 200} at your guild master.  It's not that expensive to do either (at least around 170.)  For me, it's much easier to farm up some plat for the training, rather than a whole bunch of combines.</div></div><hr />
