<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azif Icared</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I'm starting to believe the rumors that Mastery AA abilities are broken... I've trained Alchemy Master 1,2 and since then have increased my average number of failed gate potions from 2 to 3 potions per 40 combines to 5 to 6 potions per 40 combines...  My non Alchemy Mastery combines numbered around 300 and I'm at close to 100 now for Alchemy Mastery combines.  Anyone else experienced this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have AM1, and so far have not seen a noticable difference in failure rates on Gate Potions.  Admittedly, my sample size is not very large, maybe 100 potions pre and post AM1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All ________ Mastery skills were broken in the Aug 27 patch. So far, they have only fixed Jewerly Mastery. In fact, dispite numerous /bug reports, they have never admitteAd anything was broke other than Jewerly Mastery, and have never said when or if they plan on fixing the remainer of the broken ones.</div></div><hr />
