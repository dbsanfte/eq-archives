[list]<br />
 In-progress tradeskill guides that are not currently hosted on the site<br />
 Links to tradeskill guides that you've written that are hosted elsewhere<br />

It is NOT for posting tradeskill questions!  If you have &quot;how do I&quot; or &quot;where do I find&quot; questions, they belong in the proper tradeskill forum. If you post those questions in this forum, they will be deleted.  Repeat offenders can/will be banned, as &quot;I didn't know we couldn't post that here&quot; is NOT an excuse, when this post is a sticky announcement.    If you refuse to spend the time to read this post and accept that it applies to you, then my moderators shouldn't have to spend their time cleaning up after you and rerouting your posts to the proper forum.  ;)</div></div><hr />

If you're posting links to personally-hosted guides or UI mods, PLEASE make a note if you want it added to the links page (when I get time to do a massive update). Listing on the main site's link page *may* cause a tad too many hits to your space, and I don't want anyone getting in trouble for exceeding their bandwidth due to eager tradeskillers pouncing on it.  ;)</div></div><hr />
