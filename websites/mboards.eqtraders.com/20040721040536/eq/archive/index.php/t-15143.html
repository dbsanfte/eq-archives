<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is the list of questions I plan to ask at the Fan Faire in April.  I have also sent this list in to the Developer's Corner.  The questions are arranged in categories, and within categories, they're sorted by most to least important.<br />
<br />
Past commentary has been removed to a new post lower in the thread.<br />
<br />
Game mechanics<br />
 Is there a greater chance of getting a skill-up with a sucessful combine than with a failed combine?<br />
 Is the chance for a skill-up greater for combines with trivials closer to your skill? i.e., Will you skill up from 0-20 in brewing in fewer combines (on average) making MHB (triv 248) or Short Beers (triv 31)?  This also relates to the tradeskill &quot;con colors&quot; in the new UI.<br />
 In the far past, Block to Large Brick to Small Brick conversions used to yield two of the smaller item when combined with a Chisel in a Forge.  (People who were grouped with the smith would see the message for two items being made.)  Due to limitations of the game engine at the time, though, the smith would only get one resulting item.  The recipe was changed to yield only one result (and thus one message).  Later on, the game engine was changed to allow duplicate results.  Is it possible to change these combines so that they again yield two of the result?  This applies to all types of ore, including store-bought Medium and High Quality ore, velium, acrylia, mithril, and others, including enchanted variants.<br />
 Can there be some exceptions made for the quest recipies not being learnable? (e.g. Enchanted Velium Bits, Vial of Velium Vapors subcombines)<br />
 Can the AutoInventory button on the new UI be made to put all the items back in your bags (for combines that return tools or have multiple yields)?  Alternately, could an &quot;Autoinventory All&quot; button be added?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Requested enhancements<br />
 A few months ago, the number of slots on a vendor was reduced from 100 (of which 20 were &quot;under the counter&quot;) to 80.  This took away the ability of players to &quot;vendor mine&quot; which served as both a plat sink and a way to increase the flow of usable items (particularly tradeskill supplies).  Are there any plans to restore those extra slots?<br />
 Given the number of drops added to spiderlings for newbie quests, the effective drop rate of spiderling silk has decreased hugely over the last year or so.  Could the drop rate be increased?<br />
 You can currently break down Fine Steel weapons to get various quantities of High Quality ore.  Could a similar conversion be added to convert Velium weapons to assorted blocks, bricks, and pieces of velium ore?<br />
 Could we please get bazaar tokens for non-weight-reducing bags? Examples include the reinforced jewelry kit, the black marble mortar and pestle, and the Deluxe Sewing Kit.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Previously promised or discussed<br />
 The disparity in the number of tempers and blocks of ore needed for plate vs. chain armor has long vexed smiths, particularly when dealing with very rare components like elemental smithing.  At the last Fan Faire, it was stated you would be reviewing this disparity.  Has anything come about on this front?<br />
 Alternately, for elemental combines, could each armor use two tempers?  One would be made with more common components, and used to make the subombines for elemental armors.  The current tempers (rare) would be used in the final combine of the armor.  This is a parallel to cultural smithing, which uses two different tempers.<br />
 Could the existing tradeskill trophys be adjusted so that each yields a unique 100% WR bag?  Thus, a person with three trophys could get three different 100% WR bags that don't poof on logging.  This was mentioned as being possible in the past.<br />
 What happened to Froglok cultural smithing?  The cultural forge is in Gukta, and Absor (Alan VanCouvering) posted shortly after LoY came out that Froglok cultural was complete.  In fact, he thought it had already gone live.  Any news on this front?<br />
 Also at the last Fan Faire, you mentioned that you would be investigating the PoJ prisoner who discusses making an arrow.  His text sounds a great deal like the description of a tradeskill combine, yet no recipe (or even matching components) have yet been found.  Is this in fact a valid recipe?  What hints or advice can you provide us regarding it?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Wishlist<br />
 The drop rate for the rare parts of elemental armors are incredibly low, and what few items drop are typically horded by upper-end guilds.  Could the drop rate be increased so as to allow a greater flow of the items into the general (non-uberguild) market?<br />
 Are there any alternative ways planned to help tradeskiller find rare items on vendors?  For example, it's often been suggested that when selling an item to a &quot;full&quot; vendor, it shouldn't automatically disappear.  Rather, the oldest player-sold item would poof and the item being sold would appear at the top of the list.  This would allow vendors to keep a &quot;rotating stock&quot; of player-sold items.<br />
 Is it possible to make recipes yield different amounts based on the skill of the tradeskiller?  e.g., allowing 6 or 7 arrows per combine rather than the normal 5 if your skill is far above the trivial.<br />
 Will Half-elves and Vah Shir be receiving any kind of cultural armor?  It doesn't have to be diety-specific, just race-specific.<br />
 Will frogloks receive LoY-style cultural robes?<br />
 Will cultural armor be added for Iksar Monks, Necromancers, and Beastlords?<br />
 Could we get a &quot;master recipe book&quot; that allows us to see all our learned recipes at once, regardless of tradeskills?  This would only apply for items that don't appear in tradeskill containers by default.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tradeskill quests<br />
 Currently, if a melee class player wanted to obtain the Phylactery, they would have to do the full Grand Robe of the Oracle quest.  However, the robe they obtain is useless to them, if they obtain it at all.  The Token of Service cannot be multi-quested with another player.  In short, melee classes get half the rewards from this quest that a caster class would get.  Are there plans to add an item equivalent to the Grand Robe or Tunic for melee classes?  Alternately, could the Token of Service be made tradable or MQ'able so as to provide some measure of compensation for melee classes that undertake the quest?<br />
 Any there any plans for more Coldain Prayer Shawl / Aid Grimel type quests?  Ideally, ones that require very high tradeskill levels, but no flagging requirements or access to restricted zones (since not everyone can get flagged).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
General<br />
 Will there ever be recipes (not quests) for new items that require more than one skill over 200 (because of nodrop subcombines)? Currently there is no significant need/use for the New Tanaan Crafting Mastery AA other than the Aid Grimel quest, that couldn't be handled just as well by several characters without the AA.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tradeskill super-trophies<br />
Are there any plans to add some kind of super trophy for multi-tradeskill GM's?  Here are some ideas on what could be done in this vein.<br />
 A tradeskill super-trophy is defined as a trophy you can only obtain once you have all seven tradekill trophies (excluding alchemy, poison making, tinkering, and research), or one that requires 250 in all seven general tradeskills, or both.<br />
 One possibility is a combine that requires all seven trophys plus some other item, yielding back six normal trophys and one super trophy with increased stats or abilities.  <br />
 Another option is for a no-fail combine of all seven trophies in a quest container to yield the super-trophy.  The super-trophy could be combined by itself in a forge to yield a no-drop, no-rent, lore item with a bonus to smithing; it could be combined in a tailoring kit or loom to yield a tailoring-boosting item, and so on.<br />
 Perhaps this super trophy could allow the wielder to exceed the 252 cap on tradeskills -- if it were a 10% mod for a 250 tradeskiller, the wielder's effective skill would be 275 rather than 252.  <br />
 Another popular option is to have the super-trophy reduce fail rates, much like the enchanter Jewelcrafting Mastery AA.  This reduces enchanters' lock on one tradeskill while still giving them an advantage -- the super-trophy requires being a GM in all seven tradeskills, whereas enchanters can get the same benefit purely with AA's.<br />
 Alternately, a single super-trophy with multiple tradeskill mods on it would also be nice.Questions I don't plan to ask personally<br />
<br />
Note that I personally don't agree with the implications of some of these questions, but I'm listing them here for completeness.<br />
<br />
 Are there any plans to add additional tinkered items to the game? A Collapsible Brew Barrel seems to be a very popular option.<br />
 Previously, it was mentioned that some tinkering components could be made stackable.  Is this still in the works?<br />
 Are there any plans to make Shawl, Oracle Robe, or Solstice earring quests with rewards aimed primarily at melee and hybrid classes?  Currently, all three of these quests provide rewards that are far more valuable to casters than to melee, and the Aid Grimel quest requires extensive flagging that not all players can get.<br />
 Will Celestial Essence still be makable in a Marble Mortar and Pestle?  With or without the new UI?<br />
 Are there any plans to improve the GM paths for smithing and tailoring?<br />
 Is it possible to implement a way to increase the yeild on some recepes and tradeskill recpes that are made from rare and/or hard to get supplies?<br />
 Will there be added Cultural Specific armor for Iksar Monk , Necromancer and Beastlord?<br />
 Will the Iksar Necromancer skullcap quests ever be finsihed so that the reward is appropriate for the amount of work that goes into making it, and more in line with the final items recieved for the Shaman/Monk and Shadow Knight Iksar's?<br />
 Could there be implented a quest that rewards people for improveing there faction with other races or races in general?<br />
 Why is LDoN Deep Cavern armor made using swamp temper made from pondweed, instead of from Deep Cavern Fungus? Did you put pondweed in the recipe by mistake?<br />
 How come halberds, axes, and scimitars were skipped in the new GoD weapon recipes, after being in all the other smithed weapon sets?<br />
 Is there a cap (hard or soft) on the additional chance for skill ups from having Int/Wis &gt;255? &gt;280? &gt;305?<br />
 Can NPC vendor decide not to try to resell loot whose only purpose in life is to be sold back to vendors?  That is, is it possible to delete items with no quest or tradeskill use (so-called cash drops) from vendor inventories as soon as they are sold?<br />
 Would it be possible to just make foraging automatic (ie every two minutes a new foraged items is dropped in your inventory). Maybe as an AA purchase.<br />
 Is it possible to have the forage engine check to see if you already have something that's lore before attempting to give you another lore item (e.g. Ripened Heartfruit) and give you something else instead?<br />
 Is there a plan to un-nerf fletching and pottery? They are not easy tradeskills to learn by far.<br />
 There needs to be some additional path to at least low 200s. The drop rate of superb and flawless rockhopper hides is simply too low to make them a viable skill up method.<br />
 Is it possible to add a Magus in the Abysmal Sea?  (On the ship, of course).<br />
 What is the purpose of the GoD tradeskill recipes? Almost all of the stuff made is almost totally useless considering the cost required and the recommended levels. In addition, the drop rate on most of the tradeskill items is horrible, meaning that it is not a viable skill up mechanism either.<br />
 Can we get quest NPC's who only offer tradeskill quests if you have your GM trophy? &quot;Show me the proof of your skill.&quot;<br />
 Please take Nitram Anizok, and move him to PoT. (Leaving a non-merchant NPC to trigger the Xanamech event).  Or make the items that ONLY he sells stack. Or make him near non-See Invis, KoS mobs.<br />
 Will pottery ever get some new (and accessible) recipes? It has been skipped in LoY and LDoN expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weberran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would also ask about the implementation on new items that appears since the recipe UI came into play. The only one off the top of my head are the goblin(fuzzy memory) pottery stuff that came out (uses something of rallos zek)... sorry early brain dead.. take pick ;)....<br />
<br />
<br />
Am sure there are lots of equivalents for other trade skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Re, the number of slots dropping from 100 (20 hidden) to 80, with no hidden.<br />
<br />
As per the last fan faire in Chicago, it was stated that this was done deliberately, and that the slots would not be restored. You can ask again, but you'll probably get the same answer.<br />
<br />
I LOVE the idea of rotating stock! Please try and get that question worked in... *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's been stated that there are around 3000 undiscovered recipies in the game. Are there any plans to add any hints in game to help in their discovery?<br />
<br />
I seem to recall something being mentioned about reviewing tinkering and possibly adding more things to make or making more components stack. Are there any plans to add more tinkered toys for the gnomes to make in the near future? Prehaps... dare I say it? Collapsible brew barrels? It's amazing what gnomes can cram into a bag. :p<br />
<br />
Any plans to make more solstice, shawl or Oracle type quests involving items with focus to melees? Meaning, while those quests produce excellent items they certainly have more casting focus than bashing focus so to speak.<br />
<br />
Any plans on making cross-trade items? Things like tinkered devices with charges powered by alchemical potions instead of mana batteries. Or smithed objects powered by poison refined fuel?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Main concern - temper disparity between plate/chain/leather elemental armor vs cloth curing agents. To make a livestone bp it takes 7 rare tempers vs 3 for a chain/leather vs 1 for cloth robe.  The drop rate on some of this stuff is astoundingly bad. Coupled with the fact that lots of temper items are used in multiple recipes, and you have a problem.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I can think of a few, that aren't tradeskill related:<br />
<br />
Will there be changes/updates to the berserker class to make them more useful?  The berserker AAs seem to be direct copies of the warrior AAs, but up until this point, each class had a few AAs that were specific to them.  Will you add in class specific AAs to them?  What about throwing mastery (like archery mastery) and endless axe holding thingy (like endless quiver.)?  Ranged criticals anyone?<br />
<br />
For tradeskills:<br />
Any plans on changing the GM route for the two hardest trades, baking and brewing (just kidding, tailoring and smithing)?  They are both insanely hard and take a tremendous amount of time, money and sanity to GM.  <br />
<br />
What about adding a trophy for people who have 7 trophies?  Something like a GM Tradeskiller's Trophy that would have nicer stats than any of the regular trophies, or even similar stats, but 10% modification to each skill, rather than 5%?<br />
<br />
Any plans for more coldain prayer shawl / aid grimmel type quests.  Perhaps something that takes very high tradeskill levels, but doesn't have the flagging requirements that grimmel does (since not everyone can get flagged.)<br />
<br />
Increasing the freaking drop rate on spiderling silks?  I shouldn't have to kill 20 spiderlings and get 5 silks.  Perhaps make every MoB on Norrath drop velium to make the EBVs much easier. :cool:<br />
<br />
I would like to know if SOE has any plans to modify ore breakdown yields. It seems silly that a block of an ore eventually only yields two small pieces.<br />
<br />
1 Block of X Ore --&gt; 1 Large Brick of X Ore --&gt;<br />
1 Small Brick of X Ore --&gt; 2 Small Pieces of X Ore<br />
And to further this comment, if you go in the opposite direction, the conversions are not the same.<br />
<br />
3 small pieces --&gt; 1 small brick / 3 small bricks --&gt; 1 large brick / 3 large bricks --&gt; 1 block</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Trezark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">While on the subject of Froglok cultural smithing, could you mention the somewhat related issue of Froglok cultural robes?  I don't know if a dev has ever commented on it before, but it's always bugged me. I don't even play a Frog, I just hate the lapse in continuity.  ;)  If Iksar get robes that all use Necro words, shouldn't Frogloks get robes that all use Wizard runes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>MartanioKotiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Tradeskills-<br />
I remebered someone saying that no new cutlural armor was to be impemented until ingame cutlural armor was made more balanced. Some of the cultural armor is quite good for the amount of risk/reward that goes into makeing it. For instance High Elf. But as for some like Iksar Cultural this armor quite frankly is horrible stats. And it is also if not one of the hardest cutlual smithing to make as it requires so much Velium, Sarnak Blood, Iksar Blood (Wtf?!) Froglock Blood , Blue Diamonds, and so on. <br />
<br />
Question 1. Is it possible to implement a way to increase the yeild on some recepes  and tradeskill recpes that are made from rare and/or hard to get supplies?<br />
<br />
In the current system there is some recpes thar are far too dificult or time consumeing to make with the sheer number of hard to get or rare ingrediants that go into makeing them. I understand that makeing an item more common could have a negative effect on the price of the ingrediants and even the final product.<br />
But this problem should not be ingnored. In one paticular instance someone else mentioned there amount of supplies required to make plate armor and chain armor of certain armors is simply mindnumbing. One way I see to fix this is instead of makeing one temper that it makes 5- 10 instead.<br />
Also this could also make lower end armor more apealing to make /skill up on. Recepes that I know that could use a boost are PoP Smithing and Tailoring,  Shadow Scream Armor, Iksar Cultural Temper's, Taw Ew Plate Armor, Tae Ew Tailoring and Acrylia Bones Armor are some I can think of at the top of my head.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 2. Will there be added Cultural Specific armor for Iksar Monk , Necromancer and Beastlord? <br />
<br />
 As for now I don't know of any armor that is currently in game  for them.  Being said I think that being so isolated for such a long time they would have a need and or time to develop there resources into makeing armor for all of it's classes..  Not to mention that the Brood of Kotiz is seen as such a powerful force in the Cabilis army. Why not make armor for there robe wearing fellows?<br />
<br />
<br />
This was mentioned before that in PoP and with a lot of smithing recepes there is a huge disparity in the amount of supplies that go into makeing some of the armor. I could make 2 Chain Bps for the amount of supplies it takes to make  one <br />
<br />
Quest<br />
1.Will the iksar Necromancer skullcap quests ever be finsihed so that the reward is apropiate for the amount of work it goes into makeing it? and in line with the final items recieved for the Shaman/Monk and Shadow Knight Iksar's?<br />
<br />
Currently if you do the quest you will spend maybe 20 hours at least to get to the final in game cap only to receive a cap that you can buy a better one for at most 25 plat. And what is up with the fact that the last cap is tradeabler and if I rember correctly can be used by all races?<br />
<br />
2.Could there be implented a quest that rewards people for improveing there faction with other races or races in general?<br />
<br />
 When I started the game there was quite a large need to raise your faction as it was needed on some server's to reach your server specific trade zone and or help travel around Norrath. But with recent changes and past changes there is hardly any reason to raise any of these factions if any at all. I imagine that most people raise a faction is to raise up just high enough to do a specific quest. For instant Coldain Prayer Shawl Quest and Velious Armorr quests. But with the introduction of such a variety of items on the open market and the introduction of so many quest that don't require faction and that a majority of the old world items are not even good enough for risk/reward of completeing the quest even for the most novice or begining player.  So in the mast the reward for raiseing a paticular faction with a city or group of NPC's was rewarded but now with advent of PoP portals and other influences this is no longer the case. Can there be a quest that is put in the game that gives a reward on diplomacy/faction raiseing? My suggestion just have a mail type courier quest where the peope of Norrath are trying to come to peace or stregthen already strong bonds by sending diplomats to other cities and require you to be seen at a certain faction level to continue the &quot;peace talks&quot;. . Some races would never see eye to eye for instance Iksar with any of the other filty races of norrath (Haha) But there could be a Good , Neutral version and eveil version so thta the groups talk to each other. While anyone can do the other quests it would be balanced out as it is already very dificult to raise some factions if not impossible.  The reward could be Ring that is worn on the finger slot that increases as you gain more diplomatic skills. Maybe eventually ending up with a item that has a right click effect of Alliance or other faction raiseing spell.  This way it wouldnt nesceraly be just for caster's but could be used by everyone. If not that effect there could be melle version (Damage Shield that increases with strength of the ring) Priest version (Improved healing that increases with strength of the ring or Purecaster (Faction Modifier). <br />
<br />

Could the Necromancer Epic's casting time be reduced down to 2-4 intead of the increadbly long casting time it currently has?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lushissx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I like the idea of rotating the stock to put the new items at the top. I would even more so like to see an overstock dealer. Simply put, it is the surplus store. When a vendor gets more than 80 items, anything and everything else goes to an overstock dealer in town. I imagine people would be camping him, but with so many folks selling so much in POK it would give many folks opportunities to get very cool stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>EQDal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">While it isn't tradeskill related, I do have a question I'd like asked at Fan Faire.  Contrary to what television would have us think, 8 is NOT enough. Of course I'm referring to spell slots. I don't expect them to double the number of slots, but even 2 more would be a boon. I'm a shaman and am tired of always having to juggle spells in the middle of a fight. I wouldn't mind if they even made this cost AA points. Just something to let me have more spells memorized without having to get items with the same spell effect.<br />

1) How about making one block break down to TWO large bricks which each break down to TWO small bricks which each break down to TWO small pieces?<br />

There is a possibility that more tinkering ingredients can be made stackable to alleviate some reported problems with excessively inconvenient combines.<br />

Will there ever be recipes (not quests) for new items that require more than one skill over 200 (because of nodrop subcombines)?  Currently there is no significant need/use for the Tanaan Mastery AA other than the Aid Grimel quest, that couldn't be handled just as well by several characters without the AA.<br />

Will the yields ever be improved for ore breakdown (ie chisel + brick = smaller bricks)?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>mewkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Questions:<br />
1. Is there a greater chance of skilling up with a sucessful combine than with a failed combine?<br />
<br />
2. (similar but different) Is the chance for a skill up greater for combines with trivials closer to your skill? ie, will you skill up from 0-20 in brewing in fewer combines (on average) making MHB (triv 248) or Short Beers (triv 31)?<br />
<br />
3. Is there a cap (hard or soft) on the additional chance for skill ups from having Int/Wis &gt;255? &gt;280? &gt;305?<br />
<br />
<br />
Requests:<br />
1. With the new tradeskill UI, can you have the return key perform the search for recipies in addtion to mouse clicking the search button.<br />
<br />
2. Second (third/forth/whatever) the request for better ratio when breaking down ore (also see #7 below).<br />
<br />
3. Can NPC vendor decide not to try to resell loot whos only purpose in life is to be sold back to vendors (e.g. Wrurln Claw (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20337))<br />
<br />
4. Can there be a way to extract the chain from the solstice robe. It kind of defies logic to want fail a combine. If not, is there a way we can get a negative geerlok that reduces our tailoring skill by 90%.<br />
<br />
5. Can there be some exceptions made for the quest recipies not being learnable (e.g. Enchanted Velium Bits (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9525&amp;menustr=035000000000))<br />
<br />
6. Can the AutoInventory button be made to put all the items back in your bags (item made and hammer/needle/file/whatever).<br />
<br />
7. How bout the possibility of varying degrees of sucess (in regards to quantity produced) on some combines based on your skill. This would be making a quantity of 6 or 7 arrows (instead of 5) occasionally if your skill is way higher than the trivial. This could also provide the means for satisfying the ore conversion request (it just makes sense that I highly trained smith should be able to chisle a block of ore into two or more bricks/pieces).<br />
<br />
Tending towards class related stuff (ie foraging):<br />
1. Since most people now have the /doability x /autoinventory set up for their forage skill tied to their left/right keys is there a possibility of just making foraging automatic (ie every two minutes a new foraged items is dropped in your inventory). Maybe as an AA purchase.<br />
<br />
2. Is it possible to have the forage engine check to see if you already have something that's lore before attempting to give you another lore item (e.g. Ripened Heartfruit (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=6150&amp;menustr=035000000000)) and give you something else instead.<br />

<br />
Is there a plan to unnerf fletching and pottery? They are not a easy tradeskill to learn by far, yet why they are nerfed? Especially fletching, as it is the about only useful skill even if ur skill is loww. The skill that deseverd a nerf is probably brewing and JC which is the easiest.<br />
<br />
Tailoring<br />
<br />
There needs to be some additional path to at least low 200s. The drop rate of superb and flawless hide is simply too low to make them a viable skill up method. <br />

<br />
Wayfarer camp is so powerful, put a magus there?<br />
<br />
GoD<br />
<br />
Currently, a lot of GoD content is too hard. There is no one exping in Qinimi or Brandu because a) the mob hit too hard b) exp is very bad c) mob are too crowded make CC a necessary. I solo some in Brandu, hit for 6xx, flurry and proc 610 DD and all of those is 2% AA. there are also various named mob in the T1 zone where no guild that is capable to do them. Currently GoD is only for time guild - time guild that farm time for a long time. It is a waste of contents. PoP was not only for people who clear VT months. Also, since very few people go to GoD, the rtadeskill component is equally rare.<br />
<br />
Also, what's so funny about putting the quest NPC in deep of a zone surrounded by 200 mobs? When yo uare trying to read the quest text suddenly a mob come up and kill you is not that fun. Also, why everything must be faster than soe? Not everyone is a bard or pal or sk or have the fastest horse/lizard. Also, the succor point is not safe as all, so why put a succor point at all? So you evac the group out of danger only to find a see invis soe+ speed mob is able to finish your group?<br />
<br />
LDoN<br />
<br />
After the released of GoD, the cash loot as well as the exp from LDoN is stealth nerfed. Any reason to do this? people will still not go to GoD even if you nerf LDoN..<br />
<br />

<br />
There are so many zone that are useless. So instead of adding expansion which create another bunch of unused zone why not just revamp the old one instead?<br />
<br />
Spell Criticals<br />
<br />
At least wizard discover their critical AA is being stealth nerfed to force them buy the new GoD AA. ANy updates?<br />
<br />
Druid<br />
<br />
Any idea to help druids? Druids nuke 60% as well as wizard, heal 60% as well as cleric however that does not make them a 120% class. because druid can only do 1 such thing at a time.

Druid currently has no unique GoD AA. Same as bezerker. who dont have unique AA anywhere. There are also a lot of AA that is overpriced yet have minimal usage such as the healing ward.</div></div><hr />

Are there any plans to add some kind of super trophy for multi-tradeskill GM's?  One possibility is a combine that requires all seven trophys plus some other item, yielding back six normal trophys and one super trophy with increased stats or abilities.  Perhaps this super trophy could allow the wielder to exceed the 252 cap on tradeskills -- if it were a 10% mod for a 250 tradeskiller, the wielder's effective skill would be 275 rather than 252.  Alternately, a single super-trophy with multiple tradeskill mods on it would also be nice.<br />
  <br />
<br />
Part of this has been answered.  It has been mentioned MANY times in posts and at at least 3 fan fairs...  that it is not posible in the current engine, to make a &quot;mod&quot; for more than one tradeskill... including &quot;all&quot; tradeskills.<br />
I know the programers here will scream &quot;anything is posible&quot; so the translation of that is, it would take many many many more man hours to make it posible than they are willing to spend the time and money on.  It is defenitely not an &quot;easy&quot; change for them.  Character Database corruption has been mentioned as a result of trying this... so... it is not easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">One possible way round it (purely off of the top of my head) would be a 'generic' trophy with lots of stats, a new clicky bag (with turn-in for a rentable version) but no skill mod for 1750 people that can then be 'combined' (by itself, no fail) in the relevant tradeskill container  (sewing kit/loom for tailoring, etc) for a version with (for this example) a +10% tailoring mod.<br />
<br />
When finished, combine the tailoring version with itself for the generic one again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Only trouble with that is putting nodrop trophy in a tradeskill container, which is generally a Bad Thing.<br />
<br />
Hmmm...maybe have the 'generic' one clicky-summon a lore, norent nodrop 'Grandmaster's Signet' which can then be converted to the skill-specific one. Skill specific one is nodrop/norent/lore as well, of course.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know that, and in fact I was trying to work around it.  Here's what I had in mind.<br />
<br />
You must have all seven tradeskill trophies.  You to to a forge, put in all seven trophies and a hammer (possibly with a new item, a Grandmaster Artisan's Seal, which would serve as a plat sink), and combine.  On success, you get back six normal trophies and a smithing super-trophy with new stats or a better mod or something.  If you fail, you lose your smithing trophy and hammer, but get back the other six.<br />
<br />
Alternately, Itzena had some great ideas.  Put in all seven trophies in the forge and combine (no-fail combine), and you get back a no-rent no-drop smithing super-trophy.  Do the same thing in a tailoring kit and you get back a no-drop no-rent tailoring super-trophy.<br />
<br />
A third example would be to merge the two ideas.  Once you have all seven trophies, you can combine them all (possibly with a Grandmaster Artisan's Seal again) in a quest container to get a Grandmaster Artisan's Trophy.  This would have no tradeskill mods on it, but some happy set of stats instead.  If you put the Trophy in a forge and combine with itself, you get back a no-drop no-rent item with some kind of uber smithing mod.  In a tailoring kit, you'd get a tailoring mod, and so on.<br />
<br />
The question is whether it would be possible to have an item with a tradeskill mod that allows you to exceed the current cap of 252.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe instead of greater skill, it could give you reduced failures, in the same manner as Enchanters JCM AA. We know the current engine can do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Also a great idea, and a way to get around many people's objections to enchanters having an advantage in JC.<br />
<br />
If the &quot;super-mod&quot; allowed for 50% reduced fails, like the JCM AA, that gives everyone a shot at making things with lower fails.  Enchanters would still hold an advantage in JC because they don't have to GM all other skills to get their bonus; they can get it through AA instead.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Angahran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Just a quick question about the number of tempers required for PoP plate smithing.<br />
<br />
iven the rarity of the components it seems that there is a huge amount of tempers needed for each attempt at a combine.<br />
<br />
e.g. Plate BP:<br />
3 Sheets of electrified copper = 3 Tempers<br />
chain jointing = 2 tempers<br />
Final combine = 1 Temper<br />
<br />
So thats 6 tempers for one combine.<br />
<br />
Thats a lot of tempers for a single combine that is unlikely to be successful on the first attempt.<br />
<br />
What would be nice would be to use the culteral model where the subcombines used a relatively easy to obtain item as the temper for the subcombines and keep the difficult temper for the final combine.<br />
<br />
e.g. Dark Elven cultural, uses neriak nectar as the subcombine temper, then shadow temper for the final combine.<br />

My half elven, Mithaniel Marr worshiping paladin grew up in Freeport, surrounded by mainly humans. As such, her culture would most likely be more human driven. Now, take a half elven Tunare worshiping paladin, who grew up in Felwithe. That paladin would most certainly have a culture more geared towards elves.<br />
<br />
I know that they were supposed to put in Froglok cultural armor. Well, frogs worship Mithaniel Marr also, so why do they get cultural and half elves don't?  Please, oh please fix this.

Though I'm not sure what good 10% would really do, by the time someone gets all their trophies, they would have their skills in the 240-250 range.

Every time you do a combine, (maybe just on a success), there is a chance that due to your skill you salvage some of the left over parts.<br />
<br />
These fragments could be recombined with others to much like ore is.<br />
<br />
e.g. you make 10 breastplates, during this time you do well and receive 5 'fragments of ore'. You combine all these fragments together and find you have enough ore to try to make something else, maybe something smaller like a bracer ?<br />

I'm posting my working list here; I'll come back and update this post as I think of new stuff.  I'm looking for two things.<br />
<br />
1) I need your feedback and ideas.  What questions do you think should be asked?  What aspects of the game are worth discussing?<br />
<br />
2) I want to give the devs a heads-up on what to expect.  At the last Fan Faire, too many of the questions went unanswered because the dev dealing with that aspect wasn't at the Faire.  By posting the questions early (and I'll be emailing them to the Developer's Corner later this week too), we give the devs a chance to research the questions ahead of time.<br />
<br />
Naturally, the focus for me would be on tradeskills and on paladin-related issues, as that's what I mostly deal with.  Feel free to suggest questions from other areas, but they probably won't be priorities for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Update March 21, 2004<br />
I have decided to limit the questions here to tradeskills, as per Maddoc's request.  I've added the questions found in this thread to date.  I did not include questions that were very vague or waffly.  I will not address matters that I don't understand thoroughly; sorry, but I have to be able to defend my questions and requests. =)<br />
<br />
I'll finalize the list tomorrow around this time and send it to the devs on Tuesday.<br />
<br />
Side note to Maddoc: Remember that any questions you can answer here mean that much less of a headache for you at the Fan Faire. =)  If we could get answers to the &quot;easy&quot; questions here, that will leave more time for the stickier ones for which you would prefer face-to-face discussion at the Faire.<br />
<br />
<br />
Update March 24, 2004<br />
I've sorted the questions in each category by their relative importance to me; most important ones are at the top.  This will be the list as I send it in to the Developer's Corner.  If Maddoc wants to PM me an email address, I can send it to him directly too.<br />
<br />
I made a new section for tradeskill trophies, since that seems to be a hot topic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Here's the intro I used in my developer's corner post.<br />
<br />
Greetings.<br />
<br />
Below is a list of tradeskill-related questions I plan to ask at the Fan Faire in April.  This list was developed in conjunction with the EQTraders community and represents many (though obviously not all) of the concerns of tradeskillers across all servers.<br />
<br />
I am sending this in ahead of time so that the tradeskill developers have a chance to prepare the answers.  At previous fan faires, various developers have said they can't answer questions because they have to research the issues or because the developer in charge of that topic wasn't at the faire.  By notifying you ahead of time, I hope to avoid those problems.<br />
<br />
I know that Maddoc is aware of the question list posted on the EQTraders message boards (from whence this list was developed).  I would appreciate it if you could forward a copy of this list to him and to any other developers who will be attending the faire.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is there anywhere else I should send in the list?  Should I email this to any of the devs directly?  If so, please send me their email in a PM (do not post their email here) and I'll send them a copy too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>atonic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Originally posted by Ngreth Thergn <br />
Part of this has been answered.  It has been mentioned MANY times in posts and at at least 3 fan fairs...  that it is not posible in the current engine, to make a &quot;mod&quot; for more than one tradeskill... including &quot;all&quot; tradeskills.<br />
I know the programers here will scream &quot;anything is posible&quot; so the translation of that is, it would take many many many more man hours to make it posible than they are willing to spend the time and money on.  It is defenitely not an &quot;easy&quot; change for them.  Character Database corruption has been mentioned as a result of trying this... so... it is not easy.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Perhaps for the cost of a mere 20 AAs.........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Niellya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">A third example would be to merge the two ideas. Once you have all seven trophies, you can combine them all (possibly with a Grandmaster Artisan's Seal again) in a quest container to get a Grandmaster Artisan's Trophy. This would have no tradeskill mods on it, but some happy set of stats instead. If you put the Trophy in a forge and combine with itself, you get back a no-drop no-rent item with some kind of uber smithing mod. In a tailoring kit, you'd get a tailoring mod, and so on. This is the best idea I've heard yet for a 1750 club trophy.<br />
<br />
Also as for the ore breakdowns, it doesn't even have to be  2 of each (though that would make sense since you have to combine 3 of each when going up in size); however, if they say they still can't do it, they can at least do one lesser size and 2 small pieces.<br />
<br />
Ex:  1 Block of velium  --&gt;  1 large brick of velium + 2 small pieces of velium</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Will pottery ever get some new (and accessible) recipes?  It has been skipped in LoY and LDoN expansions.<br />
<br />
Since the PoP release the only new items have been the artisan's seal and marble mortar and pestle (December 2002), and the ceramic bola weight which seems to be the only recipe added in GoD.  About 40% of pottery recipes are firing recipes.<br />
<br />
Pottery really needs some help.<br />
===========<br />
Any chance we can get an in game hint as to the use of egg sack cocoons, petrified wood, white primrose and the other mystery LDoN tradeskill usable forages?   The other LDoN tradeskill items are all detailed in the recipe books available on the magi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I would like to see all the tradeskill trophies changed to a reduced failure chance than a skill bonus.  Most players who have one (or more) are at or near the maximum skill so the mod is mostly just for show.  Also if you really need the 5% mod you can get a geerlok far easier than the trophy.<br />
<br />
I would also like to see the trophies made a no-fail, skill-restricted combine (say at 242 where you have the max chance when using  a geerlok).<br />
<br />
Please have them nerf Brewing!  The only thing stopping a flood of 250 brewers was the sheer number of clicks it takes to get there.  With the new UI that is no longer an obstacle, and for a skill that is already short of marketable recipies it is just a nightmare for the serious brewer.  An increase in the number of combines would help greatly (similar to what was done with pottery).<br />
<br />
The Pottery nerf was too severe.  I agree that pottery was too easy at one point but now it's too hard.  An adjustment back the other way would be helpful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Laurelleii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">This has probably been covered and it's a small thing but does anyone wonder why when you do a combine with someone in your group they can see what you have made and you cannot? I would think that if they can create a message telling a groupmate what you have &quot;fashioned&quot; then they ought to be able to tell the person who made it instead of the standard &quot;something new&quot;. It's a tiny thing really but might be nice to see changed.<br />
<br />
I'm also one who'd love to see some sort of nod to half elves for anything cultural, anything. I'd be willing to do a quest to perhaps choose to do human or high elf cultural as an option. Or even work AA's to get the shot at anything even remotely cultural. Long shot but you never know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Example in the 5 or so times that my guild has done XTC in SSRA he has Never dropped the Smithing Mod hammer.<br />
<br />
Did the Devs take these out of the game? Are they considered ultra rare drops?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Barli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">For those of us who have to go out and farm certain racial bloods for recipes / tempers - how about this option.....<br />
<br />
You should be able to draw your own blood and convert it into a tradeskill item.<br />
<br />
For example, if I'm an Iksar, take out my trusty dagger, poke myself and use a small vial to capture the blood.  Thus you get an Iksar Blood that you can use in tradeskills.<br />
<br />
The process would drain you of HP's and/or Endurance/Mana and you could limit it to being able to do this skill &quot;Draw Blood&quot; every 30 minutes or so in order to keep the market from being saturated.<br />
<br />
You could also make this a skill a Rogue could do to other players but only with their permission of course.<br />
<br />
This would solve the rare Iksar blood drops for sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I like the whole part except this.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see &quot;Draw other's blood&quot; given to Clerics, instead of Rogues.   Doctors draw blood, rogues only shed it.<br />
<br />
Or, we could have anyone draw blood from another person,with consent, but make it dependant on either Bind Wounds or Piercing skill(Gotta hit the right vein). <br />
<br />
If your bind wounds skill is too low, you can take serious damage.<br />
Or am I thinking this through too much?<br />
<br />
Either way, Froglok Blood would be a lot more prevalent too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>mewkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Drawing blood wouldn't be something a cleric would do. They're more priest than doctor. Drawing blood would probably be more in the Shaman's realm.<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
On second thought, this sounds like something that a Necro might be more suited to be doing to various corpses. Maybe after a sacrafice or something similar. Maybe an AA skill that they can preform on dead mobs that has a certain chance of sucess based on level of AA/skill.</div></div><hr />

This would be very very nice. It's pretty easy, if timeconsuming, for me to clear to him if he's up on my own, but then the problem of finding him up and successfully pleading with a raid to please please please let this little gnome buy her supplies before they kidnap Mr Anizok for their dragon raid. Uh, and her 3 mules who came along to buy the unstackable metal casing.<br />
<br />
That's my problem with Tinkering atm, how few things stack. A lot of the vendor bought objects stack but when it comes to dropped items it's 50/50 if it'll stack or not. Products that are just an intermediate step between the actual product those usually never stack, like base prototype. Actually the part of tinkering supplies that I'm most surprised do not stack yet are metal casings from Anizok, and the Lucin era geerlok components. I think Mr Anizok, being undoubtedly a wealthy man from his devices, must have a summer home in PoK. One with security from clockwork dragon raiders perhaps?</div></div><hr />

The GOD refining combines eg from raw nhilite to pale nihlite can give (0) 1, 2 or 3 resulting items. The NPC always gives 2.<br />
<br />
Is there ever a point when it is better to do it yourself ?<br />
How much work does it take to get there aprox, i.e. is it 10 &quot;skillups&quot; or 100 or 1000 or 5 Million ?<br />
Dose the same &quot;skill&quot; counter work for the high level and low level versions of the item (e.g. Pale and shimmering), so that if I &quot;skill up&quot; on pale to the point when I always get 3 back will I be that good with shimmering too ?<br />
<br />
Basic version of the question is it ever worth doing the refines your self and has this been confirmed in game ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">Not to derail, but here's a partial answer of Jarak_akn's question, taken from the site.<br />
<br />
http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q142&amp;menustr=120037000000<br />
<br />
When you first learn how to convert the material, you will receive, on average 1.5 units, for every unit you convert. (Half the time you'll get 1 back, the other half the time you will get 2 back.) While this is less, overall, than you would receive from the NPC, the more that you work with the material, the better you get. Eventually, you will always get at least 2 units of the material back, and once you have become highly skilled at working with the material, you have a chance at getting 3 units of the material back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">I think Jarak was asking for precise numbers for &quot;the more that you work with the material&quot; and &quot;eventually&quot; (from the quote), and whether those numbers have been confirmed in game.</div></div><hr />

A teaser for you: &lt; evil grin &gt;<br />
<br />
We now have the complete formula for determining whether you get a skillup or not.  You get double the chance of a skillup on success, and INT/WIS over 255 do help, as high as you can get them.  Past 190 skill, you will never have over a 5% chance of a skillup on any combine.</div></div><hr />

Past 190 skill, you will never have over a 5% chance of a skillup on any combine.  <br />
<br />
So the 1 in 20 combines theory holds up. This also settles the arguement of if int/wis over 255 helps. We were all right. It helps and it doesnt help depending on skill levels. AND the 190+ &quot;hell&quot; levels were correct as well. OH PLS HURRY SEEING THEORIES PROVEN MAKE ME SO HAPPY :) and I got an ever so small gift for ya Kyros but I havnt seen you online to hand it over ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regarding Iksar cultural smithing for the classes scared of metal, I dont belive that it is necesarry for all clases of a race to have TS armor. Arent High elves halfling and Erudites the only ones who get TS armor for ALL classes that race can be?<br />
But also to continue the Iksar cultural thread I do belive that the current cultural armor &lt;b&gt;does&lt;/b&gt; need a line of plate armor-type armor introduced, it can be less AC to compensate for the Iksar AC bonus even. but please guive us more than a 30AC Breastplate. It is wonderful armor for shamen but not to desireable for anyone else.<br />
<br />
As for the blood drawing ability, I would have to argue against it. Don't want to make being a cultural smith too easy.While useing your own races blood is dubious There are reasons that could be argued for it.  Plus humans cant draw light out of the sun. =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Taushar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">Don't want to spoil other's answer but to me the most significant part of the Fan Faire Q&amp;A was the answer to the most asked question, does success have better chance of skill up than failure? The answer is YES. This surprised me somewhat. Here is what I heard from the session.<br />
<br />
There are several factors involved in skill ups, one of them is the stats, wis/int/str/dex, depending on the tradeskill. That plays a larger role than success/failure. However, the success of combining an item can have up to 100% more chance at skill up than failure. Of course it's still random. There is a caveat to this. The stats work like mitigation on skill up. So, if your stat is lower, then your chace of skill up is upto 100% more on success than failure. However, at higher stats, the difference dimishes greatly so the difference of skill up between success and failure is much less. The bottom line though is that success will give you better chance of success than failure.<br />
