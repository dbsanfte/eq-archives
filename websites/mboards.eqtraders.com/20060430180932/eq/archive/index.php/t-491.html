The High-Level Character's Guide to Smithing<br />
<br />
by Richard Lawson  (aka Monual Lifegiver on Drinal)<br />
<br />
Revision History:<br />
<br />
December 8, 2002:  Initial Draft<br />
<br />
December 10, 2002:  Added component cost for smithing throughout the guide.  Corrected target skill levels to reflect that 252 is the maximum adjusted skill, not 255.  Removed section on creating Ethereal Sheets of Metal, since their trivial is 212, the same as Ethereal Rings.  Added Gauntlets of Dark Embers as another item that confers a 15% modifier to Smithing.  Corrected various spelling errors.<br />
<br />
December 11, 2002:  More spelling errors, bah.  Plus I realized that 212 minus 192 is 20, not 10.  Double-bah.<br />
<br />
December 20, 2002:  Yet more spelling errors.  Added some information about the Hollowshade Moor War based on feeback from others.<br />
<br />
January 30, 2003: Added some more tidbits here and there, nothing major. Final edit hopefully.<br />
<br />
March 13, 2003:  Swirling Shadows are no longer no-drop, yay!  Changed guide to reflect that. <br />
<br />
Here's how my 60th-level Human Cleric became a GM Smith. During the course of his blacksmithing he went up to 63, which made a couple of things easier (hunting shadows in Twilight Sea, for instance). Here is the underlying philosophy: <br />
<br />
-&gt; I was not interested in making money. I simply wanted to become a GM smith as quickly as possible. That meant I was willing to attempt combines I'd surely fizzle on just so I could try and get a skill-up. Everything I made I immediately sold to a vendor. <br />
<br />
-&gt; I didn't want to spend a lot of money. When I started my smithing quest, I had 50,000 plat. During the course of my smithing my account balance fluctuated as I sold outdated equipment and bought peridots for grouping. 50,000 seemed a reasonable starting point. <br />
<br />
-&gt; I was willing to spend some time farming. That meant that I had to turn down requests for groups as I farmed stuff for Shadowscream armor. I'm in a raiding guild, so I always showed up for raids, but afterwards, I'd disappear from sight as I farmed and farmed. I could have dinged 65 and accumulated quite a few AA points if I'd stopped. I sacrificed that to become a GM smith - you'll have to be prepared to do the same. Normally if you explain to your guild that you're working on smithing, they'll understand. Occasionally I'd take a break to help with a shard camp or help get someone through a Plane of Justice trial, just so I wouldn't fall completely out of touch with my guildmates. <br />
<br />
-&gt; I wanted to be self-reliant. That meant no chanters to enchant my ore or summon vials of mana for me. As you'll see below, that also meant not needing to find a grandmaster brewer. I wanted to do everything myself and not have to waste someone else's time. <br />
<br />
Some general notes: <br />
<br />
Whenever a recipe calls for two items - two metal bits, two swirling shadows - you must but them into the forge *unstacked*. At best, the combine will fail. At worst, the combine will eat your entire stack when you only needed one. The latter happened to me once; the forge ate an entire stack of ethereal energy bricks and I was very sad. <br />
<br />
Get a Geerlok Automated Hammer. These player-made items cost 100pp or less in the Bazaar. They add 5% to your smithing skill. Since 252 is the highest your adjusted smithing can go, that means you'll only need to get to 240 in smithing to have the maximum allowable skill. <br />
<br />
Always have your WIS or INT or STR maxed out when you attempt a combine. This will maximize your chances of getting a skill-up. Since I was a cleric, my WIS was near-maxed. Still, I made sure I always had KEI cast on me before I attempted a combine. I preferred KEI over other WIS/INT buffs because KEI lasts two and a half hours - longer if the chanter has some focus items or AA abilities. That's far longer than any other WIS/INT buff you can get. If you don't have access to a friendly chanter that will cast this on you, you can usually buy a casting of KEI from a chanter in the Nexus or in the Bazaar for 100pp or less. <br />
<br />
Get Planes of Power. The Plane of Knowledge is a tradeskiller's paradise - everything you need is right there. This guide was written under the assumption that you have PoP installed. If not, you may want to consult one of the other guides for alternatives to some of the recommendations I make below. <br />
<br />
And, finally... do what you can to get your guild to raid and kill Xerkizh the Creator in the Temple of Ssra. He sometimes drops the Hammer of the Ironfrost which adds 15% to your smithing skill. With that, you only need to get up to 220 in smithing which is a *tremendous* savings in time spent getting skill-ups. Plus, with this hammer you can take a shortcut from 192 to 212 (see below). I realize this may not be an option for many folks, but if XtC is within your reach, do what you can to try and get this nice Hammer. Another option, if you can raid in Vex Thal, is to get the Gauntlets of Dark Embers from Kaas Thox Xi Ans Dyex; they also add 15%. <br />
<br />
Before I begin, I'd like to thank everyone at the EQTraders web site and message boards, who provided me with the information I used to create this guide and provided very helpful commentary on this guide. Without their info, it would have taken me *much* longer to become a GM smith. My sincere appreciation goes out to all those folks who did the legwork that made smithing much easier for the rest of us. <br />
<br />
OK, on with the show: <br />
<br />
Step 1:  Equipment<br />
<br />
Make sure to get a smithy hammer and a smithy chisel, both of which can be bought in the Plane of Knowledge (PoK). You'll also need a file, which you'll have to make. Start by making a few metal bits. Combine two small pieces of ore (which can be bought in PoK) in a forge with a flask of water. Buy a file mold and put it in a forge with 1 metal bits and a flask of water. It may take you several attempts, but eventually you'll make a file. Keep this file; you'll always find a need for it. <br />
<br />
Step 2:  Banded Armor<br />
<br />
What... no metal bits or pots or needles as an intermediary step? Nope... I started out by making Banded Armor. Some folks have maintained that you're more likely to get skill-ups on items that you are close to being trivial for you, but I didn't find that to be the case. Sure, I failed the combines forty-nine times out of fifty at first, but I still got skill-ups. And banded requires few ingredients that are relatively cheap. <br />
<br />
Sheet metal can be bought in quantity in PoK for about 1pp each. Buy lots. Also, buy lots of flasks of water. Then buy as many banded boot molds (1.7pp each) as your inventory can hold. Go to a forge and combine one sheet metal, one boot mold, and one flask of water. This will produce banded boots. Repeat until your smithing skill is 95. Then buy helm molds (0.6pp each) and combine those with two sheets of metal and a flask of water. This will take you to 106. Then you move on to mail tunics - combine a tunic mold (1.3pp) with three sheets of metal and a flask of water. This will take you to 115. <br />
<br />
Gosh, you're halfway there already? Yup, and it will go quicker than you might think. With everything within easy reach in PoK, it's simply a matter of devoting time to clicking &quot;combine&quot; over and over again.<br />
<br />
Step 3:  Fine Plate<br />
<br />
For this you'll need &quot;medium quality folded sheets of metal&quot;, lots of 'em. To make these, you'll need to combine one block of medium quality ore (20.5 pp each), a flask of water, and your smithy hammer in a forge. (Note that on success or failure, your smithy hammer will be returned to you.) Medium quality ore can be found on a vendor in the PoK. Make stacks and stacks of them. <br />
<br />
You'll also need leather padding. I had no trouble finding lots of leather padding available for sale in the Bazaar off of player traders, usually selling for 20-25pp each. I preferred buying these off traders rather than farming pelts and making leather padding myself. Yes, it can get a bit expensive, but you can also sell your successful plate combines back to vendors and get some plat in return, helping to offset your cost a bit. <br />
<br />
Combine a plate bracer mold (6.3pp), one medium quality folded sheet, a flask of water, a leather padding, and your smithy hammer in a forge to make a plate bracer. Continue making these until your skill hits 168. Then move on to plate helms - a plate helm mold (10.5pp), two medium quality folded sheets, a flask of water, a leather padding, and a smithy hammer. When you hit 179, move on to Fine Steel Breastplates: a plate breastplate mold (21pp), three medium quality folding sheets, a flask of water, a leather padding, and a smithy hammer. This will take you to 188. <br />
<br />
Your hand cramped yet? Well, take no comfort in the following fact: the *easy* part is done now. After 188 it gets... complicated. However, it gets much cheaper on the pocketbook, so you won't have to make any more large investments.<br />
<br />
Step 4:  Shadowscream Armor<br />
<br />
I spent a lot of time evaluating different methods for getting my skill above 188.  No matter what you do, you'll need to do a lot of farming.  I simply didn't have the resources to buy lots of stuff from the bazaar or make mistletoe sickles.  Shadowscream Armor requires lots of farming of no-drop stuff, but once you know how and where, it isn't so bad.  And it's relatively cheap.<br />
<br />
First, you'll need to do the Shar Vahl smithing quest:<br />
http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/luclin_sharvahlsmith.htm<br />
Follow this quest until you have a humming luclinite hammer and a Vah Shir anvil.  This took me three hours, most of which was spent farming the newbie area around Shar Vahl.<br />
<br />
Once you have those things, it's time to begin farming.  I'll discuss a few methods for farming wailing and shrieking substances:<br />
<br />
Shrieking Substances, the Slow Way<br />
Go to Tenebrous Mountains.  Kill sonic wolves.  They wander all over the zone and are plentiful.  The annoying thing are the bats and grimlings which may add.  Still, you should be able to get a decent drop rate, 15 or 20 shrieking substances an hour if you're a good soloer.<br />
<br />
Wailing Substances, the Slow Way<br />
Go to Paludial Caverns.  Yelloweyes, near the Shadowhaven zone line, drops a wailing substance upon occasion, but he is usually camped.  There's a camp of four grimy owlbear cubs deep, deep within Paludial Caverns, at about -2000, -500.  Kill them all.  You'll average about one wailing substance out of every four owlbears.  Sometimes you'll get two, sometimes you'll get zero out of the four owlbears.  I averaged about six wailing substances an hour here, which is a definite bottleneck.  I would definitely recommend the Fast Way.<br />
<br />
Shrieking and Wailing Substances, the Fast Way:  The Hollowshade Moor War. <br />
This has got to be the single most frustrating thing to manage, as the war becomes bugged quite frequently and will only become unbugged if the zone is reset. But it gives you *lots* of Shrieking and Wailing Substances if you can get it to work, so it's worth trying. <br />
<br />
Basically, you have three camps whenever the zone is reset. Grimlings to the south, Owlbears to the east, Sonic Wolves to the north. After a server reset, every so often one camp will attack another and try to take it over. These random, automated attacks will stop after one race has successfully taken over the camp of another race, at which point attacks will only be triggered when you kill a named. You want to manipulate all of this to your advantage. <br />
<br />
What you're trying to accomplish is to get the owlbears or sonic wolves to take over the four islands in the southern part of the zone. The sonic wolves and owlbears that spawn on these islands will comonly drop shrieking and wailing substances, respectively. <br />
<br />
First, learn where the named owlbears and sonic wolves pop. There are two named owlbears in the owlbear caves: Skrieta'Cha pops at 3027, 2002. Skrieta'Chu pops at 3537, 1983. Their placeholders are owlbear fleshrenders, and they are on a 12 minute cycle. The sonic wolf named is Ghowik, in the caves at 450, -2975. Its placeholder is a sonic packleader and they are also on a 12 minute spawn cycle. <br />
<br />
Pay attention to the next sentence, as it took me far too long to figure out: <br />
<br />
Killing a named will spur its race to attack another camp. <br />
<br />
In other words, if you want the owlbears to attack another camp, you have to kill one of the owlbear nameds. (It should be noted that others have found this not to be the case, and that killing a named will trigger a random attack from any camp to any other camp. That may very well be. I'm just sharing my observation, which is that once the automated attacks have stopped, I could only trigger an owlbear attack by killing an owlbear named.) <br />
<br />
What you want is for the owlbears or the sonic wolves (depending on which substance you wish to farm) to attack the grimling camp to the south. Listen for the zone-wide message that says who is attacking and who is defending. When you hear that the owlbears (for example) are attacking the grimlings, run to the grimling chieftan at -2800, -600. In front of him are a couple of grimling bodyguards. The attack of the owlbears will spawn four grimling defenders. These mobs are perma-rooted and *summon*, so be careful. Do what you must to kill all these guys - defenders, bodyguards, and chieftan. You have about ten minutes from the zonewide announcement to do this. Then the owlbear attackers show up. If they can get into the chieftan's hut, the owlbears will have won the battle, the grimlings in the area will despawn, and owlbears will spawn in their place. Follow this same sequence if it's the sonic wolves you want to win. <br />
<br />
If, when you kill a owlbear named, you see a message that the owlbears are killing the sonic wolves to the east (even though the sonic wolves are really more north than east, the zonewide message talks about their camp being in the east), I'd recommend going to the sonic wolf cave and helping the defenders defeat the owlbears. You don't want the owlbears and sonic wolves to kill each other in the north and east camps, and if one race is completely defeated, you won't see it again until the zone is reset. There's supposed to be a way for you to get the war to reset on your own, but it is hopelessly bugged. So it's up to you to micro-manage the war and make sure the owlbears and sonic wolves defend their own realms successfully. <br />
<br />
Also, let's say owlbears have taken over the southern grimling camp and you've got all the wailing substances you need for now. Go to the sonic wolf cave and kill Ghowik until you see a message that the sonic wolves are attacking the owlbears in the south. Then run to the same place the grimling chieftan used to be (-2800, -600) and kill all the owlbears you see there, including the perma-rooted summoning owlbear defenders. Then the sonic wolf attackers will waltz in and take over the camp. <br />
<br />
Properly managed, this war can make farming wailing and shrieking substances trivial. It frequently becomes bugged, and you'll often have to run from place to place defending one race against an unwanted attack. Still, the benefits are worth it. <br />
<br />
Okay, you've gotten the sonic wolves or owlbears to take over the southern camp. Start killing the mobs that spawn on the four islands. As a 62 cleric I was able to be a one-man AE group: I aggro'd about eight or ten sonic wolves, then cast Upheaval and wasted them all. Doing this with KEI, I averaged 30 drops an hour. What's best, though, is if you can get an honest-to-goodness AE group together, with a tank puller and a wizard to AE nuke. Then you can get 50 drops an hour. <br />
<br />
This will be your best source of wailing / shrieking substances if you can manage it properly. <br />
<br />
Swirling Shadows<br />
You might be able to get Swirling Shadows from a vendor in the Bazaar; they're certainly worth checking for every time you pass through.  However, you'll need so many Swirling Shadows that you'll almost surely end up farming them yourself.  You can get swirling shadows from lesser shades in Shadeweaver's Thicket, but they are uncommon drops (about one in five lesser shades drops a swirling shadow) and it's a real pain chasing down the lesser shades all over the zone, so I recommend farming lesser and greater shadows in the Twilight Sea. <br />
<br />
There's an island in the Twilight Sea at about -200, -1000 where the shadows roam. It's a relatively small island that's relatively close to Katta Castellum, so it's convenient to farm. Be warned, these mobs are not necessarily pushovers. They are level 40 and they lifetap frequently. I definitely needed KEI to farm there, since I had to heal myself often. Also, because the island is small, it is not difficult to get two or three adds during a battle. If that proves to be a problem for you, I'd recommend pulling the shadows to one of the nearby islands, where you won't get adds. Soloing, I got about 20 swirling shadows an hour. I'm certain my drop rate would have gone up with some help; this would be another decent place to AE, I think. <br />
<br />
I should also mention that it was easier for me, a cleric, to farm the mobs in Twilight Sea since I could heal myself after getting lifetapped constantly. If you're a class that can't heal themselves effectively, you may want to consider getting help, or just go back to Shadeweaver's Thicket and farm the lesser shades. <br />
<br />
You need at least twice as many swirling shadows as wailing or shrieking substances for Shadowscream armor, so plan accordingly. <br />
<br />
At Last: Combining Everything into Shadowscream Armor<br />
OK! You've got your swirling shadows and your shrieking substances and your wailing substances. Time to actually make some armor. Go to the Plane of Knowledge and find the vendor that sells large bricks of ore. (Plain ore, not high-quality or medium-quality.) Combine one large brick of ore (1.5pp) with a flask of water and your file in a forge. You'll get your file back and two metal rings. Then combine one metal ring with one wailing substance, one shrieking substances, your humming luclinite hammer, and your Vah Shir anvil in a forge. This will produce a humming orb. <br />
<br />
Now place two swirling shadows, one humming orb, one banded boot mold (1.7pp), a water flask, your humming luclinite hammer, and your Vah Shir anvil in a forge. Hit combine. On success you'll get Shadowscream Boots. <br />
<br />
Keeping making Shadowscream Boots. They become trivial at 248, but remember you only need to get to 240 if you've purchased a Geerlock Automated Hammer. As a guildeline, I found that I averaged one skill-up per twenty combines. That means that to get from 188 to 240, you'll need approximately 1040 Wailing Substances, 1040 Shrieking Substances, and 2080 Swirling Shadows. <br />
<br />
Congratulations Grandmaster<br />
<br />
Addendum:  For those with 15% Modifiying Items<br />
<br />
So you've helped kill the Creator in Ssra and have been awarded the Hammer of the Ironfrost. Or you've hunted in Vex Thal and got the Gauntlets of Dark Embers. That's great. That means that you only need to get your smithing skill up to 220 to become a grandmaster. Plus there's a small shortcut you can take: Ethereal Energy Rings. <br />
<br />
The minimum required skill for EE Rings is 220, which means you'll need to use Shadowscream to get your skill up to 192. 192 + 15% &gt; 220, so you'll be good to go then. <br />
<br />
In order to make those, however, you need Ethereal Temper, lots and lots of it. This requires a Grandmaster Brewer to make. Rather than try to find one willing to make hundreds of Ethereal Tempers for me, I decdied to become a Grandmaster Brewer myself. This is much easier to do than you might think. That also meant I was willing to spend 3 AA points in New Tanaan Crafting Mastery to allow a second skill to rise above 200. If this seems excessive just to get 20 skill-ups in smithing, keep in mind that this will still be a useful skill after you've maxed your smithing, since you'll need these tempers to make some of those ultra-uber PoP armors. <br />
<br />
You need a brewing skill of 220 to make Ethereal Temper - or a skill of 210 plus a Geerlock Fermentation Device. The Geerlock Fermentation Device is another player-made item that adds 5% to your brewing skill. I found one for sale in the Bazaar for 50pp. <br />
<br />
Everything you need to become a GM Brewer can be found in Shadowhaven. Combine barley, hops, malt, yeast, and a cask in a brewing barrel. Repeat until your skill hits 135. Then (ready for it?) do a nice little *nine*-item combine: Two flasks of water, two short beers, three malts, yeast, and a cask. Repeat until your skill is 210. Overall, it cost me two days, 500pp, and an extremely cramped hand to get to 210 in brewing. Still, this is one of the easiest and fastest tradeskills to master - if only smithing was this easy. <br />
<br />
Now for Ethereal Tempers. Everything you need is in the Plane of Knowledge. First get a mortar and pestle, then combine a Scent of Marr and a Celestial Solvent to get a Celestial Essence. Then, in a brewing barrel in the Plane of Knowledge, combine two Celetstial Essences, a soda, and a emerald tea leaf to make Ethereal Temper. Make lots. Lots and lots. What I would often do is buy a bunch of Celestial Solvents and Scents of Marrs and take them with me while we were raiding. During downtime, I'd combine them into Celestial Essences. I discovered that you can even do this while auto-following someone. :) If you want to save time making Celestial Essences, you can usually find them for sale in quantity from player vendors in the bazaar. When I was in a hurry, I could find them for 5 or 8pp each, which is not entirely unreasonable. <br />
<br />
Now all you need is a lot of Ethereal Energy Bricks. If you group in one of the PoP planes you'll find that these drop in quantity. I also would buy them from traders in the Bazaar if the prices were reasonable, although that could add up in a hurry. <br />
<br />
Making EE Rings is easy: Combine one Brick of Ethereal Energy, one Ethereal Temper, and your file in a forge in the Plane of Knowledge. These become trivial at 212. <br />
<br />
From 212 to 220, revert back to Shadowscream armor. If you're uber-rich and have access to a willing cleric of Tunare, you might consider moving on to Mistletoe Sickles to avoid farming. Or you can start making Heraldic armor, which has the potential to make you lots of plat while you're getting skill-ups. I won't go into detail on those recipes here; check elsewhere on http://www.eqtraders.com for details on what you can make and how you can make it. <br />
<br />
That's it! You're a Grandmaster Blacksmith.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arghargh</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good info.  Here are a couple of random notes:<br />
<br />
On zone reset, the attacks are on autopilot.  They will launch without any player interaction.  Often two attacks will be going on at once (Grimlings attack wolves, while wolves attack owlbears for example).  You can just wait, and eventually the right attack happens.  Attacks only succeed if you kill the defenders (players camping spots often kill them for their own safety, so be careful).  You don't specifically need to kill the bodyguads and chieften, but leaving them up makes it harder to kill the defenders. <br />
<br />
You best bet with the Hollowshade Moor war is to camp there before a patch, and get there as soon as the servers reset.  Manipulate the war while you can, then farm like crazy.  I farmed at least 200 substances at a shot if at all possible.  <br />
<br />
Out of way too many petitions, I only had a GM reset the zone once for me.  If you do petition, mention you're after owlbears and sonic wolves, not the war.  The war doesn't work, so they won't reset for that.<br />

<br />
Quite well written, definately something to be refered to whenever someone asks about skilling Smithing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimdar</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This guide here is basically exactly what I did to reach 250 smithing however I was one of the lucky ones to do skillups from 227-&gt;246 on etheral bricks. And although I have killed the XTC many times, I have never got a 15% hammer. Another thing to mention, since this IS a high level smithing guide is that there is also a 15% smithing item in VT, one dropped for us the other night.<br />
<br />
Also, I think that overall - its FASTER (maybe more expensive?) to do ornate gold chain to 155 in between banded and Fine Steel. The reason being, that sometimes Leather Padding can be hard to come by on some servers. Additionally, Ornate Chain components are all store bought. I wouldn't put ornate plat chain as a viable option, due to the cost of plat bars.<br />

Unfortunately, being level 48 isn't &quot;uber&quot; anymore, and I'm concerned what my chances are of being able to manipulate the war.  I'm pretty sure I can handle individual shadows in TS, but I am deathly afraid of getting summoned to my doom by five grimling defenders and having them all beat on me at the same time.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any idea whether the defenders (and, for that matter, the grimlings near them) are aggro even when green, or what the minimum level is that you have to be to avoid being aggroed?<br />
<br />
I could really use a faster way to collect these components, since the xp on sonic wolves in Tenebrous is drying up at 48.<br />

2)  Farming Lesser Shades.  I made my own leather padding, using shadeling silk and rockhopper hides.  The hides I started by farming but eventually purchased LQ/MQ ones from the bazaar for 5-10 pp each.  The trick to farming lesser shades in Shadeweaver's is they all spawn in the same area then go wander off.  This area is right around the entrance to the first cave one approaches as you head to the right out of Shar Vahl (also the cave you'd use if you were going the shortest distance from shar vahl to paludal).  I would kill all the lesser shades/skeletal hunters I came across out wandering around for about 15 minutes.  Then I'd head over to the cave and kill lesser shades/skeletal hunters as they were popping.  The spawn time is fast enough that I basically was never waiting for one to pop.  This could be an alternative method for the swirling shadows.</div></div><hr />

It is a good guide if you have unlimited funds, which unfortunately not all of us have. <br />
<br />
I've done detailed analyses of how much it actually costs to skill up on each different smithing item and written a guide that lists what I have found to be the most cost-effective skilling-up route from out of the blocks through 188. Still working on the 188+ stuff at present, so I haven't finished the guide yet.<br />

Before the big patch, people made 67 skill ups on fine steel (175-242).  Now if you jump straight into fine steel after banded, you'll get 73 skill ups before it trivials.  From skill 175+ is where most people experience the &quot;hell lvls&quot; of skilling up.<br />
<br />
Combine the easier skillups from 115-188 with the easier skillup formula, increased wis/int/str caps, and the option of getting exp and pelts at the same time from poachers in JPF, and the only real reason left to do ornate chain at all is if you don't mind farming the ore yourself.<br />

What you should do is go from Banded to Lowest levl cultural then to Ornate chain gold then fine steel plate. At least that's how I did it for cheap pp cost with nice sell back rates. The only prob I have encountered now that zones with alot of PP like cazic-thule are nothing but green's at 65 making new pp is very hard. Since all the nice loots in POP re common drops thus yielding little sell value. Any suggestions, besides just farming fine steel weapons for ore. I am down to 8k pp now and all the leather padding and such is gonna be costly so I will be out of funds soon.</div></div><hr />

Yes this guide is the expensive way to do it up till Shadowscream, but you can go from 0 (or 20 if you spend your points) to Banded being trivial on less than 1.5k plat.  Also Shadowscream is the cheapest way to get your kill over 200 that I have seen.  I was able to farm the parts with very little trouble at level 50 as a Mage, and when I needed money...the Grimlings in TM are a nice source of cash that is easy to farm as well.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is, however, written to be at absolute quickest way, as I am sure folks have figured out.  Skipping right to banded then FS is a bit.... Costly..<br />
<br />
<br />
Costly is relative Lilosh.  Banded is 1pp per sheet plus molds which run less than 1pp each. Assuming you drop banded mail on the floor, it's 94 skill ups from 21 to 115. 1900 combines at 2-4pp each is about 6k. And that's a very high estimate since skill ups are much faster below 115 and sellback pretty much completely covers the cost of the combine if you have a success.<br />
<br />
For plate, it's about 30pp per sheet per combine for a fail and a loss of about a plat on a successful sellback, so you're talking 53 1 sheet skill ups, 10 2 sheet and 8 3 sheet. 97 skill up-sheets. assume 5 failures and 15 successes per skill up and you're talking about 15k plus padding costs.<br />
<br />
Less than 20k to smith to 188 assuming you are really sloppy about doing it and want to do it quickly. While that may seem a lot, I could put that aside in a week without a terrible amount of effort (and more with luck, my prime cash source is Thurg quest MQs, if I see a BP drop I'd be set for a while), and I don't move at anywhere near Monual's level of the game (you'll notice he had 50k banked at the outset - which is significantly cheaper than a fungus covered scale tunic).<br />
<br />
Given that tempers for cultural smithing from 188 to 250 will run on the order of a quarter million plat if you buy (assuming you can find them on sale, and there's no shadowman war - or wyvern or seafury - to manipulate to increase drop rates so the alternative is spending months farming), dropping 15k or so to get to 188 isn't that intimidating - and you can do it for much less if the money is important to you. Of course, that quarter million plat for tempers assumes you have an enchanter on call and don't have to pay 100pp per ore enchant (which is the going rate on storm hammer nowadays).<br />
<br />
The bit about the hollowshade war looks interesting. It's a **** well written guide if nothing else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The described method could get the aspiring smith up to skill 212, but not skill 220.  In fact, there is no reason to use sheets at all since the rings use one less brick.<br />
<br />
One other note:  I found the condensed chunk of XXX + flask of water (arrowhead recipe I believe) approach to getting to 115 VERY fast.   I could buy all I want of the condensed chunks in the bazaar (100pp a stack, but this is the high cost version...).  Nothing beats a 2 item combine :-)<br />

<br />
I was afraid of this.  I wrote this guide as if I've already gotten up to 222, when in fact I'm only up to 204.  (I was going to hold off submitting this to Denmother until I'd actually used it to get to 222.)<br />
<br />
The web site used to list the trivial on sheets as being 220, and had been reliable so far, so I made a rather large assumption without trying it out for myself.  I double-checked and triple-checked the information on the website just to be sure before I submitted this.<br />
<br />
I just now went back and checked, and the trivial for Ethereal Sheets is now listed as 212.  /sigh.  Ah well, so much for that.<br />

I will make the appropriate changes before I formally submit this.</div></div><hr />

I mention in the guide that I got about one skill-up per twenty attempts.  How consistent is that with everyone else's experience after they made that smithing patch recently?  Does one skill-up in twenty combines seem right to you, especially post-200?<br />

I am somewhat surprised that a high level human would go the shadowscream route.  Freeport cultural is fairly straightforward, the only bottleneck being sea temper.  Now that saltwater seaweed is droppable, even sea temper is easy, assuming you have a bit of plat to spare.<br />
<br />
If you can get the Gornit camp in OOT, you can hunt Gornit (a fast spawning Hill Giant who drops about 220pp an hour in plat alone), fish for seaweed while you med and even do the odd seafury cyclops if you have the mana.  <br />
<br />
Better yet, persuade a group of high 40s/low 50s friends to come hunt seafuries while you heal and buff them in return for any sea foam drops.  You can still fish at the same time....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mikel Morbidus</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually followed this route for my smithing. Worked up to 194 on Freeport Plate, then won hammer in a raid. Was going to write how I did it, but you beat me to the punch. :)<br />
<br />
After that, it was rings/rings/rings till I hit 212.<br />
<br />
About 1 skill up in 20 seems accurate to me. Of course, the random generator rarely makes things that simple. At least one of my skill ups took about 60 combines to get. Then again, after I made 212, I made two acryila armor pieces and got 213 on the second combine.<br />
<br />
I didn't have any 100+ combines hell levels like some other people have posted. Worst skill point was the 60+ one I mentioned.<br />
<br />
Also, as a high level character with access to some plat, (I am not rich, but I won a couple items which I was able to sell for smithing money) I found the bazaar a tremondous resource. I didn't have a lot of time to farm and gather components, as I am a leader in a fairly active raiding guild, so being able to walk in and just buy a stack of leather padding, etheral bricks or etheral temper saved me a huge amount of time. Granted, I went through about 30k going from 188 to 213, but I did that in less then a week after I got the Creator hammer. Got very little cash left, but I at least now make sickles and black acryila weapons and start to recover my losses a bit.<br />
<br />
Being able to make decent armor with smithing has always been a dream of mine, but one I thought I could never achieve due to my lack of time. However, with the bazaar, Creator hammer, and planes of power its now a reality.  :D</div></div><hr />

I have tried killing the &quot;leaders&quot; of the wolves, bears and grims and do not see an immediate &quot;attack&quot; by the tribe whose leader is killed.<br />
<br />
In fact yesterday, i killed the owlbear leaders and placeholders for 3 hours and saw many grims attacks northward and wolves attacks as well but NOT ONE owl bear attack at all.<br />
<br />
Finally, i helped the grims defeat the wolves; then an hour later the owls defeat the grims (in the east) then an hour later the owls FINALLY attacked the southern grimlings. Also, for the last hour and a half I found an ally in zone (55 SK) who kept the owl bears chiefs/placeholders cleared. <br />
<br />
So in summary, its my belief that (and I have heard whispers of) its not just killing the chiefs of the tribes but also a matter of certain directions need to be done in order to increase certain sequence.  In addition, it seemed that the zonewide message occured often on the hour (real life) which would be a multiple of the 12 minute spawn time. However, it could occur more than once per hour (but always at least once).  <br />
<br />
I would appreciate any ideas as I'm at 225 skill now and have 220 orbs ready to go so I would welcome anyone's insight into shortening what was a 5 hour night last night BEFORE I could farm.</div></div><hr />

You lose 8pp at max cha on the silver, I do not know what the rate is on the electrum, gold, and platinum, as I used it to skill up before the patch in may because I was rushing to get the last 65 points to get over 240 before they made it harder = ).<br />
<br />
But the way it works is still the same.<br />
<br />
What you do is you get a bag from the vendor that sells the HQ ore, he wants 4 bricks of the stuff, combined in the bag, returned to him to restock him. When you turn in the bag he despawns and then almost immediately respawns. The unrefined ore drops somewhat commonly in permafrost, especially deeper in, only the goblins can drop it. Runnyeye goblins can also drop it, but I found permafrost to be easier and that they dropped it more commonly. From a full supply on the vendor you can make about 180 rings if you use the right size ore, and around 216 if you combine the small bricks to make large bricks. <br />
<br />
I would not reccomend doing ornate chain unless you want fast skill ups and have the plat to burn, you WILL lose 160 plat per 20 combines if you suceed on making ALL the armor, if you fail any, tack on another 20 plat per failure. I got 40 skill ups before the patch using ornate chain, and it cost, it cost ALOT. Doing ornate chain armor you can crank out over 1000 combines in 4 days, I know because I did. And it cost me 40,000 platinum to do so. . . <br />
<br />
If you are still undaunted by the costs, here is a quick guide to doing the ornate chain armor.<br />
<br />
1 ) Make, or get a friend to make, a mule on a seperate account to help you out for a day as the unrefined ore is very VERY heavy. Bank anything you dont need and create as much space as you can, hopefully at least 72 slots.<br />
2 ) Head out to permafrost and farm unrefined ore, 4 of any type (small brick, large brick) will work as long as you get 4 of it. When you get back, say &quot;What job&quot; to Yakem Oreslinger<br />
3 ) Combine the ore in the Empty Ore Crate Yakem Oreslinger (who is in South Qeynos on the 2nd floor of the smithing building that is right in front of you when you zone in) and hand it to him. He will despawn and respawn with a full stock of ore. ( Note: if the server has gone down recently check to see if he still has ore on him, and save yourself a trip to permafrost )<br />
4 ) Buy Large bricks of High quality ore from Yakem Oreslinger ( for around 20 pp a shot) until your packs are full. Turn them into Rings and hand them to the mule that you made in step one as you go. Repeat until ore is depleted<br />
5 ) Head to North Qeynos and go into the side building of Ironforge's (Jewel Box) to buy silver, electrum, gold, or platinum bars ( whichever you need ), then directly outside stands Connie Link, buy your chain patterns from her and head back to South Qeynos.<br />
6 ) Luckily, Yakem Oreslinger also sells Flasks of water ( I say luckily because unless you have that mule, you are VERY encumbered at this point and your not going anywhere fast ) Buy the water you need for the combines, then combine : High Quality Rings (1 to 3 depending on piece), the chainmail pattern, a flask of water, a silver bar, and a smithing hammer. Combine until your packs are full, and go sell to the vendors ( Please note that Yakem Oreslinger is not on Qeynos Faction so you may not get the better sell price compared to the other vendors inside the building ) Repeat until you run out of rings<br />
7 ) Congragulations, with luck, you just gained 6 to 9 skill points in smithing, as well as burning at least 4,000 platinum. Repeat steps 3 through 6 until you run out of unrefined ore (or plat), repeat step 2 as needed until you triv the chain or run out of plat.<br />
<br />
Best of luck with your combines everyone</div></div><hr />

It cost the poster that much because they were skilling up on ornate chain when the trivial was in the 200s, not now. There was a deadline when the trivial was going to be lowered, so burning plat on ornate chain cut out A LOT of farming.</div></div><hr />

Avoid recipes calling for casks as long as possible, they are a pain cause they don't stack.<br />

Fishing grubs can be foraged, or bought in Kerra Isle and PoK.<br />

I tried at 192 +15% and forge wont allow .. ok Same forge at 193 15% mod let me do the combines w/o that stupid message. Thanks for 19 easy Skill points .. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkehawke Crimsonhands</div><div class="date">01-05-2003, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Based upon this guide my plans are as follows:<br />
<br />
I am a 65 wizard and I have been able to free up 6 of the 10 bags in my inventory. I have been using the advice garnered here to farm substances. I detest farming so I want to get as much of this done at once. The Wailing and Shrieking substances being no-drop is a problem in that I want to do this all at once, in one huge non-stop binge. This is how I plan to do this.<br />
<br />
Farm the substances make them into orbs, store the orbs on mules, placing Traders Satchels on them I can make the most of 8 slots of inventory and bank space for a total of 160 orbs. However I'm going from 185 on up as I am loathe to spend any more money paying exorbitant prices to bazaar mules. to this end I plan on making 1100 orbs which means I will need to make 7 mules to hold them. The mules, in reverse will hold any completed Shadowscream armor as well. <br />
<br />
A week before I go on my smithing binge I will farm the crap out of shadows in Twilight and fill up a mule with these. I will port said mule (over level 10) to my smithing spot, duel him and leave a corpse when i have farmed all of the shadows I need. Sadly, 1 corpse will not be enough as these cannot stay in the bank.  <br />
<br />
The day before the binge I will make a 4th type of mule, a mold mule to hold all of the molds for this project so as little running is done as possible.<br />
<br />
on the day of the binge I will loot 1 bag of shadows at a time in order to guard against loss of the no-rent shadows.<br />
<br />
Yes, I have 3 computers, yes I have more then 1 account. Yes, I am completely nuts, but I want to do it all at once. I want it out of the way, I want it as close to grand mastery as possible in 1 day and yes, I am aware how time consuming this approach will take, but I think I can pull it off.<br />
<br />
Advice/Comments would be appreciated,<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just farm the wolves and owl stuff till you have what ever level you need.<br />
Then go do the shadow stuff. I tried what you are talking about and it drove me nuts logging in different characters for the stupid orbs. But it is good to have em there to take trader satchels of completed stuff away.<br />

I have had a very frustrating time fighting the Bazaar Barons for the war rights upon reset. The zone on Terris Thule, is, as I write this, ALL Grimlings. It is a bitter, horrible thing.<br />
<br />
Thought I now have 400 Shrieking in the bank. I *WILL* meet this goal and I *WILL* Get this done. My will is good and unbroken. My goals are set and I can and will Attain them. I am mostly there and within sight of an end on the filling of the orb mules. <br />
<br />
Being a high level epicced wizard has made this much easier, killing 30ish at at time using f8/staff of temperate flux to pull with has proven quite usefull.<br />

The true trial here is keeping the spawns in the zone straight. I'll bet I'm the only one on the server hoping for another all out patch.<br />

<br />
Go to Sol A and kill 100s of gobos. Collect HQ Ore, and Fine Steel Weapons. Fill your inventory, go to a forge and melt these down to more HQ Ore. You'll get to 20 skill with this. Do this many times (you'll need it later)<br />
<br />
Make HQ Rings from the Ore you just farmed. Skill up to 45 - 50 trivial<br />
<br />
Make Banded Gorgets to 102, then Banded Mail to 115. <br />

You will have plenty of HQ Rings to make Ornate Chain to reach around 142... from then on its Fine Steel...</div></div><hr />

Thanks for all the great info,<br />
Ok here is my 2cp<br />
Tae ew shields: lizard-blood temper, &quot;2&quot; sheets of Sheetmetal, smithy hammer, kite shield mold (named &quot;tae ew shield&quot; in-game): lizard-blood temper, 2 sheets of metal, kite shield mold, smithy hammer; AC 35, STR 8, WIS 8, INT 8, HP 50, mana 50, sv fire 25, sv disease 7, sv poison 7, sv magic 10, wt 4.5, medium, magic, WAR, CLR, PAL, RNG, SHD, DRU, BRD, SHM; ALL, required level 51, trivial not provided <br />
<br />
As the guy stated, upper lvl guide to Gm,<br />
all tho this will cause you extended time farming it is one of the cheapest ways to get skill up, I'm 180 and still not trival, <br />
the great thing about this item, <br />
lizard-blood temper: scale temper , 1 Thul Tae Ew Blood (NO STACK), trivial &amp;lt;=153 <br />
scale temper (iksar) sarnak blood, froglok blood, iksar blood, bloodwater <br />
<br />
My point is simple, no chanters needed, second any smihty worth his wieght in gold is also 190 brewing, <br />
Down side is: much time spent farming<br />
Have fun good luck and may the gods smile on your drop rate,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gebster</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love this guide! It saved whatever hair was left in my head after a pathetic attempt to farm windstones. But I made 1 change to it so I thought I would share.<br />
<br />
I started with the boots mold at 188 (+ %5 skill mod geerlok)<br />
<br />
at 188 using boot mold<br />
12 success<br />
18 fails<br />
no skill up (30 attemps)<br />
<br />
so....I switched to a mask mold even though it takes 1 extra swirling shadow and my results were....<br />
<br />
at 188 using mask mold<br />
3 success<br />
2 failure<br />
1 skill point (5 attempts + the 30 on boot molds)<br />
<br />
189 using mask mold<br />
3 success<br />
0 failure<br />
1 skill point (3 attemppts)<br />
<br />
190 using mask mold<br />
4 success<br />
3 failure<br />
(ran out of shadows)<br />
<br />
I guess my point is, my skill seems to increase faster using pieces with a lower trivial and of corse with a better success rate for the most part. Even though they may use 1 more shadow, in the long run it would be less components since the skill is taking less combines to raise.  My future plans are<br />
<br />
Mask until 203-205 depending on how board I get with masks<br />
Helm until 208-ish, just like the masks<br />
Bracer until 228-ish, same as above<br />
Boots to 248<br />
<br />
Hope this helps anyone else that was getting a little frustrated with tons of fails and little skill ups. I'm still at 190 so we'll see how it goes from here.</div></div><hr />

Go farm about 200 ShadowScreem combines (RNG is broken sarcastic remark insert here &gt;&amp;lt;) and get that last point you need.

The switches come very fast sometimes -- sometimes as little as five minutes between switches.  Happened to me the other day with wolves;  a bunch of post-60 characters including yours truly were trying to keep wolves up, but the war kept switching like crazy, and during one turn, the wolves came out and took over the southern isles for only a few minutes before switching.  I got only two shrieking substances(I two-box a 63 shaman and 60 monk), two other 60's casters got only 1 substance between them, and one lucky 50'ish ranger got 2 substances.  Then POW, the mobs changed again on us.  <br />
<br />
Combine the rapid changes in HSM with the occasional person killing nameds for loot, and I find farming hollowshade far more difficult now.  The other weekend, by the time I got only 33 shrieking substances, I had well over 200 wailing substances.  After a lot more hunting all weekend, when I mostly just refused to loot any more wailing, I still have over 100 wailing sitting in the bank, no more shrieking.</div></div><hr />
