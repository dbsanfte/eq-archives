<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Antoin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After hearing about your backup woes (and remembering earlier about having a HDD crash at home) I looked over to my left and saw the 3.2 GB tape drive I picked up at an auction for 20 bucks.  It works AFAIK.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately it's parallel-port and the software's windows-specific, but it could save some people some major headaches; you could back things up locally in case anything happened.<br />
<br />
It's a Seagate TapeStor 3200.  It came with 3 unopened 3.2GB (1.6 uncompressed) tapes.<br />
<br />
I don't use it right now and I figured I'd offer it to you, although I may end up using it myself in a few days.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I just expected some time since the last failure to make a backup.  I had about 12 hours from when I got all my rights back to the next failure...  and I didn't happen to make a new backup in that time.</div></div><hr />
