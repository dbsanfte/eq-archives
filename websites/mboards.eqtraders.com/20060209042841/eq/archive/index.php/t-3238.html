I've been looking to upgrade my pants, and the Cazic-Thule leather has some nice stats.  I haven't spent much time in CT myself so I don't know what the drop rate is on the materials.<br />
<br />
Any input on the difficulty or advice would be welcome.  I'm not rich, but I'm willing to camp for good stuff.<br />
<br />
The materials needed are: Flawless Tae Ew Hide and Tae Ew Blood.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

The drop rate on the blood was just recently increased. Getting that shouldn't be too hard. They can drop off any lizard including the ones by the zone in. However, I haven't heard anything about a change in drop rate on the hides. You may want to ask over in the tailoring forum for where to best camp for hides.</div></div><hr />

I'm not aware of any of the other tailors having made them.  I've been unable to camp for the materials myself, nassy zone.  Nice stats on those pants.  Klugge is currently selling the 2nd pair i made for him.</div></div><hr />
