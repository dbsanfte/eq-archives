<br />
Now Sanna wrote up a little chart of who is expressing interest in the guild, here is what is done so far;<br />
<br />
Thank you Sanna, I'm going to start write more people in, if you wish to take this back over just let me know.<br />

<br />
More as I catch posts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, as I said before;<br />
<br />
HERE (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=7077) I see this guild as a FAMILY guild first who all likes to do serous Tradeskills with raids later on in life to help people get tradeskill items and level up/explore.<br />
<br />
So to me that means everyone who is doing this likes playing a game for fun. Yes, some might level faster then others but we will not be enforcing &quot;Power Leveling&quot; of anything besides people who like to play together a lot. We will work on tradeskills when the person doing them wants to. If someone wants to wait till they are level 50, ok, if it's getting over 150 in each skill by level 20, that's fine also. This is for FUN!<br />
<br />
Also, I know we all love and don't want to give up our 'real' mains on our 'real' servers. This is something else to do, like I said before, when your main can't find a group or dies 3 times in one day.<br />
<br />
Please, make HELPFUL comments here, if you want to join or you want to ask to be an officer post here. Don't try and bring down some people having fun. Once we get things fleshed out more, we will work on who the leaders, elders and officers are. Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galathnor</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I mentioned in the other post, I would be interested in doing baking or brewing, but wasn't sure about race or class. After thinking on this some more, I believe that I would like to make a Wood Elf Druid, and do either baking or brewing or maybe even both. The Druid would be good for ports later on, and for foraging also. I have done both to the higher 190s already, so am pretty familiar with the recipes up to that point. I would also be available if needed to help anyone else in those skills and if you look at my sig I am pretty familiar with most of the other skills also. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delfontes</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know exactly what I did to not get mentioned in the officers there ;).<br />
<br />
I'd like to be able to maintain stuff, add members/remove as needed.  For the first few weeks I think we should be inviting people without too much hassle, call it a trial membership.  If they turn out not to be interested in tradeskills, or have any little problems in their trial period, not a big loss, and certainly no investment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maevenniia</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can count me in.<br />
<br />
As for what I’d play, I was thinking of a Gnome enchanter, because chanters are so necessary to almost all the other tradeskills, I haven’t played a gnome yet, and I wanted to try tinkering.  I’m sure the guild will need more than one enchanter, so I hope you don’t mind Delfontes.<br />
<br />
My other possibilities were Froglok cleric or shaman, or DE cleric.  Or maybe Vah’shir shaman. Hmmm, soooo many possibilities…….although nothing beats a wizard with PBAoE for mass-farming of greenies for silks and such :)<br />
<br />
(argh, I love my wizard…if only I could be a wizard-chanter!)<br />
<br />
I like all the tradeskills, although pottery, baking and spell research are my current favourites.  I’m willing to be an officer in whatever capacity I can serve.<br />
<br />
Can't wait for the new server, this will be fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunlar</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Sunbelle(yanamila), sunlar, and all need new avatars on the new server.  I wonder if ngreth or denmom have been playing since beta??  they could be considered for name of the server then.  We get to do a vote according to VI so it looks like  late may or june for a start date as a guess.<br />
<br />
Sunlar, et. al.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Faymar</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to admit I could be a bit nervous about joining the guild (a guild is for life, not just for christmas) based on how things pan out, but the idea is definitely tempting....<br />
<br />
Edit: Cyrnan has a very good point. This, for me, would be a fun diversion. I have no intention of leaving Tarew Marr, the new server would be my secondary playground ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EnfinitiStarr8</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wanted to talk about the Elder Council for a few moments. If some of you say there are more then 12 Tradeskills b/c Spell Research is divided between 4 classes then you have to say there is something like 30+ Tradeskills. By that I mean I would then have to say I need someone for Human Cultural, for Dark Elf Cultural, For Wood Elf Fletching and someone for non cultural Fletching. It's just too much.<br />
<br />
That is why I said each member should have a well but NOT supreme knowledge of the skill. Its hard to have supreme knowledge when you never have to worry about making Dwarven Armor or Erudite Tailoring.<br />
<br />
As it stands this second I would be honored if Zeralenn would mind being the Smithing Council Member. I think she has a grand understanding of the overall Smithing world.<br />
<br />
Also, I fully expect some people to be level 60+ within 2 weeks or so of launch. Why? They know all the exploits and will use them. I have been playing for over 2 years and am still only level 53 with 0 AAs so I don't use them, I report them. Many people will not have the money to spend for tradeskill items, but we can barter and work together. I just want the opportunity to play with you all on an &quot;even field&quot; if you will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iceblossom</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't know if I am up to being guilded, for one, I hate to commit to the time and for two, I am not really wanting to join a &quot;tradeskilling&quot; guild.  Been there, done that.   Like a poster or two above me, I am very serious about my commitment to a guild and I don't need any more opportunities for self-reproachment for not doing enough.<br />
<br />
I think at first I will be hunkering down doing the newbie quests and then going off to meet compatible people.   There are a few other characters that I would like to make, a lot are just classes/races I haven't done much with before.  I have never really been a druid of any sort for example. <br />
<br />
But I really don't plan to be leaving my main server, just sometimes I like to go and meet new people.  Besides, with three smiths already over 100, I need to get my Vah Shir up over her 120 or so to do the Sonic Wolf Bane.  The tinkering cleric is only at 156.  The enchanter is still 29 and needs to enchant her own platinum before she really progresses in jewelry.  There is a little rogue on another server who would like to get the time and age to make poison (the one tradeskill I do not have a high master in).  And Ice the shaman is still stuck at smithing 191 and tailoring 161... and she needs to go kill sirens for the next shawl quest... and and and.<br />
<br />
So many tradeskills, so many characters, so little time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyrnan</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My question is this -- Are all of you hardcore tradeskillers, with mid-high-uber level characters on other servers where you've worked months and years to improve, really all going to throw in to a new server and go full bore into a guild? Or are you going to get it started, then one by one trickle off, back to your comfortable servers and known characters and alts?<br />
<br />
I ask this only because I think everyone jumping on this bandwagon should be honest with him-or-herself and everyone posting here about their commitment to the long run. That way, egos, feelings and attitudes will remain unbruised in the foeseeable future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anhar</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking of starting a new character on this server, just because I like the new atmosphere. I am / have been a trade junkie, even if my skills don't bare fruit (see my sig).<br />
<br />
As an officer in Blackmaul and Stormhammers Alpha Storm, I can't commit to being an officer in DMC, but to be a participant would be nice. And yes I do plan on taking a full week-2weeks off my main guild time to power level my characters.<br />
<br />
I also 2box on occasion, and actually have 3 accounts (blast Firiona Vie's restriction of 1 character!). I will have at least one cleric bot and then either a necromancer or rogue, two classes I have never played. Cleric will be either a froggy cleric, or a human cleric for the human cultural. Not sure of diety yet, but probably Mith Marr. Necro of course is agnostic. My necro will start out as a brewer, moving on to the other 6 skills as possible, and needed to get the Shawl.<br />
<br />
Names will be thought out before the server goes live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanna</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Delfontes - sorry, most of that original list's compliation was done while juggling ordering plane tickets to Germany and staving off an overly-stressed father and trying to keep him from findingo ut that i'm posting on a board about everquest, that complete and total waste of time and when am i gonna pay attention to the important things in life like a job and a career. So, I apologize for missing you in the O-list. <br />
<br />
Enfiniti - Delfontes is on the M-list twice, once at the top and once near the bottom. Unless you just really don't want to, I can keep up with the list, NP. ^_^ <br />
<br />
re Enfiniti's comments about splitting up 'council' into too many columns....<br />
yes, that is a point. at the very least, we ought to try to get all the ' i wanna be officer ' people in a channel or something, and (calmly!!!) hash this ALL out. i suppose put that on the list of things to be discussed. <br />
<br />
Re Cyrnan - <br />
Also a good point. <br />
for my part: I love Iroke, but Sullon... unless something changes, I need a break from Sullon. Due to finishing-what-i-signed-up-for, if i 'abandon' Sullon/Iroke, it's going to be for a) finishing the mod (estimate 2 days if i do nothing else for those 2 days, which might be able to happen real soon), and b) Mithaniel.Clico. I need to finish the dwarven cultural trivial thing. <br />
<br />
I'm not actually going to play Clico, she is solely an experiment and a tool. But I have a responsibility there i must finish. BUT, when she is done...<br />
<br />
I want a good solid 'blue' charactor to play. I could turn around and play Clico when the smithing is all done. But I could just as easily untangle her in the end, and go to NewServer and start a new char. (NewServer, new names! I could FINALLY get Sanna!)<br />
<br />
I consider myself able to be a hardcore tradeskiller. At the very least, I will be a part-time tradeskiller. On a scale of 0-100, I put myself as able to be anywhere from 25 to 99. <br />
<br />
Unless something massive changes,  I do not want to be leader. But I might want to be some sort of managerial officer, if there is needed such a capacity to be filled. I like leveling perfectly well; I like grouping, I don't really like soloing b/c it's somewhat boring. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
People will come, people will go. People may come and be sincerely serious about DMC for five months, and then suddenly lose interest. In the end, EQ is just a game and that must be expected. For myself, I do like to finish what I start.... sometimes it just takes a while. But I also have no problem with setting up a system and handing it to someone capable of keeping the system intact. <br />
<br />
Cyrnan has a very very very good point. Define what you want. Don't be afraid to say it. If DMC is not entirely for you, so be it, it happens. I am willing to help wherever I can. <br />
<br />
I am, and had better be for a while, sullon.iroke. (i wish /afk messages went between servers, tho.... if i don't respond, then i'm in bazaar and afk.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morani</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to admit a certain amount of interest in this but it would DEFINATELY be a fun thing for me. I'm already an officer of a guild and only have 2 nights a week that I can play EQ so I would not consider myself dependable for any time commitment. I'd like to know more about what is being looked at as &quot;required/requested&quot; of members (not elders/officers). As it stands right now, I tend to be on-line latter than the most of my guild so it would be nice to have an option. I also like the opportunity to learn more about the game from people who've been doing it for a long time.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quinner Sparrowhawk</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My replies may become sporadic - My school system finally added this BB to their blocking list  :( <br />
<br />
1) I will step aside if Lilosh is seriously interested in being the Guild Leader. I would like to be an officer.<br />
<br />
2) None of us who have not ever started on a fresh server can tell whether we will like it better or not. Even old timers who have been there, done that, might find the new server to be more to their liking. Some will stay and some will leave after a week. That doesn't matter. What does is that everyone remembers that it is just a game and we all play to have fun.<br />
<br />
3) The purpose of this guild on a new server is for many us who trade words back and forth here and on the channel to be a part of something all together. There may be some members who never get out of their low teens and only visit on off days. There will be some that do nothing but work on GMing in a particular skill. It's all good because we will be family.<br />
<br />
4) This whole thing could fall apart by the end of the summer but as someone once said there would never be a need for more than 5 or so computers in the world. We are creating........which is the one thing that drives us to do what we do :)<br />
<br />
5) Think before posting about disinterest or pooh-poohing our dream here. It's not really adding anything to the discussion. Pointing out pitfalls is a great idea to help us from repeating the mistakes of others.<br />
<br />
6) I was planning on making a Dwarf Cleric for the purposes of grouping but if I need a character of a particular skill of which to be a Guild Elder then I will make a Shaman and take on Alchemy.</div></div><hr />

If this is the general consensus, then count me interested. I have NO idea what I'm interested in playing though. :)</div></div><hr />

Someone do the legwork to apply for the guild, I was told you can start it on your local server and just transfer it over to be there day one.<br />
<br />
Since I don't know that first hand, don't quote me... just don't want to have a weeks worth of waiting once the server opens, that first week is vital to have good communication in other than a chat channel over there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And then, rather than try to keep up a confuzzing text list of possible members (though I will do so of L and O candidates)... click this link. <br />
at least it BETTER be a link. <br />

http://www.sannask.com/misc/eq/new_server.html http://www.sannask.com/misc/eq/EQ_CR_color_01_small.gif plz show up stupid thumbnail.......&lt;/a&gt; <br />
<br />
Well, the link works to the page, even if the thumbnail wont' show up. That is supposed to be a small version of a chart i made up the other day of what race can be what class... just because i wanted to know. the link takes you to a page of Who has volunteered to be what, where the volunteering is rather specific.

<br />
Looks like a broken link, but it worked fine when I clicked on it.<br />
<br />
Two gnome chanters?<br />
<br />
Competition, I like it ;).  Ok I don't, hehe.  <br />
<br />
Gonna be a blast, with the vote already going to name the server it seems they are going forward fast.<br />
<br />
I am thinking it could be within a couple weeks, so this has to be coordinated well :).<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the hard work done so far, and over the next few weeks getting started.<br />
<br />
P.S. Lilosh posted while I was typing, doh.  Is there a way to set it up with 20 people from other servers with the intention of starting the guild on day one of the new server?</div></div><hr />

<br />
stuff for link fixed. I realized I'M not in those charts, but i'll have to edit that in later.<br />
<br />
We get to vote on names either 'now' or 'very soon' (the link on the EQ site takes you to the DevCorner page about the new server, i can't make it take me to a voting page or anything'). I leave the fudging country on june 10, i be sooooo mad if verant does this to me........</div></div><hr />

Otherwise I would suggest setting up the guild on a server that nobody (or very few of us) currently inhabit to avoid any existing guild/char conflicts.<br />
<br />
As far as characters go, I can play anything. I like them all, even Troll Shadowknights.<br />
<br />
I like the Council of Twelve idea better than the Grey Council (Only 9). It can be trade or race based. I know that we are setting out to be a tradeskilling guild but we don't have to lock ourselves into that mode for our elders. (BTW - Some of us have a great deal of knowledge of different tradeskills that is not reflected in our skill levels due to class level restrictions,money restrictions, etc.) Either way, 12 is a good number for officers but we do want to be sure that each officer has specific responsibilities beyond the tradeskills.</div></div><hr />

Hm. Depending on how things pan out (IE, will i even BE HERE?? /sniff, /cry) I could be Elder Baker, I have decent knowledge there. But if someone else had their heart set on it, sure, let em have it. ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galathnor</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 01:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just let me know when to be where, and I will be there. I can if needed log onto 3 accounts at the same time if that would help. <br />
<br />
The following is cut and pasted from the EQLive site:<br />
<br />
Guild Creation<br />
<br />
If you decide that none of the existing guilds are quite what you are looking for, you may create your own guild. In order to establish your guild, you must have an acceptable name, charter, and a membership of 10 players who wish to form this guild.<br />
<br />
The following process needs to be followed to gain approval for your guild:<br />
<br />
The person who is to be the leader of the guild must enter the chat server and issue the #makeguild command. This will create a private guild channel. The name of the guild should be used as the name of the channel, although this name can be edited later during the creation process.<br />
<br />
<br />
After the channel has been created, the guild leader needs to invite the members of his guild into the channel. To do this, he needs to tell the guild members the name of the channel and the password for access.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once 10 or more members are in the channel, they need to issue the #approveguild command. The guild leader can then issue the #makeguild command. This will move the guild leader to the guild creation screen. <br />
<br />
<br />
In the guild creation screen, the guild leader needs to enter a summary of the guild's charter. This summary should focus on the guild's role in Norrath and the goals it will pursue. Details of the internal working of your guild need not be included. You may also edit your guild's name in this screen. Once completed, hit FINISH and the guild will be submitted for approval. It's important that you double-check the spelling of the guild name because it could be approved with submitted spelling and then could be very hard to change.<br />
<br />
<br />
The leader of the guild may check the status of the guild by activating the GUILDS button from chat. If the status of the guild indicates a need for revision, the guild leader should select his guild and hit the EDIT button. Comments regarding the nature of the needed revision appear at the bottom of the guild creation screen.The guild leader can edit the charter and the guild name as needed and hit the FINISH button to resubmit the guild for approval. IMPORTANT: If the leader is only viewing the revisions needed, hit CANCEL to exit this screen. If the leader hits FINISH, the guild will be resubmitted for approval and the leader will be unable to re-enter the guild creation/edit screen. IMPORTANT: If your guild is listed as Initial Approval, it is not fully approved yet. Please do not petition on server to have your guild created at this point. <br />
<br />
<br />
If the name and charter are approved, the guild leader will be notified via email that the guild is ready to be created. IMPORTANT: Please verify that your email is correct in our registration information by:  A) Going to &quot;Account&quot; B) Then going to &quot;Change Account&quot; C) Then going to &quot;Edit Registration&quot; from the login screen. NOTE: It is important that you have the correct email address listed, or you will not get your approval letter promptly. <br />
<br />
<br />
After the guild leader has received notification via email that the guild has been approved, it is his/her responsibility to petition and meet a GM to complete the guild creation process. Only the Creator needs to be present for creation.<br />
For fastest service, try to petition between 2PM and 10PM PST. If this is not possible, you may either petition and allow a Guide to assist you further or locate and request the assistance of the Chat GM.<br />

 All copyrite etc is the property of SOE.<br />

Just thought this might be info we would need.</div></div><hr />

Then make a channel called Denmom's Children, and we all join it.<br />
<br />
Once we get the approval e-mail Quinner just needs to petition when we first log onto that server.<br />
<br />
Viola, day 1.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Sanna, I hope you're gonna add Tinkering for me ;)<br />
<br />
And Alchemy/Poison making for shamen/rogues...<br />
<br />
Those class specific research ones are not gonna be happening like that.<br />
<br />
I volunteer for the &quot;Tinkering Elder&quot; position as it were.</div></div><hr />

4. JC<br />
5. Pottery<br />

9. Spell Research - ALL INT casters<br />

<br />
If I am not the leader then I would like to be the Fletching Elder. Being a Wood Elf Druid I have Cultural Fletching open to me and my real Main is a Ranger so I already know a great deal about it.</div></div><hr />

As I'm an officer in my current guild (and don't get much time to play anyway) it would be hard to commit totally.<br />
<br />
As I have played a warrior since I started EQ (2 years ago nearly) I'd probably go for a SK for a little variation (with the instinct to tank I'd be pureed if I tried a caster) and probably a DE cos I love em so much.<br />
<br />
Also it being a part time thing I'd probably not get any skills up so high, but don't mind being tasked with endless subcombines for others (provided of course I get some benefit from the finished result of your skilling), so something of a jack-of-all-trades I would be.</div></div><hr />

This is what I get for not reading the boards for a week.<br />
<br />
Although I'm not nearly as expirenced with tradeskills as the rest of you - I love this community and want in the guild on the new server too - if you'll have me ;-)<br />

Most likely as a wood-elf rogue baker/poison-maker-person-thingy  :shock:</div></div><hr />

Whoa - What happened to Lilosh and Enfiniti? I was only on standby as leader. I think we need to have a vote or something. Any suggestions as to how to do this?</div></div><hr />

I was thinking of making a new thread with a poll for the 3 leader picks. But i wanted to wait to see if anyone else wanted to ask to be a leader. I didn't want to just eliminate them. But if it's just Lilosh, Quinn and myself. I'll make a poll and everyone can vote.</div></div><hr />

I'm mostly a lurker here, as I've recently returned to EQ. But I've had great fun on Bristlebane working through the first Coldain Shawls as well as toying with tailoring to get it up.<br />
<br />
I've rolled Morlaren, a gnome enchanter, who is now level 7. I'm not certain about other alts...I miss my wizard and might create one as well. :)<br />
<br />
So does the guild exist yet?</div></div><hr />
