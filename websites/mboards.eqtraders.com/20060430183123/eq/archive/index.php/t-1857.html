A friend of mine just recently quit and bequethed me with 9.5K :D.  I dabbled in smithing a while back and managed to get up to 115, but I was curious what skill lvl I could expect to have if I went ahead and poured all the cash into smithing.  Has anyone had any similar experiences?<br />

PS I have about 170 str and maybe 57 cha in my best smithing gear, I assume this will affect my skill up rates?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">9.5k will get you to 188 easily.  From there it will burn up quickly.  If you go shadowscream you'll use next to no money, but it will take massive amount of component camping.  If you go acrylia, expect to pay somewhere in the neighborhood of 600pp a combine or more if you purchase the combines in the bazaar.  If you have a specific low end cultural you can work on, the price may be more or less, depending on the components needed and how available they are, but it won't be cheap.<br />
<br />
The upside is, sometimes you can sell your successes in the bazaar and make most or all of your money back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oggom</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would it be a better idea to pick up a small set of str/cha gear to help with 188 or to just burn it and get it later?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xorshaik</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go for anything you can upgrade by 5 to 10 points in STR per slot for under 500pp. (preferably well under). There are some good pieces you might not otherwise think of that are **** cheap.. Bear skins of rage gave me 20 STR in chest for 60pp or something like that.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, 9.5k will get you to 188 yes, but if you had 188 and had 9.5k, you probably wouldn't get 189 by blowing your money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Something to invest in is a suit of gear that raises your strength.  Lately, I have taken to the bazaar to try to max out my strength on the cheap.  This is what I recommend;<br />
<br />
Crustacean Shell Boots, 6 STR<br />
Crustacean Shell Bracer or Validus Custodus Plate Bracer, 5 STR<br />
Validus Custodus Plate Breastplate, 10 STR<br />
Crustacean Shell Gauntlets, 8 STR<br />
Validus Custodus Plate Greaves, 6 STR<br />
Crustacean Shell Vambraces, 8 STR<br />
Validus Custodus Plate Girdle, 5 STR<br />
Validus Custodus Plate Helm, 6 STR<br />
Validus Custodus Plate Pauldron, 5 STR<br />
Validus Custodus Plate Visor, 4 STR<br />
Validus Custodus Plate Collar, 4 STR<br />
<br />
All pieces here should be relatively cheap at 50 to 100p.  The total strength listed is 72 points.  Ears, fingers, primary, secondary, ranged, and cloak slots are still open here... even at just 3 STR in each of these, you would have a total strength bonus of 96.   This should put an Ogre Shadowknight way over 200 STR.  If you are so inclined, you could acquire some better pieces on the cheap too, like a Hero Bracer for an additional 5 STR.  You probably already have some good pieces.  This investment would be ideal for helping you skill up faster.<br />
<br />
You CHA needs help too.  I recommend a pair of Opal Encrusted Steins with will add 50 to your CHA.  Even if you have to pay a bit for these, it will pay for itself in no time even just selling things to vendors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
also for charisma when buying and selling which i deem very important. get 2 opal encrusted steins..25 charisma each..any charisma over 110 with indif faction is basically pointless, so 2 steins should get you pretty close.<br />
<br />
when making fine plate selling back to the vendors you dont lose a lot of cash, a few plat per combine, and recycling this money back into smithing that 9.5k will get you pretty far..like someone said most likely to 188 and beyond.</div></div><hr />

You can always buy a strength buff/potion from a shaman. And if that isn't possible. Drink your way to 255 strength, alcohol can be your freind in this game.</div></div><hr />

I have 190 in smithing (worked on this b4 the famous patch) and would like to improve it.<br />
<br />
I read many posts here, got the Shir Anvil and huming luclinite mallet, tried as well some acrylia combines. I was thinking about culturale but seems there is no issues to get some decent success with only 190 in skill.<br />
<br />
(I got a gearlock, that make my skill up to 200 or near but this is still not enough)<br />
<br />
I don't get many times to farm items (like for the vah shir way) and would like to find a faster (but costly) way to improve my skill.<br />
<br />
I'm quite sure there is not, but well, I'm not an expert and would like to know if any of the great people posting here got some ideas here. Didn't start a new topic, thought it didn't worst it.<br />
<br />
Thx in advance for answers.<br />

I think it cost me almost 8k to do 20..at 196 skill no imps, no successes..would NOT be my preferred method. <br />
<br />
however if you can make some to sell, it can turn around the profits for more smithing fairly easily. These bad boys cost somewhere along 300-400 per combine, take a zillion clicks each, but if you have cash to throw around, thats ONE method..but if you have cultural you can try, its probably not the best method.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArrakeenNaedShoj</div><div class="date">01-05-2003, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">25k could easily get you to 250 range, if you are doing Shadowscream, Old Cultural, and/or Acrylia, IF you farm the components yourself. The shadowscream will only cost you the banded mold, and the Old cultural will only cost you a gem, the ore, the mold, and the price to pay an enchanter to enchant for you, I think acrylia is all farmed like shadowscream. You may even make money if you are lucky selling the acrylia and old cultural, but that depends on you, your server, and which race you are.<br />
<br />
As far as successes on cultural. At 190 skill you will have already reached the 95% range for successes on the &quot;old&quot; style cultural, I have done over 300 combines at skill 193 and my success rate has been just over that. The BD Cultural though is a different story. Until you get your modified skill in the 210-220 range, you won't even break the minimum 5% success rate ALL smiths would have on the item. <br />
<br />
DO NOT attempt to do sickles at your current skill unless you have over 100k to throw at them. You will have about a 5% success rate which means that you would have to sell them at over 6K each to make a profit. If you have over 100k and a geerlock, however, you might be able to do enough combines to get your skill to a level when your success rate starts going up and maybe get the number up above 10% where you only have to break 3k to make money on them. Either way, you are still probably better off spending that 100k on old cultural, shadowscream, or acrylia, attempts to get your skill up to 210 or so before switching over to sickles.</div></div><hr />
