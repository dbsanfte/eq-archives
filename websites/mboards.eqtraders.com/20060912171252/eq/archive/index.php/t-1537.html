<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jacobrobbins</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just finished up Wu's last night and i was wondering which way is fastest to go- velius, or acryla? I have tons of money to spend so i'm just looking for the fastest way.  I have a bunch of small bricks of velium from velks if that would help at all. Also i am a 58 ranger so i can track stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username"></div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am almost in the same boat as you.  I've seen a lot of people going to that solstice robe, failing miserably just to get skill-ups....<br />
<br />
I plan on researching that, and combining the Hopper hides I've already collected.<br />
<br />
The major problem with hopper hides is that they aren't always up, and when up are heavily farmed. <br />
<br />
Best thing to do for you would be soloing naturally on hoppers, fear kite, but no exp to speak of anymore at your level.  For faster kills you might want 1 partner like a rogue/wizard, give them flawless, keep the superb for now... or 50/50 it and keep flawless for later... which theoretically can get you to 242.<br />
<br />
Don't know anything about velium, so I can't give a valid opinion of that.</div></div><hr />

If you have the cash to spend and don't want to do the farming, you should be able to get the pelts and acrylia in the bazaar.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dexanth</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would go with acrylia. Velium tailoring requires vials of mana and such. Acrylia is how I am currently skilling up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mnemosyne</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been doing velious tailoring mostly to get skill ups.  I buy reasonably priced hides in the bazaar and farm them myself being a druid.  To get velium and a little cash i rip apart CC and since my farming partner is a chanter he could sell there before the faction change.  In theory acrylia is the best way to go but from my experience, the actual acrylia is hard to get.  Unless you can get a group in AC. The Sambata hardly drop it (I've noticed a better flawless/superb hide drop ratio from hoppers than acrylia from the Sambata) and farming in TM can be tough with all the wolves and bats that hang around.<br />
<br />
My advice to you would be do everything you can get your hands on.  On days when you have nothing to do, gather components from velious and bank them for later, farm and buy as much acrylia as you can get.  I've never tried solstice robes but I hear that if you fail on them a lot its not as expensive as succeeding making a robe.  But in the end it's all going to get you points.</div></div><hr />

(Joking)   Ebay? (/Joking)<br />
<br />
Seriously, if Money were no object, I would go with robes.<br />
<br />
If I didnt have to worry about reselling 6 million robes, then it would be much less stressful.<br />

<br />
Its not unreasonable to figure 60 robe combines a night. You would be hard pressed to get 3 stacks of hides and the acrylia needed for 60 combines every night.</div></div><hr />
