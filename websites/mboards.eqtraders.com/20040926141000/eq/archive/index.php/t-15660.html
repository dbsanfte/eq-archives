<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Emron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking at attempting to make a few haversacks (skill at 196 unmodified).  I expect that the blue diamonds are a drop, just wondered where I should start looking for them (to loot them myself).<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pardick_KB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Vendors drop them all the tiome :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Vendor mine, especially a day after the patch. My fav places are every single vendor in PoK (but especially those near the port in and the banks), vendors in Gunthak, bazaar, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mainiac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hit the mother lode of blue diamonds!<br />
<br />
It happened one morning at breakfast, I pour a bowl of Luck Charms and son of gun! Blue diamonds galore!<br />
<br />
OK, now seriously, I find them on vendors quite frequently, once found over 6 stacks on a single vendor, I stopped buying, he had more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Has anyone gotten a Purple Horseshoe lately? I havent seen any on vendors. Have they nerfed the drop rate?<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the purple horseshoe was dislodged from<br />
the dead horse during one of it's many beatings...  while there have been several people claiming it was a stealth nerf to the dead horse, appearantly the horseshoe is actually now working as intended.<br />
<br />
.. and yes, PoK merchants for BD's... PoT vendors usually have some too within the first few days after patches/sever downtimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ariene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd buy them as well.  As stated PoK vendors usually have a ton.  LDoN Magus vendors usually have some and PoTranquility is a good chance if you don't find enough in PoK.<br />
<br />
If you really want to kill for them...<br />
BoT or LDoN is probably your best bet I can think of atm. Seb is good but I heard a rumor that was nerfed?  The boats in Dulak drop a lot of gems as well from what I hear - if you didn't get BDs you could at least use the cash from the other gems to go shopping in PoK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Furyrpied</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">PoN stalkers camp, if it's open.<br />
<br />
The mobs drop<br />
<br />
Diamonds (known)<br />
Rough Diamonds (kinda hazy memory)<br />
Blue Diamonds (absolutly)<br />
<br />
Semi rare tho, would be faster to do some window shopping in PoK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Heartsong_Steelsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At 55, we get an occasional blue diamond in lost dungeons, and I can only assume they are slightly more common as you get higher.  I would just make sure you have cash on you and offer your group the vendor buy price.<br />
<br />
Anyway, a friend of mine buys most of his off the magus at the camp, which seems to work quite well for him.</div></div><hr />

Rough Diamonds? Is that something new? I knew they dropped Raw Diamonds, did they change the name or it that a new drop?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jarilon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Back when LoY first came out I was camping the ships in Dulak's Harbor for a charm slot item and I got a surprising number of blue diamonds from doing that.  I could easily keep the decks clear with a charmed Wharf Rat.  Of, if you have a few willing friends, go AE the place :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Furyrpied</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Told you my memory was hazey..... :)<br />
<br />
Raw Diamonds... that's them<br />
oh, and some other 'junk items' as well drop from the stalkers...<br />
<br />
As a druid you can charm kill these, get 'decent' AA exp (or regular exp if that is within your range) and get some nice diamond drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Galgond Cloudburst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A guildie told me blue diamonds drop sometimes off mobs on the boats in Dulak so I decided to go hunt there some and within like 15 minutes got a blue diamond drop.  Not sure on how common they are though b/c I didn't stay online too much longer.<br />
<br />
*I have since this post hunted the dandalok boat for quiet some time and have had only one blue diamond and one named spawn in maybe 5 to 6 hours of camping.  I don't mind b/c in part I'm just there for the good aa xp I get quadding.  Just wanted to say this is most probably not the way to go about trying to get blue diamonds :p*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Bought 4 stacks of BD's off the PoTranq vendor near the bank yesterday. ^^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Optimum1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What magical phantasmagorical happy happy joy joy servers are you folks on? &quot;Oh the Blue Diamonds rain down from the heavens. Every NPC has stacks and stacks. Spiderlings drop them...&quot; I have tried to vendor farm them, I think I have gotten 3 or 4 BDs for my couple of hours invested. That's fine if you're making some resist gear for that inkie hunny you have on the side but it's not going to cut it for real mass-production style tradeskilling. On Bristlebane ya raid for em, pharm til ya puke for em or pay out the wazoo for em.<br />
<br />
BTW I have personally had decent luck getting soem BDs in Dulak while PLing alts. Especially in the large enclosed area near the drydocked boats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">&quot;...inkie hunny you  have on the side...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
/wipes coffee from the monitor =D<br />
<br />
If it makes you feel better, I look for BD's all the time. Yesterday seemed an oddity with a gazillion of them on one vendor. I did buy every last one them, hopefully to tide me over until I can find another vendor with a few.<br />
<br />
I did also check every vendor in the PoK library (was short a few haberno peppers to make slarg poppers, so foraged while shopping til i got enough) - only found 3 more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've only twice found BDs on a vendor. Haversack makers here have driven prices sky high, and I can't imagine finding a whole STACK of them on a vendor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Some more vendors to check are the ones around teleport and port stone (shaman and cleric) destinations.  <br />
<br />
I hunt in Dulak quite a bit and sell my gems to the merchants in the Shaman's Guild in Shar Vahl.  Being a lowbie area the merchant doesn't get picked over much like the ones in PoK and she usually has the gems till the server goes down.<br />
<br />
I should put them on my Bazaar mule but the competition to sell them on my server is bad and the price is often down to 250pp so I don't bother.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am on BB also and just the other day I went to see my friend Jolum in baz and he had 12 stacks of BD's for me to buy, being that he had even more showing I of course sent a tell to my bestest friend and she came and bought more stacks.<br />
<br />
Still ol' Jolum had more to give, so I logged on an alt and bought 6 more stacks...<br />
<br />
Sadly I was out of plat  :irked:  so I had to stop buying, but ol' Jolum had plenty more for others apparently because an hour later someone was in auction channel sellin over 100 BD's for 350pp per, I guess he paid Jolum a visit too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>syndellbristle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">older servers (like the blessed bristlebane in which i inhabit) you can find lots of blue diamonds on various magus' pot/pok vendors.  Your best bet if your going to vendor dive is to; A)  Do it a few hours after servers come up.  or B) Wait a couple days, and the vendors will see many blue diamonds.<br />
<br />
They're a fast efficient sell off for many groups, and i can not think of the last time anyone ever requested me to hang on to a few blue diamonds for em after a group.<br />

<br />
I seem to recall a bug/exploit a few years back where vendors had unlimited supply of Blue Diamonds as long as one showed in their inventory window. I hope that is not the case this time. I remember Alot of people got banned for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I vendor buy them anytime I see them, and this hasn't been the case.  I don't think I see more than 4 on vendor most of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Silound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">All I can say is, watch the vendors by the casino. Couple days after a patch I pulled 61. Few days later I pulled 14. Since they seem to be a relatively common reward for those who spend 100k+ in the casino, it's been a good few days for vendor mining.</div></div><hr />

Well he did run out of BD's, and was not reset because he had the same other misc inventory showing that he had when he was selling BD's.<br />
<br />
Now if I could just find a few Jacinth =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>ampleworks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Its been probably about 2 months since I cam across this find but the same vendor that sells the packets of paela sap and bark near the brewing barrels had  more than 100k in BDs on it. I'm not sure if uberguild_01's loot master went and cleared their bank or what, but that's almost two bagfulls.<br />
<br />
I was truely amazed, the profits of reselling them for 300p/ea in the bazaar was fantastic as well.<br />
<br />
Pay attention after patches to your local elemental/time/god guild people, heck follow them around (discreetly of course  :D ), its hard to tell just what they may sell to a merchant!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Jetfire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">If you don't want to vender dive but prefer to hunt them then I would suggest the following:<br />
<br />
Plane of Justice Basement. I've seen a decent supply of diamonds from there, normally about 1 every clearing or two of the mobs and they respawn fairly quickly.<br />
<br />
Crypt of Decay: This IMO is the Tradeskiller motherlode. Tonnes of Corrupted Essences for pottery, lots of Threads and bricks of energy, and a decent amount of diamonds as well.<br />
<br />
LDoN (L60+) seems to have a good amount of Diamonds esp blue ones. Not as many now.<br />
<br />
Plane of Hate: I was hunting there last weekend (9 hours yesterday) and got 5 BD's and 3 Jacinths and 2 Black Sapphires just hunting Tier 1. I also got 2 BD's from armor turn ins as well, and a decent amount of cash in general. Good AA XP and easy hunting up there too for a L60's group.<br />
<br />
LoY seemed to have a few BD's as well but I can't recall where the sweet spots are off hand. I think the last boat had a few fairly commonly though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kronepsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I currently have over 200 BDs off of a combination of vendors and looting, but I know I've gone through 1000s if not 10s of 1000s of them.<br />
<br />
And that bug was more complicated than that Grimrose.  It involved hidden inventories, which don't exist anymore, and it wasn't unlimited.  If it was as you said, everyone who used a vendor past the normal inventory would have gotten banned.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Deedolith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Look in sebilis, bugs camp also</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Aalar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Plane of Fire<br />
<br />
I solo there and the Jopal Gatherers drop diamonds - blue diamonds - TPEs - mephit meat - fire mephit blood - mephit hide - ether threads - and the bricks - sometimes all the above on one of them.  The spiders drop the ever elusive obsidianwood sap that is needed for the Aid Grimel quest.  It can sell for tens of thousands per sap.  I currently have 2 but since I'm doing the quest I'm not selling.  This is a goldmine for tradeskill components.  The exp is really good too.  The mobs do not summon and they don't have a great deal of HP.  Of course the biggest problem - and why the zone is almost always empty is the flag requirements.<br />
<br />
If you can get in here though it is the best place to farm I have seen in the game.  Great exp - great loot - can't beat it.  It gets interesting when you pull a mob that is immune to changes in run speed too.<br />
