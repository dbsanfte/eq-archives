<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cmcsess</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi All,<br />
<br />
Sorry if I am sounding niave.  I am a Paladin skilling up in Baking and I realized I had started an Iksar Necrromancer as an alt some ages ago.  I logged on to that character and found he had a skill in foraging of 50.  I've been looking around to find a guide on foraging and haven't found one yet. I was wondering if any of you knew of one.  I know there are forage tables somewhere, and I'm interested in skill level caps.  My thought so far was to bring him to Faydwer to forage Cinnamon sticks (I'm at 193 baking so far) but I also have no idea how high a level I must get him to become a master forager or maxed at 200.  Can anyone help me out? Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Elyssanda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Honey, you are capped at 50... unless you're a druid or ranger...<br />
Bards are capped at 55.<br />
<br />
racial ability is great for a newbie.. keeps them alive, as a tradeskiller, it sucks unless your racial ability  is augmented by your class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cmcsess</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ahh, thanks.<br />
<br />
So now the question is: say I started a ranger or druid, where can I find the skill progression for these classes?  I can ask this now only because my Paladin has reached level 65 and I can finally pay attention to some alts.  I have and Enchanter I'm working on, and a Monk, but I'm willing to work on a foraging class if it seems worthwhile, although I am probably not thinking of leveling a druis or ranger all the way to 65 unless it turns out to be fun. :o <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wood elves start out at 50 skill but can't raise until the skill could go above cap by level. The skill is the usual 5xlvl (+5) formula and skill cap for both druid and ranger is 200, so take your pick which you'd prefer. So the good news is that you'd only have to level your forager to 39th to max the skill. Personally for a forager only with max foraging utility I'd recommend druid since your ports will give you easier time to get to some of the zones to forage in. I find it nice for tea leaves in particular.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Furyrpied</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye, druids are the best for forraging due to the ability to get yourself to the zones you need to forrage in.<br />
<br />
First thing you need to do is associate your forrage button to your &lt;- and -&gt; buttons (or what ever you use to turn left and right) that way you will never 'forget' to forrage.  Look in your options/keyboard thingy to see how (or if anyone can show/explain it here then heh)<br />
<br />
What to hold on to as a newbie?<br />
Cinnamon Sticks in GFay<br />
Misty Acorns in Misty<br />
<br />
if you forrage these up hold on to them, folks in Mistythicket are willing to pay 10-20pp each acorn as they are used in high end cultural tailoring and are hard to come by.<br />
<br />
Cinnamon Sticks... Dunno how much these can go for now, but used to be a hot comodity for bakers making Pixie Cinnasticks<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tudamorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Rangers and Druids can raise foraging skill to 200, Bards to 55, using the standard level/skill formula (meaning you will need to level up some if you want to get a high skill level).  Each class obtains the skill at a different level.  More skill will reduce the chance of failure, allowing you to collect items more quickly.<br />
<br />
Racial foraging, with wood elves and iksar, starts you off at 50 independent of your class.<br />
<br />
There's a partial foraging table right here (http://www.eqtraders.com/sources/source_zbt_page.php?st=Foraged&amp;menustr=110070000000) and one on EQ Druids (http://www.eqdruids.com/reference/foraging/foraging_main.htm).<br />
<br />
The easily soloable Rare Plants (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1465) quest will net you a scimitar, usable by foraging classes, with a +10% skill mod.<br />
<br />
To avoid the nuisance of dealing with the foraged item appearing on your cursor on each time, create the following macro and bind it to a hot key:<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/doability X (where X = the position of your forage ability in the abilities window)<br />
/pause 5 (you might need a number greater than 5 on a laggy system)<br />
/autoinventory<br />
<br />
Then just press the hot key every 2 minutes and the foraged item will appear on your cursor for a tiny fraction of a second then go automatically into your inventory.  At the end of the play session, just delete the stacks of junk and keep the good stuff.</div></div><hr />
