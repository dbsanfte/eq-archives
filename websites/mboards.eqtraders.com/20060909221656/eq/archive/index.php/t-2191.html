<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dacoda</div><div class="date">01-12-2003, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is really insignificant, but I have been slowly skilling up my tailor on regular quivers. For the last few months, my successful combine rate was around 80%. However, I did a half-stack run after the &quot;eq in a window&quot; patch and my success rate was 10% (and no skill-ups). My current skill level is 93.<br />
<br />
Heck, since it's such a pain in the butt to have to stop and sell after every few successes, maybe this is a good thing, but it was nice to get a pp or two out of it.<br />
<br />
Just thought I'd mention, thinking perhaps some other success rates had also changed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How did you know that when you were getting 80% successes that it wasn't a lucky streak?  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbuegel</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 02:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm curious about this because it seemed to me that quivers made you skill increase faster than masks.   So, I personally believe they may have changed it.<br />
<br />
So, dude, please try another 10 or 20 more quivers and let me know if you think it was changed, or you just had a bad streak.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nolequen</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 05:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I went from 94 to 114 last night on a good run with quivers.  20 skillups from 51 attempts (52 if you count the one attempt at a banded mask with the only HQ wolf skin I had).  I had 36 or 37 successes (I wasn't keeping close track, I was so happy about the skillups).<br />
That was with 198 wis for most combines (buff faded before the last 11 attempts--but I still got 4 skill ups at 178 wis).<br />
Take from that what you will, but I was overjoyed to get that success rate and skillup rate.  Not to mention finally mastering tailoring (after a year or so of playing).<br />
