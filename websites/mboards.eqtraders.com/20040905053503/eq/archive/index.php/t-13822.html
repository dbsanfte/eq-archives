<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This Friday, at Noon EST, I propose a Toast!  To the Devs of EQ for the new Tradeskill UI!  <br />
<br />
Every brewer gather 'round the PoTq stone in PoK and hand out drinks they have brewed and drink them in salute.  <br />
<br />
The only two things I ask is 1) that they be brewed (if not necessarily by you, but at least by someone), and 2) they can get ya drunk (no tea here!).<br />
<br />
Who is with me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i can pledge some hero brews to that and maybe some shakers and 2x strength dwarven ale.  :)<br />
<br />
will have to hand off to someone else though.  i can't get to an eq computer then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Confused troll 2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Already done.  Gave out the 5 stacks of Hero's brew I had remaining after I raised my brewing from 192 to 248. (I produced A LOT more than that)  Thanks to the Devs of EQ for saving me hours upon hours of agonizing boredom!  (I had to stop my /ooc after I drank a stack of the stuff myself  :boggled: )</div></div><hr />
