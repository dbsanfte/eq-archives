<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rama</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've just hit 102 on my fletching skill and was trying to find something to work on to increase it more. In the past I've been using arrows to do it (class 2 bone hooked put me at 102), but I can't seem to find anything that won't cost me an arm and leg to continue. Anyone have any sugestions on what to try next to up my skill or do I just need to bite the bullet and spend spend spend?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oualawouzou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Note that the trivial of an arrow combine is easy to determine: it's set by the most expensive component you are using. :)<br />
<br />
So, take the arrows that trivial at 102 and check for the next highest component (no matter if it's the fletch, the knock, etc..., only the price matters) and keep it up.  Up untill 202, it's relatively cheap (from 180ish to 202, it costs about 70-75 per 20 combines, and you can make over 50pp back by selling the arrows to the merchants).  After 202, it's VERY expensive.<br />
<br />
Currently, I have the choice of going with bows (which costs over 200pp per combine), the Luclin stuff (I don't feel like farming and I try to avoid the Bazaar when possible, a personnal thing...) and the Karana arrows (which cost around 35pp per combine)...<br />
<br />
So I'd say fletching is not at all expensive to get up to 202.  After 202... ouch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
also the link to the quick chart can prolly fix your problem.  just use the arrow part with the highest triv and the rest crappy if you aren't using them and want to be cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daikoku Ashikaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you keep everything but the highest trival item you are using  at the cheapest item Flatching is not that expensive, a lot cheaper then say JC if you fail on a combine too 102-202 too, if I remember correctly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">that is a good guide but a little outdated.  i didn't see acrylia arrows but may have missed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lanalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I used Xanthe's (http://www.geocities.com/shadowknight57/fletching.html) fletching guide, and I didn't spend a lot of money getting it to 202.<br />
<br />
With a geerlok, you make back a lot of what you spend with sellbacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I made money on fletching from 1 to 202, by making more useful (i.e. long range) arrows, but I was patient and willing to sell stuff slowy in the bazaar.   I also made money on 235-&gt;239, making Mithril Champ and Blessed Mithril Champ arrows.  In between i did bows, and lost a good deal of money, even though I made my own cams where needed.  Points 240 and 241 were on shadewood and also money loserts.<br />
<br />
Point 242 came on a BFT, those have been money makers.<br />
<br />
<br />
In short, though, if you take the cheapest path through, it should not be expensive to 202.  If you can park in the bazaar, don't take the cheapest route, instead make the best arrows, and profit.  Either way, though, you should not have too much trouble, money-wise, getting yourself to 202, assuming you hvave high WIS, INT, or DEX</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">really high volume long range arrows sell sometimes too.  to the pullers who are just tagging to get aggro.</div></div><hr />
