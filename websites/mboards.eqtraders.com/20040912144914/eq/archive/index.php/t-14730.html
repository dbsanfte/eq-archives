<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lytoxx Frekxnel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, just making another plea to the tradeskill community on the whereabouts of this item.  I don't care if the information is hacked.  Well, I do, but this is really frustrating me that they have this item in our default recipes but there isn't any information to be found *anywhere* that I've looked.  And I've looked in a lot of places a lot of different ways....  Please help.  *frustrated smile*  For those that missed it, the item I'm looking for is the Mottled Cloak that is supposed to be part of Fizzban's Guise.  And for that matter, what does the guise do?  Or is it another bum item like Flame Bolt and the Anti-Grav device....?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Can I add  my plea for the same info please. It's ticking me off as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sorry, but while drinking her favorite ale, Lewena lost it.:p :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Axterix EnObelix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My theory is that they rearranged some stuff in the recipe database.  The same day the guise appeared on my known list, a bunch of my favorite recipes were screwed up...collapseds saying to use the items for another collapsed item.<br />
<br />
Anyway, probably some old defunct recipe that, sort of like the catapult, got revealed in an unexpected way and, like the cloak, the drop for doesn't exist in the game.<br />
<br />
That's my belief, anyway.</div></div><hr />
