I used to have a full set of the imbued chainmail, but gave it up for different equipment.  However, I miss the look, and the stats on the Artkeeper's pieces look fantastic.  I have very rarely seen pieces up fo sale in the Bazaar, and my own lowly smithing skill would not be sufficient (I got my full set of imbued by just trying over and over again at skill 118, until I got the pieces... too expensive to do that with these).<br />
<br />
I am not rich (i.e. don't have hundreds of thousands of plat in the bank) but if someone could contact me in-game and quote me some prices for a fellow high elf, you would have my eternal gratitude, and a very happy porter on your hands.  Alternatively, you could also reply to this message with your willingness to take on some commissioned work, and I'll try to contact you when I'm in game.  I would be willing to purchase all of the components for the combines.<br />
<br />
Specifically, I am looking for some of the visible pieces to start, Tunic, Arms, and Legs.  I am on West Coast time, and traditionally am on in the late evening, although my playtimes run the gamut.<br />
<br />
Thanks so much!  Safe travels and happy hunting!<br />
