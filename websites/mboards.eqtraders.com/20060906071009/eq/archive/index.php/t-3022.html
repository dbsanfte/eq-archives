<br />
look under trade supplies under pelt drop guide for the type of skins that you are looking for.<br />
<br />
And thank you for your time :oops:  :?  :idea:</div></div><hr />

The poachers drop quality hides most of the time, sometimes 2, and  they also drop plat, research components, and the occasional rare item.   My cleric was also lvl 59 and I could pull singles with a nuke then beat them to death with the proc hammer.  It was pretty slow.   I started 2boxing with a 52 Ranger.  He would bow pull, snare, and melee.  I think there are 16 spawn points there, all static, no wanderers, and a number of Named poachers that can spawn on occasion.   My Cleric/Ranger team could easily control a dozen spawns.  Poachers turned Light Blue at 51 or so.<br />
<br />
Do Not kill the four legged wild life here unless you have no care for your faction with the vendors in the outpost.  Stick to the poachers!<br />
<br />
After a few hour tour there, I would have 80+ hides.  HQ/MQ/LQ cat, bear and wolf pelts.  All pelts seemed to drop in pretty equal numbers.  No ruined drop here!  HQ bear and cat went to my bazaar mule, the rest got cut to LQ for padding.  Everything else went to the inzone vendor, and a few hundred plat went into the bank.<br />

<br />
I will improve my tailoring in a few weeks for the shawl quest. Reading the guide to tailoring, I was asking myself if I should transform my medium quality pelts in low ones to make leather paddings with my silks to save space, since they didnt seem to be that usefull in skilling up...<br />
<br />
Those that make sense to your tailoring expertise?  :oops:</div></div><hr />

Bring some silks and a skinning knife to turn the low and MQ in Lether padding as you farm, sell in bazaar at 20pp a pop, cheeper then everyone else and you still make a TON of money, and help smiths out at the same time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Perseverence Rewarded</div><div class="date">02-21-2003, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are doing LQ for padding your best bet is Marus Seru for Hopper hides and Shadweavers Thicket for shadeling silk. An indecent amount of silk drops here. I farm swirling shadows here and end up with BAGS FULL of silk in 2 hours.  :shock: (shhh....keep it the family. Don't want to much competition  :P )</div></div><hr />

I have a decent quantity of shaded silk threads that I collected while I was hunting for other drops in Shadeweavers.  I ran through Mars Seru the other day and killed a couple of greyhoppers (along with assorted very green zels and lightcrawlers that seemed to instantly know the moment I entered the zone) and looted a couple of greyhopper hides.<br />
Dropped on in my sewing kit with the thread and hit combine.<br />
No good.<br />
Then I remembered that I needed an LQ hide...<br />
So I pulled the thread out, put my skinning knife in, and hit combine.<br />
No good.<br />
I had thought the grey hopper hides were the equivalent of MQ rockhopper hides.  Is this not the case?  Do I need to look strictly for greyhoppers that drop LQ hides?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It appears you hit a bad RNG streak in MS. 90% of the hoppers drop LQ hopper hides. This has been established as the Mecca of Padding among smithies. I go with my Nightmare compound bow and pull pull pull pull till I have a half dozen hoppers on me. Hack-n-slash a minute then loot loot loot.  Rinse and repeat. :D</div></div><hr />
