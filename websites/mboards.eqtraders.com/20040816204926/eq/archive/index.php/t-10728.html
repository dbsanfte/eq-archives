ANY Wood Elf (regardless of class or god) can MAKE the &quot;Wood Elf Cultural Fletching&quot; items such as Blessed Faydark Thunderbolt, Mithril Scout Arrows, and Blessed Champion Arrows.<br />
<br />
Any race can utilize these items. However the &quot;Blessed&quot; items can only be utilized by worshippers of Tunare. The Bows can be used by Warriors, Palidans, Rangers, and Rogues. The normal arrows can be used by Warriors, Palidans, Rangers and Shadowknights. The &quot;Blessed&quot; arrows can be used by Warriors, Palidans, and Rangers.<br />
<br />
ANY worshipper of Karana can MAKE the &quot;Karana Diety Fletching&quot; items such as The Blessed Hurricane Bow, Steel Phalanx Arrows, or Blessed Steel Guardian Arrows.<br />
<br />
Any race can utilize these items. However the &quot;Blessed&quot; items can only be utilized by worshippers of Karana. The Bows can be used by Warriors, Palidans, Rangers, and Rogues. As can the arrows.<br />
<br />
So Wood Elf worshippers of Karana can make BOTH types of items, but would only be able to use the normal mithril arrows and the Karana items?<br />
<br />
So from a Ranger perspective, only Human and Half-Elf worshippers of Tunare do not have access to some sort of special flecthing.<br />
<br />
Is this synopsis a fair reflection of the way it actually works?<br />

<br />
Correct - this is the only &quot;cultural&quot; tradeskill in which the combines are also limited to those who worship a specific god.<br />

Yes, it was very short sighted of them - they really should have just made cultural fletching for woodelves be class fletching for rangers and either junked the god requirements on the gear or made it work for Karana and Tunare.<br />
<br />
But hey, atleast the half elves can say they've got a cultural tradeskill if they worship the right god. ;)</div></div><hr />
