<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaman Arriana</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ornate molds drop in Plane of Tactics, Bastion of Thunder, Halls of Honor, Solusek Ro's Tower, and (I believe, not 100% sure) in Plane of Torment.<br />
<br />
Elemental molds drop in the elemental planes of earth air fire and water.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balthozzar</div><div class="date">12-21-2002, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The one thing that's not clear to me about these molds, is exactly how hard and rare they are to get. Small guilds have long been able to hunt in Kael and even Halls of Testing to equip themselves in pretty good armor. Are the Ornate molds dropping from mobs a similar sized guild will be able to handle in several months, once more people are flagged for these zones? I hope that this armor is seen as an upgrade path from the Velious quest armors, and not something that will be forever limited to raid guilds. I can wait a long while until my guild has paid its dues, but if they only drop from mobs that take 30+ people to kill, I'll never loot one. It's been at least a year since I was on a raid with more than 24 people.</div></div><hr />

They drop from mobs that require 1 good 65+aa group to take down, or 2-3 62-65 leveled groups. <br />
<br />
Even if you take a long time to get flagged for these zones, the molds and patterns should trickle down to the bazaar eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahlmer</div><div class="date">12-22-2002, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since I've been flagged for BoT and Tactics, I've seen quite a few molds drop.  Personally, I've gotten 2 bracer molds and a helmet mold in Plane of Tactics from the named mobs in the pit.  I've also seen 1 BP mold drop in BoT off one of the mini-bosses there.  From named mobs, it seems you get 1-2 sheet molds.  Other guildies have received boot molds and helmet molds as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaman Arriana</div><div class="date">12-23-2002, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the molds ever trickle down (I don't think they will), they are useless to the general public.<br />
<br />
Bohr Warhammer won't let you make armor unless you've been flagged for the zones where the molds drop. So, the only people who can make the armor will have access to the drops directly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahlmer</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 12:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Access to BoT is quite easy to get for someone who has access to storms.  A few well equipped groups can take down the giants to get the drops necessary for their BoT flag.  Tactics has a quest for entry as well, although I'm not familiar with it...I think you need 4 pieces from the Diaku that run around Plane of Storms, or something...anyhow, it's possible to get access to these zones if you aren't in an uber guild.  Of course, it's going to be a pain to get into groups in those zones that will be killing things that drop molds.  On Zeb, there are 3 guilds with access to Tactics (where most of the molds/patterns seem to be dropping) and we're pretty much in direct competition with each other to get the good camps and stay there as long as we can when we're not raiding.  It would be highly unlikely someone would have an easy time finding a pick up group in these zones at this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazick</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question on the names of the Elemental Molds..<br />
<br />
Are they called:<br />
<br />
Ornate Plate Bracer Mold<br />
Ornate Chain Bracer Mold<br />
<br />
Elemental Plate Bracer Mold<br />
Elemental Chain Bracer Mold<br />
<br />
And for different pieces swap Bracer for the proper name (Sleeves, Boots, Gloves, Helm, Leggings, Tunic)?<br />
<br />
Are there molds for Cloak (Back), Belt, Face, Neck or Shoulders?</div></div><hr />
