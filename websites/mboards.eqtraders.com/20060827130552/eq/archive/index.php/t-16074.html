Absors response (Other than an amusing remark that torqued a few rogues off) was <br />
<br />
<br />
free to post any interesting ideas you have for tinkers.  No, you're not going to get tinkered pets...  It's a very cool idea but it's a little too much.  Besides, I think the game has way too many pet classes as it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
I replied with the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
As a tradeskill nut, I have a few suggestions.<br />
 <br />
1)  Gnomish Velium Compressor -  Input a velium block, get a Velium Bar (for JC).    This would be a godsend.<br />
 <br />
2)  Super Geerloks, 335 Trivial, expensive combine, for a 10% geerlok.    There's a giant gap between normal geerloks and the super-rare 15%mods for smithing, and the one 15% mod for tailoring.<br />
 <br />
3) Tinker gnomish caster armor - If I recall, a study showed that something like 80% of gnomes are INT casters, but the Clockwork armor does zero for us.   Make a line of the clockwork Observer/shadowwalker wearable by gnomes.   The robes from LoY were a good idea, but anyone can wear those.    <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The thread is in the &quot;The Nexus&quot; section, in the &quot;Development&quot; section.<br />

I am going to feedback this, this is great. As I just failed a really expensive &lt; PoAir &gt;bow combine for a guildie ( with 252 with geerloc)  and felt terrible.

If you were at 252 with geerlok, a higher skill mod wouldn't have helped. 252 is a hard skillcap... you cannot go higher than that no matter what skill mod you have.<br />
<br />
Higher skill mods only allow the convenience of you being at effective 252 skill while at a lower actual skill.<br />
<br />
As such, I wouldn't hold my breath for super geerloks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gnomish Foraging Machine - maybe a few versions, depending on battery used.  Each gives 10 charges.  Class 6 gives 200 skill (you'll always get something), but costs about 10pp a shot.  Class 1 gives 35 skill, but very cheap to use.<br />
<br />
The super geerloks sound nice, would let folks cap at 230 vs 240.<br />
<br />
Would also like a rechargable stalking probe.  They cost about 16pp to make, and come with 5 charges.  So if you made one that cost about 5pp per charge consumed (20 charges, takek a class 6), it would be fair.  I do a lot of pulling in LDoN as a cleric and I'd use something like that frequently to peer into rooms that are packed.  &quot;Anizok's Improved Stalker&quot; ?</div></div><hr />

Gnomish Tri-corder :D<br />
<br />
I like the tinkered mount ideas, that's SOOOO gnomish!<br />
<br />
Gnomish Caltrops.  Assorted junk (like you always pick up in PoI) for a short-duration snare<br />
<br />
Gnomish Air Horn.  Deafness.<br />

Gnomish Ear Plugs.  Silence.<br />

<br />
I do not want to  have to tinker a mount. I would gladly purchase a gnome only mount, a clockwork spider , a tank, a jetson car. I certainly don't want my bank space filled with parts to try all the combines to make a mount and fail on the combine.<br />
<br />
increase in geerloks sounds nice but only if it would get you above 252.(which is pointed out it won't get you above 252 so why bother.) <br />
<br />
A universal geerlok would be nice, only have to carry one item to get the bonus for all skills. Swiss army knife.<br />
<br />
<br />
an Anti-punting device would make gnomes safer.  make a polarity inverter and combine it with an antigravity device to increase a gnomes gravity.  Can't punt a gnome if he is glued down.<br />
<br />
a gnomish chemisty kit to make mordant dyes to color back packs. Aren't you tired of having to look in each backpack to find the things you need. Well organize your bank space with colored backpacks<br />
<br />
Foraging and tracking items sound wonderful and would sell well but I know I hate when we lose a gnome only item to others.  I don't want to take foraging and tracking away from others.  I would rather have creative gnome only ideas rather than duplicate an ability already out there.<br />
<br />
<br />
a bubble sword<br />
<br />
I like the idea of improved stalking probes, more charges, longer duration.<br />
<br />
Patented Improvement devices ( tinkered augments)  1% adds to geerloks, skills, improved ac, increase battery life. decrease battery class needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tinkered collars and leashes for charmed pets to increase the duration of the charm and control of the pet.  Shock collar, retractable leash, tie out stake, scooby snacks. <br />
<br />
Buff box-- special box to hold what buffs you want for a raid. It would certainly save time on raids to have your buff box ready to go.  Open the box and lets start raiding.<br />
<br />
First aid kit to help fight rez effects<br />
<br />
Black box recorder to help in language learning.  Does anybody learn the languages anymore? Now you can do it in your spare time.<br />
<br />
Louder stereo speakers because gnomes rock<br />
<br />
binoculars of leadership<br />
<br />
items to help other tradeskills baking and cooking we could tinker latte machines, bean grinders, deep fryers, ginsu knives, juicers, and vegetable slicers.  For brewing seltzer water would be nice, ( a little song, a little dance, a little seltzer down your pants), also those little miniature swords for the olives.  Jewelcraft could use grinders, cutters, magnifiers, and cubic zirconium.  Sculpting, well I have no idea what sculpting needs.  Fishing always needs new bait and flies, fish finders, and ways of recycling those annoying sandels and rusty daggers.<br />

<br />
SOE Dev already stated that 252 is the cap for the long term future.  Raising the cap would require significant resources and extensive coding, both of which they have none extra.  <br />
<br />
Also the increase in skill caps would result in a significant influx of high end equipment (ie success on 5 out of 6 Earth Plate BP's for example) which would thus further erode a weak secondary &lt; 200 skill product market, making elemental quality equipment available to even the weakest players in the game.  This will create artificial power jumps from levels 46 to 60, further trvializing all expansion previous to Planes of Power content wise.<br />
<br />
You already have the best skill possible to make any attempt at 252.</div></div><hr />

Personally much rather your other suggestion of making them stackable. I just feel if people had much easier access to these that the small market there is right now would drop to nil (as has most other tinkered items.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chenier</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, my tinkered horse:<br />
<br />
Been thinking about components. There's a lore drop off of PoN horseys, Nightmare Hoof (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16680) which supposedly is for an unknown quest. That sounds good...<br />
<br />
Aaand, I'd add in a steam pump, class 6 battery...<br />
<br />
Actually, if every cast cost a battery charge, should probably use a class 5 to make it a bit cheaper - or something.<br />
<br />
Perhaps to make it a little bit more difficult (difficult = rare = seller's market), the horseys in PoFire drop some sort of hide from time to time. Can't remember what it's called.<br />
<br />
So<br />
<br />
nightmare hoof (PoN)<br />
nightmare hide thingy (PoF) [note: not &quot;nighmare hide&quot; from PoFear)<br />
grease<br />
bolts<br />
steel wire<br />
metal rods<br />
<br />
makes &quot;a rocking horse&quot;<br />
<br />
then add in a steam pump (made the usual way), plus a mana battery (see above discussion for which sort - oh! or depending on which battery you use to make the horse sets the speed...so class 1 battery makes the slowest horse, class 6 makes the fastest, equivalent to the fastest purchased horse), plus sprockets, ball bearing, maybe a greasy diamond of innovation? (need something else magic in there)...<br />
<br />
poof! tinkered horsey!<br />
<br />
Could be REALLY evil and make it triv at 336...tho would be neat if it was 275ish, better chance of making them...<br />
<br />
each cast consumes a mana battery charge, rechargeable just like everything else in a toolbox with another battery...<br />
<br />
Would have the look of the tinkered animals in Steamfont, make creaking noises instead of whineys...<br />
<br />
I wanna name mine Eveready...=D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ozmandias</div><div class="date">05-11-2004, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The hoof definately has a use and a quest already.<br />
<br />
Plus, it's too rare to use as a tradeskill item.  Ok, so most PoP stuff is rare, this would be a bit over that though.</div></div><hr />

give the raid leader ability to cast invisibility on groups, port individuals, send up flares, raid speak in a raid leader only color ( that might be gnome walkie talkies) , and conjure smaller flags for group leaders. <br />

Right click Summon Bait (summons 1 stack of 20 bait), 20 charges, recharge with a class 1 battery.<br />
<br />
Figure bait is 3cp so a stack is 6 sp.  If it had 20 charges, thats 1.2 gold worth of bait on a fully charged device.  A class 1 battery is 10pp, so its much cheaper to buy bait instead.  But imagine going to a fishing hole with 1 stack of batteries, effectivly 8000 bait in 1 item slot (20 batteries per stack  x 20 charge per battery x 20 bait per charge.

Yo-yo's normal toys, battle yo-yo's (1hb), begemmed yoyo's with effects... (couple pie plates, string, sprockets, dowel, dwarven wire and den add other stuff for fancier versions- simple to make (low tinker needed))<br />
<br />
Propeller hats/helmets (levitation device or safefall device) Props, spring (twisted dwarven wire around a dowel and heated in a forge (smithing) , padded cap, iron cap, manabattery) basically a one way levitation - down slowly only...works on small races only...(halfling gnomes and dwarfs)...click effect run and jump...float down spinning slowly while you fall...<br />
<br />
Ogre-corker cannon...plugs up the ogres so they can't pass wind... ranged item used for pulling, uses corks, soda water, mana battery, spyglass, tube, leather padding...<br />
Over the shoulder device- fires a cork for long long distance...if it hits target does a low low agro pull...but with ogres causes HIGH agro...if you crit...well...better not go there.   <br />
<br />
Winged Boots- feathers and fletchings, dwarven wire, dwarven springs, sprockets and gears (micro) appropriate boots (plate best), mana battery x 2 (1 each boot), metal sheet (light metal)...<br />
effect- 5-15% run speed increase 10% leaping distance 15% height on jumps...safe fall if jumping...click and buff lasts 5 minutes, works with sow, but not lev... <br />
<br />
<br />
Pie catapult...backpack sized item, uses minicatapult, harness, pie rack, mana battery, gears, dwarven springs, etc ...<br />
Can hold 10 pies (opens like toolbox) and when clicked will fire a pie at your target...effect would be silly, but would work for pulling...may also use pudding, rat goo, and stale biskits...but pies work best.<br />
Great for food fights, or to distract hungry gnolls, giants , ogres and trolls...launch a few pies at them and they will fight for the pieces while you run away!<br />
<br />
<br />
Gnomish Drink shaker- caution on putting Fizzlepop inside it!! Or other bubbly drinks...<br />
Cask (2 slot), Vibrating harness (harness, mana battery, springs gear sprockets and winding handle), metal bits (for mountings- or gnomish bolts) <br />
When used Gnome or other user clicking it vibrates up and down and in a small circle for a few seconds...result is a well mixed beverage...<br />
Mixes Fruit smoothies, mixed drinks...<br />
Fruit smoothy would be Milk + fruit and click...<br />
Mixed drink would be fruit juice/veggie juice + alcohol of choice and CLICK...<br />
If fizzy drink is used...aoe stickyness (emote and short buff that makes you stick to things (light snare)...<br />

http://www.tinkering.org/comm/brodder.shtml<br />
<br />
<br />
NOTE- this is half of what I submitted before ROK went to devs for development, and I was working with yakatizma (Dan Enright) at time via outside channels for tradeskills...<br />
I had near 20 more recipes for tinkering, most just plain funny, all inspired by my friend the gnome mage Catbik Tinkerton when we were on bertox before moving to Terris Thule.<br />
<br />
I'll see if I can dig up older stuff on my very very old HDD's sometime...one crapped out and I replaced the seeker chips myself from a similar hdd and run Seeker 12.4 on it to recover and remap the hdd. It takes all memory, and hours upon hours upon hours to map and reconfigure it, so I only get to do this when I know I'm not gonna be online or writing/editing stuff...<br />
Maybe I'll rebuild my second PC...errr third...<br />
Guess it's all in the spirit of tinkering...<br />
----------UPDATE that PC died horridly in hurricane last fall...recovery impossible------------ :boggled: <br />
Second note- I don't think any of these actually went live- I'm just posting these for nostalgia's sake...<br />
Experiment on your own if you wish... <br />
<br />
Not sure it ever went in...<br />
But I have a few recipes for it somewhere...<br />
I'd have to check my email/pm logs...<br />
Then get confirmation that it did go in somehow sometime longlong ago in a far away gala....errrr wrong bat channel(ing) ;P<br />
<br />
Basics of it was Spit or brazier + cooking pot + fuel bottle(battery or firewater+wick) made the Deepfryer/gnomish cooking pot.<br />
<br />
To charge it you'd have to open it and put in 4 oils and 2 fuel one at a time until it was charged.<br />
then it'd have 10 uses of deepfrying...since frying oil would be absorbed and get dirty during use.<br />
<br />
After 10 uses you'd have to put in 1 jar of gnomish cleaning paste (from brewing superior gnomish spirits) to clean out the pot.<br />
Then you could recharge it....<br />
<br />
I am fairly sure the two steps required (requiring magic charged type item) was beyond the ken of the crew of programmers at SOE/VI-EQ at the time.<br />
So this probably got shelved.<br />
<br />
And that was just one use of the gnomish cleaning paste by the way...<br />
It has many many uses in tinkering, but none have been found or implemented in game yet.<br />
<br />
That's it for now...<br />
**********************<br />
So until we get confirmation that this is in game, and the recipes that need a fantabulous-gnomish-cooking-pot, actually are in game then it's on our wish list.*********** <br />
<br />
Recipes that should have used this pot...<br />
Fish and Chips.<br />
Beer batted fish<br />
Beer battered veggies.<br />
Beer battered shrooms.<br />
Deep fried clams.<br />
Potato chips.<br />
Tempura covered spice snacks (gnomish recipe).<br />
Deep fried Goo! (yes that sick goo that you can make at very very low levels of baking).<br />
Frybread. (dough + yeast + honey)<br />
Tempura veggies (sliced first with the gnomish kitchen utensil...it slices it dices...it julians...)<br />
<br />
Tempura is soda water and ground rice flour (motar n pestle + cup of rice).<br />
Spice snacks were pixie dust, icing, spices, cup of flour, yeast malted milk, and fruit/berries.<br />
Beer batter is self evident. Short beer and cup of flour.<br />
<br />
Dipping sauces were suggested...<br />
Sweet n sour was honey vinegar fruit/orange juice and (t)arrow root (thickener)(alchemist herb).<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW pudding was easy too arrow root + milk + eggs + sweetner mixed in pot/bowl. with variations by city.<br />
Chocolate pudding would use chocolate.<br />
etc etc...<br />
<br />
GAH you've made me think too hard...<br />
<br />
NOTE-- NONE OF THESE RECIPES ARE CONFIRMED AS IN GAME AT THIS TIME....<br />
<br />
NOTE 2- Some may be in game in different forms. But I have no real clue as to how.<br />
<br />
Note 3- You hungry yet? I am... talk to ye tinkers later...<br />
And this last word... <br />
Don't invest time into this device until we get word that yes it is in game....the rest you can piece together from my old recipes and formats and hopefully find new toys and foods to play with.<br />
<br />
Yes I know how you gnomes like to play with your food...or use it to describe or design new gadgets....<br />

<br />
A tinkered Augment Unsealer would be wonderful.<br />
<br />
I found a post on Tinkering.org about it...&lt;grins&gt; And then I realize that I wasn't the only one to actually think about something like this.<br />
<br />
http://www.tinkering.org/board/viewtopic.php?t=351<br />
<br />
The idea is great, even though the items listed seem a bit commonplace and cheep.<br />
<br />
More than likely, the way to keep your augment will be a very expsensive solvent, but I can hope that it will be a tinkered container (maybe collaspible?) that will require the item and the regular solvent for your desired slot.  It would give back to you the augment and the item, eating the solvent.<br />
<br />
After the lack of tinkering stuff for Ldon and GoD, I really really hope that something like this, or at least a boatload of functional (or simply fun) tinkering recipies come out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is similar to the vender sold Bag of Tinkers, but the gnome who discovered it, had this strange notion of this magical thing called &quot;gravity&quot; and thus named it for his idea.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodder FoamyMugs</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">would it just would be fun, a good nuff reason? Especially if it actually doesn't do anything useful in game?<br />
 I mean, Gnomes tinker fer tinkering's sake aye?<br />
<br />
 So if we take something commonplace now, twist it to eq tools (ie items in EQ), add in gnomish genius, and warped it to affect users too...<br />
 That'd mean that the Gnomsih Drink Mixer that shakes the wearer too (amusing to others to watch except if said user forgets to close the lid (yes you can hit MIX before closing the lid) or he uses a fizzy mixer in there causing it to explode in a sticky spray...<br />
<br />
 What's to understand? Has Tradeskill uses...is amusing to see used, and the opportunity for chaos and mayhem as folks get a sticky snare...<br />
 <br />
 That's what I envision as the spirit of Tinkering for EQ.<br />
 I also think Tinkers should have a staff (long term epic) that they add tinkered augs to as they skill and level up, that gives it more and more utility and effects...<br />
 Silly stuff like, Click warning- Message area- XXXXX is about to activate a new device's final combine...please stand clear.<br />
 1 Emergency warning- UHOH!!!<br />
 2 PAGE Healer-  Zone wide /broadcast- XXXX has suffered and Ooopsie...could a cleric or another priest...Ummm Better make it a cleric...he looks mostly dead now...<br />
 3 Sirens and lights- For gnome tinkers in a hurry to get someplace fast for only reasons they know- short duration buff that causes a siren sound and flashing red blue n white lights to flicker above the gnome and he runs about (5% speed boost- doesn't stack wtih sow).<br />
  4 Shield of the observer/teacher- Tinkers have to share their knowledge this aug gives the Staff of the Tinker's a Single Rune spell that has an hour cool down period and only lasts 10 minutes uses an Opal or another gem as fuel. This rune will stop any one hit from flying debris or an UHOH (useable outside tinkering of course, but a single no mana with catalyst Rune spell).<br />
 5 Shine! Cause foam to cover the gnome from head to toe (uses gnomish cleaning paste, soda water, and something if not used by staff - that is if you decide to make this an outside/spell item too)-  when foam wears off the Gnome tinker has +5 Charisma buff that lasts 5-10 minutes- less the further he travels with it up...as this just cleans his hair, bald spot, clothes and gear...ignore that puddle he left behind it's someone elses hazard.<br />
 6 GEerlock Slot opens at this item's level- since staff is primary or ammo slot or range- this means geerlock is part of the new tinker epic...<br />
 7- Sale sign- Summons a Lightening elemental that hovers over the tinker, flashing SALE! then BUY NOW!  then (small letters) mostly (big letters) Guaranteed Quality Items! This elemental causes a buff to appear (and so be clicked off) on tinker and can only be summoned in City. POK areas and Bazaar areas...<br />
 8- Reinforcement- Staff gets reinforced with tinkered bits and becomes a better weapon.<br />
 9-  Summon Tinkered companion- a No Attack No agro tinkered pet is summoned that followed the gnome about , making whiring noises and in the case of the mecha-puppy yaps insistently, wind up kitten would climb everything near by, the robo-parrot would echo things said near it or have a particularly salty pirate vocabulary- hey gnomish pirates might tinker too neh?<br />
 10- Final Upgrade- Type 7 or 8 slot opens for such an AUG.<br />
<br />
 Most upgrades would be tied to a Tinker related quest. And turn in result in it being returned with a new power (removing need for having a item with more than two aug slots)- this would allow item to grow with tinkers and be valuable to them if not silly in nature...<br />
<br />
HMM how about Condensed Firework SHow! Box with button - that fires off (Up only maybe at an angle up and away from ground at that time) (can be refilled after use) with a good number of effects inside it.  Ie add X number of fireworks to a tinker tool box or into a dehydrator/shrinker (minimizers device)? A mana battery to set em off- Gears n sprockets n a dwarvish spring ( take a wooden dowel -in game- dwarven wire -in game- wrap it around it- and put in forge to heat and then cool it rapidly hardening it into shape) and a windup crank- this would rotate the barrages in order for firing- ONCE pressed the button the item needs to be placed on ground and let be to do it's thing...pretty! different versions of 7 gun salute to 21 gun to birthday barrage to wedding day BOOMS BALLS and KABLOOIES!... to recharge it you add in x numbers of fireworks of various types (pre- shrunk of course) until item is at its capacity...<br />
<br />
 That's it for now- read my previous posts in this thread too please absor...and the tinkering link to years old posts....</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Gnomish Velium Compressor - Input a velium block/brick, get a Velium Bar (for JC). This would be a godsend.<br />
<br />
2) Super Geerloks, 335 Trivial, expensive combine, for a 10% geerlok. There's a giant gap between normal geerloks and the super-rare 15%mods for smithing, and the one 15% mod for tailoring.<br />
<br />
3) Tinker gnomish caster armor - If I recall, a study showed that something like 80% of gnomes are INT casters, but the Clockwork armor does zero for us. Make a line of the clockwork Observer/shadowwalker wearable by gnomes. The robes from LoY were a good idea, but anyone can wear those. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I really like the idea of Gnomish devices being USEFUL.   Anizok's devices make me proud to tinker. LoY geerloks helped a TON.  Necrotic Diving Devices are NICE.  Collapsible Containers changed the face of tradeskilling.<br />

What about &quot;Transitink's Bait Dispenser&quot;. Right click Summon Bait (summons 1 stack of 20 bait), 20 charges, recharge with a class 1 battery.<br />
<br />
Figure bait is 3cp so a stack is 6 sp. If it had 20 charges, thats 1.2 gold worth of bait on a fully charged device. A class 1 battery is 10pp, so its much cheaper to buy bait instead. But imagine going to a fishing hole with 1 stack of batteries, effectivly 8000 bait in 1 item slot (20 batteries per stack x 20 charge per battery x 20 bait per charge. I think most fisherman would KILL for such convenience.</div></div><hr />

Repeatedly, violently, and cut up the victim, cook it and serve the meat as 'hynid steak'. It's a great idea that I would in fact kill for speaking both as a tinkerer and compulsive fisherman.<br />
<br />
It would eliminate the biggest problem with fishing for me, which is bait space. It's not a huge problem if I'm on my druid since she can go run for more bait, but if I didn't have a porting fetcher then fishing in most of the places worth fishing in would be quite frustrating.

As it is there's only one method of compressing your bait supplies and it involves first spending time fishing for a zone specific fish in another zone. Or being a really lucky forager who gets a bait in every forage. I don't see it as being a game breaking object at all, it would allow some degree of freedom not currently had yes, but not an unbalancing one. Certainly no more unbalancing than the gauze press. It's useful and as much as I understand the desire not to give out too useful trinkets the only purpose a trinket that does nothing will have to me is skillup, also with no useful effect on an item there's going to be a small market for it.

<br />
Make a Tinkerer's Touchstone.  When equipped (or placed in a bag slot, perhaps), it allows you to change coins (e.g., gold to platinum) without having to be at a bank.  Very handy for raids where cash drops are common, or for long exp grinds in places like the Old World.  <br />
<br />
Monks would love it for weight reduction, and most soloing silk classes would find it useful too, I think, due to low strength.<br />
<br />
If you really want to make it useful, allow cash looted with &quot;/autosplit on&quot; to be perfectly distributed -- the machine automatically makes change from the cash on the mob's corpse and divides it evenly among the group.</div></div><hr />

Ok, but you can't make bait from power supplies (fish don't eat uranium, except on the Simpsons).<br />
<br />
So you'd also need a stack of fish or something.  1 fish might = 1 stack of bait.  So if you carry the device and 20 fish, you could get 20 stacks of bait.<br />
<br />
?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maevenniia</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That would work. <br />
<br />
However, is it necessary?   The Anizok’s Gauze Press summons bandages without needing to be recharged with “a bolt of cloth” in addition to the battery. ….Or can you see people digging up a corpse every so often to recharge the Necrotic Divining Device?    :D <br />
<br />
But if that's all it takes to make the Devs happy with the idea, you have my vote.  I would request that you allow &quot;Fresh Fish&quot; to be the fish in question.  That way if I run out of bait, no need to carry a stack of fish with me, I'm already fishing and it's likely that I've caught some already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koru</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, but you can't make bait from power supplies (fish don't eat uranium, except on the Simpsons).<br />

If that's what it would take for the idea to go through, sure. But you might want to consider the cost per bait gained vs the cost of fish. I understand wanting RP balance, it's a question of how you want to balance the price per the convenient device bait and normal bait.<br />
<br />
If it would make more RP sense then it should be possible to make a more sensible 'bait' gained and make it a fly, not an organic bait. Mechanical Gnomish Fly for instance? It would fit in with the fishing recipes as most of the flies do not require a meaty substance to create. There's a variety of stackable metalic things that are of suitable price that could serve as raw materials for such a thing rather than using mana batteries.<br />
<br />
Besides, we just know devious gnomes are about the only people on Norrath who would find a way to make fish be able to live off of Uranium  :D I mean, look at Ak'anon! If it were any more of a mechanical wasteland I'd be getting shot in the back by a mutated ogre named Marcus whenever I go back there.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ambrya</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's an idea I posted at the EQLive boards today:<br />
<br />
Anizok's Ammunition Dispenser<br />
--uses a class 2 battery, summons a stack of arrows.<br />
<br />
This idea developed out of a discussion over the plight of younger rangers to keep arrows supplied if they choose to use archery pre-endless quiver.  I, myself, remember fear kiting dire wolves in Great Divide in my late 30s and early 40s for the purpose of increasing my archery skill in preparation of the day I would get my archery AAs, and how I would routinely have to leave GD to absolutely FILL my packs with arrows before heading back.<br />
<br />
Right now, choices for summoning arrows are pretty sparse.  There are mage summoned arrows, if you are lucky enough to find a mage and which go *POOF* when you log.  There is the Tolan's Bracer, which costs a fortune in the bazaar (and most pre-60 rangers simply do not have that kind of plat) and has a VERY long cast time and ALSO goes POOF, and there is the Bloody Ancille's Pouch, but the Hunter's Barbs suck (only a 25 range!) and that, too, costs a lot in the bazaar.  3-4K at the least, and I know some PCs at lvl 65 who would balk at paying that much still.  Unless you have a sure means of income, which most pre-60 rangers do not, then the price is prohibitive.<br />
<br />
So I thought...heck, Anizok has a friggin' BANDAGE summoning device (which strikes me as being considerably more useless, but then I never bothered with first aid) why shouldn't he had a gizmo that can summon arrows?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, some merchants sell fishing grubs...why not have it consume those?  Or fishing bait.  The logic being that it REPLICATES the bait, maybe?<br />
<br />
However, that would mean we'd have to be careful to keep our reagents somewhere in our inventory where they won't be used as bait...hmmmm...</div></div><hr />

My suggestion from this thread (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/showpost.php?p=109046&amp;postcount=5) was as follows:<br />
<br />
Base Prototype, Gnomish Bolts, Mana Battery - Class One, Yappin Doggy Circle Fly (because I love the name).<br />
<br />
I used the gauze press for precedent, in which case a stack of bandages &quot;primes&quot; the press and, subsequently, uses the battery to recharge. In my recipe the Yappin Doggy Circle Fly is used to &quot;prime&quot; the device.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froni Thunderpaws</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with the organic piece of it - how about a Collapsible Bait Farm (aka composting box).  Converts leftovers like foraged roots, bone chips, piece of meat, leftover fish and fish scales, rotting sandals, etc. into Ak'anons Best (TM) Giant Mutant Wiggling Bait Worms.  Unfold it - stick in some food, hit combine and out comes a stack of bait.  Collaspe it back for easy storage.<br />
<br />
figure a combine of something like Gnomish Heat Source (heat), Soil of Underfoot (growing media), Radiant Meteorite (radiation), Earthworm Munch or a Fishing Grub or a Bookworm (as organic starter), Coiled Spring (to help it collapse) and an Unfired Large Jar (container)<br />
<br />
Meant to add the resulting the bait would need to be zero value to vendor (so no regular fishing bait) if the bait is generated from low/no value feed material.</div></div><hr />

How about Nitrous boost cannisters?  Max run speed for 6 seconds (a tick) casting time instant, 10 charges (or less).  required: 1 base prototype, 1 vial of gases, 1 coiled spring, 1 metal studs (Ya need a button), 1 mana battery class 6.  Inflicts 100 pts of fire damage on the user.<br />

I still like the idea of a gnomish tracking device.  Even with a super low ability level like 25 would be useful.... Heck, make it so it doesn't even show direction, just that the mob is up.  Tracking is a multiple class skill so I don't see too much of a problem with that device.<br />
<br />
Gnome tinker only rideable spider would be great AND they could use existing models for it.  <br />
Make one of them no drop, expensive combine( 100k+ ), 335 trivial, and required 250 skill combine.  Heck, you could even make it a multiple skill item/quest like the Aide gimel earrings.  A badge of honor that is seen by all.  For this kind of cost however, it should be almost as fast as a paladin/Sk AA horse.  This would serve 2 purposes, give the high end tinkers something to work towards and take more pp out of the system which was the original purpose of the horses.  Make it use expensive batterie(s) to run on thereby taking more pp out of the system.<br />
<br />
Could make droppable ridable spiders that are gnome usable only in different colors/sizes/speeds.  Make the cost/skill for the combine appropriate for the speed.  Make them use expensive batterie(s) to run on thereby taking more pp out of the system.<br />

I absolutely agree with you and I don't see why they woudl get angry.  Besides endless summoners making arrows, you have clicky items like Tolans Wrist and Bloody Ancillie's Pouch.  The Bloody pouch is about 7k on my server and can be obtained through an LDoN, very easy itemto get.

How about an Anizok that summoned throwing weapons? There are raid items that will summon some pretty good throwing weapons, but for lower rogues and monks who don't have that yet an Anizok might be a better choice as the Mrylokars the rogues get just provides a normal throwing knife which doesn't have the greatest range. It could be recharged with a normal fishbone dart (to keep the fletchers happy and not kill the fishbone market), created with among other things the HQ fishbone dart. I'm thinking something like Gnomish Aerodynamical Dart, say 80-100 range at least. If we could make those I'd get my rogue one. I'd also get my friend's monk one, and my other friend's rogue one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love the bait summoning thing personally, as a fisher. How about this: <br />
<br />
Anizok's Bait Dispenser<br />
<br />
(tinkered bait) + base prototype + gnomish bolts + mana battery class 6 + Static Orb (or something about the cost of static orb, mabye metal twine or reflective shard or something)<br />
<br />
Triv 262<br />
<br />
<br />
It has 20 charges of summon:gnomish bait (norent). To recharge you need the Class 1 Mana Battery (same one as gauze press) + tinkered bait. It produces norent versions of tinkered bait (but no % to fishing). If you really want to make a different subcombine to make it produce whatever you use to recharge it, you can, but that seems like too much work, just make it summon Summoned:Gnomish Bait (norent). That would mean that to recharge it would be a three item combine requiring tinkered bait. I know I'd carry around a stack of tinkered bait along with a stack of mana batteries if that meant 20 stacks of bait. It's the perfect compliment to the Fisherman's Companion. Or just don't require the tinkered bait on the recharge (gauze press don't require bandages to recharge). Just throwing out ideas here. REALLY want to see something that summons bait.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no it doesn't...we make things that invis...that's a spell..we make things that summon bandages..that's a spell.  a spell is a spell.  invis is the same as clarity.  i think by abilites they meant forage, tracking, lay of hands, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koru</div><div class="date">08-12-2004, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They've nixed rez potion ideas and rez device ideas because it's considered a class ability. Clarity spell line is very much considered a class ability as there's no all/all items you can get from vendors that will cast those spells and only one class gets that particular spell line. Generally if it's only available to a handfull of classes and cannot be gotten cheaply from merchants a spell effect is a class ability.<br />
<br />
Invisibility isn't considered a major thing because there are so few classes that have no means of invising themselves and 10pp potions that invis can be gotten at merchants all over Norrath. Bandages aren't considered again because of how widely available bandages are. Neither device really provides a service that can't be gotten through other vendor sold items, they merely save inventory space on holding those items. This also explains why they're not opposed to a bait dispenser, baits are readily available already, the only issue with them is how much space they take.<br />
<br />
I don't mean this in a hostile way at all, I'm just saying the chances of getting a C dispensing Anizok so slim as to pass for an anorexic Ethiopian.</div></div><hr />

Ngreth responded:<br />
    &quot;Well... this would have to cost at least as much per &quot;compression&quot; as the sellback cost of Velium Bars... or you have a money creator :/ Good idea despite that!&quot;<br />
<br />
It could be viable as a right-clickable cast item that uses multiple blocks/bricks for the desired result of giving the user 1 vellium bar.  Since I don't do JC (yet, at least) I don't know if it would be unbalancing to be able to do this with roughly equal vendor values of each, but that's my two cents.<br />
<br />
Other ideas I have liked or want to see more developed:<br />
-   Somebody mentioned yo-yos or something like it as weapons?  Why not tinkered weapons?  Or if that's taking too much from smithing...<br />
-   Tinkered augs?  A type 4 aug that adds a Steam Blast proc or some suc, maybe not too much damage, since augs are very much the province of the adventure points and expedition biz.  Also, it might be cool if the effects from cultural armor could be condensed to augs for other armors (still gnome only) so that casters could use 'em, maybe.  That would probably make recharging them a pain since, at best, you'd have to remove the aug, recharge it, and put it back in.<br />
-   The bait dispenser sounds great!  I don't even fish and I can see how perfect that would be for those that do.  I stand behind it for their sake.<br />

That way the int casters can tailor something and tinker it onto their armor.<br />
    A charged device that casts 5 charges of dex made from a faun hoof for example.<br />
    Being given the ability to tinker that onto, say... acrylia plate would be nice... then upgrade that to cultural status. Make it insanely expensive, higher level restriced, nearly impossible to combine, whatever. A variety of options would be nice.<br />
    Ice silk armor, tinkered with a clicky, upgraded to cultural, add an augment. Make it that funky banana yellow newbie color. Slap on a level 60 or 65 restriction or something. 55 would be nice since wasn't that the velious highest level? Also wasn't that the only tradeskilled int caster armor from that expansion?<br />
    Gnome only on all that of course, can't have the masses wanting to buy our stuff. Think of how much work that'd be, how crowded wakening lands would get!<br />
    Last but not least, more high level roaming giants that have 10-15khps,double or triple for up to 473 hps and path along with the panthers please. Having them pop only once every 30 minutes isn't doing my aa bar much good. /grin</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pocket watch and bait maker seem quite nice novelty items that shouldn't cause any problems.<br />
<br />
We can fit 200 bear pelts or for that matter 200 casks in a backpack and you cannot accept the concept of a portable still? :) More to the point, a backpack in EQ can hold far more than we would normally put in a brew barrel for even the most complex recipe. Think about it.<br />
<br />
Such comments aside though, keep in mind that a RL still is really a simple device and breaks down into components easily. Frankly I have never understood why this is considered a problem. If heat source is the issue, then we should not be able to use spits for cooking either.<br />
<br />
As for forges, again, the forging components fit in packs, so the forge itself should not be an issue other than heat source. For a forge, however, the heat source is presumably much hotter, and not so trivial. Even so, given the large numbers of rather fire resistant nasties in the world, one would think that some sort of viable insulation should be possible....<br />

Its more of a cheater skill actually. Why find a ranger/druid/bard when you can just use seeeq or whatever cheater program and see every mob, exactly when theyspawned and even see mobs that wont show up on track, like traps and triggers.<br />

They cant add tinkering AA's as it is a racial ability.<br />

Why not have a gnome-only quest? Turn in an item - get an AA added to your list? If they can set the cost at 0, im sure they can set it at anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's my favorite version of some great ideas I've seen here:<br />
<br />
Coin Fusion Device<br />
   Each charge converts all coins exactly like hitting the Change button in the bank.  (Rechargable of course.)<br />
<br />
Defective Filleting Contraption<br />
   Each charge mangles one fresh fish, producing a stack of bait.  Recharge using inexpensive mana batteries.<br />
<br />
Rubbish Collector's Junk Detector<br />
   Works like track or Sense Undead, but only for dropped items and ground spawns. <br />
<br />
Gnomish Army Knife<br />
    +5% to all tradeskills, like having a full set of Geerlocks in one slot.  (I'd aim for a combined average cost of 20-50k to leave the market for geerlocks as is.  Maybe make it attunable?)<br />
<br />
The ideas most likely to be accepted are those which can utilize some existing function in a new interesting way, or things that make it faster (and more expensive) to do something all classes can already do.   I prefer to leave it up to Sony what components would be required.  (I hate to think they'd pass up a good idea because someone's recipe was silly/inappropriate, but you never know.)<br />
<br />
BAD<br />
<br />
Folks, as much as I like the idea of a Gnome Tracking Device,  (Each charge lets you track a single character, so long as it is a gnome.)  I don't believe it's going to happen.  It doesn't matter if it costs 100kpp to make, Sony won't implement it because Rangers would scream.  I suggest you just give up suggesting items that compete directly with<br />
  A) Clarity/KEI<br />
  B) Tracking  <br />
  C) Foraging<br />
  D) Ressurection<br />
  E) Potions already in game (Gate)<br />
  F) Pets<br />
  G) Safefall (Maybe I'm the only one thinking of spring-loaded boots?)<br />
Those are classified by Sony as class defining abilities.  Sony makes the judgement in some very subjective ways.  It doesn't really matter how many classes have them.  For instance, I don't expect to ever see items which allow melee and hybrid classes to bind, because Bind Affinity is an ability &quot;unique&quot; to (all 7) casting classes.  Every time some melee type says they want a tinkered device to allow them to bind, I imagine someone at Sony thinking, &quot;Yes, we know you want it.  :p  You've said it a lot.  We're glad to hear it, because if you want those class-defining abilities enough, you'll spend time playing those classes too.&quot;<br />
<br />
UGLY<br />
<br />
I don't expect Sony to do anything which requires new models or graphics just for tinkers.  That includes tinkered pets and mounts.  You wouldn't want a mechanical horse if it looked exactly like an existing horse, but cost more, would you?  Even using the existing clockwork models means they have to be loaded in all zones.  Right now the zones where you see clockworks sacrifice other models to make room.  If they were summoned mounts, you could load them in any zones which would mean larger amounts of memory, and there's no way Sony is going to raise thier system requirements just for us gnomes.   :boggled:</div></div><hr />

The bait thing with fishing is annoying, and I thought it would be nice to have a solution that didn't use up so much space and also didn't make you need ot head back to a merchant as often ... like a quiver of never ending bait or some such thing.  Or specific tinkered bait that let you get a slightly higher chance of catching a specific fish or item from the water.  A Henry Blake fishing-hat look would be awesome. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a wizard, I can say, new looks in headgear have been requested for a very long time.  I mean, how hard can it be to make a POINTY HAT?  It seems to be too much graphical load for Sony to endulge us.  Since there's more wizards than tinkers, I doubt the answer will be any different.<br />
<br />
I get the impression that the code that decides what gets foraged or fished up is difficult to change.  Rangers complained for a long, long time about getting mostly fishing grubs from forage before anything could be done about it.  Is it possible we could tinker an item that lets us bias the catch?  I don't know, but the odds don't seem very good.<br />
<br />
Unless I'm mistaken, we only got Locate Corpse, not Summon Corpse. Or did I miss something?<br />
<br />
You didn't miss anything, Cerpicio; I did.  The tinkered gizmo locates corpses, but doesn't summon them.  That'll teach me not to listen to a high elf about what a tinkered gizmo does.<br />
<br />
Locating corpses is not classified as a class-defining ability because you can buy a rod that does it in most towns.  I guess summoning them still is class-defining?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fulminate</div><div class="date">03-24-2005, 07:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gonna ressurect an old thread here, but I have another idea.<br />
<br />
Gnomish Tool Compressor<br />
A tinkered tradeskill container (10 slots, giant) that has recipes where you put in common tradeskill tools for a particular tradeskill, and it 'consumes' them, creating an item, that, if placed in the GTC alone and combined again, 'creates' those tools again.  I'm not sure if the tradeskill engine will actually allow a recipe that results in up to 10 different (non stacked) products, though.  If it doesnt, they could have the compressed tool set be a 1 charge clicky that summons up a bag (No Rent) with the 10 tools in it, using a similar mechanic as to how mages can summon pouches full of ammunition.<br />
<br />
Sample Recipe for the GTC :<br />
<br />
Nesting Cookware Set<br />
__Pie Tin<br />
__Cake Round<br />
__Muffin Tin<br />
__Pot<br />
__Non-Stick Frying Pan<br />
__Casserole Dish<br />
__Dairy Spoon<br />
__Filleting Knife<br />
__Skewer<br />
<br />
Similar recipes could be made for other trades, combining their non-quested, non-No Drop components that are returned, success or fail, in recipes that call for them.<br />
<br />
Since it takes all the tools to make the compressed kit, and the compressed kit makes just the tools, there is no issue with this being a 'platinum summoner'.  And it would save a LOT of bank space for multi-tradeskillers who dont want to have to make new tools every time they do a recipe.<br />
<br />
It might also be possible to combine all of the compressed kits to make a super-compressed all-trades kit that, when uncompressed, returns the individual trade compresed kits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How about a tinkered Grandmaster Tinker's Collapsed Toolkit (let's call it the GMTCT from here out)?  (Okay ... just calm down for a minute and hear me out on this. :) )<br />
<br />
What I am talking about is a &quot;sidegrade&quot; (or at most a modest upgrade) from the Grandmaster Tinker's Spanner.<br />
<br />
Definition: sidegrade -- an equipment change that doesn't really improve or detract from one's overall stats or abilities in a significant manner.<br />
<br />
Stats on the GMTCT are as follows:<br />
<br />
Grandmaster Tinker's Collapsed Toolkit<br />
LORE ITEM NO DROP<br />
Slot: PRIMARY,SECONDARY,RANGE,AMMO<br />
Skill Mod: Tinkering +5%<br />
Effect: Summon Collapsible Grandmaster's Toolkit (Cast Time: 10.0)<br />
STR: +10   CHA: +50   WIS: +10   INT: +10   <br />
WT: 0.1   Size: SMALL<br />
<br />
The effect summons a no rent, 10 slot &quot;Collapsible Grandmaster's Toolkit.&quot;  This combines the item stats of the Grandmaster Tinker's Spanner with the effect of the Collapsed Toolkit while giving the user the upgraded toolkit capacity of the 10 slot Deluxe Toolbox.<br />
<br />
This would benefit a tinker who also had a tradeskill trophy in another tradeskill and therefore didn't need to have two items which both summoned the same kind of bag.<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
The way a Tinker would acquire the GMTCT is through a process similar to the way a rogue acquires the Grandmaster Assassin's Seal.  It would require the Tinker to first make the Grandmaster Tinker's Spanner, and that would then be used as a part of a quest to gain the GMTCT.  To get a sense for what I am discussing here, take a look at this link:<br />
<br />
Grandmaster Assassin's Seal Quest (http://home.comcast.net/~corinari/grandmaster_assassins_seal.htm) <br />
<br />
Does anybody else like the general concept here?<br />

Gnomish Army Knife<br />

<br />
<br />
Someone returning from fan faire mentioned that the developers have a problem putting multiple tradeskill modifiers on a single item.  Let's revise this to say...<br />
<br />
Gnomish Army Knife<br />
    Like having a full set of Geerloks in one slot, but no stats by itself.   You have to unfold/expand it for each tradeskill.  If you've ever had a swiss army knife, you may remember pulling out the tiny tweezers, but then having to put them back afterward.  Sometimes it would be easier to reach for the real tool than to find the right blade in the knife and get it open.<br />
<br />
To do this in EQ, combine your GAK by itself in any tradeskill container.  You get a TEMPORARY NO TRADE gadget for that tradeskill along with your GAK back. For instance, combine your Army Knife by itself in any fletching kit and get a <br />
Fletching Gadget<br />
Primary<br />
LORE NO TRADE TEMPORARY<br />
+5% fletching<br />
<br />
All those restriction tags avoid any potential exploits.  To avoid competing with Geerloks, this should be at least 5 times the combined cost of a full set of geerloks.<br />
<br />
** EDIT **  Forgot that geerloks are Primary-Only, unlike trophies.</div></div><hr />

OFF TOPIC .. keep mages unique ability and add to it .. now we have serverwide /invite .. give mages serverwide CoH .. and make tinkers able to make an inzone coh item - make it expensive but ideal for people that box in particular when they are in twisty dangerous and or laggy areas. .. but agree it will probably never happen.</div></div><hr />

That would be far too powerful in that it would trivialize too much content.  In effect it would permit an entire raid to get anywhere a rogue with the Shroud of Stealth AA (a.k.a. SoS) could get without having to kill a single mob, and rogues with SoS can get darn near anywhere.<br />
<br />
The only way to balance this would be to add more mobs that see through SoS (which would greatly anger the rogue community) and/or to flag more zones with the &quot;CoH doesn't work here&quot; flag (which would greatly anger the mage community) and that, in effect, would inconvenience everybody.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
OH!  heh.  Sorry about that.  Let me rephrase...<br />
<br />
If you want to be able to cast call of hero, you'll have to play a mage who has the spell.<br />
<br />
My whole point was that Sony reserves this ability for mages.  As uncleshmoozo said, it completely breaks the balance of class abilities if non-mages could summon people.  For the same reason, I think it's very unlikely that any tinkered item will ressurect.  A rogue or monk with ressurection is simply too powerful.<br />
<br />
Server-wide CoH would allow people to bypass way too much content.  There are developers out there who specificly want people to travel through dangerous zones with see invis mobs to reach some destinations.  In fact, those destinations provide extra rewards in terms of experience and loot strictly because of the difficulties you have to go through to get there.  If you added server-wide CoH, the developers would no longer be able to offer bonuses for people willing to travel to out-of-the-way, hazardous zones.<br />

Im sure others have stated this idea and call it &quot;unreasonable&quot; but we should put in a tinkered item with a one charge teleport. With pottery you can make the spiritstones/faithstones and alchemists can make limited port potions. As tinkerers we should have some sorta port item such as:<br />
<br />
Gnomish Space Rocket<br />
Magic Item Lore Item<br />
Slot: Primary<br />
Expendable Charges: 1<br />
Effect: Blast to Akanon (Must Equip. Casting Time: 30.0 seconds)<br />
Class: All<br />
Race: All<br />
<br />
Blast to Akanon<br />
Teleports you to the mechanical city of the gnomes.<br />
<br />
Another idea:<br />
<br />
Gnomish Sky Rocket<br />
Magic Item Lore Item<br />
Primary<br />
Expendable Charges: 1<br />
Effect: Alter Plane: Sky (Must Equip. Casting Time: 30.0)<br />
Class: All<br />
Race: All<br />
<br />
Alter Plane: Sky<br />
Teleports you to the Plane of Sky. Requires Cloudy Stone of Veeshan.<br />
<br />
Im sure gate potions and port potions will still be popular but opening up more venues for travel from far distances will lead to competition, decreased prices, revived interests in old world zones, and alot more fun. You can make these somewhat a challenge to make.<br />
<br />
Another tinkered device for a limited time to fit in w/ the Age of War....call this fun:<br />
<br />
Gnomish War Bomb<br />
Magic Item Lore Item No Trade Artifact<br />
Primary Secondary<br />
Expendable Charges: 1<br />
Effect: Gnome Destruction (Must Equip. Casting Time: Instant)<br />
Class: ALL<br />
Race: GNM<br />
<br />
Gnome Destruction<br />
The gnome ignites with burning rage, explodes, and dies. Targets within the vicinity of the gnome is burnt for 2100 points of damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nantik's Foraging Contraption<br />
or <br />
Anizok's Foraging Device<br />
<br />
Make it around the 280-290 triv mark so there's something else to skill up on at around that level mark and also make it lore to keep them from being swamped on the market. Add a reuse timer to it such that they couldn't just right click all 20 charges right off the bat. Make it rechargable with two(2) type six mana batteries. <br />
<br />
Let the recipe be something like:<br />
Base prototype<br />
Mana battery - type six<br />
Knuckle Joint<br />
Gnomish Bolt<br />
Then something like roots, veggies, berries or some other foraged/dru/rng type item. <br />
<br />
Maybe add a subcomine for a Mechnical Ground Picker then make the last item needed for the Forage Device be that. <br />

<br />
 Though I think it should be a PET.<br />
<br />
 Collapseable Scavenger Mark I-<br />
  <br />
  Clockwork parts (x5?)<br />
  Gears Sprokets<br />
  Wound Springs (same used for cam bow- dwarven wire + rod + forge)<br />
  Undamaged Control Box<br />
  (Druid brain?) (grin)<br />
  Requires a cheap mana battery and a Programming card.<br />
  Preservation fluid and Jar (for brain)<br />
  Cards are sold in Akanon or result from quest rewards.<br />
  <br />
<br />
 Or are produced by an analyzer Calculator Machine. (needs bigger name)<br />
<br />
  YOu input a sample (food, non-organic, etc) and it produces a single program card for the Scavenger unit.<br />
<br />
 Cards can stack upto 20.<br />
<br />
  Each card allows the scavenger to run that program 5 times and fill its bin.<br />
  You have no real control while the scavenger is running the program.<br />
  It can cause agro and get destroyed.<br />
  So better use it in an area that is safe for you...or take the risk.<br />
  It moves about randomly centered on the owner until it finished one Loop of its program. <br />
<br />
  There should be five levels of Scavenger Clockworks.<br />
  Each has a better chance of actually foraging something  than the previous.<br />
  Each has a Bin that can only be emptied or looted when it either finishes its run(s) or is destroyed and then is lootable.<br />
<br />
  Each has larger bin.<br />
  Basic unit can run 5 program cards.<br />
  Each one after can run 2-3 more.<br />
  Each larger and better unit uses larger mana battery.<br />
  The unit needs recharged after 100 uses no matter what.<br />
  The unit also has a chance of breaking down when running.<br />
  Tinkers can repair and recharge these units.<br />
<br />
  Tinkers make the programming machines too. <br />
  Or you can just put it (the device) in a central area.<br />
<br />
  What the gnomes don't tell everyone is that all the food and stuff they receive in the Program Card Calculator-analyzer Maker (needs cute gnomish name) is actually stored inside. This means they get plenty of needed stuff themselves for their own crafts from their devices installed all over Norrath. They also make a nice killing on the gold deposited in the machine too.<br />
<br />
  Click machine Insert item (Item level/type needs to be equal too or greater than the type of materials you want to forage for...ie common means only common forage program cards. Rare item = more cards but they will allow rare and below to be foraged. Each has a bonus to chance of finding items.<br />
 It needs to run the program top down. Check for rarest first then on down to the common items. This will prevent distribution and mathematics from making the better program cards worthless. <br />
<br />
 Each Scavenger Unit Pet Robot (Sup'r) can only run certain cards.<br />
 Running too high of a card on a low end Version is allowed, but it increases the chance of the machine going beserk or breaking down completely.<br />
<br />
 These machines should look like a cross between a clockwork spider  or crab with a cabinet/box rear end.<br />
<br />
 a /pet report command not only gives its status, but will list (in order) the program cards in its Queue, and remaining power.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Faydwer News Service Alert!!!<br />
AKANON SCAVENGING UNITS RUN AMOCK! NO SUP-R's AVAILABLE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. <br />
<br />
<br />
           The Badger Beer Scavenger Units met with failure when a handful of such devices were released near Kaladim to impress the Dwarfs with Gnomish Creativity. Good Idea, bad implementation. These devices were tough and very direct. They collected any booze and beer in the area they could locate with their Arcane Powered Machine Brains. <br />
<br />
           They didn't cause much property damage, but the resulting battles with the Dwarfs of the Region, led to beer hoarding and hordes of angry dwarfs guarding access to all the pubs in Kaladim.<br />
<br />
            When one of the Beer Badgers was finally broken open and they discovered the Tinker Inventor's name...the army marched on Akanon...War was averted,barely only due to an incursion of Dark elves who came to watch the show and stupidly taunted the dwarfs too, and the mass summoning of magical ale by every mage the City of Gnomes could summon.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was just a bad set of program cards,&quot; said one Gnome on condition his name not be given to the nearby dwarven horde. &quot;The machines work just fine and even exceeded the durability requirements of the Guild. It's not our fault the dwarves attacked them. They should have just let each unit fill up its Bin and they would have come home to Akanon on their own. Silly dwarfs caused a &quot;What If&quot; clause in the machine code to activate and well. The Badger units are made for scavenging in the harshest conditions, these are the best of the best units around. Excuse me I see some dwarfs headed this way. Gotta Go!&quot;<br />

How about something to turn those darn rusty daggers into something a little more useful, and preferably something that stacks?  Say you pop in a few rusty daggers (I'd say between 4 and 6, but I'll leave the details of the recipe to the developers, of course) and hit combine and it pops out a metal bits.<br />

Or even weirder  ... you pop in a rusty dagger and a tattered cloth sandal, and it pops out a few fishing lures which stack and act just like bait.<br />

Bow part still made by fletchers (infact just use bows already in the game) with the stock and final combine made by tinkering.<br />

Essentially the change would be one of two options, the graphic only or the graphic and the stats.  Making both dam/dly larger would be my preference.  Bolts still made by fletchers with some new parts.<br />
<br />
I don't think it'd be too unbalancing or terribly difficult and the graphic is already in the game in a form (check out Thurgadin).<br />
<br />
<br />
Augments<br />
Right clicky stuff like on the clockwork armour.  Nothing too special to be overpowering but useful none the less.<br />

<br />
Ore Smelt<br />
Ok so no portable forge, how about a smaller container that can be used to break weapons/ore down?  Maybe just 4 slots and restricted to only those types of combines, save carrying tons of velium weapons back.</div></div><hr />

Crossbows... why haven't they made these yet?  Come on Sony, the graphic has been in the game since Velious, I doubt it would take much different coding to make them use bolts instead of arrows.<br />

Just let that effect be permanent deep underwater wearing the goggle.  A lot of people hate going to underwater zone because it is difficult to see under water. How about adding an EB effect to it so it's more desirable? The stats won't have to be high, that way you have to sacrifice something to be able to see under water. Just a thought.<br />

I feel fairly confident that that is a bug in the antiquated pre-kunark graphics engine that never got fixed because it was simply unimportant.  I doubt, however, that they would consider making items specifically to exploit it.<br />

Out of Food/Water: <br />
Right Click Food and Beverage Dispenser (Reagent is battery or a type of food you wish to replicate, food is ND or No Rent, if battery then higher the battery type the better the food, whether it be duration or some type of low level stat food)<br />

No Money In The Field/Too Much Money In The Field:<br />
Two Slot Banker Container that will allow access to one shared bank slot and one normal bank slot, also has &quot;change effect&quot; to consolidate coinage and withdraw deposit cash in the field.<br />

Nexus Relocator:<br />
Think Tinkered gate potion. Whether it is 10 uses and destroyed or rechargeable it should be of sufficient difficulty to make that it resembles the difficulty to obtain the Gate Neck from PoP.<br />

Boar-Forager:<br />
Just as pigs forage for truffles, an activate forager-bot that does zone specific forages with 100 charges and is rechargeable.<br />

<br />
A tinkered device that banishes a jester :D It may be fun under certain circumstances but sometimes it's more of a hinderance than fun in serious situation and therre have been time that I wanted to DT the jester and whoever brought him out.<br />
<br />
An all-in-one geerlok device that combines all 7 fully evolved trophy for a single one with !5% mod to all basic tradeskills so you only need to carry/store one rather than 7 indivual trophies.  (Alchemy, poison, research, and tinker is exempt from super trophy) The final combine is done by any player but the device can only be made by gnomes and requires high tinker skill.  Think swiss army knife version for the trophy.<br />
<br />
A device with 1 or 2 slot containers and turn any HQ fur or skin into medium quality, MQ tol ow quality.  This covers the skin and fur not converted with skinning knife and tailor kit/loom.<br />
<br />
Something similiar to Necrotic Divining Device, this helps track ground spawns.  Many GS tended to be rarer than forged counterpart so it's not exactly game breaking.</div></div><hr />

Let's revise this to say...<br />
<br />
Gnomish Army Knife<br />
    Like having a full set of Geerloks in one slot, but no stats by itself.   You have to unfold/expand it for each tradeskill.  If you've ever had a swiss army knife, you may remember pulling out the tiny tweezers, but then having to put them back afterward.  Sometimes it would be easier to reach for the real tool than to find the right blade in the knife and get it open.<br />
<br />
To do this in EQ, combine your GAK by itself in any tradeskill container.  You get a TEMPORARY NO TRADE gadget for that tradeskill along with your GAK back. For instance, combine your Army Knife by itself in any fletching kit and get a <br />
Fletching Gadget<br />
Primary<br />
LORE NO TRADE TEMPORARY<br />
+5% fletching<br />
<br />
All those restriction tags avoid any potential exploits.  To avoid competing with Geerloks, this should be at least 5 times the combined cost of a full set of geerloks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Wanted to present an alternate method of implementation.<br />
<br />
Put each geerlok in toolbox + misc other parts to the Gadget:<br />
<br />
Tinkering Gadget<br />
LORE<br />
Primary<br />
Expendable Charges 1<br />
+5% tinkering<br />
Effect: Summon Smithing Gadget<br />
<br />
Clicking destroys the Tinkering Gadget but creates:<br />
<br />
Smithing Gadget<br />
LORE <br />
Primary<br />
Expendable Charges 1<br />
+5% blacksmithing<br />
Effect: Summon Tailoring Gadget<br />
<br />
Which creates: <br />
<br />
Tailoring Gadget<br />
LORE <br />
Primary<br />
Expendable Charges 1<br />
+5% Tailoring <br />
Effect: Summon Fletching Gadget<br />
<br />
<br />
And so on, until the last version creates the Tinkering Gadget.  This way they add 1 recipe (to tinkers), 8 items (tink, bs, tailor, jc, pottery, brew, cook, fletch gadgets), and 8 new spells (the effects).  Instead of adding 7 recipes to each container to create the appropriate item from any of the types.<br />

As a druid I think this is a very bad idea. Leave some things class specific. Over the years many druid specific skills have been taken from us, so at least leave us this.<br />

I do like the idea that your trophies can be turned into one, Maybe once they are maxed, there could be some sort of quest to combine them, so you could combine 2 or 3 or .....<br />

If it is sufficiently unwieldy and difficult to use then it will never truly displace the foragers yet it will at least give non-foragers the CHANCE to forage what they need. <br />

Think of it this way: you can pay a landscaper to come to your house once a week and mow your lawn, trim your hedges, run a weedeater.

My twink tink was making those Stalking Probes. How about make them stackable? Right now you get 5 clicks and then that's it. It doesn't even rot.<br />
<br />
If each click were a stackable probe you could activate that would be very useful because it wouldn't eat up your inventory space.<br />
<br />
So instead of making 1 item with 5 charges, you could make 5 items and stack. Then make a stack of 20. That would really be nice.<br />
<br />
I would bet that this item would be something you could actually make and sell regularly and not end up selling it back to vendors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True that. But, I'd prefer the burned item. They cost almost nothing to make. And a rechargable item means you have to carry batteries and a tinker box with you. Plus making multiple ones helps you skill up.<br />
<br />
Maybe we could get an upgraded one and make a tinkered scout as an advanced skill. (The won't give us robots but this would be cool.) Maybe a little spider that crawls around scouting. (This would be rechargeable of course. May treat like a horse.)<br />
<br />
In that same vain, I also like the tinkered auto-forager. Would be cool to click it. Let it run around and come back when it's batteries wear out and it dies. Then all you do is loot it. Let it last 5 or 10 minutes so it could get a couple tries in. And you could maybe make upgrades to the item so that the higher the skill level needed the more efficient(successful) it would be. And based upon the battery the longer the thing would try to forage.<br />
<br />
Also could trigger it to pick up local ground spawn stuff or those nasty ranger/druid droppings that seem to be everywhere. You'd think people of the forrests wouldn't litter so much. :D <br />

Possibilities are endless, but here are a few suggestions (the graphic artists could have fun with the effects):<br />
<br />
   1. &quot;Mechanized Great Flail&quot; -- Long pole with gears and belts and spinning chains on the end.<br />
<br />
   2. &quot;Anizok's Snake of Retribution&quot; -- Some type of mechanical whip <br />
<br />
   3. &quot;Mourning Shower&quot; -- Short range acid bomb, only usable by casters.  maybe Range 50, Delay 20, Damage 20.<br />
<br />
   4. &quot;Dynaah's Gnomish Equalizer&quot; -- my personal fav, so named it after my own Gnome wiz who invented it :p .  This would be a small flamethrower, range weapon.   Maybe Range 50, Delay 200, Damage 150.   Ammo would be &quot;Glob of Naphtha&quot;, made only by Alchemists.   Could be unstackable to limit shots.   Great opportunity for neat graphic when fired.   If target is hit, this is treated as a DoT with continuing damage for maybe 6 tics.  <br />
<br />
   Plenty more ideas.   Just a sample here!   Time for gnomes to get Offensive!!  (no cute remarks, plz....)</div></div><hr />

OK, if you want to waste time getting technical....<br />
WHERE did I say gnomes have to wear leather armor?<br />
I only said they can MAKE leather armor, which is true!  Hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinytree</div><div class="date">05-03-2006, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Questions first:<br />
<br />
Why this policy &quot;no stealing other classes skills&quot;? Invis device, levitation device, stalking probes - these are all other classes skills, i mean most melee can't cast them, and eye of zomm belong to wizards/magicians - or what? <br />
<br />
Shamans can already make sow potions, illusion potions, port/gate potions - these are class specific skills, arent they?<br />
<br />
I personally think the tinkered foraging devic, and tinkered tracking device are great ideas. <br />
<br />
It doesnt have to match or even come close to ranger/druid skills, but just to be able to track short distance, would be great. <br />
<br />
There is a reason why every other EQ player has a druid alt - its for tracking/porting/foraging. But of course, this might have its advantages for Sony, since every other person pays for 2 accounts this way. <br />
<br />
I have a second account with a druid on it, and all i use this druid for is this, tracking, foraging and porting - maybe buffing once in a while, but thats about it. <br />
<br />
If you are a tradeskill freak like i am, and not a foraging class, then it is near impossible to do any tradeskill without buying all these foraged items. You cant kill your way to many of these, not even the clockwork grease from Plane of Innovation - this is pure logic, or is it?<br />
<br />
Classes who can forage has great advantages when it comes to tradeskills, compared to other classes. Since they can obtain most items themselves, is it fair to give these classes monopoly on these items? Is it fair to give these classes advantages on tradeskills?<br />
<br />
Ok, enough ranting - i just think this whole &quot;no stealing other classes skills&quot; policy is double moral, since it does not corrospond to what is going on in the game now. <br />
<br />
Regarding the Race Tinkering Mastery AA - maybe its not incorperated in the game at the moment, but that doesnt mean it cant get there. Why is tinkering the only tradeskill that doesnt have the Mastery AA? Game has class specific Mastery AA, so should be possible to make race specific Mastery AA too in my oppinion, and the Tinkering Mastery AA should be there to make all tradeskills even.<br />
<br />
Thoughts:<br />
<br />
When DoD came out, i began seing players on robot boars - i thought, wow, they made tinkered mounts! What a great idea, i want one! i must have one! I started looking for the recipie, but to no avail... the tinkered boar was a flop, you can only get one if you go buy the expansion in the stores - and i had already purchased the expansion online, so no tinkered boar for me.. :grumpy: What a dissapointment... But!! One can always try to make up for their mistakes, by making a tinkered mount! How about one of those tinkered clockwork spiders or rats that roam around Akanon? Now that would be awesome! And maybe even make them work in indoor zones - since they are indoor creatures... ideas ideas!<br />
<br />
And how about a Tinkered clockwork container! Why cant gnomes tinker those? Halflings have tailored bags, 10 slot giant 100% wt reduction, let us have tinkered boxes 10 slot, giant, 100% wt reduction! I know they can be vendor bought, but why oh why cant tinkerers make tinkered boxes? Thats just ironic.<br />
<br />
So ideas:<br />
<br />
Make all collapsible containers non lore! Its really annoying that you cant make one while you already have one on you, you may want to make one for others sometime.. or to sell in bazaar, is there a logical reason why they are lore? The unfolded containers can just be lore to avoid people making multiple containers.<br />
<br />
Gnomish snaring device: click = snare mob. A group without a snarer doesnt usually last very long, since it often end in a mob running away, creating a train, wipe group. After a couple of these wipes, group break up, or someone bring their alt druid to snare... This isnt really the most fun way to play. A snaring device would really improve gameplay!<br />
<br />
Gnomish knockout device: click = feign death. I just like this idea, could have long cast time, should not even work when you have mob aggro, but it would be really nice to have a way to go afk without dying. SK's/monks and necros can do this, why are they the only classes who should be able to go afk without dying? Should this ability to go afk without dying/getting aggro be limited to rogues and these classes only? i dont think so! Camping out in my oppinion is not the right solution.<br />
<br />
Gnomish transformator device: click = change gender! Well, i know its doable in game, in griegs end mobs proc race/sex change on players, GM's can do it, you become another character in monster missions, you can cast race illusions on players - so why not change gender? I want a sex transformator device! :p<br />
<br />
Gnomish troll evation device: click = shadow step . All gnomes know how hungry trolls always are, and how often gnomes have to run for their lives.. but! if they could instant shadow step away from the troll, that might help increase the population of gnomes in Norrath! It might also help people getting unstuck, when they are stuck between rocks etc, when rewind doesnt work - been there, done that, more times than i can remember - and there's not always a mage to CoH you out of there! Who knows, maybe its a gnome size issue...<br />
<br />
Thats about it for me, I know this thread is very old, so i just hope someone with some influence still reads these boards, so my message gets out ;) <br />

<br />
Snaring.  Here I have to call BS.  There are more than enough classes capable of snaring that it does not need to be in a clickie for everyone to use from inventory.  Druid, ranger, necro, sk, wizard, bard, beastlord, berzerkers.  Warriors have a no running disc, several weapons in the game proc snares already and it is not uncommon for someone to have one in the group.  Half of the classes in the game can snare.  It already has been given out to a lot of people.<br />
<br />
If you did create these devices, what compensation would you give to them?  You are not thinking about your balance altering changes from a global perspective simply a &quot;what does my character not have that I want&quot; view.</div></div><hr />

Gnomish Radar Device - Casts See Invis<br />

Gnomish Remote Control Mechanical Monster - a shroud - obviously you'd have to restrict where you could activate it, so just PoK maybe.<br />

All you have to do is spend 20 min or so doing the refine quest, then you never have to go back to Abysmal again for refines.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, the algorithm that decided what was trash had some shortcomings which resulted in some rather spectacular failures.  While the loss of mining expedition 323 (after a goat ate its way into an explosive storage area) was considered to be an acceptable loss by the inventor, 2 weeks later when one of his creations consumed his prized collection of left handed wrenches he recalled and rebuilt the entire line.  The rebuilt mounts were originally only supposed to eat small bits of organic trash, but determining what is trash still doesn't work well. <br />
As mounts that eat the food from their packs is much less stressful to gnomes than if the mounts ate the other contents of their packs, the new Roboboars are considered a resounding success.</div></div><hr />
