<br />
Didn't see this mentioned...thought it worthwhile to point out...you can use the &lt;enter&gt; key to search for recipes with the new UI now!  No more waiting for the &quot;Search Recipes&quot; box to activate...<br />
<br />
Sure, it's a small thing...but a nice small thing!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samoht</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">About time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mewkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">....and there was much rejoicing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, I still had been hitting enter instinctively while it wasn't enabled ... then today I noticed I actually got search results that way!<br />
<br />
Very nice change :) Woot!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes! Woo hoo!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sweeeet.  I've been out of game about 2 weeks now but I was ALWAYS hitting enter after typing in my search, purely out of habit.  Very nice to see this little nusiance has been addressed. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mewkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not sure if it was just me or not, but I was making solstice robes last night and noticed that when I enter 'sols' in the search field and press return I got nothing. I press return (2nd time) and then it would find it. Anyone else see similar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Try fixing your UI. I assume this is why my enter key has no effect... oh... that and the lil red message telling me my UI isn't working properly :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've noticed there's a slight delay from when I type in the search request, and when the search button stops being greyed out, so if I hit &quot;enter&quot; too fast, it won't do anything.  (I'm a fast typist, so it's not uncommon for me to have to wait for various things to catch up to me when I'm on a roll.  ;D)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How do you get the ADD button to light up? Or do all recipes automatically get added? My ADD button never gets highlighted and I could never hit it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>MerlmanTM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The ADD button is to add a recpie to your favorites list. So I search for a recpie then once I find it, I highlight it and then the add button works. Then you hit the favorites button and its always (hopefully) on you UI when your open that container again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Is there still a limit to the number of favourites?<br />
<br />
I've not added much because before I could only have 20 fav's across all Tradeskills. After the Fav wipe (well, last UI fixed) I've just search for everything except Kaladim's. <br />
<br />
But yes, using enter to search was much needed :D :hyper: :sing: :hug: :cheers: :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If memory serves me, 100 was the new max on favorites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What Niami said.  You still have to wait for the Search button to ungrey prior to hitting enter.  Still better than moving the mouse though.</div></div><hr />
