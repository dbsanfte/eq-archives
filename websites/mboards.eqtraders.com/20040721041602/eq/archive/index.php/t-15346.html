<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ancarett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My cleric is xping her way to 50 in the Dreadlands. Lots of spider silk, a few brute hides and lots of honey berries for berry dye.<br />
<br />
So my husband and I are duoing but take pity on people LFG so we add them to our group. Most are doing well, but there was this one ranger who drove me nuts.<br />
<br />
I asked for the honey berries, hides and silks unless someone else in the group was using these to skillup. No one else was, but the dang ranger would not  stop looting and eating the honey berries. <br />
<br />
I asked him why. He said that they just sounded tasty. Then he'd loot some or forage some up and munch them down.<br />
<br />
:steamed:  I offered to buy them off of him. No, no, they were just too tasty and he was hungry, see? I offered him some stat food and melts, but nooooooo, he still wanted to eat those honey berries. . . . :steamed:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That ranger should have lost all pitty and been booted from the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Binkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sounds like he was deliberately yanking your chain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The one's he foraged himself, I can't fault him for eating.  It's rude and provocative, but they still are his berries to do with as he pleases.<br />
<br />
The ones looted from the mobs, however, are another matter.  I'd agree on the &quot;boot-worthy&quot; sentiment for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pretty mean...if I'm looting stuff I don't want, I just drop it on the ground. I can't tell you how many times someone in my group will pick it up and then ask me to save anymore for them (which I'm more than happy to do).<br />
<br />
/saves her honey berries for Ancarett =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yah, if they were doing it on purpose to spite you, the retalliation is simple:<br />
<br />
Dispell, dispell, dispell, dispell, port to Cazic Thule, kick loser from group, port out, /ignore.<br />
<br />
That would get the point across.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">While I love Splunge's idea in theory, I'd go with the more reasonable route in reality, which is what I've done on occasion (luckily, I haven't had to do it often).  Boot the ranger.  Tell the group why.  If he requests a reinvite, discuss with the group, and give him another chance if the group agrees.  If you're not leader, ask the leader in tell to boot the ranger, and say why.  If the ranger doesn't get the boot, boot yourself.  I had to do this in an LDoN where a SK looted three augmentations, after being asked on the first (and second!) to allow rolls before looting.  I asked the leader to boot him, and the leader said we needed the DPS.  I disbanded, and waited.  They decided they needed a cleric more than the knight, and booted him.  SImple.<br />
<br />
If you don't get reinvited, leave.  Until a &quot;ninja&quot; class comes out, there's no reason to be around this sort of behavior.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Elyssanda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">OMG gotta share this.. Now, I've had my guild foragers trained for a while.. they eat food I give them, they save me all forages (this is COOL) recently we absorbed 2 guilds which were falling apart. little did I know these people were unedumacated about the finer points of foraging. grouping with a ranger today I about spazzed on him when I see the message scroll by chom chomp chomp XXX takes a bite from a vegetables...<br />
I yell in /gu PLEASE NEW GUILDEES DON&quot;T EAT THE FORAGES.<br />
<br />
He says oh do you need veggies? I said Always. he replies meet me at Pitt bank. I run there, he gives me 3 stacks of veggies, 2 stacks planar fruits (used to be justice fruit), and then runs through a list of forages he has sitting in the bank letting me have any that I want. Including 4 --count em 4-- stacks of... Tea leaves.. <br />
I almost cried. then I turned around and gave him a couple stacks of MTPS and QATs and he was thrilled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Now that's the kind of guildie we all love! As for that other ranger, I just won't play with mean people.</div></div><hr />
