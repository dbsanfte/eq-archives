I seem to be experiencing a dramatic increase in failure rates the past few months. This is happening on the very high end items. Examples would be Mastodon fur cloaks, Ice Silk Caps and Robes, (Robe is trivial 342 highest I have seen for any tradeskill item so far), Star Ruby Steins, Cazicite Jewelry etc.<br />
<br />
I dont even bother attempting Halfling Cultural armor any more. With success rates hovering at a one in five success rate on average, (with those SPECIAL streaks of 15-20 faiures in a row),  it is not possible to cover the cost of the Blue diamonds alone. <br />
<br />
Maybe I have just been having a two month streak of horrid combine bad luck? <br />
<br />
Let me know if I am the only one seeing this. <br />
Thanks! Sluggo<br />

Personally I went thru a HORRIBLE PoP run last month but since I've done better than average. I think its just a slump, look for it to end as they all do ;) Over the last few days Ive been 7 for 8 on high end PoP gear, but I expect that to change VERY quickly.</div></div><hr />

You should EXPECT to see 25 percent success rate on these combines:<br />
<br />
Masto Cloaks<br />
Ice Silk Robes<br />
Solstice Robes<br />
Cultural 3 sheet items<br />
<br />
You should expect to see 50 percent success rate on these combines:<br />
Ice Silk cap<br />
Cultural 1 sheet items<br />
<br />
If you get anything outside of these rates over say, 500 to 1000 combines, then you may have a problem.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jayle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">for the last few weeks, i've skilling up on sickles and am currently kicking and screaming my way through solstice robes. i've combined tons and tons and tons and tons and tons of dust, bless tunare. i ususally do a run of 6 stacks and consistently fail about 15 of them. failure rate did seem a bit high to me (trivial 103, skill 140). but figured it wasn't worth asking about since i'd just end up seeing a whole lotta<br />
