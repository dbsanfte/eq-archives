<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I see to make Blessed Fishing Poles, one needs Imbued Plains Pebbles to make Blessed Dust of Karana.<br />
Do most of you folks who make the Blessed Fishing Pole buy the  Imbued Plains Pebbles from Bazaar?<br />
Or does it pay to make a Druid that worships Karana, power lvl him to 29 or 30....just to Imbue Plains Pebbles?<br />
I am a lvl 55 druid of Tunare and I would hate to start over.<br />
So how do you go about getting Blessed Dust of Karana then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Buy in bazaar or ask your halfling druid friends (or the rare Karanan cleric) to imbue them for you - at the rate you can forage planar oak and dragon eggs it will take quite some time to get through a stack of imbued pebbles.  You can certainly forage the unimbued ones as an elvish druid.  No need to remake a character - the game mechanics strive to &quot;encourage&quot; you to work with other players to get things done.  And if you were a halfling you would probably want the blessed dust of Tunare for some of the other combines.  <br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm a Karana Half-Elf Druid and I Imbue these as I need them. Be aware that this process is a huge mana hog and you probably won't get them cheap if you have to buy them.<br />
<br />
I'm on Veeshan and I, for one, would be happy to trade 1 for 1 to any Tunare Druid for Blessed Dust of Tunare, but otherwise it takes me a full mana bar to do around 30, if I'm lucky, and that's enough time spent medding to make it worth some cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arghargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hated waiting for the boats, so I made a druid alt as a taxi.  I use him now as a forager, and plains pebble imbuer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like to be self-sufficient.....I am a lvl 55 Druid of Tunare......I have 2 computers and 2 accounts so I guess I can power lvl a Karana Druid to 29 pretty quickly?<br />
I also have to Power lvl a Gnome Mage to lvl 16 to Tinker.<br />
Ahhhhh.......I guess I will finally visit PC zone :)</div></div><hr />
