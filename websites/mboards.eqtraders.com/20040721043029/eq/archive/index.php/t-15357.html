<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>coloeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since the release of the tradeskill interface, I have noticed that my success rates have been based on time between success's . this is mearly an observation on my part. It seems that waiting  80 seconds between success give or take a few combines, gives me anouther success. This was done between skill 200 and 240 and for all tradeskills. Your results will prolly be  different as I am sure things like Int. Wis etc. would also come into play. <br />
The message I have is for you to Pay attention  and see if you can find that nitch that is right for you. Also keep in mind that the time may be different for different recipies. This method has increased my tailoring skill from 220 to 240 on 2 stacks of combines. thats right GM'ed tailoring. Same thing with fletching and baking I am know GM of all tradeskills. Hope this helps at least one other person, good luck!<br />
BTW if for some reason you cant make this work it may have very well been a fluke or a bug, I have no idea. I just know it worked for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is a reason it is called the Random number generator.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>coloeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">in my original post skill ups are what I call a success sorry if that was not clear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Carmaris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm going to have to say it was a fluke.  A random number generator shouldn't have any relation to time.  Also, if it were just a matter of time, people across the board would see fairly consistent numbers when skilling up, ie if my time (could/would vary according to wis/int etc) is 100 seconds and I can do ~25 combines in 100 seconds, then I would expect to be able to predict a skillup every 25 combines or so.  Just doesn't happen that way, unfortunately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Still, no RNG that a computer is responsible for is true random.  If the condition is absolutely identical, the numbers will be the same.  Its consider good enough simply because truely identicial condition is almost impossible to achieve.  Time is almost always an element in RNG routine simply because it is NEVER the same.  But if by some fluke .... well .... its still a stretch .... hmmm ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Freya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It would make sense if there was some sort of pause time between sucessful combines..it would punish those who use macro's to tradeskill, since with a macro the time between combines with be virtually identical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tradeskiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well it may be a just a fluke here to but I remember not to long ago with the new UI I was doing some combines for skill ups, forget which tradeskill it was.  But I did approx. 45 or so combines and no skill up, left the tradeskill UI open while I had to go afk and the first combine I did when I came back was a skill up. I didnt think too much about it but was happy none the less then maybe a few days later the same thing happend after coming back from afk. I never thought anything about it until now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Most random number generators are known to have temporal autocorrelation in them.  That means that numbers at one time are not totally independent of the numbers drawn previously.  Some random number generator algorithms are better than others.  If EQ uses a simple one, it is likely that there is a significant degree of autocorrelation in their random number generator<br />
<br />
There is also the intriguing possibility that EQ purposely builds in temporal autocorrelation into their random numbers.<br />
<br />
I almost always find that my skill ups, whether in trade sklls or ther skills, come in &quot;batches&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/tosses another post in the RNG bin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;temporal autocorrelation&quot;<br />
<br />
I like that term. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tradeskiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Since there is a RNG then whats the deal with needing to have max wis/int or whatnot.  Or does the RNG look at your wis/int and say ohh hes got soandso wis/int so lets give him a skill up at X combine while this other guy has 75 less wis or int so lets make him do more combines for skill ups.  What gets me is some people with 355 wis or int can do 150+ combines and get no skill ups.<br />
<br />
coloeb why not post what you used to skill up on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Horanaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Now I utterly suck at math, but here is how I imagine the system works, in a round about way. <br />
<br />
Let's use the old /ran 1 101 that lots and lots of people have used to roll on loot since forever (on prexus anyways).<br />
<br />
System does 2 checks, one for skillups and 1 for success/failure. First check is like this.<br />
<br />
1-80 = no skill up (with base int/wis, pick a number for this)<br />
81-101 = skillup<br />
<br />
Lets say you reach a point in wis.int that it is beneficial for skillups. For the sake of argument, we will go in 50 point steps fromm 100.<br />
<br />
100 int/wis would be 1-101<br />
150 would be 5-101<br />
200 would be 10-101<br />
250 would be 15-101<br />
300 would be 20-101<br />
<br />
However, this doesn't account for the increasing difficulty in getting skill ups in higher skill levels, so lets change the base roll a bit,adding the wis/int bonus to the front number of the range.<br />
<br />
at skill 1, it would be 70-101<br />
at skill 50, it would be 50-101<br />
at skill 100 it would be 45-101<br />
at skill 150 it would be 20-101<br />
at skill 200+, it would be 1-201 :D <br />
<br />
This is just an example, and likely highly inaccurate, but would account for the benefit of high wis/int while still being random.<br />
<br />
The success/fail check sould be similar I imagine, but using skill level/trivial to determine the range for success.<br />
<br />
Of course, I may be (and probably am) completely wrong. But that's how I always pictured the system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>coloeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The combines I used for tailoring were othmir fur caps , for fletching I did bows and followed the trivial curve, for baking I did the crab/ tuna recipies along the curve. Barbequed ones till 242 . hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naxy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I almost always find that my skill ups, whether in trade sklls or ther skills, come in &quot;batches&quot;. I have the same experience. And I find that it goes for failures in combines as well. My theory is that the &quot;seed&quot; for the random number generator is refreshed every tick. And some ticks you have a seed which is &quot;friendlier&quot; than at other times.<br />
<br />
Now, I know this doesn't match what I learned about random number generators, but I am an experimental kind of guy. If theory doesn't match experience, the theory goes in the trash.<br />
<br />
So I make quick combines just after I get a skillup and more often than not do I get another skillup just following it. /shrug<br />
<br />
Whatever voodoo floats my boat. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>scarbrowed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I recently read a story about  a professor teaching probablility. (I wish I could remember where I read it). He would have students write down heads or tails 50 times, then had them flip a coin 50 times. The real coin always had more streaks of the same flip than the lists the students had.<br />
<br />
The point is that random numbers like coin flipping are far more likely to have these clumps than people expect. So in fact the streakiness people see seems to me validation that EQ is using a good random number. If streaks were rare, we would know it was rigged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Streaks = Random. When you look at the long haul, you should see a pattern, and I've never read anything that made me think that anybody in the long term is out of &quot;sync&quot; with anybody else.<br />
<br />
Ride the wave if you're on a roll</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Lumenku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I read somewhere here that the RNG used the clock to get the base number for the RNG.<br />
<br />
It could therefore be possible that if you do 3 quick combines the same number is used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Seedling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It's not using minutes as a base, Lumenku :) More likely to use milliseconds. <br />
<br />
The simplest RNG would return (min+random(time)%(max-min+1)). Considering the amount of randoms a game like EQ needs, it would have to be simple and fast. <br />
<br />
But in the end, the only true random is the one that's never rolled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lumenku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Logically I would have to agree.<br />
<br />
But illogically it doesn't seem very random to me. :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dvinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Verant's RNG has been failing since it was introduced.  A good random number generator should be such that you don't notice any trends in the results.  With Verant's RNG, trends are all you get.  Grade - F.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>scarbrowed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If you've noticed a consistent trend, please share with the rest of us. If the RNG had a trend, we could all abuse it, and skillup faster. Until I see this happen, I'll continue to see the RNG as working properly in a mathematical sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Finavar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">With even a trivial psuedo RNG, it's REALLY unlikely you will get enough of a sample to notice a flaw or a 'system'.<br />
<br />
Based on comments from developers at the various Fan Fairs over the years, the RNG is believed to be a very sophisticated one.  Think about how many times RNG is called in any *one* person's play.  Multiply that out some.  It has to be fast, efficient, and as random as possible.   <br />
<br />
Remember that 'random' in this context means it's hard to predict the *next* number in a sequence based on all previous numbers.  Not that the next number is necessarily *different* from the current one.  Given some large number of runs, all numbers in the range should be shown to occur the same number of times.  The better the RNG, the fewer runs it will take to show this behavior.<br />
<br />
Given a fixed hardware environment (like Sony's machine room), it's fairly trivial to write a PRNG that's essentially completely random.  For instance, sample the data on an unconnected microphone port, or use data from an antenna.  Also, there are hardware cards that produce cryptographically secure random numbers.  They probably don't go to such lengths, but that is an example of things you could do.  <br />
<br />
Now, that isn't to say that there isn't some code in there that rewards non-macro TSers.  Which would have nothing to do with the RNG per se.  I just find it unlikely, but SOE has done some whacky things...  Grats on your skillups :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">A random number generator can and will have streaks. Some people who play the lottery think the numbers cna NEVER turn up the same 2 nights in a row. In fact the odds the numbers will be the same as the last draw are the same odds as ANY other combination. <br />
<br />
Same with a coin flip. Flip a coin 20 times. The odds of all 20 heads or all 20 tails is the same as a heads tails pattern. Its random folks streaks dont break the randomness. Each &quot;choose&quot; (or flip or combine) yields INDEPENDANT results. A success or fail on one combine is the SAME EXACT chance of a success or fail on the previous combine. Just because you failed 10 times in a row doesnt mean the 11th will suceed or fail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>qwkhyena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Originally posted by scarbrowed <br />
..... it was rigged. <br />
<br />
<br />
It IS rigged and the RNG hates me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Dvinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Lets put it this way.  With sense heading maxed at 200, what do you think the odds of logging in and failing the first three sense headings in a row is.  Do the math if you like statistics.  I'd like to know the chance, because it happened to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>scarbrowed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well, I have no data on sense heading failures, but let's say 1 in 20 for failures at 200. To fail three times in a row would be 1 in 20 * 20 * 20, which is about  1 in 8000. Considering that 500,000 people play EQ, if the average person logs in 3 times a week, that works out to 187 times a week that it should occur.<br />
<br />
(And honestly, I made up 3 times a week to make the number come out small. I have days I log in 3 times a day.)<br />
<br />
Of course this is now moot, since sense heading is no longer used. But it's still a useful exercise to demonstrate things.<br />
<br />
BTW, since we are no longer discussing tailoring, I'll say more in OOC if anyone cares. (If not, I don't blame you.)</div></div><hr />
