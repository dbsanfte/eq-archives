<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nepper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Having been a casual player since pre-kunark, and having used these boards since I first learned I could craft items, I wanted to take a quick moment to give a heartfelt thank you to you, DenMom, and all the people who have made these boards what they are.  I've only recently started posting in the forums, but have always admired the amount of work and patience you've all put into this.<br />
My lifestyle beeing what it is, I have come to the long overdue decision to retire my ranger.<br />
I may pop in from time to time to see what is new in the TS community, but besides that, I'll bid you all a fond farewell.<br />
<br />
May Tunare always smile on you all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thanks, Taytm.  Always glad to hear that the site and the boards have been of value.<br />
<br />
May you find joy wherever your travels take you, in-game or out.<br />
