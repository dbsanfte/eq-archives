<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Airriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently level 28 with my pottery to skill number 202. I probably have spent over 5k pp  just to raise it from 202 to 203 and it still hasnt moved. Is there something else I should be doing? Any kind of help or suggestions I would appreciate greatly. Thank you</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">These levels are the rough ones, where there's no cheap or fast way to break through, so you need to be patient.  Some suggestions:<br />
<br />
Planar Steins: At level 28 you can't farm the tainted planar essences needed for these, but they're on merchants all over the PoK for 6 pp each.  Do these whenever merchant finds and money permits, and bank the resulting unfired steins for later firing when you have access to a jeweler (or can become one yourself).  The planar peridot steins sell, because they're used for the beginner stealth manual, and the good part is you can use your first planar peridot stein to get yourself a manual!  That was the first time I finished a quest with something I made all by myself, and it was a great feeling.<br />
<br />
Unfired Crucible of Escape: Again, at level 28 you're going to have to get someone to fish for you in Old Sebilis if you want to fire them, but you can make the unfired portion for about 8 pp per combine, and hunting in the Gorge of King Xorbb is still beneficial at your level.  Tackle the evil eyes, and then hunt the muddites while you wait for repops.  Good experience, good loot and free heavy clay for practice.<br />
<br />
Opal Encrusted Steins: You're probably already making these, but these are the only store-bought-only item I found at this level that sells for anywhere near cost to make.  Make 'em, bank 'em, and sell them as you can.  If you're patient, you can recover most of your platinum from these.<br />
<br />
Good luck.  This is the part that separates the masters from the grandmasters, and it can be awfully frustrating.  We're all pulling for you, though!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Obina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I do suggest you get your Wis or Int to 250 or as close as you can manage.  Get buffs and use special food too.   The good thing is if you spend money on gear, there is a high chance you will get it all back.  If you spend 5k on failed combines for no skill ups, the plat is gone.  If you spend 5k on a trade skill suit, you can always sell it back after.  Many guilds will loan you plat for a suit, where it is tougher to loan you plat for the combines themselves.</div></div><hr />
