I am trying to make clumps of dough for skill and was wondering where everyone went to get Eggs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Phabos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I like Lavastom to kill Lava Basilisks, others recommend the basilisks in the caves in Jaggedpine. Either way, one basilisk egg will combine for 15 dough each, so they are the most economical way to go. Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Elyssanda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it depends on your skill level.. under 35 or so.. Basilisks in Lavastorm, yes..<br />
<br />
35+ Basilisks in the caves in JP... if you're a forager you get the bonus of foraging for the ever hidden Plant shoots while you're there..<br />
<br />
also from 35-about 45 the basilisks are gonna give ya XP too.. the reason to get the JP ones is simple.. lavastorm ones will drop at MOST 2 eggs that I've see. JP ones will drop up to 6... now, in JP ONLY the basilisk genitors will drop eggs... but hey, one kill, 6 eggs.. not a bad return.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I pick up every egg I find while merchant mining...<br />
<br />
I also find a lot of them in the bazaar.... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The genitors in JP are definitely worth the effort if 35+.  I got to 44 killing the cave basilisks, by then, they were light blue and some were green.  Under 35, if you can track and forage, Lavastorm yields more than just lava basilisks for eggs.  Ashweed, used in DE cultural robe dye, is one of the entries on the forage table for Lavastorm.  There's a number of tradeskill stuff available from mobs in Lavastorm.  Imp Blood, Essence of Fire, and a handful of gems all drop in Lavastorm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thicket Tundrabog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I vendor mined eggs in Jaggedpine. The gnoll vendors in the caves (if you have decent faction) often have a large supply.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">never even thought of them.  will have to check them out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>piting</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Another place to get eggs is Gunthak. Niflik's drop eggs and you can also forage their eggs!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Any newbie zone will have snake eggs aplenty.  Doesn't make as many as basilisk eggs does, but ANYONE, even lvl 1 newbs, can get them.  You can probably find hundreds by merchant mining in your friendly local newbie zone merchants.  Also check the merchants in the guildhalls that newbies frequent since they often sell there as well.<br />
<br />
If you're killing dragons you're probably not worried about CoV faction, they drop dragon eggs (I think) I know that you can forage them there.  They also drop dragon meat which is useful in baking as well.<br />
<br />
I perfer JP basilisks because you don't have to hunt them all over the freaking zone, they are all static spawns in one little room, packed for your convenience.  Only issue is getting the right ones to spawn and actually being able to kill them.<br />
<br />
If you're hunting griffons for meat, I believe they also drop griffon eggs which can be used for dough as well.<br />
<br />
Aviak eggs are foraged in BBM, they also yield dough.<br />
<br />
It's your choice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Maisie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I vendor mine in   newb zones for snake eggs, and Gulf of Gunthak for nifilk &lt; sp&gt; eggs, and I also let friends and guildies know I am on the lookout for foraged eggs and I get tons..<br />
<br />
I also offer  5pp per stack of snake eggs in newbie zones and a temp and I get a lot that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Spirish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I started  a chanter this last weekend and was hunting in WFP.  I got 15 snake eggs in about 45 mins.  killing the snakes.<br />

According to the recipes you can make dough with them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lanalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I forage my eggs in Western Wastes/ToV.<br />
<br />
I use Wurm eggs for clumps of dough (yield 16, I think), and save Drake eggs and Dragon eggs for their respective oils (Drake egg oil used in tailoring, Dragon egg oil used for blessed fishing rods).<br />
<br />
I spent a lot of time exping in Western Wastes, so I still have a huge supply of Wurm eggs in the bank. I just take an egg and make dough whenever I run out. :)<br />
<br />
But yes, it really depends on your level. I would agree with the previous posters that if you're a semi-low level, just hunt basilisks/snakes/etc or merchant mine. I see a lot of eggs on merchants in PoK quite often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Crydee Ossiriand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Dragon Eggs are the way to go if you can. One egg will make an entire stack of dough, so they are easier on the bank than other types of eggs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">with dragon eggs being an easy way to get tailor to 150 on treated silk fibers for blessed fishing poles you basilisk or wurm eggs.  dragon eggs can sell for 50pp or more i have seen and that is much more than some extra flour and milk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rissenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If you're hunting griffons for meat, I believe they also drop griffon eggs which can be used for dough as well. <br />
<br />
Hrm, well yes, but remember that snow griffon eggs can also be sold for a nice profit. On FV, they go for 150-250pp each.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Melinia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Snake eggs: any where you find snakes they can and will drop. Check merchants near where you would find snakes, great place to merchant mine them ( Freeport, Qeynos, Butcherblock, East Karanas, Ect.) Foraging there will help to. Snake eggs only yield 1 dough tho. good for skill ups.. bad for subcombines for the bigger stuff. Good for making noodles aswell.<br />
<br />
Aviak eggs : Foraged will yield less dough than dropped. Kill or check merchants in and around Butcherblock and South Karanas along with Lake Rathe. Good for the sub combines. Do not waste on the skill ups.<br />
<br />
Basilik eggs : (sorry for spelling) Yields much dough when looted rather than foraged. Kill or check merchants in and around Jaggedpine, Butcherblock Mountains, Lavastorm. Great for sub-combines but do not waste on the skill ups.<br />
<br />
Bazaar : People may have them on sale. Dont jump at the first one you see.. some people will charge outragous prices for something they foraged up. Keep an eye out for some good prices.. they will come.<br />
<br />
There are other eggs you can use but these are the most common and farely easy to find in your general travels. Most eggs can be foraged but will yield less dough except for snake eggs.. either will yield only 1 dough I believe.<br />
<br />
Happy Holidays :angel:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>chernabog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Are there any mobs that drop more than 1 egg at a time, like the Karanas spiders dropping silk?  I need eggs for noodles &amp; don't want to use my basilisk eggs since they are much more effecient for dough.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">have seen 3 on a snake and 2 on lava bailisk.  seen 4 on basilisk in jp caves.  for skillups just farm snake eggs.  if you were on luclin i could just ae a newbie yard for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>chernabog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Eniamn, which snakes?  Where?  All the newbie snakes only have 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">doesn't happen often but found it on a gopher or grass snake in the qeynos newbie yard i beleive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If you can forage, Skyshrine is the place to be.  Drake eggs and wurm eggs come by the ton.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">they posted that they are dnc for dough though i thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Snow Griffon Eggs are for the shawl quest for the Snow Griffon Sufflette (sp) so I doubt you want to waste them on baking when you can use them to get your next shawl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Laurelai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">When I just need dough (kneed dough? har har) I goto lavastorm because I can track so finding the basilisks isn't hard.  For one recipe, I needed snake eggs, and lemme tell ya, *the* place to go for snake eggs is the newbie courtyard in Paineel.  Those snakes there almost always drop at least one egg, frequently two, sometimes three and occasionally 4!  4 snakes in one drop!  woo hooo!<br />
<br />
Happy baking!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Another vote for Jaggedpine for the eggs.<br />
<br />
I've never gotten an egg off any Basilisk in the caves other than  a Genitor, but I can't swear that's true; others may drop them. If you can kill them, that's the way to go.<br />
<br />
It's a very small, compact area that lends itself to farming. Again, it depends on your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Quillium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Crydee Osiriand said:<br />

----<br />
<br />
*shudder*. Why oh why? From a cost perspective, a dragon egg can sell for anywhere between 100-175pp. That means you are paying 5pp-9pp per clump of dough, not to mention the time spent foraging. In comparison, you can usually get basilisk eggs in the bazaar for 5pp and IIRC you get 15 or so clumps of dough from them at a cost of 3.3g each.<br />
