<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vant321</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is not tradeskill related but this thread is for people who have a pipe dream of what they would like to see on Everquest.<br />
(I hope it does not get shot down by the moderators).  An example of stuff I am talking about follows.<br />
<br />
Okay here is what I would like to see.  A new item given to warriors to put in their charm slot.  It would basically be a charm with alot of augment slots (easy enough with the current software that EQ uses), but only one type of augment would be combinable for it.  This one augment would be &quot;A scar from soandso&quot;.  Then take all the raid type mobs (Nagafem, Vox, uber Kael mobs, Cazic Thulle etc.) and add a &quot;Scar&quot; to each of thier loot.  This &quot;Scar&quot; would be a lore item, no drop, warrior only.  This way the main tank of the raid is most likely to get it.  This would have the effect of adding a little pride to those who use warriors.  I am no computer programing genius but this seems like it would be easy to implement and would add a little bit of flavor to the game.<br />
<br />
Well what do you think about my idea?  Or do you have an idea of your own?  I really want to see what other people would like to see in the game as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;I watched my body hit the floor and wondered how long the secondary tank would hold of Lady Vox's wrath from the rest of the raid, he was a ranger.  I was told it was over very quickly.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">would you give up pop charm for it?  i could see linking it as a badge of honor though.  it should be allowable for others too though.  my wizard would be hecka proud if he got one from tanking vox.  also it removes a loot slot.  should add it to the cursor of the person with the highest aggro at time of death.  a death insta cast thing.  <br />
<br />
just some other ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your best bet on letting the developers know of your ideas is to /feedback it in game or email eqfeedback@soe.sony.com, not post about it here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">what tinile said but the ot forum is a nice place to share pipe dreams.  maybe not the righ board for it but still the best forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>vant321</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just wanted to hit the thread with two notes.<br />
<br />
1)  I know this is supposed to be a trade skills forum, but I am in Japan and this is one of the few forums I know how to get to...If you all rather I not run the thread or avoid cluttering your message board with non tradeskill items let me know.<br />
<br />
2)  The reason for scars would be to increase the pride in playing a warrior.  All the other classes have a &quot;signature&quot; ability which gives them a certain amount of pride (druids soloing, rogues = DPS, wizards=huge nukes, shamans = dots, necros/mages=godly pets etc. ad nasuem).  But the warrior has no signature ablity other then the fact he can get whaled on by almost anything and not fall over in a single blow.  Therefore I would not give it to wizards.  I would consider giving other mellee and hybrid classes something simlilar though.  (maybe a ear to be put on a necklace for rogues, a gris gris for monks, maybe a feather or some other fetish for rangers to make arrows out of.....)<br />
