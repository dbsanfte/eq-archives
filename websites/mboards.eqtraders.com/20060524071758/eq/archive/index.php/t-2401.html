<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleem</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, I'm seeking 4 Golden Idols of Tunare to complete my PotC earrings sets for me and 2 friends.  I have 6 permafrost crystals and plenty (I think) iron oxides.  I was hoping to use iron oxides as payment for the services.  My wife is a druid so she can imbue the emeralds as needed.  I can also arrange for the clay to be enchanted if neccessary.<br />
<br />
I also need a star ruby encrusted stein.  (I was originallly only assembling 3 sets but am getting one for another friend now too)  I figured as long as I was looking up a grand master potter, I could get them to make me one of them as well.  I can lacquer the gem myself.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you can help.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />
