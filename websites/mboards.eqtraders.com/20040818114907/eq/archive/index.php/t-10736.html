Horse<br />
VoQ<br />
FT4<br />
SCM3<br />
No MP focus (forgot about it)<br />
Geerlok<br />
280 INT<br />
Spells used: Mass Enchant Gold/Platinum.<br />
<br />
Start: 10am on Saturday, skill 195, inside the JC hut not far from main PoK bank.  Money taken out of bank: 2500pp<br />
<br />
Been on and off, at times going AFK for a while, and logging a couple times for an hour or two.<br />
<br />
Finish: 3am on Sat-Sunday night, skill 250.  Money deposited back into bank: 2400pp.  :D <br />
<br />
If I had one less fail, I'd be in the plus.<br />
<br />
I began with gold+star ruby, progressing to fire emerald, then sapphire, then ruby till 207 JC.<br />
<br />
Followed by gradual progression from platinum malachite to platinum jade.  After completing a stack, I'd do next stack with a gem that was triv 6-8 above my skill. <br />
<br />
All gold/plat was enchanted, and final combines sold at ~4pp more than component costs.   A 100% successful stack got me about 85pp gain,  a 95% successful stack of plat combines would be approx 22pp loss.   I did not think to log my progress, really, but in the end I was down a measly 100pp.<br />
<br />
Then I went and made my trophy on the first attempt. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DaariAyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well this has to be a record!  well done :)  <br />
<br />
I think mine took nearly 10k from 200-250...although I was not nearly as willing to enchant the metal, so that may have helped some.</div></div><hr />

8400pp Spent<br />
Nothing enchanted<br />
200-250 in 2:45<br />
Usually 1 past next trivial rather then simply next trivial.<br />
INT was just above 200. CHA was 118<br />
Then Trophy on 3rd try.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>vovinit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">From 162-242 in 13.5 hours cost 6400 plat nothing was enchanted. Went better than I expected. Had a geerlok and stuck to the closest trivial Got a skill up on avg of 1 in 40 combines.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Unidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think he means about 3 hrs, not 3 mins, which would be a skillup every 3  mins.  That's not insanely fast if not enchanting at all, as you can do 1-2 stacks in that time at least.</div></div><hr />

Sorry,   it was frustration at the post above that prompted my post=/  I think i posted that around hour 13 in my 14hour run from 189-245... I'm not interested in a macro program, and didnt really expect anyone to post about one. I just don't see how that was possible...  sorry kahmon and nimphe,<br />
<br />
I had...<br />
wis   205<br />
int    255<br />
dex  210</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kahmon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">JC was my 3rd skill to 250. After 48 points of Misty Picknics &amp; 80 (yes 80!) points from Mino Hero Brews, doing a 2 item combine where I didn't have to leave a room was a blessing. Just click, click, click, sell, buy, repeat.</div></div><hr />
