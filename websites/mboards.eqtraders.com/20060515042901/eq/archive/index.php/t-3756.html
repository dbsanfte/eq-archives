If anyone is interested in buying these items let me know how many you want and how much you'll pay, and I'll contact you when I've acquired enough of what you want. Also willing to trade the appropriate amount of hides/cash for a Lodizal Shell Shield. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pootle</div><div class="date">02-28-2003, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kinda interested in te Ice Burrower Silk if they are not too pricey.<br />
<br />
Honestly what some people charge for components these days makes me sick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shakobex</div><div class="date">02-28-2003, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So what kind of prices are you thinking? From what I've seen market value on velium hound furs is 500pp, velium mastodon is 800pp. I typically sell these for 350pp and 650pp respectively. Ice Burrower silks are considerably harder to get, as you might imagine, but I would hunt them if the price on silks is good. They do seem to make some nice int caster stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shakobex</div><div class="date">02-28-2003, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, and for the most part it seems like the price of components is directly related to the price of what the components can make, allowing for failures, profit, and other costs. So for instance if 4 ice burrower silks made something worth 10k, and you the Uber Tailor can succeed on them one time in 3, then you might reasonably pay 2k per component set, leaving you 4k in profit per success. If the non-silk components were 100pp, then you would pay roughly 633pp per silk. <br />
<br />
But - I don't know the Uber Tailor success rate OR the sales price on the best items with each fur/silk. This is just a rough example :) <br />
<br />
Alternatively you might have people selling components for less, like me, since for me the prices I gave are &quot;good enough&quot; to make it worthwhile, and because I hate selling stuff even with the bazaar :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pootle</div><div class="date">03-02-2003, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You will probably be able to find other people willing to pay more than me.  At the moment i am really just collecting any components i can get my hands on to skill up with.<br />
<br />
What people tend to forget when deciding on what to charge for components is the thousand and thousands of plat needed just to raise skill, usually on items that dont sell.<br />

<br />
Anyhow....  give me a tell in game when you have some you want to sell...  we can talk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shakobex</div><div class="date">03-03-2003, 02:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure, sounds good to me. I currently have 17 velium hound furs for only 275pp each because I hate trading... best deal around! :) <br />
<br />
I know about the cost of tailoring. I hear ya. But like my example if you make 4kpp profit per success on an item that sells for 10k, well that's not too bad. Adjust the numbers to fit your own taste, but the point is that the components aren't really that overpriced necessarily. Also, I wouldn't be hunting WW if the pelts weren't worth at LEAST 200pp each when they drop. The XP isn't that great! <br />
