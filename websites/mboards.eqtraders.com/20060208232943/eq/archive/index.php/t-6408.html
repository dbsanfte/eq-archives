You smelled a sale and did exactly the right approach, sorry I didn't have enough to buy out your inventory.  <br />
<br />
For other people on Drinal who use up blue diamonds, this Loamdog claims he has blue diamonds stocked daily, his price was fair that he charged me, see if you can speak with him.  Normally I buy at lowest cost (don't we all) but I might make an exception in your case because of your salesmanship last night.  For someone selling tradeskill supplies, thankyou.<br />
<br />
I live in a city in RL where customer service is a VERY forgotten art, that's why I'm gettin all slobbery over this little tidbit of service.</div></div><hr />

I think that is his way of funding his own lower end tradeskills. He is a cool peep though, and pretty funny to chat with.</div></div><hr />
