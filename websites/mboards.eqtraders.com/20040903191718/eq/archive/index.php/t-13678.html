<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rendael Brigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seeing how metallic substance is 15-25k each, and the resulting armor isn't all that 'hot' (pun intended), imo, would this armor to you be worth making and selling?<br />
<br />
It doesn't have much hp but is heavy on mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Clerics, Shaman, Paladins and Possibly SK's would buy it. I know I would like a set for My Paladin but Not about to fork out the PP for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rennol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I doubt any paladins or shaman would seriously consider wearing this due to the lack of hp.  Clerics could possibly be interested in a few pieces, the breastplate and legs perhaps being the notable pieces.<br />
<br />
Metallic substances are too rare/hard to get though to be worth it really.  Armor from water is just as hard to get and hp's are much more desirable than mana at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well Looking at it from a person who is not:<br />

Elemental Flagged<br />
Vex Thal Keyed<br />
<br />
I am a 65 Paladin and would wear the Inferno armor, You are correct it is not as good as the Other Elemental Armors but it is still better than some of the items I currently have.<br />
<br />
One of my other 3 accounts is a Shaman, now on the Bot shaman I do not need tons of HP because all he does is Buff, Slow and sometimes DoT rest of the time he is sitting down so I look for the High Wis items for a Larger mana pool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sylphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">All the rangers/shamans I've talked to laugh at paying 100k for a piece of inferno or livestone chainmail -- just too expensive.  They would really prefer ornate which is usually around 50k-70k, or rarely hurricane chainmail at 15-20k.  The platemail would be even more expensive to make than chainmail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah the price is too high as I stated in my first post But if someone were to give me the items I think I would try for it and if successful would wear it proudly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Garndart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Most of the elemental is not worth it. (even on a guild level)<br />
I think my guild has about 10 pieces of elemental armor in circulation for guild use. Most of this is Earth elemental because components are alot more common than the rest and a few pieces of water elemental. Even on the scale of a time or elemental guild its 1300% faster to farm actual pop elemental drop molds then it is to try and outfit your guild in the pop elemental smithed armor. If elemental armor was worth making it would be seen atleast as much as elemental pop fletching and pottery. Those are the money makers for the guild in elemental planes and time. If you are not in time yet the only two pieces worth making are legs and bp's which take 6 tempers each on a good day of elemental farming you will have 7-8 elemental molds drop and maybe have enough temper material for 1 combine. This rareity and expense vs. ornate and or ldon bought dropped armor just makes this almost a non option. <br />
<br />
On a side note i think if they changed the recipe slightly say take the need for a temper to make the plates or rings this would help the situation of this armor greatly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, at 25k per substance, I wouldn't touch it. However, every time I see metallic substance for sale in /auc or baz, i send a tell offerring 5k for it. i have gotten 3 this way, putting me halfway to an attempt for an inferno plate bp, or one temper short for a bracer.<br />
<br />
I've made 2 of the livestone BP's, and my cleric wears one, and I sold the other for a 75kpp profit. I have to pass on 3/4 of the elemental components, because they are overpriced, but can still make a little plat when the stuff comes up cheap.<br />
<br />
Personally, at least for Clerics, I don't find the Ornate to be enough better to be worth the 200k+ the bp sells for, especially since the effect is kind of weak. My cost for my personal livestone BP was 50k. :D <br />
<br />
I plan to wear it until I finally get the points for that LDON oplate bp from north ro. Then it goes to my warrior (woot droppable gear) if it was ornate, it would go in the bag of &quot;corpse run&quot; gear I've never had occasion to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rendael Brigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I started a run with 180k. <br />
<br />
I failed a livestone plate bp.<br />
<br />
I then got enough for a chain attempt. I succeded.<br />
<br />
Just those two attempts dropped me down to 28k.<br />
<br />
I can no longer afford to buy any components. <br />
<br />
Four days trying to sell the chain and just window shoppers, no sale.<br />
<br />
I hope this wasn't a waste of time, money, and effort.</div></div><hr />

Well Looking at it from a person who is not:<br />
<br />

Vex Thal Keyed <br />
<br />
I'm a (as far as raiding content goes) basically keyless, flagless 59 paladin, and (even ignoring rec level stat reductions), most pieces would be only a marginal upgrade from Underfoot platemail.  They tend to have 2-3ac more, and a bit more +mana and a wider variety of stats.  The only major exception its the breastplate, which is significantly better.<br />
<br />
When you can get the Underfoot for less than 10kpp a piece, it seems hard to justify paying ten times more for that small degree of upgrade.<br />
<br />
Seems somewhat reminiscent of the 1492 vs 746 LDoN armors, although here the price difference is more exaggerated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, a paladin wouldn't rate mana as highly, so I could see them not being so attractive, particularly the Inferno.<br />
<br />
However, the gauntlets are significantly better than underfoot, as is the helm. True some pieces are not tons better, so its like most other armor sets, pick and choose what you need.<br />
<br />
For pally, I'd say Farwater is best, followed by Livestone/windessence, and inferno is the weakest. For a cleric, I'd say reverse the order.</div></div><hr />
