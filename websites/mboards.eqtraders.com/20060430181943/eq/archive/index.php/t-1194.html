<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gymp</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Completed the Vah Shir Quests this past weekend for 2 chars: Cleric smith and farming Necro. My plan is for the necro to farm shreiking and wailing substances and make the Humming Orbs then pass 'em to my cleric to make Shadowscream. While farming a 10 slot BP of shreiking substances a few questions poped into my head:<br />
<br />
- My Necro's smithing is only 157, the trivial listed for the Humming Orbs is 168. Anyone have data on success rates? I don't mind loosing a few things to failure provided I can skillup in the process. Should I atleast work FPlate to 168 or just eat the losses as I make Humming Orbs?<br />
<br />
- The Humming Orbs aren't listed as NODROP on the recipie page. Am I correct in assuming the final Humming Orbs are tradeable?<br />
<br />
- Anyone know how to reset the war in Hollowshade? (excluding  petitioning) I have heard rumor and hearsay that as long as the Grimlings do not control all the camps it can be player manipulated to be reset but have no clue how to do it.<br />
<br />
Any info would be greatly appreciated :)<br />
<br />
Thankee much...</div></div><hr />

I've only done 13 so far at 188 and none failed but it's no fun going back and manipulating the HS war if you let it get screwed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oogha</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 12:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure the orbs are tradeable, BUT they don't stack.  If the cleric and necro are on the same account your looking at a major headache getting the orbs transfered to do smithing, the no rent swirling shadows makes it even more of a chore.<br />
<br />
  As far as failing a few while the necro skills up...  I don't think a few fails would be any big deal, if you've got a geerlok on him you are almost at the trivial anyway so shouldnt fail many.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gymp</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 03:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info, I was having nightmares about a Gnome necro stuck with 200 humming orbs :)<br />
<br />
Think I will use up the leather padding I have on hand in one last run of FPlate before I start the Orbs just to further reduce losses.<br />
<br />
The Necro and Cleric are on separate accounts and I can 2box smith. It will be painful but not nearly as bad as if they were on the same acct.<br />
<br />
Thanks Again for the info and feedback.</div></div><hr />

The orbs are droppable, and ive only failed one out of roughly 100 with my ranger's 170 smithing skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">B_Delacroix</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 07:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I made orbs at 160 something.  Under the trivial.  Never failed one, even got a few skill ups doing it.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, my guild was in HOT.  I am kos to the dragons, so spent the 4 hours farming 100 wailing substances.  I try not to think about the fact that once I finish collecting the materials for 100 orbs, I may not even get a single skillup on the shadowscream that will come out of it.</div></div><hr />

Since I hit 250, I don't intend to ever do another shadowscream combine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kingbobb</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do exactly this, with my monk (228 smith) and beastlord (120, if I remember rightly).  The BL has tone of substance from his own questing, and even at his lower skill, succeeds more than 50%.  Since he's been collecting them since he was old enough to hunt the grimling islands in HSM, it's not really a waste or risk, and keeps me from having to store the humming orbs (indeed they are no drop) on my space resticted monk.<br />
<br />
Also, last time I checked, the DS charge the orbs carry does not consume the orbs, and the &quot;spent&quot; orbs can still be used to make shadowscream.</div></div><hr />
