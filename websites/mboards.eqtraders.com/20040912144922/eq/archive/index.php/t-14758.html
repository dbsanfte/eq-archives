<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nanndas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did large bowls until 148. I am currently doing casseroles. I also did some advanced poison vials as I had zombie skins. Currently stuck at 179 after 210 combines with no skill up... :mad: <br />
<br />
Do all my pottery in NFP as the wheel and kiln are right next to each other and the zone is real quite. Found PoK just to busy. I park my druid in JPF and he buys the patterns for the casseroles, then puts them in the shared bank.<br />
<br />
I do some vendor mining and sometimes find ceramic linings for sale..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just checked out a few things myself... If you have GoD then head to the Abysal Sea and everything you could wish for seems to be there waiting for you :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SilverfurMangycoat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In Abysmal Sea, the pottery vendors carry Crow's Brew. Its a substitute for skin/pelt for making vials. You can go all the way to 188 on it. <br />
<br />
After that, ceramic lining. Again, in Absymal, the vendor has everything you need and is parked next to the wheel.<br />
