<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brodder FoamyMugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Had a privacy site issue with zone alarm and pop up adds-- the buttons on this site and smilies counted as pop-up adds...who'd have thought.<br />
<br />
Took me long enough to figure it out .<br />
 Well lotsa ale anyways...figured it evened out in long run.<br />
<br />
Can someone link me on what was dropped off at last fan faire on Brodder's Revenge, Lewena's quest too??<br />
<br />
 And Can yall petition for Brodder to be a legendary demi-god or god of brewing (for tradeskillers in EQ2) since Brell's supposedly gone in that game?<br />
<br />
 I can't see how Dwarfs would let that happen.<br />
<br />
 Losing Kaladim? Well yes... that I can since I know the true story to the one armed dwarf who killed the dragon that used to live in kaladim's caves before the dwarfs took it over...<br />
 Let's say that dragon ahd an extremely extremely long respawn time (WINK).<br />
<br />
 Once I get info from yall on fan faire and NPC goes in for LEWENA and proper clues  I might drop off the recovered sections of the emails with dan enright on Dah Brodder's revenge, Ogre Chili Pie, Nagafen/Dragon Chili, and how to make hotsauce....<br />
:rolleyes: :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
To the best of my knowledge, all that came out of the Fan Faire regarding Lewena was that they'd be adding an NPC with a clue to the game -- though they could just be adding the clue to an existing NPC, I suppose.  Be that as it may, I haven't heard anything about what the nature of the clue is.<br />
<br />
Again, to the best of my knowledge, nothing at all was said specifically about Brodder's Revenge.<br />
<br />
Having said that, I wasn't at the Fan Faire.  I did eagerly read all the FF reports I could get my hands on.<br />
<br />
Here's a link to the Denmom's message regarding the Lewena clue NPC:<br />

Oh, and welcome back! :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Gods are gone per se, but merely silent.  I'll let you know more as we find out more in the Everquest 2 community forums I frequent (or as we're able to beat/bribe/intimidate it out of Moorgard).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brodder FoamyMugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ask Moorgard what he knows about Brodder...<br />
 If it's nothing, educate him and get him drunk...<br />
<br />
 One way or another we'll have our Brodder's Revenge!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kandrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ye know, I be wondering that Brell not be in the game because he be wanderin' the world testin' fine ales. There be precident fer Dwarven gods wanderin' hither and yon, ye know! Take Reorx ferinstance. He be makin all sorts o' pretty things in the guise of a dwarf, wanderin' from place to place havin' adventures and such like... And who else would Brell be but a mug swingin' cleric, to be healin' the woes o' them what overimbibe his concoctions. An' to be sure he do call himself the 'Beer God'. 'Tis somethin' to ponder...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ranguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Brodder says we missed something, so I did a search on &quot;Brodder&quot; and am reading through his translated journals now. Some interesting things I've noticed...In Part 3, he mentions something about the halflings and high elves knowing how to make &quot;aged oaken casks&quot; This may help with the Hot Sauce we're looking at OR could be what is needed for Brodder's Revenge (final combine). For the references to halflings, dwarves, and the &quot;never looking down except on others&quot; possibly Underfoot Mushrooms OR Underfoot Brown, sounds feasible to me. As to the Ogre clue, he mentions &quot;what's with Ogre's and Vinegar&quot; so Vinegar is definately the Ogre component. Trying all kinds of variations on my GM Brewer using all the different containers...Oven, Mixing Bowl, Brew Barrel. Bags are completely full of different things I've collected...was thinking MAYBE a Coldain Heater (shotglass graphic, sounds like a type of whiskey or vodka to me) would work, but I have to make some...will give em a try after work tomorrow, GL anyone who gives it a shot :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thicket Tundrabog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">'Aged Oaken Casks'... Maybe involves foraged and ground spawn oak bark?<br />
<br />
As an aside, in some homemade wine recipes, oak chips are added during fermentation to give the wine an 'aged in oak cask' taste.<br />
<br />
Thicket</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
ok correct me if i'm wrong but wouldn't the looking down part be a reference to high elves? they are considered to be the nobles of the elven raes and are even lsited by SOE as looking down their noses to other races, even other elves<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: forgot to ask. you said you found the link with the journals. cna you link them for everyone so we cna find them more easily?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ugh, not another use for morning dew, PLEASE! LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ranguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Here's the link for his diaries, Brodder's Diaries (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=21&amp;highlight=Brodder)  should help with &quot;getting back to basics&quot; He says we're thinking too deep into what he says and that we get close and then pass right by the recipe, so it's gotta be in here.<br />
<br />
Based on what's been said, Hot Sauce is in the game, and we should experiment with the peppers. Gonna make a list of what I've gathered.<br />
<br />
1. The recipe he lists for Brodder's Revenge from an old post is: Short Beer, Whiskey, Spices, Snake Eggs, Veggies, and a Cask. NOTE: He also said it might be a different egg and a different beer. From this thread: Brodder's Revenge (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?threadid=4029&amp;perpage=25&amp;highlight=Brodder&amp;pagenumber=2) <br />
2. We should experiment with the peppers. (From the summarized thread) Observation 3: We don't have even a partial recipe for Brodder's Revenge, other than what Brodder himself has posted here. In his original posts, he just says his recipe may have been too risque as he envisioned it.  not true, you've what's in the diaries, and in previous parts of this thread. Note it may be a pepper (hot), or a pepper sauce (tobasco) instead of spices since something similar came about in Luclin neh? Not saying it is, but there could be such a chance of it being true... <br />
3. No Jumjum.<br />
4. There are subcombines.<br />
5. He's enjoying watching us squirm. :)<br />
From some his more recent postings...<br />
Lil late late late night clue...<br />
<br />
If I wouldn't eat it I'd not be to likely to drink it.<br />
Dwarfs are not cannibals.<br />
We do like pretzels, fried root chips covered in dried sea salt and spices, and a good meat pie...<br />
<br />
So you can right out cut out stuff that's not in me original recipes or that I'd find distasteful as a big clue.<br />
<br />
Oh okay I drank boot beer and skunk breath ale...but that was for the Mithril Mug o'Brell and flag of Kaladim and all that...you know brewing posterity!<br />
<br />
Several of you seem to be right on track, then stop short...remember there can be subcombines and there can be upto 10 ingredients ala Minotaur hero brews...<br />
But it may not be that many...or it may...<br />
And more from later...<br />
Yall are doing fine...but if ye get wayway way off base, I'll clear it up...<br />
DER's No Jumjum...<br />
Der are subcombines- not necessarily in same skill set.<br />
INgredients are common.<br />
If it's a part of another humanoid, I wouldn't eat or drink it...<br />
Ahm a dwarf ****it.<br />
Skull ale if ye remember was a legend I'd heard of...and used brains of their enemies, but since brains were in short supply in Oggok...well the skull alone was used.<br />
<br />
It's likely more then just 4 ingredients... see my other hints<br />
too for more info.<br />
Some of this is based off rebuilt notes...BUT know this SOE can and has changed recipes of mine before and quests...<br />
<br />
Trick is to get lewena talking. She knows I'm sure.  <br />
After that it's not gonna be too tough.<br />
<br />
Off to try some combines while I have ideas in my head.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Someone mentioned in the thread in the Baking forum that it could be Chagra Spices (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=8362&amp;menustr=035000000000) since it's a spice, from Luclin, and has no known tradeskill use yet... I can't forage it, but someone should take a look at it.</div></div><hr />
