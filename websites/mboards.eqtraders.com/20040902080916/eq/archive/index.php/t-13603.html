<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zelerific</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any suggested zones to hunt for the following research items?  This is for LoY DE robes.<br />
<br />
Words of Abrogation<br />
Words of Burnishing<br />
Rune of Ellipse<br />
Rune of Cyclone<br />
Wing of Xegony<br />
Yaeth's Compendium page 73 (right)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>drtyaty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would suggest you do not even view this one as an option.<br />
<br />
Page 73 (r) is a component for Remove Greater Curse.  So, even if you see one, noone will have it for sale at a reasonable price; no guild will likely give it to you; and, you would be far better selling the spell for mucho dineros.<br />
<br />
FYI though, it does drop in CT and supposedly in PoM by the jesters at the castle entrance.  The spell or the page is also rumered to drop off a mob in a hard LDoN dungeon crawl (not sure which one).<br />
<br />
I have been destroying lots of Wing of Xegony while hunting for velium in cc I think, although I am not 100% positive; it was that or DL while playing my alt.  I guess I will hold onto them from now on.<br />
<br />
The bazaar is by far and away the best place to get compoents though.  However, if you buy off of merchants I suggest you set a price limit and not buy any pages above that limit; then, everyone who puts the page up for sale in the bazaar will put in at or below your price.  I often times will also leave one in the bazaar at a very low price and send tells to all other traders who have that item for sale asking if they can lower to the lowest price in the bazaar, which they usually will gladly do.<br />
<br />
Vendor diving is also a very good way to pick up components.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Centuri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I make and sell swatches for LoY robes.  It's not bad pp, I dont charge outrageously and the tailors are usually thrilled.  I can always tell when someone's skilling up, they suddenly start buying up All my stock of a certain race's swatches.  :D<br />
<br />
Vendor diving is my friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yirr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tell me about it :)<br />
<br />
Centibank was always good to me.<br />
<br />
I would recommend doing as previously mention, set a price and buy only when in your price range. Keep an eye on the prices for a week or so to get a general idea on price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i'd suggest also checking the Research forum to read the threads asking the same questions there.</div></div><hr />
