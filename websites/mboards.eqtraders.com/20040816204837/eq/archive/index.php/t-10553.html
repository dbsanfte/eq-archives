<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vegetoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hi i am 65th rng on rallos and im curently at 207 fletching and been farmin so much acrylia /sigh ive done like 500+ combines and yesterday i did 50 and not one skillup with 255 wis :p wtf am i doing wrong? <br />
<br />
ps im poor so bows are out fo the question atm!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">nothing is wrong.  when you hit 200 combines without skillup feel abused.  until then it looks like averaging 25ish combines per skillup is good.  that is average as in 2 or 3 in one stack and 80 with one.  good luck.  if you think acrylia is hard to get for fletching you should read the tailoring board or blacksmithing.  acrylia arrows are nice though.  what is your diety.  for an excessive amount of money you might could go the cultural route.  its not as expensive as bows i here but still pricey.  just good luck.<br />
<br />
EDIT if you did all 550 without a skillups /cry for you.  that is the most i've heard of.  if you only had yesterday's run of 50 without skillup then the above is true.  not sure how to read that for sure.</div></div><hr />
