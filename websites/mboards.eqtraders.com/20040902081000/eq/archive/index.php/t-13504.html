<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wanted to make a bow for a Paladin (gnome) that I am making to play with my wife's newbie toon(see thread in ooc chat).  I was thinking the blessed gale compound bow, as I could make it, or presuming I could because it is not wood-elf culural.  It is a nice bow, and would be great for this guy.  Well, it is Karana only.  I have to worship Brell as a gnome pally.  All the other bows that can be made with stats are almost all Karana only, or have such a high required level on them.  Is there a good bow, with stats preferably, that I could get/make for him?  There are other recipies I could try, fletching is around 180ish, but, looking for the stats.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There were cultural bows introduced for Tunare first it was months (maybe years) until the Karana ones were introduced. I think this was mainly because rangers are either Tunare or Karana. While other classes can use bows the cultural was really focusing on them. There are some all diety bows that can be bought out there but few that are made are any good.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Karana rocks anyway thats why he isn't killed :) GO KARANA!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hehe.  because there were a lot of tunare worshippers with nice bows.  since karana is the other big ranger god they implemented deity fletching for him.  almost all stat bows are tunare, karana, or pop.  sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bleah.... that's what i thought.  I guess I am going to have to shell out a few pp and go to the bazaar and buy a mob dropped one, if any are for sale.<br />
<br />
Thanks, though.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
p.s.  My druid thinks Karana rocks too :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mahlig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">errr...I know this is tradeskiller site, but as a newbie weapon, you should get a shissar bow.  You can probably get one for 100pp or so.  No stats, but something like 20/35.  Better than any bow you can make (I think) and has no minimum level.  Yeah, they are gonna take my fletching liscense, but it really is a great bow for low level characters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hehe sok.  i will look for that for my wood elf tunare ranger.  :)  i like using my bow.  its just like casting spells except you can move.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vallorean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The one thing that burns me a little on these 'deity' fletched bows is that:<br />
1 - For a Tunare fletched bow, you need to be a Wood-Elf(worshiping Karana, you could still make the bows...just can't use them)<br />
2 - For a Karana fletched bow, you need to worship Karana(race doesn't matter here)<br />
<br />
Any good Tunare worshiping Half-Elf will tell you there is a gap in this system.<br />
<br />
Oh, well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hehe many cried fowl on day one.  really i think it should have been added to wood cultural like human smiths have different imbues for different diety armors.  <br />
<br />
this would be the perfect way to implement for sol ro however.  only frog wizard can't worship ro.  all other wizards can.  so expected something for ro by now though.  :boggled:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cherryflavour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aye unfortunately, half Elves have no cultural tradeskilling capablities at all,a nd its' part of the price they pay, but they can still use non cultural bows, or non-deity cultural bows (if there are any?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, but Half Elves get a wider range of armor they can wear as a trade-off for not having cultural.<br />
<br />
As for why there are Karana and Tunare only bows (and arrows, as well).....<br />
<br />
Its because Rangers are uber-archers, and Pallys, Rogues, SKs and Warriors aren't. <br />
<br />
I've got a lvl 14 Karana worshipping Ranger (He's a Halfling), but he won't be getting a Karana bow anytime soon. I don't think there are any Fletchers on The Rathe who sell them or the arrows in the Bazaar, and I'm not going to level up Oakenthorn's Blacksmithing just so he can make them. (He's using a Compound Steelshaft Bow, with a Trueshot in the bank as a backup in case he needs to make a corpse run)</div></div><hr />

Not to drive this issue into the ground like flogging a dead horse, but the whole &quot;Half-Elf/cultural&quot; thing is not the arguement any more.  It use to be when the original &quot;Wood Elf cultural&quot; fletching came out...I didn't have a hugh problem with that.  The issue now is that SOE decided to by-pass the &quot;cultural&quot; theme on this latest fletching upgrade.  Sure, it's a &quot;Surefall Fletching Kit&quot; but only by name...no cultural attachment to it really.  This is a Deity based fletching ability/skill.<br />
<br />
So, the arguement is that if SOE is going to insert a Deity based fletching (Karana), why not open it for Tunare worshippers (ie - any Tunare worshipper, not just Wood Elves).<br />
<br />
OR, keep the &quot;cultural&quot; theme and have it that if you were &quot;born&quot; in Surefall Glade, you now get/have it's culture.<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />

I thought wood elves were restricted to tunare?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I seem to recall that the rarely seen Wood Elf Warrior can worship Karana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PS I think they made the Karana fletching Diety, not race  is thata there are 2 karana ranger races,  Human and Halfling, and they did not want to put in a whole  other set of  fletching recipes.<br />
<br />
I do not think you will ever see 1/2 elf  being anything ever ever close to a cutural (ie diety based  quasi cultural)  that is part of  the race, you get the widest  choice of what you can wear/use,  but have no ability to make.<br />
<br />
Feel the same about Iksars and their cutural smithing it doesexist, but why?  not like anyone would wear it even when it came out.<br />
<br />
Dai</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yep.  It is diety restricted and I can make them with my druid.  However, the problem lies in the fact that my gnome pally can't use them even if I did make them.  But, I bought a nice bow in the bazaar for 200pp, for which the bow staff itself costs 262pp.  I believe it is 46 delay, 22 damage.  Now to make him some arrows.</div></div><hr />

1) You can still lump the other Karana rangers into this(Half-Elf).<br />
2) You could be a Karana druid(or other Karana class) and fletch this stuff if you wanted, just can't use(as a druid or other non-bow class).<br />
<br />
I think that is what SOE was shooting for this as a Karana Ranger thing too, but they just created a gap in the fletching for Tunare Half-Elf Rangers (you could say Tunare Human Rangers too).<br />
<br />
Ranger race and worship and extended fletching skill:<br />
<br />
  Race   -   Deity          -   Extended Fletching<br />
--------   ----------------   --------------------------------------------------<br />
Wood Elf - Tunare           - Wood Elf cultural fletching (mithril)<br />
Half-Elf - Tunare or Karana - Karana deity fletching, Tunare worshippers screwed<br />
Halfling - Karana           - Karana deity fletching<br />
Human    - Tunare or Karana - Karana deity fletching, Tunare worshippers screwed (possibly other Human cultural skills)<br />
<br />
Updated with Tinile's added info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Wood elf rangers and druids can only worship Tunare.  The other wood elf choices: warrior, bard and rogue have many choices of gods, including Karana.<br />
<br />
Wood elf Rogue can be: Agnostic, Bristlebane, Karana, Tunare<br />
Wood elf Warrior can be: Agnostic, Karana, Tunare, Rallos Zek<br />
Wood elf Bards can worship almost anyone: Agnostic, Bristlebane, Karana, Erollisi Marr, Mithaniel Marr, Rodcet Nife, Prexus, Quellious, Solusek Ro, Brell Serilis, The Tribunal, Tunare, Veeshan, Rallos Zek.<br />
<br />
Human Rangers can be: Karana or Tunare<br />
Half elf Rangers can be: Karana or Tunare<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The way I see it, there's a good reason why Half Elves don't have cultural: They're half-breeds, not a true race.<br />
<br />
If Half-Elves ever got cultural, logically the quality should be half-way between that of Human and Wood Elf cultural items, meaning no one would want them.<br />
<br />
Bards are the only class who can choose to worship Veeshan, right?</div></div><hr />

 I agree with you Zyrtryx, but cultural fletching isn't the argument...it is deity fletching.<br />
<br />
Why did SOE decide to insert deity based fletching(ie - Karana)?<br />
<br />
You can't really say that Tunare deity based fletching is already in place...that is the Wood Elf cultural fletching.<br />
<br />
As far as EQ &quot;Lore&quot; goes, Rangers are the masters of archery.  (Geez, as I type this, I realize this is a poor argument in general too...since Rangers are the masters of archery doesn't mean they are the masters of bow crafting:p ) SOE has now established a gap in the Ranger bow crafting capablility.  I was ok with the strickness in the &quot;cultural&quot; fletching for just the Wood Elf race, but the introduction of the Karana deity based fletching has changed things.  Now, Tunare Human and Half-Elf Rangers do not have an &quot;Extended Fletching&quot; capabilities to work with.<br />
<br />
It's not a cultural issue (as many have argued in the passed).</div></div><hr />
