<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KyrosKrane</div><div class="date">03-12-2003, 05:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Recently, the DenMom posted a challenge to all tradeskillers suggesting that we organize and figure out what the priorities should be in &quot;fixing&quot; tradeskills.  This is a huge and daunting task any way you slice it.<br />
<br />
I'd like to take a first stab at this.<br />
<br />
I'm developing a form that will allow you to input a BRIEF summary of a problem.  Eventually, I will go through and collate all the submissions into a list that can be voted on.  When all is said and done, I will post the results here and send them in to Sony for consideration.<br />
<br />
I have no pretentions that this list will be comprehensive.  I have no belief that Sony will even look at the results, let alone act on them.  I am merely doing this because I feel it would be useful for all of us, and as a kind of tribute to the DenMom's efforts.<br />
<br />
Currently, I'm designing the input form.  I'd appreciate it if you could take a look at the page and give me feedback about the design of the form and the questions.  I am NOT yet looking for any feedback about specific issues; those are what the form is for.  :)  <br />
<br />
You can find the form here:<br />
http://www12.brinkster.com/kyroskrane/Survey/<br />
<br />
Do you feel that the questions I'm asking are enough to summarize a problem without any ranting?  Are the instructions on the page clear enough?  Would you add or remove any questions, or options to the drop-down box?  Any comments and suggestions would be welcome.   You can post comments here or email me at the address on the page.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The form looks great and is definitely in a format that forces people to think beyond the immediate benefit to them in having the change occur.<br />
<br />
(Was that a grammatically correct sentence?)<br />
<br />
Let me try again....<br />
<br />
Looks good.  Makes people think.  Kudos to you.  /cheer Kyros.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morani</div><div class="date">03-13-2003, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only suggestions I can think of is:<br />
<br />
1) To remove the part &quot;(No limit, but please keep it brief.)&quot; Let the verbose people think about trying to word things within the limit that was already set and discover that what they typed is accepted. It'll do more to encourage them to keep it brief than asking them to but saying that they can get away without it.<br />
<br />
2) To add an &quot;other&quot; category. Invariably someone will not know where to place a comment/idea or will have one you never thought of. I.E. if I want to address Tradeskills AAs there is no category.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, it looks hopeful.  :)</div></div><hr />

However, work has picked up for me and reduced a lot of the time I was spending on coding it.  It should be ready in a week or two.<br />
<br />
Keep the suggestions rolling in!  So far I've received some great tips; many thanks to all who contributed!</div></div><hr />
