<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Padwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Missing on Xev, Sunday Noon PST.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Normbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He's gone on Tholuxe Paells too, as of Sunday Afternoon.  I'm sure it's because they're adjusting the prices on Steel Ore</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">About time,  Im tired of going there to make a coupla bows and seeing someone with some macro or script making steel fletches and selling them for cash,  got tired of having to report them to GMs.  As a funny side not if you tossed a bunch of crap in the forge their scripts couldnt deal with it,  was nice to see them just sitting there for an hour or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hotten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Is too bad for those of us doing it by hand though.  It was nice to have an alternative to farming mobs, and it was still work :(.<br />
<br />
Ah, well, back to fighting for spawns to fund my crafting habits.  BTW, the steel bricks left in my inventory on camping were converted into a single small piece of ore, so the recipie itself may be on hold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">- NPC Merchants will now pay less for Steel Hunter Arrows, Steel Arrowshafts, and Steel Fletch.<br />
<br />
Anyone know how much platinum it was able to generate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Normbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I stumbled onto this when I decided to use the Steel Arrowheads to get my Smithing up to 188 (I was at 135 at the time).  I figured I'd save whatever I made and then make a comparable number of shafts and Fletches and work my Fletching up from there.<br />
<br />
I took about 1500pp into Surefall and started working.  I noticed that someone else was using the forge, so I alternated with him figuring he was doing the same as me.  By the time I ran out of money I had quite a few Arrowheads and a skill of 171.  I was just going to go get more money to finish off the trivial, but I decided to see what the vendor's buyback was.<br />
<br />
All prices are rounded. Each small steel brick cost 6.2 pp and the buyback price on the Arrowheads was 4.75 pp per.  With the recipe making 2 Arrowheads, you could make 3.3 pp on a successful combine.<br />
<br />
I probably made about 1.5 Kpp getting those last 17 points in Smithing.  It sure was nice to be able to skill up and make money at the same time.  It was also nice being able to use the 16 stacks of leather padding I had accumulated (to do Fine Plate) for something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hotten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was typically able to make 800 plat per hour on a relatively fast computer, somewhat less on a slower computer just due to the number of clicks required, and separating a single item from a stack seems to take a bit longer.  Please keep in mind, this was by hand, and clicking like mad.  Could usually only do it for a few hours before my old shoulder started acting up.  I'd imagine a bot could go significantly faster.<br />
<br />
Checked today, the arrow heads now sell back at around 2 plat each, for a net loss of a little over 2 plat per combine.  The combine is still trivial at 188 (edit: not sure if the actual trivial has been reduced or not, but it's trival at 188 :).</div></div><hr />
