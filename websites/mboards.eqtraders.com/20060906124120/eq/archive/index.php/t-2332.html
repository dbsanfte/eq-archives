<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vile</div><div class="date">01-16-2003, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK I know all the Velious gear trivials at &gt;250 but could any 240 (with geerlok and 250 tailors ) give me an idea of the % I can expect to make ?<br />
<br />
I have just had a VERY depressing run and want to know if it gets significantly better.<br />
<br />
My run - starting skill 228 (real - 239 effective with GM needle)<br />
<br />
1 Ice silk robe - fail (yes I was pissed off )<br />
1 Velium Mastadon Fur Cloak - fail BAH !<br />
1 Haze Panther Sleeves - fail :(<br />
110 Arctic Wyvern Masks - 12 Success ( yes just over 10% ) + 1 skill up<br />
8 Othimir caps - 7 made !<br />
8 Black Panther items - 1 success BAH<br />
10 Solstice robes - 2 success<br />
<br />
As you can see my overall sucess on these &gt;250 items was around 15%. Please please please tell me my success with dramatically improve VERY soon. Or was this just a really bad run ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teyvan</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 12:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">...is 50/50, though you will have runs of both fails and successes.  I just cross my fingers when I'm making something I plan to wear.<br />
<br />
Sucks?  Yes, but until they implement a skill focus AA for trades other than JC we're stuck here...<br />
<br />
See you online...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Narith</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 03:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have noticed that the furs suceed alot more than the leathers. I ran 0/10 on black panther leggings but 9/10 on othmir fur hats. They both trivial above 250, but leathers must either trivial higher or just have an overall lower sucess rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ilona</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 05:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 223 plus geerlok I tend to get about 80% success on othmir furs, 1/3 - 1/4 on average on velious leathers, and too many for comfort on solstice robes (I now remove my geerlok when making them for skillups).<br />
<br />
I haven't yet tried ice silk, but I hope to succeed on the one robe I have ingredients for. *crosses fingers*<br />
<br />
Of course, now I've posted this I'm sure I'll go back to 1/20 success rates on everything!  :D</div></div><hr />

Success rates at maximum tailoring skill of arctic wyvern, cobalt drake, tigeraptor and black panther is about 50% BUT it varies with the item you are making. For example, tunics and cloaks have a lower success rate, masks and gorgets have a higher success rate. Data coming soon.<br />
