<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cubwynn</div><div class="date">01-23-2003, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I spend a lot of time and plat on tradeskills, whether by making items, helping others with their tradeskill goals, and farming/camping tradeskill ingredients. I have come to the conclusion that I'll never be able to ugrade my equipment to more level-appropriate items unless I stop and focus on just doing that for a while. I'm going to miss my friends, the Combine button and the RNG. -(<br />
<br />
Has anyone else had trouble funding themselves, and had to stop tradeskilling as a result? What did you do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username"></div><div class="date">01-23-2003, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got the opposite problem...<br />
<br />
I tradeskill for funds, and exp to avoid going insane from clicking.<br />
<br />
In groups I am much kinder than I used to be, opting out of rolls on most everything that drops in DL because I know I can make money brewing.<br />
<br />
Right now I am 2 items away from a Solstice Earring (fishing pole and mistletoe sickle)... so I am brewing to afford it, once I have it I may go back to getting exp for a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope.  My current money making technique is to strip mine vendors and use the stuff I can (baking mostly) and sell the rest (tailoring mostly). Given that SH (was) a bit lax about selling stuff to and leaving stuff on vendors, I made a killing, selling stacks of razorfiend claws, war wraith blood, putrid slime, midnight stones, velium hound fur, arctic wyvern hides, othmir fur, somewhere on the order of 15 gazillion bricks/pieces/blocks or velium (repeat after me: friends don't let friends hunt velks) as well as 4 stacks of padding (which I don't have the heart to sell or the stomach to use) and other non-tradeskill related items like coterie general boots, giant scalemail arms (3wis) and legs (3int), shimmering terrorhide cloaks and so forth.<br />
<br />
Given the killing I've made, there were about 5 people checking vendors last night after the reset.  Time to find a new market I suppose.  Manavials are selling fast and furious (and a 450pp each moving a stack of distilled mana last night was some cash).<br />
<br />
I do, however, spend more time identifying and stripping vendors than I do tradeskilling or exping (though through recovered quest items and turn ins my enchanter did levels 25-29, most of 33, 38 and 42 - dinged 43 last night on a handin - from vendors as well as taking the time to get JC to 245).<br />
<br />
Like anything else, moderation is the key.  I have to discipline myself to take exp nights and practice grouping (important for an enchanter - I'm still pretty stinky at locking down multiples) instead of checking 3rd and 4th tier vendors, &quot;just in case.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Some people simply don't realize the benefit of spending a short time acutioning stuff...<br />
<br />
Oh well...<br />
<br />
Damn, velium hound fur on a vendor?  Cripes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EVERYWHERE<br />
<br />
<br />
I have found blue diamonds on a newbie vendor, when I created a DE Shadow Knight to explore.  (Needless to say, my enchanter made his first trip to Neriak that day).  The same merchant had a nightmarewood sap, and 2 hobgobline meat.<br />
<br />
If you arent mining the bazaar and PoK, then give up.  You can't be a serious miner without them.  <br />
<br />
I find Shadow Haven is VERY nice. The merchants near the the Nexus and Bazaar zonelines sometimes have decent stuff.<br />
<br />
I have found weird pop loot in Rivervale, Freeport, Neriak, WC.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anywhere where a wizard or druid can go, loot will be dumped.  Anywhere where it is EASY to unload loot, loot will be dumped.<br />
Anywhere people are going anyway, (Class Trainers,etc..) loot will be dumped.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So vendor diving is a lifestyle. It is a passion.  It is not something where I can check one &quot;PH4T LEWT&quot; merchant, find my good stuff, and be done.<br />

<br />
Go away or I shall taunt you a second time :P<br />
<br />
Think like someone coming back from a hunt.  Where would you sell goods that's most convenient?  If you want to pick up stuff for geerloks (the PC drops anyway), check the JC vendors next to the bazaar zone in shadowhaven. The ones that are visible as you are walking back from PC (closest to baz zone and not in building) are the first visible merchants walking from PC to Baz and always have PC drops.<br />
<br />
Basically, you need to check every vendor once (preferably just before a patch when the server has been up a while) to get the places people sell.  Then hit them as often as you can to get what's there after the patch.  I take 2kpp with me for a merchant run and have needed to restock cash sometimes.</div></div><hr />

Too many secrets disclosed there Citizen.  We're sending the black helicopters now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for advice check each vender to see whats there and keep notes or something and then hit them as you need that item. :idea:  :idea:</div></div><hr />

It will be processed and used accordingly. No cows will be harmed as a result of this inquiry. Have a nice day and ignore the black silent helicopters in the sky.<br />
