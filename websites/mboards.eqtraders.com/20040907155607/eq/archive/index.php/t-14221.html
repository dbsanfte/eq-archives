<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>aaer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Although I successfully created Beer-Battered Cragbeast/Hynid Pies, they couldn't be learned. All other Beer-Battered Cragbeast/Hynid recepies can be learned. Can someone confirm if this is the same for Beer-Battered Crab/Tuna Pies?<br />
<br />
If you attempt any of theese recepies, please help narrow down the trivials the old fashioned way.<br />
<br />
Considering they are very similar in stats to Beer-Battered Cragbeast/Hynid Souffles, my guess is they trivial at or around 252.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Remember,<br />
<br />
Due to the sheer volume of tradeskill recipes to go through, they're not done adding things to the autolearn, and the learnable tables...<br />
<br />
Hopefully these will get added soon eh?</div></div><hr />

I 'learned' each of these .. but have had problems 'forgetting' a lot of recipes.  I will check after THIS patch and see if these 4 are still in my recipie book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All 4 recipes survied the patch and are still in my recipe book (aka learned recipe list)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Elinea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Are you opening an Oven when you look at your list? Each container will give you recipes that can only be combined in it. Pies are the only product in GoD baking (so far anyway) that can only be made in an oven, and not a spit or collapsible.<br />
<br />
Check the list when you open an oven and you will see that the pies are there.</div></div><hr />
