<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>unstabl13</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where is the best place to fish if one would like to make some plat by selling his goods in the bazaar ? Aside from tier 2 planes .. not flagged yet..<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">not sure if you can get to pos but storm salmon will sell well to up and coming bakers.  with foraged bread crumbs they take you to 212 or so i think.  <br />
<br />
cobalt cod are good to but obviously non-planar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lixivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">cod  from CS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are a number of things you can do for money with your fishing skill.  Try these:<br />
<br />
Cobalt Cod: Fish these in Cobalt Scar.  Velious tailoring requires the cod oil, so they sell as is, or if you have some skill at brewing, make them into cod oil and sell it directly.<br />
<br />
Nightmare Cichlid: the Plane of Nightmare is first tier, so assuming you're level 46 you can access it.  Get someone familiar with the plane to show you the docks area, or get a good map, then take an invisible trip to fish.<br />
<br />
Wulf Fish: Fish these in Karnor's Castle.  &quot;But why?&quot; you may ask.  The reason is that these are the easiest fish to catch that produce high quaity fish bones when you prepare them.  The use for high quailty fish bones is to fletchers, who can use them to produce whittled fishbone darts, which are a thrown weapon with a range of 250, so monks, bards and beastmasters can realistically use them for pulling.  This takes knowledge, access to a fletcher and some salesmanship, but when you get some folks sold, you can make quite a bit of money. on it.  Also, you can use regular fish bones for these as well, for range 225 darts.<br />
<br />
Zone Essence Fish/Tradeskill Fish: Several zone essences come from fish, like Clockwork ssence and Butcherblock essence, and many items needed for specialized tradeskills can be pulled in on your line.  Look them up on the list and fish them up for your favorite tradeskillers.  Not good sellers (although a stack of these fish or other thingies on a trader will move eventually), but if you do it on order for guildmates or the general public, you can earn some money.<br />
<br />
I hope that helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also, if you're low level and non-evil, find out what people are willing to pay for Saltwater Seaweed on your server. If its a decent amount, take a trip to Ocean of Tears and hit Zachariah's island (if you're coming by boat from Butcherblock) or Sister Isle (if you're using a translocator or taking the boat from Freeport). Both places sell fishing rods (if you don't have a Fisherman's Companion) and bait, and Zachariah's island also has a vendor who sells hooks and tackleboxes.<br />
<br />
(Take a skinning knife with you, and a tacklebox if you can't get to Zachariah's island - you can use the knife and tacklebox to make 5 bait out of each Gunthak Mackerel you catch)</div></div><hr />
