I put in both the cost to buy the left overs, and the price to sell them back to merchants.  You can adjust the cost to raise JC from 0 to 250 by either figure, if you wish.  It's your choice.<br />

The rubies were eventually used to make my trophy, which took three tries.<br />
<br />
Blue diamond jewelry kept: <br />
<br />
  3 Silver Blue Diamond Ring<br />
  4 Blue Diamond Electrum Earring<br />
  3 Golden Blue Diamond Pendant<br />
<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
<br />
I did not include the cost of the blue diamonds above because I did not plan on selling them, and I already had them in the bank.  I had one failure making the pendant.  All other blue diamond combines were successful.  The costs of the bars used to make the blue diamond jewelry is included above, so I separated the bars and blue diamond costs and prices below, so you can make further adjustments to the cost stated above if you wish.<br />

My INT was 255 most of the time when I was skilling up.  Sometimes it would drop to 246 when my Brilliance buff faded and I failed to notice it immediately, but when that happened, it was not for many combines.<br />
<br />
I did unenchanted silver jewelry up to Wolf's Eye Agate, then all jewelry made after that, starting with silver jade was using enchanted bars.<br />
<br />
I wrote two perl scripts to read the log file to generate the lists of items bought and sold.  If anyone wants the perl scripts, I can post them.</div></div><hr />

Edit:<br />
<br />
When I did the above combines, I was supposed to be working on non-enchanted silver carnelian, but after reviewing my logs, I realize that I did the combines on silver and jasper.  During the time I was doing the combines, I failed to notice the trivial message twice above.<br />

There are a number of companies that will give you free space for posting images, or perhaps your ISP already does.  Check to see if you have any web-space, and if so, see the manual or help section for information about posting the files.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doesn't really speak for the notion that skillups are more likely on success.  And, with 2421 combines, that's a pretty good run.<br />
<br />
Although, didn't we recently hear that you need a sample size of about 1 billion to get even distribution from EQ's RNG?</div></div><hr />

Yes, I beleive my ISP does offer some free web-space.  I tried to register, but every time I enter the account managment web page, it crashes my browser, so I have not been able to register.<br />

In the meantime, I suppose that if anyone wants a copy of the plots, they can PM me with their e-mail address, and I will send a copy of the the plots.  I check in here on a fairly regular basis, so it should not be too long before I notice a PM sent to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is an amazing amount of info, and really helpful for those of us thinking of getting into the jewelry business.  Congrats on 250!<br />
<br />
I was wondering if you remember or have recorded what your lowest point of cash reserves was.  Did you need all of that 10,000 platinum at a particular point, or did it hover above a certain number the whole time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>jawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I don't remember what my lowest point in cash reserves were, but one thing I did is buy 5 stacks of Gold Bars and 3 stacks of Platinum Bars right at the beginning.  The reason is because I read that is was difficult to impossible to keep up with enchanting them while working on them.  I had planned on doing non-enchanted silver up to Wolf's Eye Agate, so I used the time early on to get ahead on enchanting the gold and platinum.  The other thing I did was buy a stack of each kind of gem from Malachite up to Topaz.<br />
<br />
You don't have to have 10,000 all that much as long as you can handle buying a stack of platinum at a time, which is 2099.980, and to keep a reasonable supply of gems on hand, to avoid the constant right-clicking a merchant to transact purchases and sales.  I am pretty sure you can do it with a starting capital of 5,000.<br />
<br />
So with my purchase of 5 stacks of Gold Bars and 3 stacks of Platinum Bars, I spent 7349.840 up front just on some of the more expensive bars.  The amount spent on the stack of each gem from Malachite to Topaz was 537.520.  I think I also bought some Electrum Bars up front too, and of course, Silver Bars because that is what I started using right away.</div></div><hr />

I appreciate your guide and advice.. but Im adding up your failures on platinum bars.. platinum sells for around 100ish, and you have about 58 platinum failures, which itself is 5800pp, so that right there shows me that you must have gotten outside money or something.. and thats not counting expensive gold + gems.. or other ones..  <br />
<br />
Not trying to be a dick, just trying to show this..  I just got JC from 190 to 250, and it cost me about 15k and Im 240 cha unbuffed and max 280int and using the eyeglass skill mod.  I didnt fail much either.. maybe 1 fail per 40 combines.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so that right there shows me that you must have gotten outside money or something..<br />
<br />
There was no outside money. The figures in my original post and subsequent replies are both precise (i.e. down to the copper, not rounded), and accurate (because I have the log file, all 1,648,153 bytes of it).<br />
<br />
Prep work ahead of time<br />
<br />
Made various lists and notes for myself, for example:<br />
<br />
-- items I wanted to buy ahead of time, which was mentioned in one of my replies, when someone asked how much cash reserves were needed to do this project<br />
<br />
-- list of gem / bar combines and the trivials for them<br />
<br />
-- when I want to switch from silver to electrum, from electrum to gold, and so on<br />
<br />
-- made a pot of coffee, etc...<br />
<br />
On the day I started<br />
<br />
I was logged in on my bazaar mule. He is the character where I keep most of my cash. I put exactly 10,000 (ten thousand) plat in the shared plat slot. The shared bank slot was empty before I put the 10,000 plat into the shared plat slot.<br />
<br />
/camp desktop<br />
<br />
I ran the MS command window program, inside the window, I ran ftp to copy my enchanter's log file to my Linux system. I do this periodically anyway to keep the log files from becoming too large.<br />
<br />
The reason I copied the log file from the EQ directory is so that I could delete the log file and start afresh. I did this because I did not want my log file polluted with old information which was not part of this project.<br />
<br />
So now I have no log file for my enchanter character in the EQ directory on my Microsoft system.<br />
<br />
I logged in to my enchanter.<br />
<br />
I went to the bank.<br />
<br />
I took all platinum in my inventory window and placed it in the NON-SHARED platinum slot of the bank.<br />
<br />
I took all gold in my inventory window and placed it in the gold slot of the bank.<br />
<br />
I took all silver in my inventory window and placed it in the silver slot of the bank.<br />
<br />
I took all copper in my inventory window and placed it in the copper slot of the bank.<br />
<br />
I took most of the 10,000 plat from the shared plat slot in the bank. I left some behind to avoid being encumbered top much.<br />
<br />
I parked myself between Kirem Deepfacet and Audri Deepfacet in The Plane of Knowledge.<br />
<br />
I pressed F9 three times, adjusted my camera view until I could see both merchants at the same time so I could right-click on either of them with out having to turn around each time I wanted to buy or sell items.<br />
<br />
I did my project. I am not going into detail on this because it is pretty obvious what steps are required. In general, you buy items, you enchant metal, you combine items, you sell items, over and over and over...<br />
<br />
When I dinged 250 in jewelcraft, I went to the bank and converted copper in my inventory window to silver, and so forth for silver to gold, gold to platinum. By this time I had removed the remaining cash from the shared plat slot in the bank.<br />
<br />
Then I issued the following commands:<br />
<br />
/2 Left over items:<br />
/2 Left over 2 enchanted silver bar, 4 enchanted electrum bar, 3 enchanted gold bar, 4 enchanted platinum bar<br />
/2 Left over 5 cat's eye agate, 2 jade, 6 pearl, 2 star ruby, 2 ruby<br />
/2 Blue diamond jewelry kept: 3 Silver Blue Diamond Ring , 4 Blue Diamond Electrum Earring , 3 Golden Blue Diamond Pendant<br />
/2 One failure on pendant<br />
/2 Left over cash 5904.266<br />
/2 Prices for left over items<br />
<br />
At this point, I was finding out the prices that a merchant would pay for each of the left over items.<br />
<br />
/camp desktop<br />
<br />
Ran the MS command window program, ran ftp to copy the log file from my windows system to my Linux system. This is the log file I mentioned above, all 1,648,153 bytes of it. It contains only my jewelcraft project to raise my skill from 0 to 250, and keep track of the costs, the successes, the failures, basically everything that I posted about it.<br />
<br />
End of project<br />
<br />
Where I said &quot;I am not going into detail&quot;, there are things such as going to Ak'Anon to buy Wolf's Eye Agate, medding, casting enchant metal spells, going to bank to finally withdraw from the original 10,000 plat in the shared bank slot, camping out because it was getting late, sleeping, then coming back the next day to finish the project, etc.<br />
<br />
Some of the work done after the project was completed<br />
<br />
I wrote two perl scripts, one was to add up all the items I bought and the other was to add up all the items I sold. Running them confirmed my figure for the left over cash.<br />
<br />
Lots of work formatting the data to post on this message board.<br />
<br />
An example of how some of the loss on 58 platinum bars was recovered<br />
<br />
Cost<br />
-------<br />
104.999 Platinum Bar<br />
  0.052 Malachite<br />
-------<br />
105.051 total cost to buy the ingredients to make a Platinum Malachite Ring<br />
<br />
A merchant pays 109.579 per Platinum Malachite Ring.<br />
<br />
  109.579 Sell Platinum Malachite Ring to merchant<br />
- 105.051 Buy ingredients to make a Platinum Malachite Ring<br />
  -------<br />
    4.528 x 265 Platinum Malachite Ring(s) sold = 1199.920<br />
<br />
<br />

I leave it to you do do the rest, as quite frankly, I think that I did enough. This was a labor of love. I saw several messages about how much it cost to raise jewelcraft from various levels to 250. I wanted to give something back to the EQTraders community.</div></div><hr />

The only shortcuts I took were buying gems in stacks of 20 and selling off extras when trivial hit (fairly inconsequential loss), and skipping Wolf's Eye Agate for 245-247 or whatever, but skillups on Jade were fast, so probably no loss there.

Up to 228 and rising.  Would have probably made 250 yesterday, but got called to 3 different raids that lasted the rest of the night.<br />
<br />
BTW, I will say, the RNG must have liked you when you were doing your stuff.<br />
<br />
I was at 280 wis the whole time (KEI) and had a JC gearlock in primary slot and I think I had 1 point around 206 that I went through approximately 316 combines before I got to 207.<br />
<br />
Oh well, not much further to go now.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
as of 1/5/04 - hit 247 JC (was going to go to 250, but I thought I would leave a little room incase I get a skill point doing the Aid quest).<br />

Thanks for putting together the information.</div></div><hr />

Bought 20 stacks of components and started clicking and skipped a few on the way.<br />
<br />
But have to say anyone can get JC to 250 very easily with some PP on them. It is the most easiest skill ever made.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 I just got JC from 190 to 250, and it cost me about 15k and Im 240 cha unbuffed and max 280int and using the eyeglass skill mod.  I didnt fail much either.. maybe 1 fail per 40 combines.  <br />
<br />
I'll have to call you out on that one Splix.  If you only failed 1 time per 40 combines, then on all of your successes you should have been able to sell those back for enough profit to more than cover the expense of your failures.<br />
<br />
I am only an intermediate JC, having just worked my skill level up to 219.  However, if I had been only failing one time per every 40 combines, I would have earned plat while getting this far.  With max Charisma to get alliance level prices, my currently created item was selling back to the vendor for about 5 platinum profit over the cost of the metal and gem.  Using your figures of 39 successes/ 1 failure, then I would be making 195 plat on the sucesses and losing 104 plat on the one failure.  Net profit, 90 plat for my current product.  Given the stats you have shown, you should have made a profit while skilling up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Voco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I think Splix may be right.<br />

I just started JC with 290 int and max cha and right now I am at skill 227 after spending about 20k. I think the patch where they adjusted sell back prices may be the problem here. (this was without using enchanted bars)</div></div><hr />

About how much actual time do you think was involved here? (sorry if that question was already answered but I didn't see it)<br />

It sounds like you only spent 2 days working on the craft portion of this project.  Is that an accurate assumption?  Is it possible that I could grind out the needed combines and get the required materials in less then 48 hours all while sitting between 2 vendors in PoK!?!  That sounds really good to me, especially after talking to the power-tradeskillers on the tailoring forum!</div></div><hr />

There are some things which would have sped it up. One would be to not enchant the metal, another would be to not keep track of all the combines. I spent some time keeping notes, so that I could post the results on this message board.<br />

SOE won't mind, they know that you'll have enough failures at that point that you will at best break even.  At worst, you'll lose about 104 plat per failure and gain 3 or 4 plat per resale to a vendor.</div></div><hr />

The only time a geerlock comes into play on choosing a recipe is tailoring and smithing.  It raises your effective skill so you can make ethereal metal rings, or ethereal silk swatches from 210 to 212.  These both require a modified skill of 220 to make.<br />

Is it that he kept track of sellback and you didn't, or that he did a different skillup path, or maybe that he was just impossibly lucky?<br />

I'm just curious... I'd be willing to jump-start my JC if I knew I could go from 109 (my current skill) to 200 (and maybe 250 later) for less than 4k, but 20k to go from 200 to 201 is a totally other story.</div></div><hr />

However now if you use enchanted metals you seem to get about 5-7% back from the vendor for successful combine so you have a chance of breaking even with ever skillup.

odds say that you will not make a true profit but instead will break even, due to the occasional failure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Elensar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">I've been working on JCing over the weekend (209 now), enchanted bars defenatly sell back for profit.  With silver, it's barely noticable (gaining like 3 copper isn't worth the effort of enchanting them to me), with electrum it goes up to a few silver, with gold bars, on the expensive items I'd gain like 2.5pp per sell back (still making loss due to fails tho), and now with platinum I'm almost up to 5pp profit for each enchanted bar I sell back (while I'd make a loss if I didn't enchant them).  Of course because of failures, I doubt I'm actually making money (skilling on items with a 95% chance of success, I'd still fail 1/20 on average, and make less than 100pp back from all the successes).  So far tho, I've never had to run to the bank for more money, even after some horrible luck on failures (6 out of 10 fails on 95% success combines :p), since it tends to even out with getting real lucky at other times (like doing 100 combines without a fail).<br />
<br />
So far JCing hasn't been too bad money wise, I haven't lost much money at all.  The only problem for me is that it takes so awfully long for skillups (I think I'm averaging 40+ combines per skillup now at 209, with my worst luck being 123 combines before I went from 200 to 201).  As long as you're willing to spend a lot of time (enchanting is what slows me down, I'm a bard myself but I use a chanter friend to enchant them, problem is he's 44 so not KEIable yet), use a geerlock and stick really close to trivs and always enchant bars (you can skip enchanting silver/electrum to speed things up with only minor loss in money), it shouldn't cost much money, just time (since every success you have, you're actually gaining money, so even if you don't skill up, you're not losing money either, just time).</div></div><hr />
