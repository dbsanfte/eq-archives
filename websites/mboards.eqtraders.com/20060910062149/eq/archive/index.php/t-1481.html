I do not have Luclin or PoP. I would like to know where I can find the recipes. I am looking to get my skill from 158 to 176 for the 8th Shawl. I did the 7th by chancing it and made it at skill lvl 158. With only about 2k to spend  :? If there is a Site or if I over looked it, Please let me know.<br />
 Thank you  ;)</div></div><hr />

(everything can be found at the main site, www.eqtraders.com)</div></div><hr />

You can get to 222 making Fleeting Quivers which uses all old world components. I wouldn't suggest it, but you never know.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and by the way, the items you will be combining(the padding) will have the same failure rate from 158 to 176. Heck I know a few people that skilled up those points on them. I wouldn't worry about it if I were you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adamina Keepsake</div><div class="date">12-26-2002, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quivers ia all I will be able to do..  :? <br />
 Ok, Well I will give it a shot. I know the vials of mana will be costly, It was with Wu's. Thanks  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valorale</div><div class="date">12-26-2002, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe the Ceremonial Robes can be done without Luclin or PoP ... not 100% sure if you can buy celestial solvent in the old world, if you cannot have a friend go to the moon and buy a few backpack full. <br />
But .. if you think Vials of mana were costly? You dont want to see the cost of combines -after- 158 .. Every attempt now costs me (assuming I buy all the supplies) 80pp per attempt if I fail and 580pp if I am successful. The extra 500 is because of the chain you use up. <br />
<br />
And no... Fleeting quivers are not a viable option.<br />
<br />
Edit| BTW its Dec 26 .. why wasnt Luclin and PoP under the tree?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArrakeenNaedShoj</div><div class="date">12-26-2002, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, if you ONLY want it for the 8th shawl, It really isn't necessary to raise your skill from 158. The Soft Fur Padding will probably be easier to farm than trying to do the many combines needed to trivial it. It will be expensive if you can't do it yourself, but probably as expensive as doing any other method of skillup to trivial it.</div></div><hr />

The lion skin needed for the quiver is an extremely rare drop.  You could quite possibly earn levels of experience while attempting to get just a stack of skins for the quiver.</div></div><hr />

True enough.<br />
You could probably level that necro alt to 60 to farm for you in the time it would take your tailor to get a full stack of the skins.</div></div><hr />

CE can be bought there..well solvent can be, scent of marr or whatever is in EC. Ive been working with arctic wyvern stuff for skills, i cant and wont make acrylia and since i just passed studded trivs its kind of our of the question anyway. robes are an option, but i'd say not a GOOD one. very expensive, time consuming and really not that thrilling trying to sell them in a flooded market (your server may vary)<br />
<br />
go to crystal caverns and farm up a truckload of velium, get pelts from whereever..i find em on merchants all the time, go max out fishing lookin for cobalt cods in CS. tailor away..its expensive but not as bad as robes. i spent over 15k for 200 robe combines..and they dont sell for enough to make that much back..be lucky to get half that so i dont consider it an option really but anything you can combine is an option.</div></div><hr />

Since when?  Unless they've changed something recently, nexus/bazaar are BOTH parts of the Luclin expansion.  Please explain.</div></div><hr />

 I am lucky  have Kunark and Velious  :shock: <br />
 Ok so what you guys, and gals, are saying. there is no real reason why I need to work on this any further, correct.  If so. Woot I'm done  :D <br />
 I will work on Smithing now.<br />
 Thanks all  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meirril</div><div class="date">12-26-2002, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, but I can't let you off the hook that easily. First, if you can do velious there is always the Studded Wyvern Hide armor that any quadding druid should be able to do. Collect every hide, spend your medding time fishing (bring a backpack full of poles and 2 backpacks full of bait. Trust me). Sell off the extra fish and keep all the cobalt cod. <br />
Also, your a worshiper of Tunare, so I'd asume you are a wood elf. Wood elf cultural tailoring is difficult to collect materials for, but there is an excellent post elsewhere on these boards (look for the thread titled: wood elf cultural tailoring). If I'm wrong, well, then I'm wrong.  :D <br />
My last peice of advice is once you've hit lvl 56 go to western wastes and hunt velium hounds (assuming you are on CoV faction. it's too dangerous to go there unless your at least dubious to dragons.), their decent xp, drop a few plat coins, and occasionaly drop a velium wolf hound fur. That can skill you up to 178 I belive (check the websight, I'm too lazy to  :oops: ). Btw, those velium hounds are dangerous, and I realy don't suggest hunting them before that. Ensnare, dot, fear them. Root wears off too fast to be useful. If you have a kei hit them with both your insect and fire dots, otherwise they'll resist the fire dot too often to make it worth while till you get a few more levels under ya. I think I started a few levels earlier than I recomended, but I'm insaine. :D <br />
Oh, and you can try doing the Mamoths there too, Velium Mamoth cloaks are in demand due to a PoP quest, and they are a &gt;250 combine. Personaly, I'd just trade the velium Mastadon Fur for lesser tailoring supplies, or plat. Probably Plat to be honest. Mamoths are a bit easier but have about twice as many HP.</div></div><hr />

He is doing the 8th shawl. The recipe you speak of (Soft Fur Padding, I believe) is the recipe he needs to complete for that quest. There is NO Reason for him to do anything else if he is not planning on going to 250. And since the failure rates seem to be about the same from 158 to 176(where they trivial) there is No reason for him to try and skill up on anything else to do them.</div></div><hr />
