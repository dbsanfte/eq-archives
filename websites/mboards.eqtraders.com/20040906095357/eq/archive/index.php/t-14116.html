<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tshesebe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Please forgive me if this has already been addressed, but in general, what skill range is considered to be the &quot;Hell levels&quot; in tailoring?  I've not seen a specific thread on it, and I would like to know when I could be considered to be &quot;over the hump.&quot; (even though in tailoring, everything higher than silk swatches could be considered &quot;hell&quot;  :D   )<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It starts about 1ish and ends somewhere near 250 ;) I found 200-220 the worse combine/skill up ratio but there is room for discussion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>baody</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">238 hasn't been very fun. The new trade skill interface taunts me by telling me I have 249 with my geerlok in hand.<br />

Baody.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lixivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">220-230 were really bad for me , 200-219, 231-239 were about the same, 240+ was cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">from 187 to about  209 were my personal hell levels in tailoring. Once I got bast 227 the skill ups were coming in about 1 in 10-15 tries.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lanalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I had a lot of trouble from 190 to 210ish. 211-233 were CAKE for me.<br />
<br />
Still at 233.. couple stacks of combines and no skillups yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bamlador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am averaging 33.6 combines per skill up since 158.<br />
<br />
This includes longest of 139 combines with out a skill up at 206 and currently at 100 combines at 241 with out a skill up.<br />
<br />
It all works out in the end.</div></div><hr />
