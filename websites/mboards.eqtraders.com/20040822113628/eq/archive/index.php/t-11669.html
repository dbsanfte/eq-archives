<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pondlife</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Trueshots may be somewhat obsolete now, but the making of one can be done for little PP outlay (other than getting Feltching skill high enough), and is something of a right of passage for a Ranger.<br />
