wonder why so many rogues dont bother with it (apart from getting the seal) because it aint that big a deal. it could be so much more, but the way its implimented well it really aint worth it. yes and thats comming for a rogue with 250 poison making, all grandmaster tradeskill trophys and mr Grimels earing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's hard to come up with ideas without stepping on the toes of other TS's, I was thinking beneficial &quot;poisons&quot; but then that would intrude on alchemy,<br />
<br />
Maybe a healing cream (who knows how many hit points?) made in the M&amp;P?<br />
<br />
Let's take a look at what we have for poisons:<br />
<br />
DD<br />
DOT<br />
Stun<br />
Stun + DD<br />
Undead<br />
Root<br />
Beserker (+haste -str)<br />
weakness<br />
feeble mind<br />

<br />
What about specific direct damage (Like Burning blood - DD + Fire damage, Spine Chill, DD + Cold damage etc..)?<br />
<br />
What about multi-dose poisons, or are those kept as a 'reward' for those who have completed the GM trophy and the quest?<br />
<br />
Edit: I do have to admit, the poisons you &quot;drink&quot; and adds a proc to you (long lasting poison?) are *extremely* nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol thanks anyway, tho i wonder if it just cos we responded to your comment on the tinkering post.<br />
<br />
ok what do you want us work around? the one shot outdated Kunark poisons? or the random procing PoP poisons? <br />
at the time Kunark poisons effects were ok, however the time spent farming and making something that that didnt stack and went off on the first hit to get resisted was pita.<br />
PoP poisons while we thank you guys for getting round to doing something with rogue Poisons the effects on these coupled with fails and cost just dont make them worth it really.<br />
<br />
so ok going on that your gonna do a broad sweeping hand motion and say just throw ideas around.<br />
<br />
atm poison has very little value, it cirtanly wont make a group go hey lets have a rogue with us... they have that great Make Poison class skill. even if we do spend half our gaming time farming and making poisons to use in groups it wont make a huge difference. well not much difference at all really &quot;ive been using poisons for the past hour&quot; and the reply &quot;you have? we couldnt tell&quot;<br />
<br />
so we come back to chucking in the ideas.<br />
<br />
let rogues apply poisons (get to use their apply skill) eg the PoP buff ones to other people. soandso applys a thick poison to your blades.<br />
<br />
take all the effects from the old kunark poisons and apply them to the new pop system eg the oneshot effect working as a proc.<br />
<br />
the PoP poison effects atm are just way to weak as to make them not really worth it. make these effects x2 or even x3 and it maybe worth while.<br />
the lowering resist poisons? comon lowering a resist by 5 dont do much to a mob or even a player.<br />
<br />
if a procing poison or one shot is applied then it should work on what ever eg why not thrown daggers or arrows. pfft with a supply of 2k dot procing poisons and a bow a Grandmaster poisoner should make people go &quot;hell hes after me please buff my poison resist!!!&quot;<br />
DD poisons at grandmaster lvl 250 with seal ect the most deadly poison i can sneak up with and stab in the back with is Mind Melt (kunark 1 shot) for 555dd and still has a high triv. thats less than a single good backstab, ok yes the damage of this is from Kunark, we're now past killing Gods after Time and fighting invaders from the realm of Discord; a Kunark lvl poison is the best DD wecan count on? the Bite of the Shissar 125dd proc? oh come on please 125 damage even 3or4 procs of it on a mob aint going to do much hardly advanced poison is it?<br />
<br />
ok you get the idea, stronger poisons that aint a waste of time for high grandmaster poisoners (a lot stronger) and make them work for all weapons including other player classes (applied by a rogue)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">How about letting rogues refine items for other trades? The chance of poison being allowed to other classes is almost nil, I think most of us know this. Especially when combined with the limits of the current EQ engine. So instead lets ask ourselves, what would give the skill marketable products that could be sold to non-rogues? Rogues take glands and such things and refine the slightly poisonous parts to become quite potent. It's not too big a stretch to think a class that regularly works with quicksilver and lead can find other applications for their skills.<br />
<br />
One such solution would be to let rogues refine some materials to make other usable materials. Now traditionally you could say refining metals should go to either smithing (which already has upgrading metal into bigger pieces) or alchemy. However EQ alchemists deal only in plants. They're really herbalists more than alchemists. Rogues are the ones who traditionally use the non-smithable metallic substances in the game. There's already prescedence for letting rogues make some of the cultural components such as drops of mercury for dwarf temper. The skill limit is even fairly formidable on that, needs a skill of 200+ to be able to do it. How about the same for morning dew for example? There's been some quests that need rogue poisons made as well. A good call and that could be continued in future quests.<br />
<br />
How about letting rogues make components for new recipies? By including cross-skill components you increase trade and interaction between the various classes, in many cases it adds a bit of rarity as well. Say you have Breastplate of the Zodiac. To make it would require a special mold of the rhino (pottery), cheeta leather padding (tailoring), sheets of elephant's metal (smithing), oiled chain joints of the fish (JC+brewing), and chameleon temper (brewing) as well as 3 essences. One essence of the bear (alchemy made). One essence of the eagle (imbued gem) and one essence of the snake (poison made). Or a new weapons recipe, do the recipe bare and get an ok weapon, however put in a poisonous rogue-made contraption and get the same weapon but with a minor proc.<br />
<br />
Just naming an example of how the chores of making an item can be logically split up. As it is EQ recipies are very bare, very basic in both what they take to create and what they yield. Some require the occasional imbued gem, but beyond that most components are completely logical and mundane (in a fantasy sort of way). The problem with make poison as a trade skill isn't that poisons suck, it's that they have no value to anyone outside of rogues. Your market in that case is only a fraction of what it could be, that's not even counting how many of the poisons are no drop. The solution would probably not be to give everyone poisons as it would upset balance and still with poisons the way they are not make them terribly useful. But instead to give the skill a use outside of only making pure straight-up poisons for use against mobs. The first step in that has already been taken in allowing refining of poison ingredients for other trades.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, the groups grab us because of our DPS, out quickness, stealth, ability to scout out areas (I've devoloped a tactic, I sneak in a room, I target something, and the mez'er assists me and mezzes the target, easy and safe way to mez a room with mobs by the door).<br />
<br />
We backstab, my double backstab is now hitting up to 750 and a single up to 500, quickly adds in (although it's nothing compared to a good nuke).<br />
<br />
I think we're a very good class, although hard to play and level.  When you get up there, your power increases exponentially.<br />

As for posisons, lower level multi-dose poisons, and proc high-damage (no 50 point, I'm talking 200 point DD or a nice DoT poison), and my beef, poison tipped arrows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>javalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i would be for making more potentant poisons as already stated also would it be too hard to either convert all the old recipies to pop style of poison or come up with new recipies that did the same</div></div><hr />

1 - Snake venom sack<br />
1 - Asp venom sack<br />

Yields 1, trivial at 125.<br />
<br />
We could have other &quot;essences&quot; such as spider (spider venom sack, spider silk, spicerling silk), essence of undead (bone chips, darkbone marrow, icebone chips etc), the possibilities are endless, and mainly sticking with rogue-related mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rydex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I only used Kunark poisons a few times for duels (most were resisted) at level 45 and skill 170 or so. Having spent a great deal of time raising the skill for little to no use made me give up poisons. When PoP was released poison seemed to be a great new skill again. In the weeks after the quest was found I pushed for making the GM vial, spending most of my plat on the seal and skill ups. <br />
<br />
At first the poisons seemed to be a great new toy, until I started to parse them. Bite of the Shissar (125 DD) added maybe 2% DPS if I had more than one proc a fight. Wasted Flesh (DoT) turned out to be the best DPS increase, IF it proced early in the fight, up to about 4% DPS. Of some note for raiding might be Mental Implosion (mana burn), but for grouping I have not seen an area where enough casters (only cleric NPCs really matter here) are packed for it to be useful. <br />
<br />
While I still have a stash of Bite of the Shissar and Wasted Flesh, the only poison I have used in the past year is Spine Rend when there is no other snare, and then only sparingly. To complete a LDoN adventure it takes up to 6 doses. I would rather use the SBD and half my DPS unless time is getting close. It might take 10 min extra to finish, but it took a few hours to round up the supplies and make the poisons.<br />
<br />
This might be ok if it was a spell you memorize and keep recasting, but a 2% and 4% (if lucky) increase that is a huge time sink is not worth the use. <br />
<br />
Kunark poisons are useless in PvE. First they are not stackable, making it hard to keep a decent supply of them. Second, applying them after every fight is not possible in a good group, where pulls are almost constant. The mob is at 75% by the time you have poison applied, wasting more DPS than gaining.<br />
<br />
I would hope all future poisons would be in PoP style. Poisoning ranged items for other classes are a great idea and would allow the skill to be marketable depending on the price. More if not all supplies being sold by vendors would be a nice improvement (I only farm vendors, poisons aren’t valuable enough to farm mobs anymore). Increased duration and damage on proc poisons would help and be a simple addition.<br />

#3 less resists.  A HUGE reason we don't use poisons is after ALL the effort required, they are resisted SO frequently.  What good is a hate-reduction poison if the high level mobs resist it so freakin' often?<br />
<br />
#4 two poison effects at once.  We have a weapon in each hand, why can't we have one poison on one blade, and one on the other?<br />
<br />
#5 mez poison.  A poison that renders the mob completely (no casting) paralized for 30 secs to 1-1/2 mins.  It would be impossible to immediately stop attacking once the poison landed, so the poison would also have to grant a 10 second immunity that gave the chance for the rogue to stop beating on it.<br />
<br />
After TWO expansions of ZERO additions or improvements to this skill, you have to ask what/why?  That's just horrible.  You should be ashamed and embarrased.  I offer rogues are THE most dedicated to our class, so we failed to make your ears bleed with our complaints, and the development team takes advantage of it.  We get into groups on our reps of DPS.  At least put in an in-game parser so we can prove our mana-independant contributions.<br />
<br />
And how about a blind poison with a realistic and helpful effect?  If suddenly I found myself unable to see, I would not immeditely run in a random direction as fast as possible, somehow able to navigate changes in elevations of terrain and twisting hallways without getting slowed down, never mind falling down.  Mobs should not go anywhere, and their ability to attack and defend should be greatly reduced.</div></div><hr />

The poisons could be like the PoP procs (only better please).  Maybe the augments could have charges or something, so that they could be used in special situations (e.g., raids) so they wouldn't be permanent and people would have a reason to come back.<br />
<br />
Speaking of augments, SoE is apparently considering allowing tradeskillers to make solvents that would permit augments to be removed and reused in new equipment.  I'd suggest that maybe poisonmaking rogues be the the ones allowed to make these solvents, rather than opening it up to brewers, alchemists, etc.  We have suffered so much for so long, it would be nice to have this skill possess some market value.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And that's my point.  Our friendly neigborhood SOE developer wants us to believe he is interested, and he may very well be, but 2 expansions, and not one stinkin' new recipie???  <br />
<br />
I don't know if this is a practical way of thinking about what is right for a computer game, but in the real world, could you poison an arrow or blade, and pass it on?  Sure, 'cept for the fact you would have to use it rather soon else I would assume the poison would drip off the blade or dry up.  That sounds like &quot;no rent&quot; to me. Mage's sell summoned &quot;no rent&quot; items.  Why not rogues?  Why not allow it for the simple fact we'd have something to pass out at raids besides baked goods?  example, /rs send a tell to Doc for Virtue, and /tell Raddan for poisoned arrows.  Rangers firing away with resis lowering poisoned arrows?  Monks pulling with shrunken's laced with a snare poison?  Seems pratical and reasonable to me.  (If for some reason by Bristlebane's graces they did put this in, please let us poison stacks at a time, lol).<br />
<br />
I just want SOMETHING.  SOE, let us prove our DPS contributions with an easy-to-use in game parser.  Or make poisons useful.  I was all excited to try out my hate-reduction poisons in ToV, and when I got the chance, with resis after resis, I felt like I had just wasted a huge amount of time and money.<br />
<br />
As far as the mez poison, that seems completely pratical to me.  A posion that locks everything up for a short duration certainly would be EQ practical, as well as real-world compatible.  My impression is the previous poster/flamer is locked into specific roles for specifc classes, i.e. since EQ started, rogues can not mez, so they should not be able to now.  I say SOE missed the boat and they are welcome to fix it.  We would be a poor-man's crowd control anyway, as we pray to Bristlebane our proc would #1, go off in short order, and #2 not get resisted.  But in an emergency, or for casual, as opposed to critical, crowd control (like a normal difficulty LDoN), it could be useful.  If my memory serves, rogues could sorta mez with cudgel's in the pen and paper RPG's from which EQ evolved, and a competing title, currently in beta, empowers rogues with this ability.  So where you get it's &quot;just wrong&quot; I don't know.  What IS wrong is a third expansion of more powerful spells for the casters, and nothing for the melee's.  Try opening your mind just a wee bit before you flame, kk? thx.<br />
<br />
You didn't flame, you claim?  You were just offering another opinion?  Then give us something other than &quot;it's just worng&quot;.  I argue a drug that has a &quot;mez&quot; effect exists in the real world today, is practical to put in the game, and would give rogues an ability they have in games related to Everquest.  You, however, only criticize.<br />
<br />
one last note, potions were always a big part of medieval RPG's, I wish they were more a part of EQ.  And all of those SO concerned about making other PC's rich, it sounds like jealous whining to me, and that's a very broke rogue talking.  If more cost effective potions (to make) could be introduced, which gives me the ability to take out some mob that I could not handle before, I'll be a buyer, and if I make some shammy rich, so be it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">As far as the mez poison, that seems completely pratical to me.  A posion that locks everything up for a short duration certainly would be EQ practical, as well as real-world compatible.  <br />
While the concept of a poison that freezes a target briefly is sound, game mechanics wouldn't support it.  A typical high-level rogue will be hitting the mob something like 2-4 times per second.  So, in the course of one second, consider this scenario.<br />
<br />
Turn attack on wayward mob<br />
hit one: hit for xxx.  Proc goes off, mob mezzed<br />
hit two: miss<br />
hit three: hit for xxx.  Mez breaks<br />
hit four: hit for xxx.<br />
Attack off.<br />
<br />
Your mez lasted less than a second because it's simply not possible to react fast enough, given current game mechanics, latency due to Internet lag, and sheer human reaction time.<br />
<br />
If you insist on using a mez, you'd have to add a five-second Divine Aura-like effect to the mezzed mob as part of the proc.  Then, IF lag isn't too bad, the rogue is paying attention, AND the player has fast reflexes, the rogue would have a chance to turn off attack before he breaks his own mez.<br />
<br />
Instead, consider a poison that procs a ten-second stun.  It has the same effect you're looking for, more or less -- it freezes up the mob briefly, but you don't have to worry about turning off attack or missing the proc message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Raddan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I agree KyrosKrane, a period of immunity, as I mentioned in my first post in this thread, would be required, because it would be impossible to turn off attack fast enough.<br />
<br />
The scenerio I envision is a group in a LDoN with no bard or chanter.  The tank/puller brings 3.  In this case, the rogue would have to quickly apply the poison, which can be done with a high skill and a custom UI, and then jump on the adds, while the rest of the group stays with the MA.  Once the rogue gets a proc, and the add is mez'd, he moves to the next add.<br />
<br />
He would then have the choice of clicking off the mez effect from his buff bar and joining the fray, or sit back and waiting to see if the mez broke at a bad time, in which case he/she would need to re-mez.  So the rogue may have to truly sacrifice his DPS if he was going to serve as emergency CC.  A fair trade off IMHO.<br />
<br />
Thinking out loud, if SOE changes it so actual weapons and not &quot;slots&quot;  are able to be poisoned, the rogue could switch out from a regular piercer to one pre-laced with the mez poison.  Once he got things under control, he could switch back to the non-mez-poisoned poker and resume the DPS role.  But again there is a flip side, if applying a poison made the dagger no-rent, as the arrow and shrunken scenario I mentioned previously, there wouldn't be many blades worth sacrificing.<br />
<br />
I am no programmer, I am a customer.  I see no reason to ask for the way it should be, rather than what is easier for the SOE development team.<br />
<br />
Would a 10 second stun be worth the farming and the cost?  I think the usefulness of said poison would only be a have-it-ready-in-an-emergency thing, and a longer duration stun be required to make the effort (of making the poison) worth while.<br />
<br />
What might be a better alternative all together is give rogues an ability similar to assassin strike where if the attack is from a &quot;hidden&quot; position, with a blunt object, they have a chance of a mez, or a long duration stun, whatever you want to call it...the equivalent of a wack on the back of the head.<br />
<br />
The tank pulls and someone calls out &quot;add.&quot;  The rogue goes into sneak/hide mode, switches to a blackjack, positions him/herself behind the add, fires up the ability, and strikes!  Seems like a viable solution, albeit not part of the tradeskill debate.<br />
<br />
Again, what I am looking for is some time and effort from SOE that directly benefits the rogue class.  Spells come out with every expansion, as do new recipies for all the other tradeskills, 'cept for one, make poison.  Throw a little love our way please SOE.  Don't forget us again in OoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 #2 allow us to permanently poison arrows and throwing weapons so we have something to sell....SOME reason for the mind numbing farming.<br />
<br />
I don't think you're going to see:<br />
	a. Permanently poisoned anything.  This would wipe out the idea of rogues making poisons for themselves.  It would basically mean that you'd make one dose of a poison and never make another until you changed weapons.<br />
	b. It seems to me that poisons should remain rogue only.  Selling them for others to use isn't something that sounds good to me.<br />
<br />
 #3 less resists. A HUGE reason we don't use poisons is after ALL the effort required, they are resisted SO frequently. What good is a hate-reduction poison if the high level mobs resist it so freakin' often?<br />
<br />
Is this the case?  I'd like to hear from others that use poison regularly.  I recently talked with Rytan about resists on a few poisons and he seemed to think that they were fine, though I think I can freely admit that I know very little about the whole process.  Keep in mind that if you try to convince me that they are super weak and need to be unresistable I'll ban your mother.  :)<br />
<br />
 #4 two poison effects at once. We have a weapon in each hand, why can't we have one poison on one blade, and one on the other?<br />
<br />
Two problems here.  This is a code thing that I can't address and have no idea about how hard it is to accomplish.  Secondly it would effectively double the power of poisons and I'm not at all sure that is a good idea.<br />
<br />
 #5 mez poison.<br />
<br />
No.  Don't start asking for rez poisons or charm poisons either.  I do not want to water down any class distinctions with new poisons.<br />
<br />
 After TWO expansions of ZERO additions or improvements to this skill, you have to ask what/why? That's just horrible.<br />
<br />
I don't &quot;have&quot; to ask what or why.  I did, however, want to get some input.  Sorry for taking up your time.  Please take out all of your frustrations on me, though, if it will help.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Poison Mastery is almost completely out of date, even I stopped making poisons with how little they help..and I've always been big on using them. Reduces apply time each level? Useless. Makes it so you can't fail to apply? Useless.<br />
<br />
How about we get an additional +1 poison damage to our weapons per level? Now THAT would be worth it! <br />
<br />
Not sure if that's possible, but I'll see what folks say.  Any other ideas about how to make Poison Mastery better that matches more with how the other masteries work?<br />
<br />
<br />
 And that's my point. Our friendly neigborhood SOE developer wants us to believe he is interested, and he may very well be, but 2 expansions, and not one stinkin' new recipie???<br />
<br />

ok mate ive said my bit in other posts so you know where i stand haha.<br />
<br />
 Keep in mind that if you try to convince me that they are super weak and need to be unresistable I'll ban your mother <br />
haha ok so either keep them as they are eg &quot;super weak&quot; (they are) and make them unresistable, not the way i think we should go imo. or keep the resist check and up the power of the poisons a lot.<br />
the tiny, tiny dps increase of using the proc based poisons just isnt worth time/money, let alone that these are &quot;advanced&quot; poisons that you have to skill up to make. <br />
poisons are something that should be special and deadly, atm its something to many rogues shy away from because for the return there seams little point.<br />
<br />
the ideas put around of making poison augs sound nice, but i doubt we'll see something along those lines anytime soon, im not having a go im just sure you got more than enough on your plate as it is right now.<br />
<br />
there are plenty of ways to limmit the use of new Grandmaster deadly poisons if you felt that once made they were to powerful eg a gang of 5 Rogues teaming up to assassinate a target(that might be to close to being able to solo for xp and loot /mock) <br />
in the end all we want is for the poison line to be looked at, it badly needs upgrades for Rogues to look at it as something worthwhile.<br />
<br />
there just isnt any OOOooo in it, poisons atm are a little less that a minor irritation from a bee sting the the backside of an elephant. <br />
there was nothing put in for this skill in LdoN or GoD ummm thats 2 expansions to a class skill (unlike like alchemy) come on mate shed some light on what youve been holding onto for so long or were we really just not worth it?</div></div><hr />

I agree that there isn't any wow factor in poisons.  Part of the issue here is balance.  Unlike most of the other tradeskills, poisons add directly to damage.  If they make a major impact then they change the balance of the class.  If they do that then things need to be balanced with that in mind, and then the ability to make poison becomes a &quot;requirement&quot; to be the optimal rogue (something that I hear players worry about sometimes).  I'm not sure that we want to try to make any tradeskill that integral to the DPS of a class.<br />
<br />
And it's not that we've been holding out, it's just that there 14 million tradeskills and 14 million classes and zones and spells and items and quests and blah, blah, blah that needs to go into an expansion.  Unfortunately there isn't always time to get all of the things the time and effort they deserve.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Jaasper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I never used old world posions so I can't comment on them. I got into posions when Pop went live. I originally started using posions to reduce agro cuz them warrors just were not good enough to do it. Time passed and warrors have got much beter at agro control and I have not used posions in a year. The following is my own thoughts on posions, and your welcome to disagree.<br />
<br />
I don't use posions because the time to farm/make is not worth the extra damage a posion can provide. So what if my DPS is 5% less and the fight lasts 10 sec longer; in the big picture this means nothing. So posions are a luxury not a neccessity.<br />
<br />
I am a trade skiller (thanks Grimell for making me do it) so farming/making stuff is not a big deal; however I want to get some return for my time invested. If the rate of posion consumption was about the same as food consumption (1 dose per hour of play) then I could see using posions. I am willing to spend AA points to extend the duration of posions (15 AA's to get me to 1hr would be acceptable).<br />
<br />
I like having 2 levels of posions, the Jr level is tradable and even people that can't make posions can use it and a Sr level that you have to make yourself. There is never going to be a secondary market for posions because Rogues are to controlling and have to do everything themselves. Let the rogue twink/wanna be's use the Jr stuff. 2 and 5 dps boost for each level is not unreasonable (with the current line of AA's to pick your dps up).<br />
<br />
Only rogues should ever be allowed to use posions, I don't want to be a mage style vending machine.. but that is just me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ok fair enough thats down to the crux of the matter. poisons were something for the melee dps class to do extra damage if they put some time in. the limmit to this was that it was so restictive that it couldnt be used all the time chaining poisons. the reasons were space/making/farming/expence as far as Kunark poisons went. then we got &quot;upgraded&quot; with PoP procing poisons ok i still think they are very weak to the point that i hardly ever use them now.<br />
<br />
so what do you want poisons to be? a dps boost to a pure melee dps class? sounds like you dont want that, cant understand it myself as thats what rogues do. <br />
poisons for utility? being able to do another classes jobs via our tradeskill? well that is a whole can of worms that would cause more problems.<br />
the reason i say stick with damage is because that what rogues do, however we are totaly dependant on equipment drops on rare tables from raid mobs to do it. poisons would be another way to help damage. top end equipment is held by such a small number of rogues that the selective use of a tradeskill while not demanded could really help other rogues and make it worth their time.<br />
as for the demand that rogues will have to use poison? well i think thats just not true, it will always be something that you either choose to use or not with bag space, agro, time and money it will never be a have to use thing.<br />
<br />
it is our Class trade, but for now there does appear to be little in the way of level progression to 65 and above.<br />

	a. Permanently poisoned anything.  This would wipe out the idea of rogues making poisons for themselves.  It would basically mean that you'd make one dose of a poison and never make another until you changed weapons.<br />
	b. It seems to me that poisons should remain rogue only.  Selling them for others to use isn't something that sounds good to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, my idea is certainly nothing urgent so I'll post as opposed to emailing :)  <br />
<br />
The poison tipped arrows really appeal to me so I'd like to follow that up.  A permanently poisoned arrow / throwing dagger is not really a permanent item because the item itself has such a short shelf life.  Its not like a rogue would be carrying around a poisoned arrow for the next 6 months (or if he was, it would be useless to him that entire time).  Also, you wouldn't just be making one dose of a poison because one dose would poison say, 5 arrows.  Five arrows are gone in a heartbeat so you would have to have several doses of the poison for one evening of playing.  I think what you are opposing is the idea of one poison getting potentially infinate uses but that wouldn't be the case if it only worked on 'disposable' items.<br />
<br />
Second, my little seller heart says everything should be available for a price :)  Just wondering if you would explain the reasoning behind saying that selling poisoned items (such as the arrows) would not be a good thing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Raddan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">NO! Raddan, stop posting!  You are NOT helping!<br />
<br />
I MUST, I MUST post!  These ideas seem so good when they are bouncing around in my head!!!<br />
<br />
I'll just let it our easy this time... :) <br />
<br />
Ok so no flooding the bazzar with poisoned weapons, but what about a new (summoned) tradeskill container to combine stacks of arrows or throwing daggers with an old world poison, with the end result a stack of &quot;no rent&quot; poisoned ranged weapons?  No way we could turn a profit on a &quot;no rent&quot; item, so it would be simply something to add spice to a raid or LDoN, poisoned stars (snare) for monks to pull with, posioned arrows (resis debuffs) to give to your friendly neighborhood ranger...<br />
<br />
What about a bazaar catagory &quot;poisons&quot;, so looking up poisons for sale could be made a little easier?  If the resists on the PoP poisons are NOT out of whack, then there should be a minor market for such an item between rogues that choose to tradeskill and those that don't, correct?  Give us a catagory in the bazaar search window so we can peruse the list without having the name memorized...as potions have their own catagory.<br />
<br />
I have read the highest percentage of players or playtime is between 20 and 50.  So how about questable poisons for that level range, with an emphasis on something that helps improve the Apply skill?  I know about the spider venom one, but doesn't that costs 2pp per skill up attempt, plus the venom sack?  Not viable IHMO.<br />
<br />
Something to help my (level 65's) apply poison skill along?  Just get the AA's you say?  Bah, then why have the skill in the game?  What about the pre-65 folk? I am still working on throwing, lol, because you put it there (begging will remain at zero, however, I am not a warrior!).  My make poison is more than double my apply poison skill because I had to sell back what poisons I made during skill ups to reduce the financial burden.<br />
<br />
I understand the concept that a rogue without poison should not be less of a rogue, as a shammy without alchemy should not be a less of a shammy, but the shammy can sell his poitions to all classes, as a gnome tinkerer can sell his wares, but a rogue can not sell the fruits of his labors.  Make Poison is unique, and an intergral part of the class, and therefore the same rules can not apply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Wyloc Wormwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">ok lets take a step back and look at this as it looks to me that we've hit a brick wall and there wont be anything new and good for poison making until the tradeskill augs get worked on; thats going to be a long way off if at all.<br />
<br />
poison arrows/thrown daggers? well as said they dont want us selling these to other classes (oh no we might be able to earn money from a tradeskill haha) so that means we Rogues would use them. if this was viable eg poison 5+ arrows/knives we would have to work them on the kunark system as procs and archery is .... well naff. so if they were using the same effects as the kunark oneshots then this could work out ok, hell we may even be able to kite an xp mob solo hahaha now wouldnt that be nice. we'll wait n see what they say.<br />
<br />
now <br />
a. Permanently poisoned anything. This would wipe out the idea of rogues making poisons for themselves. It would basically mean that you'd make one dose of a poison and never make another until you changed weapons. Absor.<br />
<br />
i see ways round that. <br />
*the poison is high triv (thus very hard to make) and no rent. eg you have to keep making it. no one is gonna leave a corpse with a poison on it to save it hahaha come on.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
*bring the buff in line with other buff timers. 15min buffs?? pfft im talking 1-3+ hours like Virtue or KEI. could you guys go with that?<br />
<br />
i still think the advanced proc effects themselves are so weak as to not really be worth it, however if its all we're gonna get (excuse me while i throw a brick through the Alchemists window as they appear to be the luvies as far as new stuff goes atm) then those buffs should last a reasonable time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Talisen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Dangit why didn't anyone tell me the poison forum had Absor's attention?:P<br />
<br />
Absor: I agree with you that most of the rogues around want to be overpowered instead of tweaked a little to be better and more useful. Most ideas they come up with are off the wall and semi-rediculous. That doesn't mean there isn't a way to make poison more fun somewhere~<br />
<br />
What there needs to be is a more firm line between novice poisoner and expert. Novice being someone who is still working up skill without any AA but still wants to use their class ability for -something-. Expert would be someone that has Poison Mastery 3/3, Master Sketch, Make Poison 250, etc that needs a higher damage or more useful effects from their poisons.<br />
<br />
The idea of having a chance to proc the poison over a set amount of time is a much better idea than just a one shot deal, but as content gets added and everything gets more difficult.. poisons need to be upgraded. Just like spells from a caster.<br />
<br />
Hang on..idea forcing it's way to the front..<br />
<br />
How about this! : Turn poisons from click effects to spellbook type effects! Creating a poison will give you the a certain amount of components for &quot;casting&quot;. In some way or another we need to put the recipe in the spellbook. Memorize the poison in a spell slot.. and when we want to use a poison we have memorized and the regeants for we click the icon for a..8 second cast based off of Apply Poison skill? (Using this would make the Poison Mastery faster apply worth something) Add fizzles/mis-applies for skill checks so not just anyone can use. Using poison like this would be a one shot deal, but if the combines of poisons were to give us more than one regeant for this type of usage it'd be more worth it.<br />
<br />
Think of it like this..we have a bandoleer or belt of several kinds of holsters or vials full of poisons, each a different one. To use it we just dip our dagger in for an apply then stab something with it! Making the poisons just fills our vials/holsters and we can use it till it runs dry!<br />
<br />
I'm going too far into this.. thoughts?:P<br />
<br />
Oh I know, we can call it &quot;Talisen's Belt of Poisons!&quot; and if you use it with &quot;Talisen, Bow of the Trailblazer&quot; your poisons do x50 damage !!!!  ...ok so I had to throw something rediculous in there just to satisfy the rogue in me &gt;:\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Talisen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Oh yeah, expert would be someone who has had 250 make poison since Velious (200 all during Kunark) and has created every poison out there at least 5000 times..<br />
<br />

<br />
hahah i hear ya on that!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Talisen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">The more you guys argue against what he says won't happen the less he'll probably feel like revisiting these boards:P<br />
<br />
Come up with something new and useful that's within reason, not a way to do what other classes do or be something you aren't supposed to be.<br />
<br />
Revise the poison system, come up with ways to make it more useful and easy to upgrade in expansions! Don't just add new poison types (mez? /laugh) or put it on other weapon slots.<br />
<br />
Another idea that I broke off of the others was to have a base poison &quot;spell&quot;. By spell I mean an actual spell icon and different types we can memorize for use. Any rogue who knows what he's doing can come up with some minor damaging stuff on the spot, right?<br />
Couple of examples - Base poisons:<br />
10 DD<br />
4 DoT a tick for 5 ticks<br />
<br />
Any rogue can use those at any time, but why should we bother with that? Here is why! If our poison combines were to make reagents that have focus effects for our poisons, we could do a lot more damage depending on what we have available to add on to the base in our inventory. Such as.. let's say the Bite of the Shissar combine were to give you 10 reagents, each has a +2000% focus on your DD poison. Each time you click the spell icon you apply the poison and use up a reagent, this one in particular would make your DD 200 damage which is injected in your first pierce. Using reagents from a DoT poison combine let's say is going to give you a +2000% focus, which will make your base DoT a 80 per tick for 5 ticks.<br />
<br />
How would this not be over powering? Simple, add the 8 second apply/cast time! Poison Mastery 3/3 would make it a 0.5 second apply time, but even if you use it over and over you will be using up reagents and once you run out you're back to the base, which is a 10 DD or a 4 DoT.<br />
<br />
OR*******************************<br />
<br />
Have a universal poison that has 0% of all effects that we can apply as we wish, but having a reagent made from my other post of a customizable poison will make the outcome be what you worked towards.<br />
<br />
Either way.. just come up with something new and stop trying to argue that we should be able to make a profit off of our trade, or should be able to do everything other classes do. That's thinking like a twink, not a rogue.<br />

OH OH OH HOW BOUT AN UNPOISON POISON THAT WE CAN INJECT IN OURSELVES FOR A HEAL OVER TIME OMFG!@#!@#! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Getting back to the discussion at hand...<br />
<br />
The complaints I have been hearing, (and I may not have) is that poisons aren't worth the 'bang for the buck', it's too expensive and/or too much hassle to make poisons since most of them are kunark era and the game has gotten a bit beefier since then, and the GoD poisons are procs that aren't nearly as reliable. Problems I hear are 1) not enough damage/effect/whatever and 2) resists. Also, many people want poisons applied to throwing weapons and arrows, which I can certainly agree with so long as one makes sure the items are not tradable with the poison applied.<br />
<br />
SO<br />
<br />
1) allow poisons to be applied to throwing weapons, but make them nodrop as long as the poisons are applied (don't know if this is possible, but I know that nodrop aug + tradable item = nodrop item auged). If not this, then perhaps some other method of ensuring that the throwing item is not traded after the poison is applied. I think this would be a wonderful pull toy and increase the versitility of the rogue without breaking it.<br />
<br />
2) perhaps make rogue-only range items that do small amounts of base damage but either has lots of +poison damage or has some effect. These are throwing items, not clickies. Perhaps make this a cross-tradeskill thing. For example, the base Rogue Dagger is a smithing combine, makes 5 throwing dagger things, triv around where the rest of the throwing weapons are. Combine this with some new poison (that has no effect other than to make these) to make the Poisoned Rogue Dagger which has like 2 dam/20 delay +10 poison damage. ALL/ROG NODROP. Alternatly, combine smithed throwing daggers (the ones already able to be made) with the new poison thing to make the poisoned throwing dagger that's nodrop and like +10 poison and ROG only.<br />
<br />
3) As wizards have their lure spells, perhaps rogues should have access to a few poisons that are exceptionally difficult to resist. These should be less powerful than a standard poison, but will be more likely to affect the target. Should also contain obnoxious ingredients in hard to reach places (like the flagged GoD zones for instance) and really high triv (like over 252 so it will never be trivialized, emphasising how important it is)<br />
<br />
4) Perhaps adding a couple of espically toxic poisons that do more damage than the ones currently out (like a 1k or mabye possibly even 2k, other effects similarily extended) but is easily resisted and again requires exceptionally difficult-to-find ingredients (perhaps named drops) in hard-to-reach places (upper end flagged GoD for example) and have obnoxiously high trivs (over 252). Good luck trying to get it to land unless you got a buddy with Malo though (was thinking of it going lure but the OTHER direction, so instead of like -100 resist, it was +100 resist).<br />
<br />
4a) Another idea on that same topic. Take your already existing toxin. Combine it with upper end GoD item. Makes it a lure based (toxin it was combined with). Extremly obnoxious triv and hard to obtain. Same thing with the double strength but easy to resist toxins. This would give rogues versitility which was always a key factor in being a rogue, but make it uber-rare drops (like 1/1000) in high end zones like flagged GoD (or even hanging gardens level, you'd pretty much need to consistantly farm to get any, which makes it tedious in a zone that is not condusive to soloing). Make sure the triv for this combine is really high as well.<br />
<br />
I can understand the poisons having become no longer useful, and I can understand Absor not wanting to go overboard and making it crack, so perhaps these suggestions will be taken... if not seriously then at least the basis for serious discussion to fix the problem everyone agrees exists.<br />
<br />
Feel free to tell me to shut up if I'm way off base here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Jinieren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I've been a rogue for over 5 years now. One of the things that caught me from the very beginning was that you could make poisons and apply them to do some extra damage. Few problems with it at the time - things like your poison could actually get interrupted, resists, availability, could only apply it to one blade for one shot (which still makes no sense aside from coding issues).<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, poisons have had very little in the way of upgrades since those days. It takes an entire quest, requiring you to be at least level 46 (to zone into PoFear), to get the grandmaster seal to make 10-dose poisons. We also now have the 15-minute poisons that are considered imbued procs (and therefore have stacking issues with spells with innate procs - Night's Dark Terror, Call of Fire, etc.).<br />
<br />
Since the beginning there have been 100 DD poisons, which were decent back in the Kunark era. There were the anti-undead and anti-summoned poisons as well which did slightly more damage. But now when we're facing mobs with 100k hp, and even with my poison proc buffs it adds a tiny bit of dps. Plus these new poisons don't even touch the apply poison skill.<br />
<br />
<br />
Possible solution?<br />
When a single poison takes 10-30 minutes to make because of porting around for parts, you're forced to do it in bulk. So camping for a couple hours for components equate to doing a couple hours of dps elsewhere.<br />
Make a series of quests with rogue guildmasters perhaps. Make the rewards of the quests give you ranks in poison making and reward you with an item that is similar to the Bidilis' Chain Leggings (the pants that summon poison). Enhance the other poisons so that they become useful only in special fights... these 125 poison procs are useless against big mobs.<br />
<br />
Procs in general have been rendered weak by mobs gaining hp. I remember the Blood Points from Charasis (Kunark era) were 80 point lifetaps. Why is it that the only weapons I've seen with any kind of significant procs since then are Ethereal Destroyers from PoTime with 750 DDs?<br />
<br />
<br />
One other idea...<br />
Maybe make certain poison fortes - skill trees similar to Abjuration, Evocation, Divination. Perhaps make it so that certain rogues can specialize in creating/using slow poisons, or DD/DoTs, or debuffs?<br />
Specializing in slow poisons could make rogues a somewhat viable class as a slower in exp groups. We already have locustlures and a few other slow weapons. In raids slow-oriented rogues would be useful for getting in a slow earlier than a shaman. Lives could be saved.<br />
Specializing in DD/DoTs would be the rogues who only go for the most damage and care nothing for the other trees. DoTs would be dangerous for raids because of their mez-breaking properties, but it's a risk they'd have to take.<br />
Specializing in debuffs would be an option for rogues who try to save other people mana (by lowering resists) or reduce the dexterity, agility, strength, or AC of a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Knomercy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">One of my biggest reasons for not using poisons is because they are lacking on the high end.<br />
<br />
For instance, my biggest frustration is the ornate leg stun poison. I use them alot when I am trying to gain agro on a mob, which works great. But lets face it, NOTHING in PoP is stunnable by this posion because of the level of the stun spell, yet its a PoP poison? Works great when I go solo PoHate as a rogue, but cmon now?<br />
<br />
Suggestions :<br />
<br />
Make another tier of poisons, give us some DD's that do 300dmg per proc at least, allowing 600dmg crits. Thats not unbalanced. Give us a 0 sec stun poison that works on mobs up to 65. (Add the GoD Scoundrel leggings to summon this new tiered stun poison). Make these new tiered poisons use common component drops in high end zones (kodtaz or qvic+).<br />
<br />
*** BIGGEST reason I rarely EVER make poisons, is because it takes hours to farm components for a poison that lasts 10 minutes. Muramite bile sack? Yea I have 7 in my bank, and i've farmed/cleared GoD to Inktu'ta since release. Don't be requiring this component unless you plan on increasing the drop rate.<br />
<br />
Lastly, give us a focus effect on the grandmaster assassin seal to enhance the effectiveness of poisons themselves, and/or extend the duration of the poison buff itself.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Talisen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I actually thought the weapons/items that proc/summon our poison wasnt a good idea. What's the point of having the ability to make poisons if all we have to do is click legs (???) to summon a batch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Wyloc Wormwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">yep i agree with both Knomercy (said the same thing before) and Jinieren. the poison system is so outdated and underpowered as to serve very little value, sorry Absor mate if ya dont agree, we're the ones that have been using it from way back. we've had 2 expansions gone by with no new ones.<br />
<br />
as you see it isnt just me that feels they badly need a boost. at higher end it just isnt worth it atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Shadus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I don't think you're going to see:<br />
	a. Permanently poisoned anything.  This would wipe out the idea of rogues making poisons for themselves.  It would basically mean that you'd make one dose of a poison and never make another until you changed weapons.<br />
	b. It seems to me that poisons should remain rogue only.  Selling them for others to use isn't something that sounds good to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
How about this-- Permenently poisoning THROWING ONLY weapons (ala shruken&lt;sp&gt;, throwing daggers, etc) normal things that are store buyable.<br />
<br />
This would serve two functions, 1) Make throwing a bit more worthwhile, 2) Make poison a bit more worth while, as you could &quot;prepare&quot; ahead of a raid.<br />
<br />
Perhaps something along this line:<br />
<br />
Poison Application Kit:<br />
 - Poison of any type a rogue can make<br />
 - 20 Throwing Daggers<br />
Result: 20 Throwing Daggers of Poison Type, NO DROP, Each has a proc chance just an effect on a bow.<br />
<br />
The additional thought occurs-- add some extra rogue poisons to help address having throwing being a fairly worthless skill compared to archery... like for instance poisons aimed specifically at distance and damage.  Againly only allow them to be applied to store bought ranged throwing weapons and make the weapons no drop.<br />
<br />
Swift Flight (my naming skills are not extraordinary)<br />
 - Ounce of Mild Acid<br />
 - Simple Thickener<br />
 - Stack of 20 Thrown Weapons<br />
Result: +50 range to a thrown weapon, NO DROP<br />
<br />
Magical Strike<br />
 - Vial of Viscous Mana<br />
 - Stack of 20 Thrown Weapons<br />
Result: MAGIC ITEM, NO DROP<br />
<br />
Be nice if you could combine several, but even additional damage, range, and magic items to standard thrown weapons would make them somewhat more viable.  Being able to add a poison to a stack of weapons stuff it in a pack and use it when you needed it would be nice.<br />
<br />
Edit: This also nix's the problem of making a weapon poisoned and it lasting forever, sure you can poison a stack or five of throwing daggers or whatever... but when they run outta, they run out, and then you gotta remake them.<br />
<br />
Edit2: Wouldn't even have to make them NO DROP at that point either if you wanted rogues to be able to trade with rogues, just make them ROG/ALL.  Other classes are to careless and would kill themselves if they played with our poison dontchaknow?<br />
<br />
Shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Volante</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Mage here, so I'm not sure if these would even seem reasonable from a rogue's point of view...but one thing that i liked about posions originally was their wide array of effects.  you had the basic dd/dots, yes, but there was also str debuffs, resist debuffs, ac debuffs...<br />
<br />
so what i was thinking is why not a more unique system than opposed to straight DD/DoT?<br />
<br />
how bout some big AC or AC/AGI debuffs?  that helps everyone's damage.  or if the tank's paper, shoot in a big STR debuff (or whatever it'd be) to make the mob do less damage.  WIS debuffer for clerics so they run out of mana faster (bit more evil than the usual mana drain).  <br />
<br />
or, but the coding behind this might be a bit complex if possible at all..., you know how GoD mobs have strengths and weaknesses to weapons?  how bout a poison that cuts through those defenses.  if a mob has a strong defense to piercing, the poison negates it (at differing rates) and if it's got a normal defense, well, it'll still help some.<br />
<br />
my 2 copper before i pass out from lack of sleep...just wanted to get this in before i forgot about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Wyloc Wormwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">hi Volante, thanks for your imput.<br />
would you as a spell caster say yes to Rogues having a better stackable debuff line?<br />
just a question you understand.<br />
<br />
atm we have one shots (take up space and time to apply) from kunark<br />
the application of these is very outdated in their use, but the effects were good.<br />
<br />
the best are<br />
Suseptable Essence (great poison btw pitty its a oneshot) lowers all resists except poison by 30 for 180sec<br />
<br />
Visceral Rot (personaly dont like DoTs but some do, even tho they mean you cant use Escape skill) DoT 232hp 58ticks Dex debuff 63 for348sec<br />
<br />
Disorientation (never realy used it but its there) debuff Agi 35 and AC 21 for 180sec<br />
<br />
im not going to include the britle haste &amp; berserker madness effects for reasons that people who used them know lol.<br />
.....................<br />
<br />
ok then we have the *new* advanced poisons these are RNG buff proc effects and the buff lasts for only 15mins<br />
<br />
Scratching Madness all resist debuff 10 for upto 60sec (umm great lol)<br />
<br />
Rage of Incapacitation (this one i do use *shock* but it was a quested recipie) hate reduction 150 debuff Dex 60 for upto 72sec<br />
<br />
Mangled Tendon (never used) hate reduction 150 debuff Str 60 for upto 72sec<br />
<br />
now consider that a Rogue debuff poison would stack with Spell caster debuffs, would you like to see a GOOD procing poison for resists? would you like to see your spells land easyer due to the fact you had a Rogue that took time to use poisons in your group/raid? would that be out of line?<br />
 <br />
proc buff duration needs to be greatly increased, 15mins before you have to burn another (for cost/farming/downtime in use/fails as they are high trivs etc) is just way to short. sure buffs that length are fine from a rightclicky item, but these are made and that takes time. <br />
<br />
anyway Volante  :) nice to see you in the shady poison valts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Talisen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Get a Jagged Time Forged Blade from time and you won't use rage anymore.. :\ I don't know if that was meant to help rogues or point out further that our poison abilities can be put down by weapon procs..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Wyloc Wormwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Talisen with a comment like that i may well put my ciggy out in your eye.<br />
having farmed Inny since begining of March and my guild has yet to see a Jagged Timeforged Blade drop, Bard songblades have got to the stage of any class randoming for them just for a laugh to destroy..... and not one JTB. <br />
we're doing better on RSS..... guilds got ONE of those.<br />
lol perhaps there is no problem with itemisation and there are so many Bards around to justify this drop rate *manic chuckle*<br />
<br />
so not the best thing to point out mate and will still be using RoInc for the time being.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Volante</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">well, of course make them stack.  why go through the hassle of making them if they don't?  <br />
<br />
however, i don't think rogues would need resist debuffs.  there's too many classes with that as it is.  70 mpcf resist off malosinia, 50 mr off tash, 35 fr off immolation of ro, 15 mcf from bards, more if they use their chants, sks have one now i think...<br />
<br />
basically after a mob's fully raid debuffed, if i can't land fire nukes for jack by then, a rogue poison dropping FR isn't gonna help me any.<br />
<br />
but statistic debuffs would be a nice niche.  make it easier for melees to do damage, or take less damage more than what spells can provide, and there's very few in the magic realm.  sure, there's cripple...but that's really about it.<br />
<br />
it seems more reasonable in my book that magic is used to cut through magical defenses (resists) and poisons (which affect the body directly) are used to cut through the body's strengths (stats)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Wyloc Wormwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">ok Volante,<br />
atm our resist/debuff poisons do stack with spells so thats all good, but doing so means they take up a debuff slot on mobs. now with the changes hopfully to buff slots it will mean more things can be used. but consider this, mob X is debuffed/DoT stacked and mister rogue thinks its a good idea to lower its resists by 10 (chuckle) or maybe lower its Str (any noticable effect? never found it really) thats another buff slot gone. now because of that pointless effect Jo the spell caster is unable to place his uber DoT on mob X.<br />
<br />
so effects have to be worth using not only in cost of production and time to make, but also to take up a buff slot.<br />
<br />
thats why DD's are so handy for us.<br />
<br />
ok back to debuffs. Stats? well lets look at what we can do already<br />
AGI<br />
STR<br />
DEX<br />
out of those Dex is the one of most value because it stacks with cripple and anything to help lower mob procs/effects is good. Str doesnt really seam to do much, yes i know it should but it doesnt really so doesnt get used. Agi? sounds good as it should lower AC as well, but again the return doesnt make it worth taking up a buff slot unlike Druid Ro. <br />
<br />
so what other stats could we work on? well how about Int and Wis debuffs? could be nice, how about add in a effect to increase Fizzle rate? sounds good, something that makes it hard to think and focus on what your doing and doesnt sound to overpowering.<br />
is that the type of thing your getting at?<br />
<br />
*wanders of into dreamland thinking about poisons that tranquilize monsters disabling their ability to Enrage/Infuriate* haha now that would be worth a buff slot *wink* :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Volante</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">so what other stats could we work on? well how about Int and Wis debuffs? could be nice, how about add in a effect to increase Fizzle rate? sounds good, something that makes it hard to think and focus on what your doing and doesnt sound to overpowering.<br />
is that the type of thing your getting at?yea, sort of.  btw, npcs have 30 slots, and i think even under raid conditions not all of those are used...<br />
<br />
i mean, there's malo/tash/slow/crip/ro...and after that it's pretty much dots or token debuffs.  <br />
<br />
but also, what about group situations?  there you'll have no problem worrying about taking a debuff slot.<br />
<br />

Str doesnt really seam to do much, yes i know it should but it doesnt really so doesnt get used.

<br />
(and not to toot my own horn, i did mention wis debuffs  (-8  same wavelength, np...anyway.  fizzle one would be good, but is it even possible for npcs to fizzle?  NEVER seen that...)<br />
<br />
DDs just seem to be a cop out; you're rogues!  sneaky!  stealth!  sly!  nothing says HELLO MR MOB!!!  more than a nice ka-BOOM in the butt  (-8<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Wyloc Wormwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">well it seams that mobs will be having 50 debuff/dot slots soon anyway. enough to make rogues use a Str debuff poison? haha nope not really, but its one obstical out the way. <br />
<br />
it still boils down to is it worth useing poison? <br />
poisons in EQ are not the deadly toxins you would of thought, poison &quot;spells&quot; do the poison damage haha thats mystical poison. not even Grandmaster Sealed Toxin maker can make something for a Ukun to cross its eyes. so much for the defence of Norath hahah.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Volante</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">hey!  i'm on your side here!<br />

<br />
i think one of the key reasons the dd/dot poisons rogues get are so terrible is that, possibly, soe feels they do enough damage as it is.  so while they're the easiest poison to conceptualize, it can't be overpowering and as a result turns into a toy.<br />
<br />
i'm just going on how i see poisons in a role playing aspect.  i don't see them as this ability to magically damage a mob, it's a liquid that penetrates the blood stream, so while dots are acceptable, dds are not.  it should weaken the mob from the inside out, instead of outside in, and in eq there aren't many effects like that.<br />
<br />
of course how things should be and how they are in game are two different behemoths.  i've got plenty of beefs with other systems, and how they don't seem realistic even in a fantasy world, and what poison making needs really, is an anchor.  something that *defines* what it does.  for example, alchemy is the brewing of potions to benefit the player.  that's it's anchor.  from that you can go and create potions of differing effects that benefit PCs.<br />
<br />
kunark seemed to start an anchor for poison making: you've got blind poison, brittle haste, dizzy...nothing really outstanding, though (even for then); nothing you'd see rogues clamoring to make.  without interest, it just petered out and became a parlor trick.<br />
<br />
currently, poison making's anchor loosely seems to be &quot;additional DPS.&quot;  i'm sure soe means well, but without any real focus, what can they do?  toss the dedicated a bone here and there, give them some recipes and trivials to find, and then shuffle it back in the corner.  couple that with balance issues, and you've got a pretty anemic skill.<br />
<br />
obviously, if you compare my ideas against the kunark poisons, they seem pretty yuck, but what if you had a wis debuffer of 125?  or an AC debuffer of 500?  neg 300 ATK?  make the numbers large enough, and they make excellent raid tools.  how bout a neg 100 AC?  or if the mechanics allow, maybe a neg 10% to dodge?  make the parts common enough, you have a nice grouping tool.<br />
<br />
i just think effects like this would give poison making a bit more interest and more usefulness than just straight damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Wyloc Wormwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">nods.<br />
ive got no problem with that mate. a wis or int stat reduser (clouds your mind), perhaps a silence poison to paralise the vocal cords, a good attack debuff etc.<br />
its more the fact that that as a tradeskill (its classed as that even tho we dont Trade them haha, so its trade as in make) no new recipies were added for 2 expansions. if the same thing had happened with Alchemy or Tinkering youd have players screaming blue murder. in fact Alchemy has crossed the line now, where before they were utility with good sale prospects, they now have offence with GoD snare/stun/dd thrown potions. did they need that ontop of upgrades like illusions and group effects?<br />
<br />
did you know that for our Slow proc poison we have to go and Fish for our componants? whats more the druation on the self buff is so short that you burn through it fast. the 15min length poisons are way to short but the slow one is well low level.<br />
Paralyzing Neurotoxin : Decrease Attack Speed by 30% for upto 2.0 mins. the buff icon lasts for 2mins, before you have to use another one. ever fished for Blowfish barbs?<br />
<br />
anyway that was added with LoY and was fine and great for the lvl of that expansion. however nothing in LDoN or GoD.<br />
<br />
you know it didnt even need to new effects to be &quot;upgrades&quot; could of used what was already there increased the buff druation (to something worthwile) or just minor upgrade eg the slow from 30 to 40. its not like we can chain use it, its for trying to solo or when the slower in the group dies; used in a pinch.<br />
<br />
i still think as the effects are already there, using Kunark poison effects as procs is whats needed. we have to spend a lot of time and money farming to make them anyway. try farming heartsting venom sacs via meleeing, you can waste hours of playtime on green mobs in a newbie zone for a few (takes 2 venoms to make) doses of oneshot.<br />
<br />
or if ideas are really lacking could just take the easy way out and have &quot;Bane&quot; poisons. Ooo we have these new mobs attacking norath, from your vast knowledge, trial &amp; error you find that by mixing cirtain substances you can exploit the weaknesses of these strange creatures.<br />
<br />
the stuffs there guys, 2 expansions without anything and you wonder why we are taking a stand and saying &quot;Oi hang on a minute&quot; before you throw yet another expansion out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Sauronis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">I feel that even if they do update our poisons with new recipes that most will be under utilized if the components are a royal pain in the arse to come by.  I stopped using poisons just for that reason.  The time it takes to acquire the necessary items isn't equal in value to the effects of the poisons available.  It got a little better with PoP and the ability to make 10 dose bottled versions but the time sink on farming the components remain.  Which was slightly helped with the portal stones.  <br />
<br />
Finding a new way to scatter the needed items throughout the game is key of course.  I don't expect to find Wyloc's &quot; heartsting venom sacs&quot; while we clear T3 but it would be nice to see more poison components drop off higher end stuff that could possibly be used or processed for use in other various recipes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Talisen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">What would be nice is a Rogue version of the Forage skill that only finds poison reagents. That and actually getting poison glands or blood or some other excretion from mobs that makes a bit of sense as to what it has to do with creating a poison. I would actually prefer to have to farm poison components off of greens than buy them at a merchant, that is if they dropped every kill and the mobs aren't a bitch to find. Maybe a skill that you use on a corpse to find parts for poisons? Oh I know, just make Apply Poison do that! It does nothing else~ or Pickpocket! <br />
<br />
Anyone ever try hunting the plants in Emerald Jungle? I did..for 3 hours..for 10 attempts at a poison with a trivial over 300..IN KUNARK..when make poison was maxed at 200, guess how many I successfully made? One. Guess when I used it? I still have yet to find an important enough event to waste it on. That's right, it has sat in my bank for almost 4 REAL YEARS.<br />
<br />
Nevermind.. I give up, I find no fun in EQ at all anymore. At first I thought new levels might be fun, then I asked myself &quot;what would I get out of them?&quot; My answer: Requirements for new AA.<br />
<br />
Thats all levels are anymore, a requirement to get new AA that once you get the level for you have to save up 5/10/15/20/25 AA in order to get a 5% increase in dodge. I'm sorry but this makes little sense for anything other than to keep people around.<br />
<br />
What about hit points you say? What about them? I have 1885hp naked. I have 7000hp with my equipment. Leveling to 70 will give such trivial hp it won't even matter, not with how many stats are on items. <br />
<br />
That's another issue I have with EQ at the moment. The stats don't even make sense anymore. Armor Class on weapons/earrings/rings/bows? WTF is that? 200+hp on every slot? Food and drink with stats? I can't wait to see the expansion after Omens of War, we'll be getting 500hp 50ac 30/19 daggers that proc Nibble of the Shissar.<br />
<br />
I thought maybe doing the epic 2 will be fun..then I read they're over 30 pages long each and require a full sized raid for the end parts. All of that for &quot;the high end of high end weapons&quot; that we'll bag for better stuff a couple of expansions down the road.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry..this is turning into one of those posts.. I'll shush ;\</div></div><hr />

ok im gonna take a stab in the dark and say that the strike poisons will either have a secondry effect or i hope a damage upgrade as Strike Poison is also 125dd and Lesser Strike poison is 75dd<br />
Concussion Poison is 75 (0sec stun/65 that never does anything) so the grade 3 is a boost of 75&gt;95. umm super, click those Stanos legs guys 20pts is not gonna make rogues use it.<br />
Destroy Mind poison, well ya fine on that (did you guys ever use it?) Decrease Mana by 300 &gt; 375 &gt; 450. numbers look ok for increase but not my bag so leave others to comment on it. same with Corruption Poison &amp; Vein Rot Poison, if DoT's are your thing please comment, i dont use them becuse it makes Escape and all the AA i spent cutting the timer down on it pointless.<br />
<br />
ill watch and see what happens on the Strike poison front to see what the final result is, but if this is it? i'll pack my pestal n' morter away for good and advise the new rogues who ask me about poisons to just not bother, save your time and go buy a LDoN proc instead. <br />

<br />
i was thinking of something along the lines of PoP proccing poisons, but as a limited-charge clickie effect instead. for example, a successful application would give the weapon 5 charges of a 5 second stun, with an instant or short (1 second? 2?) cast time, and a 7-10 second recast. the effects would, of course, still be resistable. this way, though, we would be able to strategically time our poison strikes, and would avoid things like proccing a DoT on a mob when it's at 2% health. <br />
<br />
thoughts?<br />
<br />
edit: (had to retype this, my computer ate it the first time, hope i didn't leave out anything vital  :D )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Wyloc Wormwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">hi etitameh,<br />
<br />
when you get a bit higher, id be interested in how you feel poisons are, thats not to say i dont value your opinon atm, it just nice sometimes to get a fresh view as ive been doing this for so long.<br />
<br />
ok lets break down what you've put forward.<br />
<br />
poisons as a right clicky:<br />
well as you may know kunark poisons were a right clicky. you also had to apply it, a skill that is pointless with advanced poisons as there is no skill check. these were one shots and fired off the first hit after application (as long as you didnt die/LD or zone) and the effect was classed as being the rogue was imbued with poison not a weapon; so it could fire off either hand striking.<br />
now you want to imbue a weapon with a poison that has charges that you can use at will? <br />
ok i dont think thats going to work mate, i would beleave thats going to be a radical code rewrite and more work than i expect our lovely devs would be willing to put into the skill.<br />
now if you mean we would make a poison, stackable poison that would sit in gen slot or ammo that was insta cast/clicky then fired off next hit/cast at the target in effect with a single result. eg stackable kunark poisons with instant apply (no having to sit) then i agree yes its what i would like to see.<br />
<br />
note you would still have to spend time farming and making poisons, which a lot of rogues detest. but when you had made them and stocked up your bags ready for adventure you would have something worthwhile to be used and counted on, not some iffy random proc. <br />
<br />
something that Absor brought up way back in this discusion, was that he didnt want poisons to be to good thus forcing the rogues who dont want to make poison feel they need to. well atm what about those rogues who do (or rather did) spend a lot of time with poisons for damage upgrade thats less than a ldon proc. whats the point? one could retort that if they dont spend the time making something usefull them then thats their loss. atm there is very little reason to make poison at high end, the difference between damage output of a grandmaster lvl 65 poisoner and lvl 65 rogue is all with equipment, poisons have little to no impact on it. if both rogues were of the same equipment lvl you would be hard pressed to spot the difference. so why bother ?<br />
<br />
anyway before cloud your path to much i better leave it at that. enjoy your adventuring and have fun on the way, dont rush it, take your time. poisons can be great fun at low levels and can mean the difference between life n death. alas it doesnt translate to the higher end of the game.</div></div><hr />

1. Poisons - <br />
<br />
A. Integrate all old world poisons into the PoP poison system (including the ability to make 10 dose vials with the 10-15 min durations) <br />
<br />
B. Make poisons more viable by modifying the resist checks so they aren't so easily resisted. <br />
<br />
C. Add new, interesting, and more powerful poison recipes. Extremely powerful, but extremely rare poisons would be a nice addition. <br />
<br />
D. Add an upgrade to the poison mastery AA that would allow increased durations, effectiveness, and the ability to poison others weapons. <br />
<br />
E. Reduce the time investment required to collect components for lesser or more common poisons. Possibly through a better yield in combines or more components being made purchasable. <br />
<br />
F. Add the ability to poison thrown weapons.</div></div><hr />

Right now those are set to give the same increase, as a percent, as most other things will be increasing in power.  I can take your suggestions to the team, but I wouldn't hope for your poisons to improve at a greater scale than anything else.<br />
<br />
Do me a favor, compile what you think these should look like and the reasons why.  &quot;I want more&quot; isn't a reason... :)  If one of you could email me such a list, I can take it to someone to look over.  Right now, those values were set based on balance with all the other gains rogues will be getting (new items, levels, etc.) and you'll need a good argument to get them changed.<br />

<br />
Right now those are set to give the same increase, as a percent, as most other things will be increasing in power.<br />
<br />
now hang on lets look at that. we have strike poison = 125dd atm so strike 2 and 3 also doing 125dd is a 0% increase isnt it? <br />
<br />
Right now, those values were set based on balance with all the other gains rogues will be getting (new items, levels, etc.)<br />
<br />
i must say that a 0% really makes me want to continue poisoning in OoW and if thats in line with the &quot;gains&quot; via weapons, levels and AA then why bother?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Leiany</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">When I played a rogue I also dreamt about poisoned arrows but thats never going to be supported I guess.<br />
<br />
But how about bane poison (usable by rogues only)? <br />
<br />
Bane dmg wps are quite rare and a rogue who can prepare his weapon for the mob to be encountered would be both in group demand and regarding skilling up it could make for a whole new path!<br />
<br />
Bane poison does damage to a certain race/mob only and so has to be combined with body parts or other drops from the appropriate creatures<br />
<br />
low lvl mobs = low triv = low dmg<br />
higher lvl mobs = higher triv =more dmg<br />
<br />
So introducing this kind of poison it could<br />
+bring lots of otherwise worthless mobs drops to some use<br />
+provide a skilling path where drops become more important than vendor bought stuff<br />
+give rogues some poison that they will be eager to craft and matches their combat lvl <br />
(its not going to be unbalanced, a 30th rogue who can craft bane poison against 40 lv mobs still has only use for it if he can face that mob at all)<br />
+provide rogues with more group or even raid value<br />
(just imagine 6 rogues with the appropriate bane poison hitting the same mob)<br />
+(my favourite)gives back that spirit that underrating rogues is a costly mistake <br />
(Now what you think this dagger can do to me, human?  :D )<br />
<br />
So what you rogues think about it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>KyStromm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">I understand that recoding how poisons work may be a daunting task, but if it had been done realistically in the first place, we wouldn't need this discussion now.<br />
It makes no sense that I would apply poison to my right hand, then have it be effective on my first non-BS strike, or at least the chance of the proc. I would apply to a blade, be it weilded or thrown or sent via a bow. Many guerilla warfare tactics involve coating with noxious substances. Rogues should be able to take a weapon from a friend, 'treat' it, and have it proc according to the abilities of the weilder. <br />
It does make sense to have it become ineffective after a time, either the poison dries, and is useless, or it's wiped off by applications. Cleric's * of Vie is a damage absorbing shield that works in a reverse manner to what we're talking about. If parts of the code already understand how to deal with <br />
if(30 min elapsed since cast;OR;1500hp absorbed;cancel spell)else spell remains in effect.<br />
then it cannot be too much of a stretch to deploy <br />
if(15 min; OR; successful strike {or X successes}; cancel poison) else poison remains. As applied to a weapon, not a slot.<br />
Making the effect no rent is fine, but why would the blade disappear because it's poison became inert? That doesn't make sense.<br />
I haven't had too much trouble with resisted poisons, and it only seems to happen when I'm over my head. I don't aggree with a MEZ poison line, but the stun is sensible. This is what spiders, jellyfish and some snakes do to their prey, and  but this is the muscle lock line, isn't it? I would have assumed it would stop all movement for a few seconds, or more depending on the tier of the poison, then the mob would be sluggish for a while.<br />
Regarding farming, I'm lucky, my guildmates know my obsession with becoming an accomplished poisoner, and save the drops for me, and permit me the few seconds needed to apply it. My only complaint in that is TLC killing the possibility of geting a decent drop rate on farming, but that's a cross-tradeskill argument. Why a level 5 'needs' a snake egg, spiderling silk or poison sack more than a 65 still /boggles me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Ironoak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">If you don't want rogues to be able to sell poisons or poisoned weapons then don't call it a tradeskill and allow rogues to skill up Poison Making to 250 and and one other tradeskill to 250 without using up AA points.<br />
<br />
I am a 65 Rogue with a 250 poison skill that doesn't use poisons for all of the same reasons mentioned in this thread. I wish Absor the best of luck finding a rogue that uses poisons on a regular basis. <br />
<br />
I don't think Rogues need to mez mobs either but a root poison might be nice.<br />
<br />
Would it be possible to make the old one shot poisons either stack or combine? They would not necessarily have to proc like the PoP poisons. They could have the same affect when combined, they would just be good for more applications before disappearing. It would be nice to not have to carry individual little jars or 4 to 6 stacks of the materials required for 1 poison. The old shaman potions combine. Seems like whatever code does it for the shaman should work for the rogue.<br />
<br />
Not that I ever expect it to happen but I would like to have poisons make my rogue powerful enough to survive a solo fight with a dark blue mob. As it stands now, I usually have to run from light blue and even green mobs if I am alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Raddan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">These ideas have been mentioned before, but Absorb hasn't been around in a while, and I am convinced the ideas should be considered, so I post again...<br />
<br />
1.  Allow us to combine a single-dose poison with a stack of summoned (bloody ancille's pouch) arrows, throwing daggers or shrukens, with the result being a stack of no-rent, poisoned ammo items we can use or pass out on raids or LDoN's.  No one is asking to get rich.  Go ahead and make them no-rent, but please do implement this practical application of the tradeskill.<br />
<br />
2.  Get rid of the apply poison skill altogether.  It serves no purpose but to frustrate.  If you want to have a second skill check, like pottery, fine, but like pottery, make it the one skill.<br />
<br />
3.  Allow the old world poisons to be combined into the the PoP proc version.  Actually, for me, this wouldn't really do much to bring the skill back to life, but after two expansion of nothing, throw us this bone.<br />
<br />
4.  Increase drop rates.  I spent an hour in FoB, killed 50 ish heartstring scorpions, and yielded 9 heartstring venom sacks...enough for 4 doses.  Come on!  Let me buy the components, or increase the drop rates (go ahead and put the components for useful stuff like &quot;slow&quot; poisons on tougher mobs if you must balance it somehow, it's lame killing those scorpions anyway.....a tier three poison ingredient on a level ten mob???<br />
<br />
5.  Make a tier 4 and 5 slow poison.  It's the only poison effect I'd use no matter what the cost, given the hate-reduction poisons are only worth the cost on raids and I can get the free scorpion bile from my ornate pants for added damage in XP groups.<br />
<br />
6.  I watched Kill Bill vol 2 yesterday.  A guy was paralyzed with the poison of a black mamba.  Paralyzed as in can't move, not reduced movement (snare) or attack rate (slow).  A 30-90 sec stun (not calling it mez anymore) poison is something that is parallel to what exists in the real world (LOL assuming what was in the movie is true, which is probably not a wise practice!)   D&amp;D rogues can stun/knockout their prey via a sneak attack with a blackjack/cudgel.  WoW rogues also have that power.  The ability of the class to provide a minor degree of CC is part of existing fantasy RPG, and well as MMORPG's.  Please open up your minds.  NO ONE is asking to replace the role of a chanter or bard.  We are talking once-in-awhile use to help complete a quest or bail a group out in an emergency.  The tradeskill is badly in need of some new wrinkles.<br />
<br />
7.  Please do provide some feedback for resists.  I think it is of the upmost importance for the pre-level 65 raider.  That's the toon that REALLY needs that hate-reduction poison to land, in order to survive and continue to contribute to the kill.<br />

Manufacturing poisons that you could apply at the beginning of an XP run, and then apply to your weapon once for the duration. Making it an augment would allow you to have different items with different poisons in storage.<br />
<br />
Recipe:<br />
Poison (whichever) x4<br />
Viscous Substance x2<br />
Combine in a heat source of some sorts.<br />
<br />
Creates a Melee Augment (Type ?) that lasts until you log out, cannot be traded, and can be applied to whichever weapon. Care in coding would have to be taken to ensure that the Augment doesn't make the weapon itself NO RENT. I don't know if that can be done.<br />
<br />
Further thought on this arc, take one or more of the new Augments, a stack of arrows (new fletch recipe, perhaps, or specify a certain arrow class that can use them) or throwing knives, create a stack of no-rent proccing ranged weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Raddan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">What I posted yesterday, applying a single dose poison to a stack of arrows or daggers or whatever, obviuosly violates the no-stacked-items in a tradeskill container rule.<br />
<br />
I would imagine the augment &quot;birdbath&quot; is also considered a tradeskill container with regards to programming code.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can think of is utilizing the spell icons.  Once we learn a recipie, make it accesible via the spell icon, and the poison we made would be the reagant.  We'd put our weapon, or a stack of arrows or whatever on our cursor and &quot;cast&quot;, and whatever is on our cursor would then receive the poison.<br />
<br />
LOL still sounds like too much to ask for!  As much as I think poisoning range items should be done, I can't imagine doing it one arrow at a time.  And I can't think of a way around it, other than the use of the spell icons, which was someone else's idea.<br />
<br />
Finally, I do like the idea of mix-and-match recipies.  If you increase the dose with more reagants, it makes sense the damage should be greater or the duration should be longer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Aina5</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">Im not sure if someone mentioned this, or if it'd be possible at all, with balancing issues etc, but would it be possible to make poisons stack with a lot more things? So far as I see I dont see them stacking with buff spells that add procs, and a lot of weapons don't proc both the poison and the proc on your weapon.<br />
<br />
Sorry if someone said this already, its hard to go into a long written out thread and read everything written into it.<br />
<br />
A few other things to make poison better imo might be to add some buff type effects to poisons, maybe poisons that increase haste over cap by just a bit, add atk to you, or other things that are useful but not unbalancing to rogues. I mean sure adding something like this would be more like adding alchemy potion recipes into the Make Poison database, but these are ideas, or at least a way to broaden this tradeskill without making it way overpowered.<br />
<br />
A way to draw people into using this tradeskill for more than just a cheap way to get a 100% wr bag for almost free, and a little more useful than just using it towards coldain ring quest.<br />
<br />
The reason's I'd mention haste over cap / atk, is because I do not see any self buffable ways to do this, a few other ideas might be a non resistable stun proc.<br />
<br />
I'd say this because just by increasing the dmg that poisons do, wouldnt really draw people into working this tradeskill more, as we'd still have to most likely rely on druids to forage us poison components...<br />
<br />
Another idea might be to add poison to armor, you know, throw ur armor into the mortar and pestle with poison, and it adds a ds or makes your armor proc poison, and have to recharge it when a certain amount of procs go off, 20 - 50 type deal, could maybe throw 10 charge poisons in, like 5 at a time to get 50 procs etc... Or is that too unbalancing?<br />
<br />
Unless of course they made ground spawns for really high end poison components in places you can only get to safely with SoS.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my ideas are probably really unbalancing, I dont think you could really draw people into Make Poison tradeskill without unbalancing things a little bit. &gt;&lt;  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Ironoak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">I take back everthing I said about not being able to sell poisons. I finally sold one the other day. It seems they are being used in quests. I will never be as wealthy as caster who can sell his spell casts but at least I can get back some of the money I sunk into this otherwise useless tradeskill.<br />
<br />
I would, however, like to know why they put the little Gates quests in for Mauramite Blood Distallate and Mauramite Bile if they never had any intention of creating a poison or at least making these items useful to one of the other tradeskills. You know, the tradeskills they don't seem to have any trouble coming up with new recipes for without asking the users to do it for them.<br />
<br />
I would also like to know where all of these weapons and equipment are located that are suppose to make a Rogue more balanced that Absor was talking about. I get the impression that the team that is in charge of Rogues knows nothing about rogues. There just seems to be a lot of untapped potential there with all of the rogue skills, not just poisoning.<br />
<br />
One other thing, what is the SOE definition of balanced as it applies to Rogues?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Wyloc Wormwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">just a bump really as been asked about my opinon on poisons, theres plenty of information in here for ya.<br />
<br />
the aug idea is a great boon, myself i thought it would of made sense to have poison making for weapon proc augs *shrug* but the devs didnt wanna go down that path. <br />
make the most out of what we got. use your skills to construct augs, poison making as a useful skill for what it was ment to do.... well those of you who spent years with them know the score there. just aint worth it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">Folks, before this degenerates further into griping and complaining, let's remember a few things:<br />
<br />
These are NOT the SOE forums, they are the EQTC forums.  As such, SOE staff are not in any way, shape or form required to answer questions over here.  Nor should they be expected to do so. When/if they respond over here, remember that it is a courtesy to the community, not something they're required to do.  Mind your manners.  :)<br />
<br />
We've also wandered from questions on poisons, to questions of overall balance, weapons, gear questions, etc.  ... and folks are toeing the line in some cases into getting this punted over to Primal Scream and/or locked.<br />
<br />
I know the rogue community at large has a long-standing unhappiness about poisons, but please, let's remember where you are.<br />
<br />
Now, don't make me steal the pestle from someone's mortar and chase the complainers until someone actually attempts to make some of the new OoW poisons that haven't been solved yet.  ;)</div></div><hr />
