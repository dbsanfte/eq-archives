<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaysha Soulsinger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Based on information discussed in this topic (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/showthread.php?t=16010), I was able to derive the following formula:<br />
<br />
Y = [#att * 21 * ST ] / [ 800,000 * ln { ( 200 - SK1) / (200-SK2) } ]<br />
<br />
For more details regarding restrictions on its valid ranges for skills, success rate and statistics, as well as discussions about the formula, consult the linked topic.<br />
<br />
This topic is purely intended to collect raw data from various Tradeskills, to establish a value for the tradeskill difficulty Y of that particular Tradeskill.<br />
<br />
FINDINGS UP TO NOW (based on the below data)<br />
<br />
Blacksmithing: Y = 2<br />
Jewelry Making: Y = 2 or 3 (See Note 1 below)<br />
Baking: Y = 3 (See Note 2 below)<br />
Brewing: Y = 2 or 3 (See Note 3 below)<br />
Fletching: Y = 4<br />
<br />
FINDINGS UP TO NOW (based on data from other topics - with link)<br />
<br />
Fletching: Y = 4 (Source: How to calculate the tradeskill difficulty (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/showpost.php?p=118553&amp;postcount=30))<br />
<br />
Note 1: More data is needed. This trial run was very expensive though (as success rate was only around 5%), so I don't feel like repeating this often ;).<br />
Note 2: My data has a very bad run from attempt #160-ish to #320-ish; that portion alone would yield a Y = 6, so I have rounded the overal value for Y (would be 3.65) down to 3. Excluding that portion would yield an overall value of Y = 3.03.<br />
Note 3: My current data is not conclusive. Overall, I find an Y-value of 2.5 over 320 combines. The first portion yields a Y-value of 2, whereas the second portion yields a Y-value of 3. More data is needed.</div></div><hr />

I logged onto my Human Rogue Alt, level 16, who started off with 0 Blacksmithing. After having prepped the necessary components with my Cleric, I had enough for 160 combines.<br />
<br />
My Rogue had the following stats: 129 STR, 88 STA, 102 AGI, 99 DEX, 75 WIS, 78 INT, 75 CHA. He had no Geerlock or other +% item equipped. Below is the result of making 160 Embroidering Needle attempts (trivial 122):<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jarak_akn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nice double post :-)<br />
<br />
Do you want me to repost my fletching data here ? <br />
I have already posted it in the other thread, plus was done with Int 255,so is not a totally valid test (Cant find Y=2) <br />
<br />
Saying all that running the whole run up to 182 through the formular gives <br />
2.89 or &quot;probably 3&quot;<br />
<br />
However looking at the individual itmes speratly give everything from 0.99 to 3.50<br />
<br />
So make of it what you will.<br />
<br />
Jarak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaysha Soulsinger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you want to, sure. I didn't repost your data, as I didn't want to cross you with that ;) - so I leave it up to you.<br />
<br />
It's not a double post, by the way. The first batch is a Blacksmithing run I did, the second one a Jewelry Making run :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nitpaac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Y = [#att * 21 * ST ] / [ 800,000 * ln { ( 200 - SK1) / (200-SK2) } ]<br />
<br />
Blacksmithing: Y = 2<br />
Jewelry Making: Y = 2 or 3<br />
<br />
Excuse me for stating the obvious, but before I start any skillup runs, can I get this straight for a last time?<br />
Prerequisite for getting data is:<br />
- Your Stat ST (formerly known as S) should be below 200.<br />
- Your skill SK2 should not exceed 190.<br />
- You should never get more than the minimal chance of success:<br />
maximum skill for a given trivial MS= (0.75 * trivial) - 46.5<br />
<br />
<br />
Your blacksmithing data:<br />
Embroidering Needle, Trivial 122: MS = 45<br />
ST = 129 (str)<br />
SK1 = 0  (&quot;starting&quot; skill level)<br />
SK2 = 45 (&quot;target&quot; skill level)<br />
#att = 138 (you reached skill 45 with the 138th attempt)<br />
<br />
=&gt; Y= [138*21*129] / [800000 * ln(200/155)] = 1.833<br />
<br />
Your JC data:<br />
Electrum Fire Wedding Ring, Trivial 124: MS = 46<br />
ST = 63 (78 int - 15)<br />
SK1 = 0<br />
SK2 = 20<br />
#att = 156<br />
<br />
=&gt; Y=[156*21*63] / [800000 * ln(200/180)] = 2.449<br />
<br />
That's it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kaysha Soulsinger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Correct for the most part. Besides needing to have SK2 &lt;= 190, you also need SK1 &lt; SK2 (as equality means no skillups, causing ln-term to be 0, which makes Y infinitely large ;) ). Furthermore, I always used the full batch of 160 attempts, using the skill I had after that combine in the formula. The difference in choice only provides statistical noise, for the most part.<br />
<br />
If your chance of success W changes to something higher than 5%, you need to alter the 21 in the formula and add 1 to it for every 5% increase in successrate. Note that this idea of using a factor W is only a way of averaging your skillups due to failures and due to successes. A more thorough analysis would require one to carefully consider skillups due to successes and skillups due to failures.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aethn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Need to point something out here that might have skewed your data.  For the most part you used approx. 122 trival recipes in all cases but Brewing and Baking.  Both with approx. 135 trivial values.<br />
<br />
Note that the brewing and baking both scored as more difficult skills.  I believe this is partly due to you using a recipe 10+ points higher in trival then the others, which scored lower (accept fletching, which had its skill progression altered a few years back to be harder, if I recall correctly).<br />
<br />
So with this in mind, your results are invalid as a statistical analysis due to the lack of a common control point being used.  To achieve a correct correlation from skill to skill, you need to pick recipes equal to or within a point or two of each other.  If you chose 122, then you can not vary beyond 120-124, or you data will not be the same from skill to skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaysha Soulsinger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The trivial is high enough, though, to be at the bottom of the success curve. You can see this by looking at the ratio's of the successes vs. failures, and the nr. of skillups on successes vs. failures.<br />
<br />
Looking at my data, I see...<br />
(name - successrate - skillups on successes)<br />
Smithing: ~4.375%, ~9.09%<br />
Jewelry Making: ~7.5%, ~10%<br />
Baking: ~4.375, ~10.26%<br />
Brewing: ~6.25%, ~10.52%<br />
Fletching: ~6.25%, ~11.11%<br />
<br />
The expected values for a minimum success rate are 5% and 10% respectively. As you can see, Baking (with a trivial of 135) matches up with Smithing (with a trivial of 122), when looking at the successrate.<br />
<br />
By the way, someone else calculated the minimum trivial needed to skill up to 45-ish and still be at the bottom of the successcurve (i.e. 5%), it can be found here (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/showpost.php?p=118148&amp;postcount=7)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Suani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The God Progressive Quests (http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q142&amp;menustr=120037000000) can get us to skill level 54 for free. <br />
<br />
This would be time-consuming if all we want is data to estimate the level of difficulty in the skillup formula. However the first level of the quest gets us to level 31 without the need to finish the quest. We can create a new character, gather data, erase the character and start again.<br />
<br />
The next problem is getting a newbie pc to Abysmal Sea. You need an Adventurer's Stone from a level 15 quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2641). This can be done on the Test server. The /testbuffme grows you instantly to level 25.<br />
<br />
I didn't have a character on Test before so the first one had to make a little money to pay for tradeskill containers. Two greater lightstones from wisps in North Karana turned in for Concordances of Research were enough for the two characters I created and for many more if I needed them.<br />
<br />
I found out to my chagrin that level 25 is not high enough for the level-limited tradeskills. I could get only 4 skillups in alchemy from my shaman starting from skill 1.<br />
<br />
The last problem is to use of the data to estimate difficulty. I came up with a way that I will present later here.<br />
<br />
The following messages will give you the data for each tradeskill in turn. I compiled them for you rather than showing the logs to save you work and because it's trickier than it seems. A skillup is shown after a failed combine, but before a successful one. I had to match time stamps.<br />
<br />
I also compiled Kaysha's logs where available.<br />
<br />
From this data I estimate the following values for the difficulty Y in the skillup formula:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Baking   3<br />
 Brewing   3<br />
 Fletching   4<br />
 Jewelcraft   3<br />
 Pottery   4<br />
 Smithing   2<br />
 Tailoring   2</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Suani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">This data on Alchemy came from a character on Test. At level 25, the skill cap is 5. Since the character started with 1 skill point, there are only 4 skillups.<br />
<br />
S is the maximum adjusted stat, Trivial is the trivial level of the item attempted, Skill is the skill when the attempt is made (not the skill achieved), Made is the number of times the item was successfully made, Failed is the number of times the attempt failed, and SuOnMd is true when the skillup came on a successful combine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kaysha Soulsinger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The following messages will give you the data for each tradeskill in turn. I compiled them for you rather than showing the logs to save you work and because it's trickier than it seems. A skillup is shown after a failed combine, but before a successful one. I had to match time stamps.<br />
<br />
This is the reason I posted my logs with time stamp  :cool: <br />
<br />
From this data I estimate the following values for the difficulty Y in the skillup formula:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Baking   3<br />
 Brewing   3<br />
 Fletching   4<br />
 Jewelcraft   3<br />
 Pottery   4<br />
 Smithing   2<br />
 Tailoring   2<br />
<br />
<br />
I think this is the first more or less conclusive list of what we have to deal with when skilling up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think this is the first more or less conclusive list of what we have to deal with when skilling up.<br />
This conflicts with the one difficulty Tanker did give us -- Tailoring is supposed to be three, according to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The God Progressive Quests (http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q142&amp;menustr=120037000000) can get us to skill level 54 for free. <br />
<br />
This would be time-consuming if all we want is data to estimate the level of difficulty in the skillup formula. However the first level of the quest gets us to level 31 without the need to finish the quest. We can create a new character, gather data, erase the character and start again.<br />
<br />
The next problem is getting a newbie pc to Abysmal Sea. You need an Adventurer's Stone from a level 15 quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2641). This can be done on the Test server. The /testbuffme grows you instantly to level 25.<br />
<br />
I didn't have a character on Test before so the first one had to make a little money to pay for tradeskill containers. Two greater lightstones from wisps in North Karana turned in for Concordances of Research were enough for the two characters I created and for many more if I needed them.<br />
<br />
I found out to my chagrin that level 25 is not high enough for the level-limited tradeskills. I could get only 4 skillups in alchemy from my shaman starting from skill 1.<br />
<br />
The last problem is to use of the data to estimate difficulty. I came up with a way that I will present later here.<br />
<br />
The following messages will give you the data for each tradeskill in turn. I compiled them for you rather than showing the logs to save you work and because it's trickier than it seems. A skillup is shown after a failed combine, but before a successful one. I had to match time stamps.<br />
<br />
I also compiled Kaysha's logs where available.<br />
<br />
From this data I estimate the following values for the difficulty Y in the skillup formula:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Baking   3<br />
 Brewing   3<br />
 Fletching   4<br />
 Jewelcraft   3<br />
 Pottery   4<br />
 Smithing   2<br />
 Tailoring   2<br />
<br />
<br />
Very good work.<br />
<br />
What I would like to see further, is more people doing the same thing to get a larger data pool.  This larger data pool will help deal with the randomness factor, and get us better results.  If there can be 10 sets of data for each tradeskill, it at least goes a long way at reducing the random factor.  (of course we really need HUGE sets of like 1000 each to be more certain... but that is expecting too much)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been worrying about the possibility that dificulties are different on Test. I will dust off a level 20 I haven't played in years and do the quests on Live.<br />
<br />
Apart from the math, skilling tailoring did feel easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">It is also posible that your data pool is too small and you got hit by the randomness factor that is inherant to this.  That randomness factor sqewed the numbers.</div></div><hr />
