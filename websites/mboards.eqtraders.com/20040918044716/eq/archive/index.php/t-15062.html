<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was curious if there was a demand in Bazaar for the Tuna and Crab from Abysmal Sea. Did anyone find that their servers have a demand for this in Bazaar?<br />
Also.....did the Nerf cause the catches of Tuna and Crab to be reduced? Or was only the price NPC's pay reduced?<br />
I was wondering if the quantity of Fish you catch was nerfed as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From what I understand, only the price that you can get from NPCs for the crab and tuna has been nerfed.<br />
<br />
As for demand in the Bazaar, all I've seen for sale is mostly Cragbeast and Hynid meat (and its the 20lb ones I've seen). There's a vendor or two selling 1lb Crab (no Tuna, last time I looked), but it doesn't look like they're making any sales.<br />
<br />
When I was fishing in Abysmal, I socked away a Deluxe Toolbox filled with Crab and Tuna - the 1lbs mostly, though I did convert some to meat - but I did that so I could have it to use for raising my Baking skill down the road, as I foresaw the nerfing happening eventually, and would rather get a sure thing by selling to vendors than risk stuffing some on my Bazaar mule (although I did xfer the Crab and Tuna to the mule for storage, since it'll be a while before I plan on using it).<br />
<br />
Now, if they'd just put the Ground Pepper, Lemon, Garlic, etc, on a vendor somewhere other than Abysmal, so I don't have to go back to buy it so I can brew up sauces.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So is Abysmal Sea a Ghost Town now...................is that Fishing Platform on the boat Q.O.T. totally empty 24/7 now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>vovinit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Last 2 times i was there i seen 3-4 peeps in zone and those were oocing asking what happened to the fishing. So yeah it's a ghost town. Abysmal is basically a pok that's really hard to get to so there is little to no incentive to go there anymore except for quests. It's a pitty that they put so much time and effort into making that zone only to have it abandoned a month after it was released. I feel strongly that they will be putting a pok book on the boat soon to try to spice up the activity in this zone. If they dont then I doubt it will ever recover.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did anyone ever get anything worthwhile out of the Crab Traps? Best I got was one 9 pound Crab and Cloth caps. Most of the time was empty.<br />
Did anybody get anything different from the Traps?<br />
Maybe some diehard Fisherman will continue to fish the platform on the boat in Abysmal Sea since that can be  relaxing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Even a magus in there would be wonderful. I mean you have to wonder, the wayfarers are this powerful group that can transport you across Norrath in a few seconds, are going up against the newest big bad, have access to incredibly powerful magical items they give to those who are worthy, have built an entire city on the biggest boat in the world - yet they can't train and station a single magus on said boat and instead rely on mundane shuttles to reach it? These are not smart people. No wonder they keep getting captured by all the LDoN and GoD creatures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tricsun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dunno about you, but last i heard abysmal was a tradeskillers paradise.  I go there all the time to do pottery, baking, brewing, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dory</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you're not a porting/gating class, it's faster to do your tradeskilling based in PoK and the cities it gives access to even if you have to run around a couple zones.<br />
For meleers without gating capabilities, Abysmal can be a good 45 minutes travel time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I still fish in abysmal sea but now only for tuna to make my chanter up some Beer-Battered Tuna Sandwiches. For my money this is the best effort to effect ratio for INT enhancing food I can find just now - otherwise it's now a complete wasteland out there.<br />
<br />
Unless a porting mage or a PoK portal is installed in that zone pronto then it's going to continue to be a backwater for a long, long time. About the only other thing that may revive the zone is if a new set of adventure merchants are installed on board.<br />
<br />
No, I'm not going to go on about how bad the nerf was but the devs need to do something fast with this zone to revitalise it or it just will never turn into he trade skill mecca that they billed it as. Yes I know that &quot;in the old days&quot; everyone had to travel by foot or ship but now everyone is used to the ease of the PoK and without such ease of travel this zone will just never get used which is a great pity because I really like this zone and it's obvious the devs have put a lot of time, effort and thought into building a trade skill haven there that could put the PoK in the shade. Shame really.............</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>illovich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm bound in AS, so I go there all the time...it's a great place for a tradeskiller to be bound. Unfortunately, it's a horrible place to be be bound if you're not a druid or a wizard, or someone with some other port clicky thingy (like a 50+ cleric can get a home port right clicky thingy).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Galadhriel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have been occasionally selling 1 lb Tuna from my baz bot.  It's not a frequent seller, but when it does sell they usually clean out my stock of a few stacks.  Maybe the buyer just liked the convenience of having the meat all broken down for him.  (The Cragbeast and Hynid meat, however, do not seem to sell.)<br />
They seem to sell out right before I plan on doing my own baking run.  I did reach 200 this weekend while baking in Abysmal Seas. <br />
:cool: <br />
I think there were only 2 of us in the zone the whole time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mr.X</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I spent a day and a half fishing for tribute points only.     I didn't see any better way to build a good balance at my level (mid 30s).    I expect to come back later and fish for baking.<br />
<br />
The docks are always empty now.     Basically, nobody fishes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tricsun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Eh, takes me about 10 minutes or less depending on where i am.  Usually i'm around PoK or PoT, so it's just down to Freeport, EC, Nedaria, Abysmal.  Not bad at all, longest part is waiting for the boat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>slimb hcarvul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">AS is definitely a ghost town.<br />
<br />
Spent the other day doing the tradeskill freebie quests to get my lil pally's skills up.<br />
<br />
Saw max 4 people at any one time (this on a sat afternoon/evening) and even was the only one a few times.<br />
<br />
Mainly just a quest/tradeskiller zone now - one that's tougher to reach than PoK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Pondlife</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">On Stromm this place is dead.  Went there last night to complete a quest (the Broken Shore Necklace) with a guildie.  We were the only one's in the zone.<br />
<br />
Its a great shame - the zone itself is excellent, and was fun when populated by people fishing and tradeskilling.  Lots of /ooc chat going on and a good place to hang out.<br />
<br />
Why would anyone bother now....?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It was fun to fish on the docks with all the players. You got to know folks you never met before......was really a good time. EQ is a social game and this promoted that....too bad its gone so quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'd like to see either a PoK book that goes directly to Abysmal, or a translocator put up in Nedaria's Landing.<br />
<br />
Or maybe fix it so that a Magus can send you there directly, without having to hop a boat to get to it.<br />
<br />
Heck, even a no drop, quested item that can port you there directly (and either doesn't have charges, or has at least 5 charges and can be recharged just by giving it to the quest npc) would be nice, as long as the stuff for the quest doesn't drop in the harder GoD zones. (Maybe tie LDON and GoD together even more by having some of the items drop in LDON dungeons, and the others in Natimbi)<br />
<br />
When I first went to Abysmal, I had a problem getting there, because I'm a slow-zoner. The first time I took the boat, I was in the water after I zoned, instead of on the boat, and had to gate out. The second time I summoned a waterstone and ring of flight and used both before getting on the boat. Sure enough, I was in the water, but since I had used the lev ring I just ran to the dock.<br />
<br />
I need to go back to buy some ground pepper and garlic, but I don't want to have to use a waterstone and ring of flight again just to get there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Michealus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">There is a faction quest with slaves and you need the faction to go forward from there.  At least thats what I've been told.    It requires mass quantities of GoD meat dishes, tuna, crab, cragbeast and hynid.<br />
<br />
You get more faction with the tougher dishes.  <br />
<br />
I suspect that when more people get to this point, there will be a lot of  folks buying vast quantites of GoD food in the Bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>KiTA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The fish still &quot;sell&quot; back to Tribute vendors for good tribute points.  It's not as nice as getting 250 plat an hour, but 24 hours of Regeneration II is nothing to sneeze at.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which ones are considered the 'tougher' dishes? I haven't had a chance to hunt in GoD zones much so I haven't encountered the NPCs.<br />
<br />
If we knew which dishes were desirable, bakers could make them and put them up for sale in the bazaar.  Players could then choose to buy the raw ingredients and make the food themselves, or buy it pre-made.  Considering that the really high-level players tend to have lots of plat and usually are willing to pay for convenience, this seems like an untapped market.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tricsun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Now is the slave faction different from the nihil faction that you get killing some of the mobs found around GoD (big grey guys with wicked looking blade things for example)?  or is it all the same faction?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Actually, its not worthless to fish in Abysmal...<br />
<br />
You fish there, get a bunch of nice seafood, ge all m ad when you realize it only sells for 1c/lb, sell it all to a vendor ANYWAYS, then i come along, buy it all up for 1c/lb and get the cheapest/easiest baking skillups for my newbie toons outside of the freebie quests on the boat.... except i have food to eat afterwards. =)<br />
<br />
Its FAR far cheaper than batwing crunchies. =)<br />
<br />
(ok well maybe you can hunt your own bat wings, use foraged fishing grubs and a dropped fishing pole, and do them for free, but i dont think anyone has ever done that)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">One of the things I've noticed is that you can make any size crab or tuna into 1 lb. crab or tuna, and then into just &quot;crab meat&quot; or &quot;tuna meat&quot;, and then into dried meat, using just a mixing bowl and nothing else.  You can get to 46 in baking doing this, with no other ingredients.  So, you can fish to get fishing skill up, then mix the meat to raise your baking skill.<br />
<br />
Oh, and you can turn in the tuna and crab for tribute points.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Wow... you get 1 tribute per 1 pound chunk of meat, which sells from vendors for 1 copper...<br />
<br />
So as long as there are fools still macroing fishing bots there and selling the fish for coppers to vendors, ill buy em all up for 1c/lb and get 1 tribute each for em. Woowoo!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Does this work for the foraged meats too? Guess I can go find out :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">No, the foraged meats are still about 5g per pound.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>KiTA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Fortunately, since Foraging is a much &quot;messier&quot; trick than fishing, I don't think they'll nerf it.  In 6 hours of foraging, I got maybe 30 plat.  So it's nice for recovering from a disaster like losing your corpse, but other than that, it's pretty worthless.<br />
<br />
The stat food is starting to sell pretty well on my server, btw, since it's a whole lot easier to make than 10 pound pies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>KiTA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Oh, also, I noticed there are several nodrop items that you can forage there.  So it's not possible to macro it.  Which is a good thing.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Haddir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">For the tuna, is it better to fish it in Abysimal sea, or Natimbi? So far I have been fishing in natimbi because I dont like waiting for the boat, but if the &quot;drop rate&quot; of tuna is better in AS I will go fish there :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Eoghnved</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I spent a short time fishing and managed to get enough for about four stacks of tuna and crab meat.  Then I made myself some beer battered tuna sandwiches for the stat bonuses.  I'd say it was worth my time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Windru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">My druid porter is maxxed fishing with his companion; he is bound at the bank in Abysmal.  I had him maxxed fishing long before GoD.  But thanks to GoD baking, I am 228 from making foraged Cragbeast and Hynid steaks and pies.  I am trivial with Hynid steaks, so I have been giving those to friends who need food; otherwise I sell them in bazaar for 15 or 20 pp each depending on market conditions.  Cragbeast meat I use for skillups for myself to keep a WIS food item.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, my rogue has increased his fishing from about 90 to 191 since GoD came out, and I too benefited from the pre-nerf pricing.  Since the nerf, I still fish there, as he has increased his baking to 160 from making crab and tuna foods.  He in turn makes the Tuna food for my INT casters.  Lately I haven't cared much to make anything from Crab meat, mostly out of boredom I just sell it back to a vendor.<br />
I keep a mixing bowl handy and break down the meat into 1 lb sizes for ease in stacking.  I have also started keeping track of how many lbs. of meat I get from 1 stack of bait.  Currently, my average is 162 lbs per 20 bait, an average of about 8 lbs per cast.  That equates to about 8 baking attempts for each 3 cp fishing bait.  I am about 100 brewing, so I make the best sauce available for approximately 7 or 8 gp.  Add about 2 sp for water and jug of sauces, I can make beer-battered crab or tuna soup for less than 1 pp each, which will take me to about 162 baking.<br />
<br />
My point is that Abysmal fishing is still good for something:  it could take you to 250 baking (Beer-battered crab souffle = 252 trivial)<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Abysmal Sea now has a Magus that will take you to Natimbi or Nedaria, located in the central Hold area, which I thought at first was the captain's room, since Morden Rasp was initially there...</div></div><hr />

Even though I'm using the GoD baking to skill up, I've found no market for the beer-based crab or tuna items on Innoruuk server.  Can't even give the things away.  I just sell them to the vendors to recover part of my expense.</div></div><hr />
