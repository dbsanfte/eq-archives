<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Healblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I got 1750 less than an hour ago... grats me.<br />
<br />
It has been a long road...   How long?  I had the skills necessary for the Coldain Prayer Shawl quests before they went on Test.  When New Tanaan Crafting Mastery went live, I began the AA grind and started getting skill over 250 in alphabetical order... <br />
<br />
Baking: Fun... my favorite tradeskill<br />
<br />
Brewing:  Boy was that a long 13 hour night of clicking<br />
<br />
Fletching: 800+ bricks of acrylia... the worst of the tradeskills<br />
<br />
Jewelcraft: 15,316pp later I got 250<br />
<br />
Pottery: Most boring... I found the lack of a farming path past 236 (crucibles) quite irritating.<br />
<br />
Smithing: Hollowshade isn't that bad.  53 points of shadowscream, and I was still complaining about acrylia arrows<br />
<br />
Tailoring: Having saved money for over a year while doing the other tradeskills, I bought my way to 220 on ceremonial solstice robes, and bought othmir fur with the rest.  Then I farmed othmir fur full time until... well an hour ago when I got 1750<br />
<br />
<br />
So... what is there left to do?  I hate my character in groups and raids.  Playing a druid is boring, and I'd sooner quit everquest than be in a CH rotation.  Well.. off to make a gnome necro... tinkering and research might be fun, but I feel cheapened knowing I can just throw practice points into them.<br />
<br />
Looking for a /comfort from this anti-climactic occasion,<br />
~Healblade (aka Nethri)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BienaFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You cannot just throw points into tinkering, you have to farm and combine.<br />
<br />
IF you feel cheapened make a gnome rogue, tinkering + poison making should keep you pretty busy for a bit.<br />
<br />
Have fun..:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cerpicio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, try a gnome rogue.  Spell research isn't much of a challenge and isn't very interesting (but that could just be me).  I love tinkering though!<br />
<br />
And don't forget alchemy.<br />
<br />
Other than that, are you flagged for Time?  Even though you don't like raids, getting flags so you can see new zones is fun.<br />
<br />
And just how many diffeent zones have you been to?  I started making a list and checking off ones I've visited, but I haven't finished it yet.  I was thinking of making it available somehow.<br />
<br />
<br />
But yeah, make some new characters.<br />
-- C.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Healblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ah... gonna make a gnome necromancer I guess... then I'll get research and tinkering, and maybe even a character I could enjoy grouping and/or raiding with.<br />
<br />
It does feel good to have met a long term goal!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Try poison making.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Faction hunting is one of my preferred pasttimes when I'm looking for something different to do.  Getting non-kos in Cabilis alone will keep you busy a while.  I enjoy startling the iksar newbies...until they see the spear and ask for buffs. :p<br />
<br />
You can actually get a surprising number of factions really high if you pick your targets and quests well.  It's a fun challenge that will impress many people but will seem easy after GMing tailoring and smithing!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There are a number of ways you can get some serious fun out of things if you're into it.  <br />
<br />
As Verdandi wrote, farming faction is a good way to pass the time in pursuit of a goal.  Getting to the point where you can walk to the bank and do your business without being molested by the locals, in every town and city in the game (including places like Runnyeye and Kael Drakkal) will keep you juggling for a long, long time.<br />
<br />
One very curious hobby I've taken to is underwater exploring.  Get yourself an EB item and check out the undersurface.  If you've never gone to Veksar or Kedge Keep, or the Plane of Water, it's an experience not to be missed.  Some folks hate swimming, especially when they fight, but I found it to be quite an interesting challenge.  <br />
<br />
One extremely odd and possibly dangerous exploring option that I fell into (literally) is exploring under the world.  As a cleric, you can fall through the world and cast divine aura (and hope to your diety that you don't fizzle it) and the landing is nonlethal.  Then you can tool about under the world, and gate out afterwards.  Don't take anything with you that you can't afford to lose, since you could die anyway, but it's a weird thing to view a zone from the bottom up.<br />
<br />
Another possibility for exploring is high climbing.  This isn't your run-of-the-mill idea of climbing a zone wall, but finding extreme heights to explore.  To give yourself an idea of how it works relatively safely, get a lev and then go to the Combine fortress in the Dreadlands.  The Kunark portal in the Nexus will take you right near where you need to go, if you can't get a port.  Approach one of the huge spires from the back (the outside part from the fortress grounds) and run up the spire.  When you get to the top and over the crown of it, pan down, and you'll see the fortress far, far below you.  It gave me vertigo the first time.  Another place, inspired by a picture I once saw in a .sig, is the statue of Firiona Vie in the elven fortress in the zone of the same name (you did the faction walk described earlier, yes?  If not, this can be one of your practice areas).  Get up on her head, and the view is spectacular.  Get levitation if you're worried about falling, or don't if you like scaring yourself.  I only recently started trying to get up on Karnor's Castle, so I don't yet know if it can be done, but if it can I'll let you know.<br />
<br />
I hope some of these ideas will relieve you ennui.<br />
