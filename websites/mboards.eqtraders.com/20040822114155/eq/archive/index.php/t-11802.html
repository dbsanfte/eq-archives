Tinkering Journal: Brodder FoamyMugs &amp; Catbik Tinkerton of Bertoxxulous <br />
Oi oi oi , me n me matey a gnome mage had a discussion o'er about a few days ago.<br />
Me memories a bit blurry indeed, but we discussed some new ideas fer toys...umm okay devices...fer him to design. That he wants his logo on them I thinks be a bit outrageeous as all gnomes will make copies of their own soon enough and prevent his cornering of the market.<br />
With that out of the way and most of my hangover gone here's me ideas....<br />
- Brodder FoamyMugs Dwarven Cleric of Brell<br />
<br />
 <br />
Yoyo of Battlefun <br />
SM- 1HB Dmg2 Spd 15 wt. 1.0<br />
Md- 1hb dmg3 spd 22 wt 2.0<br />
LG- 1hb dmg5 spd 40 wt 6.0 (lrg races only)<br />
<br />
Basic components (common)<br />
Copper Ring + twine (hemp)+ 2 Cams+ 1 gnome Bolt<br />
Variations (medium)<br />
Silver Ring +silk twine+ 2 Cams + 1 gnome bolt<br />
Variation iii (Large Ogre yoyo)<br />
Gold Ring + 2 Hemp twines + 2 Cams + 2 gnome Bolts + 2 pie plates.<br />
<br />
Other Variations<br />
Add small lighstone for neeto light show and yoyo-ing in the dark. Add Enchanted Silver/Gold/Electrum/Platinum for various effects.<br />
Add Gemcuttered Pearls and Gems for extra customisation and (gem effects as in magic jewlery) BE the Gnome with the bestest yoyo in town! Every gnome will fight to have the best and showiest yoyo in town. Contests will be created to show off their yoyo tricks and customizations. Winners get their name inscribed on a plaque.<br />
Other possible additions... Silver arrowheads to make a Ripsaw yoyo (no longer 1hb but 1hs)<br />
<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Spiked Gnomish Helm <br />
tired of getting bonked on yer bald spot all the time? Make em pay fer the insult with yer very own Spiked gnomish helm. (small races only)<br />
<br />
Required ingredients... (three different models available)<br />
A - 2 Cloth Caps + Silver Arrow tips + pie plate+ hemp twine(to tie the device on yer head) (this is the casters version) + Greater Lightstone (to serve as a warning to them bonkers out there that yer head is off limits)+ sharpening stone<br />
B - leather cap or Rawhide (of appropriate size for customer)+ cloth cap + silver arrow tips + hemp twine + Greater Lightstone +pieplate+sharpening stone<br />
C - Metal helm + cloth cap +silver arrow tips+ gnome bolts+silk twine+Greater Lightstone (note no pieplate here)But Bolts used to make it tougher and for them big folks to see that yer small stature means business)+sharpening stone<br />
<br />
The second cloth cap is for extra padding to lessen the impact of the Bonks and bashes to yer head. Note ye should carry a botle of gnomish spits and a silk swatch to clean yer points often when traveling in ogre n trollie country or in case ye grab yer head by accident and hurt yerself.<br />
<br />
Effects- Adds 1 AC to cloth/leather and Metal helms. Adds 1 wt. And adds a 1 pt damage shield to yer head ( effectively a random check each time ye get hit in combat to damage the attacker...more so if getting bashed or punched or kicked by them big folks) Also acts as a light source.<br />
<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Dwarven Mining Helmet <br />
Small Bronze Helm + Small Lantern + Greater Lightstone+ Dwarven Wire (A new use for this Dwarven invention)+ Cam + cloth Cap small<br />
<br />
Helm is padded with cloth cap, and the light stone is crushed and stuffed into the small lantern for a fueless light source. Some of the WIre is used to attach the cam to the lantern to allow it to be aimed above, below or directly ahead of the miner. The rest of the wire attaches this contraption to the bronze helm.<br />
Previous experiments with fire beetle Eyes floating in a jar proved to be messy when a dwarf walked into a stalagtite the eye's lumination failed to show. Or the dwarves salvaged the eyes for brewing gypsy wine instead.<br />
<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Gnomish Firebomb and Firebomb Hurler <br />
Firebomb Hurler:<br />
Grease Pots + Shovel + Dwarven Wire + Pie Plate + leather Belt+ torch ( a 2 handed device used for hurling of Gnomish Firebombs)<br />
The Belt is wrapped about the handle and to add a strap for greater fulcrum leverage. The wire attaches the properly bent pie plate to the shovels wide surface. Note caution on use indoors. Torch automatically lights the bomb during hurling motion.<br />
<br />
Gnomish Firebombs<br />
1 claypot + i gnomish firewater + bandages + fairy/pixie dust<br />
effect AOE fire-explosion... Range of throw is totally dependant on hurlers strength and knowledge of the physics involved in properly hurling as all well properly educated gnomes do (and sometimes very drunk dwarves). Dmg 15 duration 1-6 rounds AOE (10 feet) Caution Friend and foe will be affected possibly to your detriment.<br />
<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Boingee Boots <br />
Required Heavy leather boots of proper size for customer + 4 Cams (2 each boots) + 4 Dwarven WIRESPRINGS** + 2 Pieplates<br />
<br />
Allows for rapid retreat over dificult terrain and to take less damage from short to medium falls assuming you land on yer feet) and to use this energry stored in the springs to boost you further ahead of your pursuer. (also useful in conjunction with Firebomb above for when things don't go as planned)<br />
<br />
Second Note- Large races such as Ogres are simply too heavy for the springs to work more than a few times before simple becoming useless-to prevent an angry ogre customer from bashing you to a pulp, proudly use our company motto &quot;Look --insert ogre's name here-- you've invented IRON SHOD Boots!! You're one smart Ogre. Congrats!&quot; They should be extremely proud of their new found intelligence and leave and if they don't tell them of the plague of rats, snakes and bettles infesting a nearby area and that the boots would make them very squishy. Rapidly don yer anti Bonking helm in case he wants to bonk you or thank you.<br />
<br />
** Dwarven Wire Springs require 2 steps to produce... First Dwarven Wire is Wrapped around a Metal Rod as tightly as possible and then the whole unit is placed into a forge to temper them properly. A friendly metalsmith should be able to aide you here or ye can lear enough of the skill to do this yerself. Each success should provide ye with one Dwarven Spring.<br />
<br />
 <br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
NOTE- this is half of what I submitted before ROK went to devs for development, and I was working with yakatizma (Dan Enright) at time via outside channels for tradeskills...<br />
 I had near 20 more recipes for tinkering, most just plain funny, all inspired by my friend the gnome mage Catbik Tinkerton when we were on bertox before moving to Terris Thule.<br />
<br />
 I'll see if I can dig up older stuff on my very very old HDD's sometime...one crapped out and I replaced the seeker chips myself from a similar hdd and run Seeker 12.4 on it to recover and remap the hdd.  It takes all memory, and hours upon hours upon hours to map and reconfigure it, so I only get to do this when I know I'm not gonna be online or writing/editing stuff...<br />
Maybe I'll rebuild my second PC...errr third...<br />
 Guess it's all in the spirit of tinkering...:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brodder FoamyMugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Second note- I don't think any of these actually went live- I'm just posting these for nostalgia's sake...<br />
 Experiment on your own if you wish...;) :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>YurienStonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">oh no Brodder ahs invaded the tinkering fora. run for your lives!!!!!! save your selves!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />

p.s. wheres the hint for the gnomish cooking pot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brodder FoamyMugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not sure it ever went in...<br />
 But I have a few recipes for it somewhere...<br />
 I'd have to check my email/pm logs...<br />
 Then get confirmation that it did go in somehow sometime longlong ago in a far away gala....errrr wrong bat channel(ing) ;P<br />
<br />
 Basics of it was Spit or brazier + cooking pot + fuel bottle(battery or firewater+wick) made the Deepfryer/gnomish cooking pot.<br />
<br />
 To charge it you'd have to open it and put in 4 oils and 2 fuel one at a time until it was charged.<br />
 then it'd have 10 uses of deepfrying...since frying oil would be absorbed and get dirty during use.<br />
<br />
 After 10 uses you'd have to put in 1 jar of gnomish cleaning paste (from brewing superior gnomish spirits) to clean out the pot.<br />
 Then you could recharge it....<br />
<br />
 I am fairly sure the two steps required (requiring magic charged type item) was beyond the ken of the crew of programmers at SOE/VI-EQ at the time.<br />
 So this probably got shelved.<br />
<br />
 And that was just one use of the gnomish cleaning paste by the way...<br />
 It has many many uses in tinkering, but none have been found or implemented in game yet.<br />
<br />
 That's it for now...<br />
<br />
 So until we get confirmation that this is in game, and the recipes that need a fantabulous-gnomish-cooking-pot, actually are in game then it's on our wish list.<br />
<br />
 Recipes that should have used this pot...<br />
  Fish and Chips.<br />
  Beer batted fish<br />
  Beer battered veggies.<br />
  Beer battered shrooms.<br />
  Deep fried clams.<br />
  Potato chips.<br />
  Tempura covered spice snacks (gnomish recipe).<br />
  Deep fried Goo! (yes that sick goo that you can make at  very very low levels of baking).<br />
  Frybread. (dough + yeast + honey)<br />
  Tempura veggies (sliced first with the gnomish kitchen utensil...it slices it dices...it julians...)<br />
<br />
  Tempura is soda water and ground rice flour (motar n pestle + cup of rice).<br />
  Spice snacks were  pixie dust, icing, spices, cup of flour, yeast malted milk, and fruit/berries.<br />
 Beer batter is self evident. Short beer and cup of flour.<br />
<br />
 Dipping sauces were suggested...<br />
 Sweet n sour was honey vinegar fruit/orange juice and (t)arrow root (thickener)(alchemist herb).<br />
<br />
<br />
 BTW pudding was easy too  arrow root + milk + eggs + sweetner mixed in pot/bowl. with variations by city.<br />
 Chocolate pudding would use chocolate.<br />
 etc etc...<br />
<br />
 GAH you've made me think too hard...<br />
<br />
 NOTE-- NONE OF THESE RECIPES ARE CONFIRMED AS IN GAME AT THIS TIME....<br />
<br />
 NOTE 2- Some may be in game in different forms. But I have no real clue as to how.<br />
<br />
 Note 3- You hungry yet? I am... talk to ye tinkers later...<br />
 And this last word... <br />
 Don't invest time into this device until we get word that yes it is in game....the rest you can piece together from my old recipes and formats and hopefully find new toys and foods to play with.<br />
<br />
 Yes I know how you gnomes like to play with your food...or use it to describe or design new gadgets....<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />
