<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niami DenMother</div><div class="date">12-02-2002, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While there are many regular visitors to the message boards that you'll become acquainted with if you visit here often, there are a few names you should know:<br />
<br />
Niami DenMother, aka DenMom, 'Mum, etc. - owner/administrator for http://www.eqtraders.com and the message boards. Make sure you know and follow the rules of the road as posted in the Visitors Corner section of the message boards, and she won't have to break out the Rolling Pin of Doom.  ;)  While she's prone to taking long naps in various people's packs, she does poke her nose in from time to time.<br />
<br />
Ngreth Thergn, aka the House Ogre - Niami's RL husband. Responsible for the design of the database found at EQ Traders Corner website (http://www.eqtraders.com). He's also handled the technical aspects of setting up these boards.  He's a pretty easygoing ogre, unless someone causes his wife grief ...<br />
<br />
Moderators-at-large:<br />
<br />
Verdandi, &quot;Bear-in-Chief&quot; ... or is that message board goddess? While she started out as &quot;just&quot; the creator of our Thurgadin Shawl Quest guide, now that 'Mum is a lot more reclusive, she's in charge of the forums.<br />
<br />
Krazick, &quot;Scaly Database Kitty&quot; indeed!!  (Ngreth chose the title in true ogre form!)  He's an iksar, he's a vah shir, he's a data entry deity!  He's been invaluable in getting information up onto the site and keeping 'Mum from going berk.<br />
<br />
Kehvrynne (retired) - while she's around a lot less often, you never know when this lady-rogue will slip by again, trying to help keep things cleaned up around here.<br />
<br />
Other moderators &amp; database staff:<br />
Angelsyn, Cantatus, Ellesidil, Heartsong, Laurefin, Lothay, Sumamael (semi-retired), Myrron, Maevenniia, Tudani, Aradyss, Kritta, Ilona, Ariene - these volunteers have put in many many hard hours on the site, not only at expansion times, but year-round.  They're a good part of why Mum's NOT fully burnt out yet, and she's very protective of them.<br />
<br />
Special SOE guests: These folks are worthy of attention and respect. If I find folks giving them grief in my forums in any way, shape or form, I may break out the banning stick. They stop by as a courtesy to this community, and are pretty good about accepting feedback, etc. Scare them away and we get a lot less responsiveness on fixes for tradeskills. 'Nuff said.<br />
<br />
Maddoc-the-Wayfarer - tradeskill developer at SOE and man of many hats.<br />
<br />
Absor - now a tradeskill developer at SOE working with Maddoc (many will remember him from his stint as Community Relations)<br />
<br />
Brenlo - Community Relations at SOE. While he doesn't post here, you'll see him mentioned.<br />
<br />
Yakatizma Thex - Den Enright was our tradeskill developer/contact at VI for quite a while.  He's since moved to the Online Adventures team, but you'll still hear his name mentioned around here from time to time.<br />
<br />
Frizznik - joins Yakatizma in the ranks of 'former tradeskill guru'. While he's since moved on to other things at SOE, you'll still here him mentioned around here.<br />
<br />
Woody Hearn - artist behind http://www.gucomics.com  You'll find his comics scattered around the site (with his permission), and he and 'Mum have quite the mutual fan club going. :D <br />
<br />
Other Community Leaders who post here now and then:<br />
Kitta Diddymus - owner of http://www.tinkering.org<br />
Spiritual Thistlethorn - from the Druid's Grove<br />
Sobe Silvertree and Chenier - from EQDruids<br />
Allakhazam and Illia - from Allakhazam's</div></div><hr />
