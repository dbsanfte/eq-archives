<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Damuri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just thought I would post this to avoid some confusion that I have been encountering.  Some recipes are not meant to show up in your UI (so you will always have to do them manually).  I've been scratching my head trying to figure out how to get EVB to show up on my UI and finally I asked the serverwide chat channel and it turns out the the recipe for EVB isn't supposed to show up.  I presume this is also the case for some of the other popular skill up recipes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most (possibly all) of the combines that dont and wont show up are used in quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">evb's are lore and no drop.  why would you normally try to skill up on them?  you have to succeed to learn a recipe anyway so you already made the only item you need and its pointless to make more.<br />
<br />
yes i know the other reasons its a skill up path but for in game use you would never need mmore than one unless you do the quest for both phylacteries and then it saves you the bother on the second one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">People skill up on them because they are easy as pie.  Buy or farm a mountain of velium pieces, and the rest is store bought.  Once you succeed in making a bit, then the rest will poof and you don't have to worry about destroying your item, another time saver.  I was at about 212 smithing when the EVB recipe was discovered and immediately used them to skill to 220.  It was a very simple, relatively low cost way to skill up.  Even with not being able to use the new UI with this recipe, I'd probably still recommend it as a skill up path.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think what enaimn was trying to say is from the game standpoint you only NEED to make one. Since its a quest that only requires one bit you dont need to make mroe than one. True you CAN skill up on it but with game lore you only need to make one thus not necessary to learn it to make large quantities.</div></div><hr />
