<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xoiijin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiya, <br />
<br />
Im looking for a GM Troll smith on Rodcet Nife. I would like to get a cultural Ykesha (Rallos Zek) made. I am currently getting all the ingredients needed for the combine. <br />
Right now i cannot find a Troll smith with the skill to do the final combine. I know there is a GM troll smith on Rodcet because I have seen 3 blades for sale in the bazaar. The person selling the blades was not the smithy.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any information, please post it for me. I do think it would be cheaper for me to find a troll smith then to have to take my troll (43 SK) from 0 to 250.<br />
<br />
thanks, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Kyrsk is the only troll smith I know of on Rodcet Nife.<br />
<br />
I am the one selling his honed yaks in the bazaar, on my trader Furl. For him, at the price he asked me to sell them for.<br />
<br />
However, I have not seen Kyrsk online for about 3 weeks. <br />
<br />
If you do happen to catch him online, and ask him nicely, he might do your combines. Kyrsk is a real nice guy, from everything I've seen of him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eatbugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Keep in mind that even at max skill, there's a decent chance (~50%) to fail the final combine on those.  More than one set of ingredients would be good if possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xoiijin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I know about the failure rate, so I am trying to get enough for 3 combines when im ready to do it.....Now i Just need to find Kyrsk, since no one has mentioned another Troll smithy on RN.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">To the best of my understanding, Kyrsk has retired from the game. I was not on when he came on and said so, but he announced it in the tradeskill channel.</div></div><hr />
