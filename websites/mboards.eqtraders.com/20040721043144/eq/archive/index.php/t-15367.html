<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>greebmushroome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there a way to query the database by zone, please?  For instance, if I know I'm going to be hunting/raiding in PoTorment, what items should I look out for?<br />
<br />
It'd be even nicer if, beside each tradeskill item that drops in a zone, we'd get a list of which skills use the item.  Even cooler would be drop-downs listing the items made with it (or even a tree of the items made with it, so that it's very easy to realize that the putrescent blood is used for Necklace of Biting Insanity, Spiked Collar of Agony and Shackles of Torment).<br />

thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Simple... <br />
<br />
See the -Trade Supplies- Link at the top, between the -Recipes- and -Links- buttons?<br />
<br />
Good... click that link... then select which zone you have an interest in from the long list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>greebmushroome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Woo-hoo!  Thank you!  That's exactly what I was looking for :)<br />
<br />
(I've been using EQTraders Corner so long I sometimes forget what's there).<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh, I thought you were looking for a list of mob-dropped items for every zone, not a list of vendor-purchased items for every zone.<br />
<br />
I assume a list of mob-dropped items sorted by zone would be fairly incomplete without a great deal of data being supplied to the hard-working EQTC staff from us first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>greebmushroome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No, I was referring to a list of mob-dropped (or foraged) items, and that's what's there.   Some of the mob names are imprecise, but it's good enough for my interest.  Woo-Woo!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">WOW !!!!! Last time i looked at that page it was just where you could BUY stuff, not drops and all ! Thank you so much for asking this question, that is EXACTLY the kind of list i wanted too! =)<br />
<br />
WOOT WOOT WOOT</div></div><hr />
