<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i had a BIG laugh yesterday when i saw a few &quot;raw materials&quot; for sale in the bazaar for what can only be described as simply ridiculous prices.<br />
<br />
for example.<br />
<br />
living coal 10k, 20k  <br />
alkaline etched stones 10k<br />
<br />
and then you wonder why tradeskillers charge for so much for the final item produced? good luck on sellings them.<br />
<br />
/wave price gougers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ilona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've noticed the exact same thing.  At those prices, there's NO WAY I'll be making any of the nice new things :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh god, that's ridiculous :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You wouldn't pay 5 or 10k for nightmare mephit blood?  20k for a drop of pure rain?<br />
<br />
I'm shocked!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can understand taking into consideration for drop rarity.. but come on folks, some of that stuff *IS* a common drop off mobs you can almost solo (depending on class).<br />
<br />
I plan to flood the market with my stockpile and ruin all your evil cartel schemes of bazaar domination!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ilona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Flood the market starting with me!! :D <br />
Guess I need to level up more to &quot;convince&quot; my friends to hunt places I need components from.  It works at level 30-40, why don't I think it will work at 55-60?? :roll:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>matteo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I thought it was funny hearing that Spell:Imbue Fire was for sale for 100kpp in the bazaar the other night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i have found elemental tradeskill stuff on NPC vendors this past week.  was a pleasant surprise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>lonewylfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's always nice to find things on vendors that I can use :)<br />
<br />
Though now that I've printed out the list of ingr for high end bows, I see I missed a few things while vendor mining :(<br />
<br />
Then again, there are people who pay outrageous prices for things b/c they want to be the first with them/can't wait to farm or get them later. *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kaeyla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Learning to solo tier1 stuff has drastically reduced the DoT on my bank account ;o<br />
<br />
<br />
/rude idiots</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>GunnyBurlfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think price gougers are the same people who complain if you tell them how much you are charging for something.<br />
<br />
&quot;! dued taht is 2 much !!1! lol i got tailroin up too 77, an its not that hard!&quot;<br />
<br />
Little do they know how much work goes into 250 tailoring or smithing now. (there are those that &quot;got in under the nerf&quot; on smithing, but no one, I mean no one had much of an easy road on tailoring)<br />
<br />
They have no idea how much we fail at 250 with GM devices standing in our lucky spot with KEI and shaman buffs on , hoping like hell that the RNG is in a good mood today.<br />
<br />
I don't mind the people farming velium at 20-50p a brick. <br />
I don't mind the people farming Superb/Flawless hides for 100-200p each.<br />
<br />
That's ok, but 10k? 20k? even 2k is ridiculous for some of the ingredients that you must use in place of WATER for the smithing of studs, for example.  <br />
<br />
I made 2 pieces of PoP tailored stuff when I got 250 because I wanted to. Due to the prices of some of the components involved, I am selling them at near cost. at 20k. /rude price gougers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">person trying to sell war wraith blood for 5k each (has 10)<br />
<br />
*giggle like a school girl*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In the last few days I've picked up 7 storm ent saps and 4 sandstone pearls.  Not knowing how much they are worth, I've checked the going rate in the bazaar and then tried to undercut it significantly.<br />
<br />
Anyone have a MSRP to offer on these items?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>GunnyBurlfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sandstorm Pearls vary, but I have seen them for around 200-300p usually.<br />
<br />
Storm Ent Sap goes for around 150p or so.<br />
<br />
That's only IMO, though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ilona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Personally, I have loads of sandstorm pearls without drops of pure rain to go with them (and still need two more items for my cleric), and at least half a stack of storm ent sap but only one lonely little storm volass hair to pair up with them :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">to help you out<br />
<br />
sandstorm pearl - drops in BoThunder<br />
drops of pure rain - drops in BoThunder<br />
storm vorlass hair - drops in PoStorms<br />
storm ent sap - drops in PoStorms</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ilona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I know where they drop!<br />
I just can't hunt them myself - and rarely find them on vendors (pc OR npc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">lets get you PoS flagged then you can go with me to plane of storms and give those giants &quot;hair&quot; cuts. =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">oho! someone is dropping some elemental plane stuff in the bazaar.. but be prepared to pay through the nose....<br />
<br />
20k-40k for imbued diamonds</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gogtuok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I know which guild it is  :? .  Thing is their merchant had 2 PoE rings on it for 110k each and they both are gone.  So with that plan on seeing more elemental stuff popping up, with stuff selling at that price peeps bank account might want in on the action.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ilona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I wouldn't plan on seeing much of the elemental stuff pop up in the bazaar.  From what I've heard, the three guilds that are already there have banned their members from selling the drops, to keep the next guild out....<br />
<br />
What I think of that sort of behavior belongs in primal scream...<br />
<br />
Bartox, I'd LOVE to get a flag!</div></div><hr />
