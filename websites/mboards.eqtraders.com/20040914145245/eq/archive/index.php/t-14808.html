<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kyrial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any reason they aren't in the recipe database? I thought they involved tradeskilling, or is it only turning in certain items to NPCs?<br />
<br />
I was trying to figure out which finds in torment (such as insanity fangs) have uses in the weapons, and find it hard to figure it out.<br />
<br />
Help? :)<br />

<br />
All the combines are either no fail or supposedly trivial at 1-10 or so.  Not much tradeskilling envolved if it is the case.  <br />
<br />
Also, I don't think the components are tagged as being tradeskill items either... maybe that's the reason? :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Estariel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Having read the thread that was linked above, I note that it says that to make the Zek Bane weapons requires a smithing combine with a trivial of 182 and two brewing combines of over 145.<br />
<br />
The final combine for the wielder has a very low trivial, but making the ingredients requires a good smith to loot the Decorin Shards and a good brewer to loot the Valorium Shards and Insanity Fangs.</div></div><hr />
