<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>YurienStonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to wish everyone a merry xmas, chanukah, kwanza, or whatever ever holiday you enjoy at this time of year and to ask Brodder a question. <br />
<br />
With this being xmas could you give us a direct ingredient for hot sauce or Brodders Revenge? :&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
happy holidays to all!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>dahna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Brodder is actually busy at planning some high elf ravishing in a cleric forum (if you consider the huge amount of texte he wrote these last days per post there) ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brodder FoamyMugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sorry matey's I've given ye all the clues I can, as I've an aggreement with the old Devs about this sorta thing.<br />
 Even if I could make it meself in game now, I couldn't tell yall how exactly ( if I knew for certain). <br />
 Only once someone figures it out themselves or a Dev comes and outright says it...then all ye can do is Resort the clues I have given ye, not read too much into it, focus more on direct approaches vs outlandish ideas...my diaries are a very good ruler to guide your testing.<br />
 Once testing fails, and my clues haven't helped...<br />
 then please please please use the FEEDBACK forms to get DEV help.<br />
 Denmom can poke from her side too, as I don't have the same access channels she does now.<br />
<br />
  Right now it looks impossible, but they are in game, but haven't been player completed yet, so test, think...etc.<br />
 Then if that fails, word a very nice feedback, post it here for player assistance  and feedback  and if needed editing, and then send it in.<br />
<br />
 I've suggested more than a dozen times that yall start doing daily feedbacks on these two issues (Brodder's Revenge and subcombines, and Lewena's Secret/Ale)<br />
<br />
 I'm not the final source on this, just the origin, things change and evolve in game...as do what dev's hold as priorities for players...<br />
<br />
 So get cracking or get writing, I'm waiting just like you are for a success or two !</div></div><hr />

Wow did they ever change that recipe ehh whut?<br />
What happened to the garnish and hotsauce??<br />
<br />
In reply to a thread where the recipe is posted, which in fact does not include hotsauce ;)  Found by someone with the UI brewing thing on test, though the recipe also works on live servers (perhaps for a long time.)<br />
<br />
I wonder how many other quests/recipes are &quot;broke&quot; like this because the clues are missing or they did not do it the way that the clues point to? Oh and this doesn't work on Lewena either, still wonder if that one even works (lewena getting a drink.)<br />
<br />
I guess the UI thing should help with this department, at least. Wonder if other missing ones will pop up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>vovinit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok so will this new UI list all the recipies that are trivial to you? I'm trying to get the hang of what this is going to do as far as unknown recipies. I thought SOE said at one point that there would be no way of discovering new recipies using this. I'm not sure where I read that though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">some recipes are auto learn.  as soon as your skill is high enough it unlocks.<br />
some recipes are can learn.  as soon as you make one it unlocks.<br />
some recipes are either can't learn or just not one of the above.  these can never be made with the new ui.  mostly quest recipes that they could never see making a stack of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>YurienStonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ok now that Brodders Revenge has been solved i have to ask.......what was your recipe for it? :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brodder FoamyMugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Submitted version (used to work)<br />
 Garnish<br />
 Cask<br />
 Whiskey (glacier) had recipe using underfootbrown to make dwarven whiskey too.<br />
 Aviak Egg (drop) or Snake Egg (Drop)<br />
 Veggies<br />
 Spices- asked for hot sauce and sent in two recipes as they were needed for Nagafen's Fiery Chili and Ogre Juice and with some other recipes I suggested.<br />
 And plain old mug of Ale.<br />
 Shake shake shake... and pour-<br />
 Was to be a hangover cure and a bit of the hair of the dwarf that bit you...<br />
 i.e. would negate some of the effects of being totally wasted-shorten timer for alcohol effects.<br />
 And be a miraculous drink (with a lil neg to int an wisdom)<br />
<br />
 catbik's Butt burner recipe never made it in- rejected outright but was good for a laugh-<br />
   Hot sauce, spices, garlic, veggies (onions), horseradish, veggie juice, and superior gnomish spirits and firewater...<br />
 Drinking this was to cause a self damaging dot of fire with a final 10tp centered fireball on drinker...OOOPS.<br />
 It was worth a chuckle BUT DID NOT MAKE IT IN.... &lt;&lt;&lt;---- SEE not in game.<br />
<br />
 Lots of other stuff he n I cobbled together was plain humorous...too  bad the pirate brews he invented for the gnomish pirates never got more than laughs either.<br />
<br />
<br />
there are other recipes missing still, hopefully between interface and all of you, more will be found.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">butt burner chilli would be awesome.  force eat it in pok.  even an easy dot to break mezzes.  plus the most important reason it would be fun.</div></div><hr />
