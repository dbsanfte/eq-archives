<br />
I need one of each Vah Shir class to do a combine so that I can make my weapons:<br />
<br />
Bard: Ceramic Claw Sleeve (Pottery)<br />
*Unfinished Ceramic Claw Sleeve Set (Quest)<br />
- Sonic Wolf Blood (dropped from Sonic Wolves)<br />
- Owlbear Bile (dropped from Owlbears)<br />
- Claw Lining Sketches (Quest)<br />
- Black Silt Clay (Ground Spawn in Hollowshade Moor)<br />
- Ashes of Dark Rituals (dropped from Grimling Mystics and Grimling Spiritists)<br />
- Combined in a weapon assembly kit (storebought)<br />
*Quality Firing Sheet (storebought)<br />
*Combined in a Kiln<br />
<br />
Rogue: Sonic Wolf Bane (Baking)<br />
*Reddish Brown Powder<br />
- Tortoise Saliva (dropped from Moor Tortoises)<br />
- Poison Dart Felt (dropped from Grimling Spiritists)<br />
- Sonic Wolf Blood (dropped from Sonic Wolves)<br />
- Digested Salass Moss (dropped from Owlbears)<br />
*Poison Vial (storebought)<br />
*Water Flask (storebought)<br />
<br />
Shaman: Reactive Sealant Soak (Baking)<br />
*Crystalized Ygri Root (Quest)<br />
*Black Salt Crystals (Quest)<br />
*Digested Night Palm (dropped from Owlbears)<br />
*Sonic Wolf Brain (dropped from Sonic Wolves)<br />
*Water Flask (storebought)<br />
*Ceremonial Metal Strainer (Quest)<br />
<br />
Warrior: Porous Claw Set (Smithing)<br />
*Bag of White Sand (dropped off Grimlings)<br />
*Chunk of Porous Ore (Quest)<br />
*Claw Mold (storebought)<br />
*Powdered Wolf Claws (dropped off Sonic Wolves)<br />
*Sonic Wolf Blood (dropped off Sonic Wolves)<br />
*Water Flask (storebought)<br />
<br />
I have all but one owlbear claw for a quest to get one of the items I need for the Beastlord combine.<br />
Beastlord: Toughened Sinew Lashings (Tailoring)<br />
*Sinew Stretching Dowels (Quest)<br />
*Owlbear Tendons (dropped off Owlbears)<br />
*Sonic Wolf Tendons (dropped off Sonic Wolves)<br />
*Kelp Salts (dropped off Moor Tortoises)<br />
*Fish Oil Soaked Rags (dropped off Grimling Fishermen)<br />
<br />
Once I get the other owlbear claw I need, I'll have the dowels and can do my combine, and I will need the remaing classes parts to make my new claws to continue the quest, any/all Vah Shir help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />
