<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Many times I have been called upon to be the ML in LDON adventures.<br />
<br />
The problem I have is I dont know what to sell to vendors or what to keep.<br />
Some of the things I loot only sell for mere silver, so I assume these must be tradeskill/quest items.<br />
I was selling goblin bones and gargoyle granite until someone informed me not to do so.<br />
<br />
Lately I've gotten so confused what to sell, that I jst keep everything, which really cuts back on the /split. <br />
On top of this, I've had to create newbie mules to hold all this stuff,  I'm running out of character slots.<br />
<br />
Is there a list anywhere with all the possible drops from LDON that I shouldn't sell to merchants?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">a. i don't think so. eqtc seems to stay away from 'master lists' because mean people abuse it, steal it, call it their own, and make Denmother-sama cry. Poke through the ldon recipes and figure out what's used where. Having knowledge in your head is more useful in the long run than any master list, anyway. <br />
<br />
... i need to hurry up and finish the mods, maybe that would help. dunno. <br />
<br />
b. wrong forum. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Unless someone specifically asks for the drop, gargoyle granite, words, pages, etc.. all things should be sold and profits split.  That is what I do, and most of the groups I have been in do.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp.<br />
<br />
<br />
p.s. this should be in OOC Chat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree.  Unless someone want's a drop sell it.<br />
<br />
When The database is back up to par, you may be able to get a drop list, but that drop list may still contain things NOT used in tradeskills, because people seem to want every drop on this site... so sometimes we includ things and then you get the &quot;No known tradeskill use&quot; hit :)<br />
<br />
but yeah, try the general forum to see if you can get someone's personal list if you are really concerned with it.</div></div><hr />
