<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there a difference between the skillup rates on condensed/acrylia arrows versus the darkwood/shadewood bows?<br />
<br />
I see from these boards a fairly broad discrepancy in the reports of number of combines per skillup, and although I'm aware people have different stat levels, I'd assume some consistency where people have equivalent gear.<br />
<br />
The ultimate cost difference between 28 attempts per skillup and 20 attempts per skillup is pretty significant, particularly with the bows.<br />
<br />
So... in my case, I have 355 wis, wis over the cap of about another 45, plus KEI or VoQ on top of that, and I'm fully shaman buffed including bear form (adds 10 wis) and Ferine Avatar, just in case.  I haven't had the intestinal fortitude to try bows because of the cost, although the ease of obtaining materials makes me drool.<br />
<br />
On arrows, I've had the following result (I care less about success than skillups btw):<br />
<br />
202-203 - 6 stacks of components<br />
203-209 - 11 stacks of components<br />
210-214 - 5.5 stacks of components<br />
214-215 - 3 stacks of components<br />
<br />
510 attempts for 13 skillups means essentially 1 skillup per 39 attempts, which seems pretty sucky to me.  I'm hoping that it's a temporary skewering by the RNG, but I just don't know.<br />
<br />
If bows have 1 skillup per 20 attempts, that might be a better way to go.<br />
<br />
What do you think?<br />
<br />
*edit* more skillup data<br />
215-225 - 10.5 stacks of components<br />
225-232 - 11 stacks of components<br />
<br />
940 attempts, 30 skillups ==&gt; 1 skillup per 31.3 attempts.  Better, but nothing like 1 in 20.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gnormy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you have the fortitude - try TRUESHOT LONGBOWS for skilling up.  While more time intensive, its defintely the least expensive ride from 202-235.</div></div><hr />
