<br />
After months of hard work and throwing plat away, tonite, at 12am PST, finally hit that 250 mark :)<br />
<br />
I still have Fletching left, to join the 1750 club, but when I'm done, I'm sure I'll let you all know :)<br />
<br />
Here's some brief info:)<br />
<br />
From 188-250 Smithing, I did purely sickles, except at 211 and 212 where I did that Ethereal stuff.<br />
<br />
Total Cost:  approx. 500kpp<br />
Total Sickles Made:  282, with about 80 left to sell<br />
<br />
I don't hunt, I'm 100% self-funded through tradeskill product sales, no uber guild to back me, so this is doable for anyone if you put forth the time and effort :)<br />
<br />
I can't forget the 80kpp I spent on pottery, the 12kpp for Jewelcraft, and the 10kpp already spent on Fletching to 222 :)<br />
<br />
Having done both Tailoring AND Smithing, I'd have to say that Smithing is definitely harder.  Though Tailoring was no walk in the park, as I got to 225 Tailoring before the &quot;slightly easier&quot; path.<br />
<br />
You know, I considered destroying my smithy hammer, but just realized that I'm going to need it for my trophy :D<br />
<br />
(((hugs))) all her fellow tradeskillers :)</div></div><hr />
