<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KyrosKrane</div><div class="date">03-27-2003, 01:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been working my way through pottery recently, and I found a few more skins that do and don't work.  <br />
<br />
Add to the DNC list: Low Quality Coyote Pelt, Grizzly Bear Skin, Mountain Lion Pelt.<br />
<br />
Add to the DOES work list: Puma Skin, Thick Grizzly Bear Skin.<br />
<br />
These were tested with Sealed Poison Vials, but I imagine they work for other vials also.  I'll post back here as I find and test more skins.<br />
<br />
You may wish to update the list at the bottom of the pottery page:<br />
http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_pottery.htm<br />
<br />
On the same page, just above the note, you have a list of mana vials.  It's missing Vial of Viscous Mana.  The sentence that should be added is:<br />
<br />
The vial of viscous mana is made by an enchanter using the level 12 Thicken Mana spell. It requires a poison vial and a pearl as material components <br />
<br />
Given how hated by tailors this item is, I'm not too surprised it's missing -- some disgruntled tailor must have snipped it off with his shears! :)</div></div><hr />
