<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hillbill</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quick question.  I am a human smith at 228 skill atm.  I have a dwarven friend who would like some new greaves.  Can I make heraldic plate armor for him with the small sized plate molds or do the heraldic recipes only work with medium sized plate molds?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

Can Dwarves wear human cultural armor?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I know for a fact Humans, Barbarians, and (I believe) Dark Elves, can all wear their appropriately imbued Heraldic Armor. <br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure about the rest. <br />
<br />
(edit: Fierce Heraldic, Rallos Zek, is the one that is useable by HUM, BAR, ELF, DEF, HEF, TRL, OGR, HFL, GNM.     <br />
MOST is HUM,HEF only, and no short races can wear any of the other imbues)<br />

<br />
To the topic of the post though, there is no Human Cultural Armor available to Dwarves....</div></div><hr />

Are you saying that a Human, other than Rallos Zek, can make Heraldic armor for a Rallos Zek?  Or that a agnostic can make diety armor?</div></div><hr />

<br />
yup, the religion of the smith is not checked, only the race.  But the religion of the wearer will be checked (along with class and race)</div></div><hr />

I tried it in the High Elf cultral forge being a wood elf myself and it told me no =)<br />

I accidently hit combine once and got the message about the appropriate race. I am glad he is a half-elf and not a human - he might have gotten a skill point, but it would have been a really expensive way to get &quot;You have become better at Blacksmithing! 1!&quot;<br />
