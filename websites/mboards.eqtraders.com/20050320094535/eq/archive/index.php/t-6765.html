<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanna</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 03:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">guys, i feel like i've fumbled something big-time here. <br />
<br />
I made yet another list of 'Everything I Do', looked at it, and felt like crying. I'm going through one of those stages where I either have to make the choice to stop doing something, or crippling apathy will set in and many many important things will all not get done. <br />
<br />
Three is a magic number, and I'm already doing three EQ things. (not even counting all the RL things I do, like school/work, comic, plan for Germany trip, sleep, etc)<br />
1. sullon.Iroke, and thank tunare I'm not guildleader anymore right now.<br />
2. mithaniel.Clico, a nice low diversion from the xp grind, I can just tradeskill in relative peace (stupid rng, not helping things).<br />
3. Tradeskill Storywindow mod. This one, if left unfinished, I will kick myself over even in my apathy stage, meaning I will feel like not doing it while feeling bad that I am not doing it. <br />
<br />
You know I love you all to death, but it would probably be my death, and while I would do anything in my power to help you all with DMC, my 'power' is quickly waning right now. I have to get my head back in real life enough to get me to Germany, and adding Stromm to my EQ list is not going to do me any good. <br />
<br />
Plus, I'm all big on 'THE Perfect Name', and since every freaking one of my choices was mercillesly REJECTED, I have no 'attachment' to my chars on Stromm. <br />
<br />
I'm very sorry, all. ~_~ I wish you the absolute best of luck with DMC, and feel free to drop me a ;tell if you wish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm kinda with Sanna here. I've very busy at the minute, I need to graduate this May from college and group projects are kicking my butt worse then a level 1 in Sleepers Tomb! I have YET to make a toon or play Enfiniti for about 3 weeks now. I WILL do this soon, so save a spot for me please. <br />
<br />
Lilosh, thank you for making the guild and being leader. I am making a Druid, Wood Elf. He will work on Fletching and Tailoring, decide which one to GM later.<br />
<br />
Other then that, I hope you all are having fun! Hope to see you soon!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delfontes</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was AFK as it were this weekend from the boards...<br />
<br />
I didn't find out til last night that the server had opened.<br />
<br />
I did make Delfontes, lvl 1 gnome and go do some exploring.<br />
<br />
I am the first person on server Stromm to die to a train at KC entrance.  :).<br />
<br />
It was sooo fun walking through DL looking at all the Drolvag/Spiders/Giants and getting all the way to KC.  The 2 ragers guarding the door and 1 more close enough to get agro were too much though.  I was well past them and almost to KC before 1 hit did me in ;).<br />
<br />
On a more positive note I did get through the lvl 1 hell level, and am now level 2.  I am not sure how I will be able to do much as the enchanter without a few PP, I have 5 silver to my name, hardly enough for 1 tiny dagger let alone my lvl 1 pet spell.<br />
<br />
Oh well, I'll be working on it off and on, I do need a guild invite if it has formed.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Once again, I was denied the name Anguish (is there some mini-boss in Hate or something I am forgetting??), so took Annguish.  Just not the same.<br />
<br />
But I did get my first pick names and spellings for a dwarf cleric, dark elf chanter, gnome rogue, halfling druid, and I made a barb beastlord just to tie up the name Iceblossom.<br />

Not sure what that has to do with this thread though, no one on Stromm can possibly be that high...</div></div><hr />

Um.<br />
<br />
You will be suprised I am sure.<br />
<br />
Sure it is not as easy to powerlevel... but there are people that do not sleep.  Or that make their own group with the amount of computers and accounts they have, or that share accounts to keep someone going forever.  It will not be long until there are level 65 folk...<br />
<br />
Plus... some of the soloing classes do have it &quot;easy&quot; and will be up there in levels forthwith.  The first 65 will be a wizard, druid or Necro... or a cleric/tank team.  At least that is my prediction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delfontes</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Give me odds on that Ngreth?<br />
<br />
My bet, bard will be first, second, and third to 65.<br />
<br />
There is nothing like swarm kiting, and they can solo in PoP easily at 50 in camps a wizard should be 57 to do with any degree of safely.  Heck even at 57 I needed C3 and items that wont be available for months to solo in PoP, hehe.<br />
<br />
;)<br />
<br />
I still stand by my statement, no one is that high yet in smithing, if they are PLing to a point where they can collect the components, they haven't had time to use them.<br />
<br />
In 3 weeks maybe some no sleep guy will be a GM smith, but not today.</div></div><hr />

SOE DID just recently kill the ability to swarm kite in most of POP... so Bards did loose that leveling spot... But still it will probably be a bard... (though the first 65 on most servers when POP was released... were wizards...I am fairly certain it was on Tunare but the PoV allowed for VERY easy wizard leveling)<br />

Yeah if I want to play a chanter I got a level 62 one, so why would I make an enchanter brand new?  I'm thinking if I don't have the services of a chanter for free I will never make any money over there.  So going to pocket her level when it's convient.  Cleric will be main.<br />

If anyone from DMC sees me on as him, I would like to join. (I usually play late at night EST - I'm a night owl)<br />

I also have a DE Enchanter named Surdir, but I only created him to reserve the name for future use and will most likely delete him and create another character with the name at some point.<br />

Anhar - Human Monk<br />
Gerrak - Halfling Cleric<br />
<br />
Side note: The name for my cleric should be Gerrick, but couldn't get it.<br />
<br />
Anhar and Gerrak are from my days in AD&amp;D. When I was in the service, I was introduced to AD&amp;D by my roomate at the time. My first character was a warrior, named Gerrick Clawwing. He was soon joined by his friend, Anhar of Gathos, a 1/2 elven Ranger/Cleric. Those two characters saw many an adventure over the years. Hopefully they will do so on the Stromm server in the world of Norrath.<br />
<br />
Trade skills so far are non-exixstant, since I have been battling to survive and get some of the monk quest armor. Both are now 6th level, with Anhar being about 10% from 7th. (I am trying to keep both characters at the same level range since I duo-box them.)<br />
<br />
I will look you all up in game this week to get tagged.<br />
