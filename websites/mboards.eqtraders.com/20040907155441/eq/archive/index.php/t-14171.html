<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tshesebe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, over on the eqdruids board, someone has posted an article about the &quot;secret place&quot; to get research components to make  CEs.  Ever since reading it first here last week, I've felt it to be a private secret.  I wonder if that vendor's going to be killed now? <br />
<br />
http://www.rpgexpert.com/1343.html    :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's not a secret, but a well thought out plan.  There are numerous merchants in several zones that sell both components of the CEs.  Merchant locations have been on this website for a very long time in the merchant section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cantatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is an easier way.  You can but both celestial solvent and scent of Marr within PoK.  I figured that was pretty much common knowledge.  It's the way I did it for months.<br />
<br />
It isn't really a &quot;secret&quot; since those locations are published in the EQTraders database.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mileron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why?<br />
<br />
You could make em from a vendor in EC too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Durew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is extremely old news, as old as PoK :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqNichola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">whois query on rpgexpert.com (http://samspade.org/t/whois?a=rpgexpert.com&amp;server=magic), for those that didn't know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Danae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You know whats weird to me ... is that I see these random posts (like the one up above) on a variety of boards. They talk about the secret being out, or something similar, but give almost no information, except a link to some RPGExpert article.<br />
<br />
I didn't think much of it for a long time, just skimmed the thread and moved on. I decline to click on links to that site, for a variety of reasons.<br />
<br />
But I'm noticing a pattern in the posts that start with those links.<br />
<br />
And I'm wondering ... doesn't RPG Expert claim that they pay for submissions? I wonder if part of how much you get paid is how popular the article turns out to be? Etc.<br />
<br />
I'm probably completely mistaken, don't mind me. Just seems like a recurring style of post etc, and it make me wonder if they were all designed to drive traffic to the site as people clicked out of curiousity.<br />
<br />
/ramble off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tshesebe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Danae, I did not intend for anyone to click onthe link &amp; go to that site.  It's a habit from another MB I belong to, where one is expected to submit proof for what one says.  Knowing that Yantis is responsible for that site, I would actually want as little traffic going there as possible.  I included the link to show the article indeed existed.  Does that make sense?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Danae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It does make sense. I hope you did not take my rambling personally, as it appears to be purely coincidental in this case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tshesebe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I didn't take it personally Danae.  I apologize for being relatively new and trying to learn some of the protocols areound here and basing it on other MBs I belong to.  The only protocol I'm truly familiar with is that I should never ask &quot;what's the quickest way to raise my xxx skill?&quot;  :D <br />
<br />
Right now I'm beating my head because I had about 200 of those Tunare silks to up my tailoring and ended up with 5 robes &amp; no skill ups.  Serves me right for being arrogant about getting to 197 rather quickly.  Can anyone say Hubris?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Personally, I've always liked doing CE's in pop, because the two merchants aren't THAT far apart, and once the CEs are made, all the other tradeskill containers are in the same zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My preference was to buy a bunch of the components at the easy place in PoK and head to Plane of Growth and forage while I was doing subcombines.  I did lacquering opals, making liquid meat, and would do it battering cragbeast if I had enough space.<br />
<br />
It gave me something distracting to do while trying to forage planar oak, but I got too fast at doing 2 component combines and would get through two stacks of stuff before forage would refresh.   (At least I go forage there while I am having some sort of planning meeting :)  )</div></div><hr />
