<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aranel</div><div class="date">04-06-2003, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am interested in purchasing some Blessed Full Mithril Armor (breastplate and gauntlets) and I understand that swirling mists are a relatively rare component for them. I have a full stack and am wondering if anyone would be interested in working out a deal for discounting the armor in exchange for the mists. Thanks!</div></div><hr />

For BP &amp;amp; Gaunts, you're looking at 5 sheets worth of armour.<br />
<br />
That's 5 Blue Diamonds &amp;amp; 5 Blocks of Velium.<br />
<br />
Bring three times that many, and some Morning Dew (the troublesome component for most High Elven Smiths) and you have a moderately fair chance at getting what you want.  Some will still charge you for successes, some won't.<br />

I personally won't be working on Smithing until I at least get my Paladin her level 44 quest spell from LoY.  :cry:</div></div><hr />

I'm in Dulak most every night til my group hits 50/51.  Get your butt over there :)<br />
