Friend of mine was making ET and accidentally forgot to equip his geerlok and was doing the combine under level 220.  Did they lift the minimum restrictions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>syndellbristle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">not too sure... but i do remember a short time where i was at like 214 smithing and forgot my geerloks and it would let me do the ethereal metal combines...  havent done it in a bit, and it only worked in the new ui.<br />
I guess if you learned it you can make it again without the required skill or its a bug... who knows what lurks in the minds of programmers  :D</div></div><hr />
