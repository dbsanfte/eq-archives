<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Flintforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Want to make some black pantherskin since the prices are still so friggin high in the bazaar.  I am sitting at 185 tailoring now and I see the trivial is &gt;250.  However, is it like cultural smithing where you start attempting to make it at 220 or so?<br />
<br />
At 220 what kind of success rate would I have, and is it really stupid to start any earlier given how difficult tailoring is to skill up on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">same as all the other velious leathers... <br />
<br />
at 205, expect a 5% success... for each point over that in skill, expect a 1% increase in success.  At 252, you're sucsess rate should be 50% .. basically</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Optimum1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Scoff =( I've never ever enjoyed that kind of success rate at 250+ trophy. Im hovering around something like 30% success and I have made tons and tons..hoardes of the stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bocote</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">curious.   Back in the day I did velious tailoring from 115 to 250 and consider 50% success as true at 250.   at 210 I noticed an increase to success above the 5% base.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Petercorbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I too have a 25% to 33% success rate on the velious stuff at 250 + mod.. you'd be better off making something else at lower levels if youre hoping to succeed and sell the stuff.   The market for panther skin is still pretty good so its worth holding on to til later unless youre like I was and couldn't wait when I had stuff to combine for possible skill ups, and I did get a good number off of black panther along my journey to 250 although at the time there weren't as many options as there are now.</div></div><hr />
