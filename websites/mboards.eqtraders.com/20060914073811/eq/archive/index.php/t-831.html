Haveing a full set of crustacean armor passed to him, he has 255 str and is chuging along smithing better than my High Elf or Dwarf..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graal</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I managed to sell all of the Rallos imbued Warplate I made eventually, total of around 3-4 sets.  Priced around 250pp per sheet it moves pretty well.  Just avoid items that have dirt cheap/common dropped equivalents.  Gloves and belt in particular.</div></div><hr />

Large acrylia plate sells better, has a wider target audience, and has better stats in my opinion. Were I buying, I would go with large acrylia plate because of superior resale value.  Until they up the ac on enchanted ogre war plate to bring it in line with other races cultural armors, its not worth the effort to gather tempers and pester some chanter to do the ore, which isnt even sold in our home town...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">solinear</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO, I'm just going to use it to replace a few pieces, see what it sells back to a vendor for and use it to get me up to Darksplint/Darkscale.<br />
<br />
No, the BP isn't that great on the Ogre War Plate.  All I care about is trying to get my money back though, honestly.  So the BP is only AC 22.   I probably won't make the BP anyway, probably stop at the Helm, since it trivials over 230 anyway.  By that time I'll be willing to burn some cash on BDs to make Darkscale. The blood isn't that hard to get (relatively speaking), nothing like Acrylia (what, you've got to farm  40+ mobs for the temper?  Bah...), go kill bandits (Karanas and BB) and sisters in OOT.  Done deal.<br />
<br />
Cost of Visor:  farmed stuff (blood, jade, leather padding) + 4 Enchanted large bricks (what, 25pp each?), + mold + Ogre Swill.  How much can you sell them for?  I'm going to see what a vendor will pay me for it and if it's near 100pp, I'm just gonna burn my few plat per combine to get the skillups and consider it a good investment.  The BP will cost you what, 10 large bricks, plus what I mentioned before?  Nothing if you can sell it for 400plat.  Sell them cheap and get the money back to get more skillups.<br />
<br />
What you want to get to is the high end stuff.  BDs are 500-700 on Ayonae Ro, that means the visor will cost you what, 600-800 to make?  Nothing, IMO, when you compare what other people have to get for theirs (foraged crap, rare drops off higher level mobs).  We have it made in the shade, with blood being our bottleneck (temper).  Everything else is an easy farm (Velium?  you gotta be kidding me...) or store bought.  We are SO lucky.<br />
<br />
Look at Trolls... they're stuck with nothing between 188 and 250 that is easy or cheap to make.  Maybe that Shadowscream crap... it's cheap, but that's about it.  Ogres have it EASY, believe me.</div></div><hr />
