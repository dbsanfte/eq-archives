I have the components to make multiple Toughened Sinew Lashings (just working on the last few skillups in tailoring), but lack the remaining four components.  If you are able to supply any of the other four pieces, and would be willing to either trade or sell your component, please contact me either by tell in-game, or in this message board.  It would mean a lot to me if I was able to complete this weapon.<br />

Thank you,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kassai</div><div class="date">12-03-2003, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still lack the sonic wolf bane poison, the claw blade, and the ceramic sleeves.<br />
<br />
Each of these three components require No Drop items from Hollowshade Moor, and each require the completion of that class' newbie quest (which I think means only a Vah Shir of the correct class can make the components). <br />
<br />
Any aid you might be able to offer would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

Got extra Ceramic Sleeves on my Bard, and you haven't responded to my posts on the Beastlord boards or Drinal boards - get ahold of me in the game sometime! (Grimgrey (Beastlord) or Rhyff (Bard) are the characters I play most often lately.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kassai</div><div class="date">12-03-2003, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, I'm afraid you found me out, Grim!<br />
<br />
Sorry for not contacting you ingame yet.  After reading your post on EQBeastlord, I wanted to have a set of the Sinew Lashings available to trade before pegging you for the Sleeves.  I just got the lashings recently, so I'll be sending you a tell (I promise).<br />
<br />
That just leaves the Warrior and Rogue part.  Perhaps we can work something out where you run around the Moor clearing out the mobs, and I can follow with a Vah Shir warrior and then rogue alt to make the final pieces for both of us.  We can discuss this later.<br />
<br />
Thanks for being more on top of my request than I've been!<br />
<br />
