I tried the usual combine of 3 Chips of Granite in my Collapsible Mortar and Pestle last night and got the &quot;You cannot combine these items in this container&quot; ??<br />

I thought maybe something was wrong with my Collapsible so I went and bought a regular Mortar &amp; Pestle and tried it in there... no go. :(<br />
<br />
Can't make any livestone or stonehide armors without powdered granite... now I have all these ridiculously expensive components and I can't do anything with them.... whaaaa!</div></div><hr />
