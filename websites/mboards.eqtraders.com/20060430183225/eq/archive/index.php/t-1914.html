<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahlmer</div><div class="date">01-06-2003, 12:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that certainly is the question!!  The other night, though, I did 60 imbued dwarven plate combines and went from 202 to 205.  I'm slowly making progress!  Now to collect more bloody lava rocks!   :evil: <br />
<br />
Honestly though, I've spend 10's of thousands of pp on smithing.  It isn't cheap.  Especially now that fine plate is trivial at 188.  The old cultural recipes are a great way to skill up if you have pp.  Unfortunately, because I'm a Dwarf, I get to buy all of those expensive rubies.</div></div><hr />

A couple hundred k will get you to the point where mistletoe sickles will be profitable. Then you'll have to sell a LOT of sickles to break even. Then ayou will see some profit. I hate to discourage people, but the bandwagon has been missed on smithing. Its not a money maker anymore unless you are among the first on your server to achieve it. Most aspiring smiths time is better spent elsewhere.  Theres more money to be made at this stage in the game by leveling and selling drops. If you want armor, its cheaper to buy it from another smith or second hand (or third or 10th hand) than make it yourself.<br />
<br />
Shadowscream has little direct plat cost, but huge opportunity cost. Tiome spent farming annoying greens in a buggy zone is time that could be spent leveling and getting plat (or gasp, doing something interesting in real life).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe I failed a couple stacks of sickles a couple of weeks ago. After that I sort of have went cold on smithing. Decided right now I needed a break. I buy everything though. I've been doing quite well at making blue diamond cultural bracers. Going 1/3 for my level. So I've made some of my money back :)<br />
<br />
I'm spending about 3 to 4 k per 20ish attempts I'm guessing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering your skill is at 178, one possible method of reaching 250, with a mindset of keeping costs low is;<br />
<br />
Finesteel to 188, that will cost 1k to 2k...depending on fails.<br />
<br />
Shadowscream from 188 to 250, that will be around 5 to 6k (1.5k for 750 large bricks of ore, and molds at 4 to 5k, I am assuming molds are 3pp or lower).<br />
<br />
This is the method I am currently following myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sethlic</div><div class="date">01-07-2003, 02:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I apologize, I should answer the question.<br />
I did 180 something before the patch so spent maybe 3k there.<br />
I have been doing shadowscream since then and will continue doing this and Elven old cultural. Will probably spend 50k or so. Then on my server seems no one has sickles for sale the last few days, so there is still money to be made. I do smithing because I'm crazy. Blessed fishing rods have been more profitable by far. Was like 4 days fishing 5 hours straight then bang costs aboth 300 pp to make sell for 1000 to 1500, Hehe pays for smithing. I spent more time collecting 200 owl bear stuff then all of fishing alone. I suggest you level to post 62 and use you AA to increas you wisdom cap. I have seen an increase in skillups per combine with my wisdom at 265 now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahlmer</div><div class="date">01-07-2003, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the higher stats may help as well, like Sethlic mentioned.  Also, there was a patch that says it made skilling up a bit more lax.  Anyhow, from 60 combines the other night, I went from 202 - 205 which, imo, is a huge improvement over past attempts to skill up before I was 65.  I currently have 280 wis when I smith.</div></div><hr />

I skilled up on shadowscream, and sickles.  Shadowscream makes tiny profit (~4sp) selling back to NPCs.  Sickles made me a bunch, but prices are taking a beating now.<br />
<br />
The real cost isn't how much more, or less pp is in my bank, but in how much time it took.  It takes a huge amount of time, either farming componants, or farming/earning pp to buy componants.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sir0die</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you read the original post, he is starting fresh with smithing, not 178.<br />
<br />
here's an idea<br />
<br />
buy all the chunks of condensed shadow you can find in your bazaar (i wouldn't pay more than 3p each)<br />
<br />
figure about 20 combines per skill up (this stat is taken from more of the high end stuff that has been posted)<br />
<br />
condensed shadow arrow heads trivs at about 116. figure you're probably gonna train smithing up to 21 in your guild, so thats 95 skill points till triv.<br />
<br />
95skill pointsx20attemps per point x3 plat<br />
<br />
so you're looking at about 6k (including cost of file, flasks of water and allowing the purchase of a geerlock for 200p or less)<br />
<br />
thats is if you want to do it all in one pop to 116. of course, if cost is the concern, it's all poprtional to the amount of farming/dumpster diving you do.<br />
<br />
once you make all those arrow heads, they can be used to get fletching to 250, so give/sell them to fletchers. I gave mine to my warrior alt.<br />
<br />
there is also plenty of guides on this site on how to do it. you have to ask one question first. Do i want to just pay a ton of plat, and do it i'm a few sessions? or Do i want to farm as much stuff as possible to keep the cost down low?<br />
<br />
once you can answer that, we (the community) can give you a better idea as to the route to go. Heck, if ya got all the plat you need, just train up and start folding sheets of Mq ore, and start on plate. I believe the subcombines alone will get ya to a decent level before attempting to make the final plate combines. of course ya wanna start farming/buying pelts to make leather padding.<br />
<br />
<br />
me personally, i like the combines with a small amount of ingredients (2-4) and i get tons of those ingredients. so what if from skill 21-60 you fail alot, if skill is your goal those failures are acceptable. <br />
<br />
some people do one recipie for 2-3 skill points then change recipies to something else. example :<br />
electrum ornate chain bracers till 128<br />
gold ornate chain masks till 130<br />
gold ornate chain gorgets till 132<br />
gold ornate chain bracers till 135<br />
<br />
<br />
i hate having to sell back unused patterns, so i just do gold ornate chain bracers till 135.<br />
<br />
sellback is nice, some people pick their recipes based solely on what sells back at the best prices, therefore reducing the overall cost of skilling up.<br />
<br />
I have found, the cheapest route is usually the most time consuming (farming, buying/selling to vendors, researching recipies and their trivs, making all the subcombines yourself or with an alt, PLing alts to enchant/imbue stuff, sitting in bazaar trying to sell you warez)<br />
<br />
soo there really is not diffinitive answer to your question, what might be an acceptable success/failure rate for me, might not be acceptable to you. <br />
what might be an acceptable cost per combine for me, might not be acceptable for you. What takes me 5 hours to farm and subcombine for 20 attempts at a skill up, could be done in 20 minutes but cost you 80% more plat.<br />
<br />
so all i can really suggest, is read all the lovely material provided by all of us here and make your own decisions. <br />
<br />
(p.s. my bank has not had more than 1kpp in well over 3 months, i don't sit in trader mode alot, and i give alot of my warez away to guildmates and newbies, and i donate alot of my baked goods to those generous KEI casters.)<br />
<br />
oh, and i'm currently working on brewing, pottery, smithing, tailoring and baking. which leads me to another point, it's quite common for you to work up more than one tradeskill to support another.<br />
examples:<br />
<br />
smith/brewing (need tempers don't ya)<br />
smithing/brewing/alchemy (wanna make that purdy blue platemail?)<br />
smithing/tailoring (where do you think the leather padding comes from)<br />
tailoring/brewing  (need all those heady kiolas for Wu's)<br />
Tailoring/pottery  (need vials of _______ mana)<br />
baking/brewing  (jum jum spiced beer in a misty thicket picnic/picnic baskets)<br />
fletching/tinkering (tinker those bow cams for your fletchwers)<br />
<br />
<br />
now that i look at that, brewing, a good way to get brewing up to 122 is fishing grubs (bought in PoK and OOT) and flask of water make fetid essences, triv to 122. cheapest combine in the game for it's trivial lvl, for any tradeskill.<br />
<br />
<br />
hmmm, feel like i've been rambling, i hope it all makes sense.</div></div><hr />

I've read in the past that the best skill ups come from around 20 below the trivial.

<br />
There are lots of smiths who have reported the same thing, that they get skillups the most often when they are well below a trivial(ratio-wise). There are just as many that report having the opposite experience(like me, normally when an item is going trivial, I get the last 2 or 3 points in rapid succession). And there are those who have reported very mixed results. <br />
<br />
Personally this inclines me to believe that the trivial level of an item(the number no more skill can be gained from it) has nothing to do with the skillup formula except to check whether or not it's trivial. Of course I also think that the trivial level has nothing to do with the success rate because there are so many different Items that give max success rate at levels completely different from their trivial.</div></div><hr />

more time = less plat<br />
<br />
No, that is my point. You can go from 0 to 115 in smithing for 150-200pp in several cities in 2 hours max. Condensed shadow arrow heads are a complete waste of money *and* time. That was what I was trying to point out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
several cities/2 hours<br />
<br />
<br />
i can log on (i usuall camp in nexus) zone to bazaar, spend maybe 5 minutes finding the trader, buy the chunks and do the combines right in the bazaar (not that i would do combines in bazaar, we all know about lag). ok, it might take me what? about 30 minutes to do 10 stacks of a 3 item (chunks, water and chisel) the combine (more if in bazaar). <br />
<br />
so, ok, we both are pointing out that the more time you invest, the lower the cost. My example 6k plat in 30-40 minutes (1 zone maybe 2 if you'd rather do combines in SH), his example 200p in 2 hours (not including combining time) over several zones.<br />
<br />
so you can see , the more running around, the cheaper the cost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But to reinforece the time vs. plat thing.  I've 2 Days total Playing a LVL 10 SK Ogre and have Spent lets see.  Maybe 100 Plat tops (not 100K 100PP). and My skill is 109.  Only ever Bought Peaces of ore never bricks or Blocks.  and Farmed a few of rusty Weapons.  Sold maybe 50 plat of Banded too.  My bank account is at 20 Plat right now (higest Ever for me).  Even had a newbe combinde for me like 20 Small bricks (gave him the Peaces) He got a free to LVL 31.  and I made the Sheets.  <br />
<br />
I'll report if I find a Long Cheap way to the 180's I'm Thinking on Boncer shields, if I can get Adaminite Cheap maybe Profitable going to check if I can Farm it yet?  Any one Try this rout? I think the Temper and Adaminte might be cheaper then HG Ore and various Metal Blocks seeing you can Farm Adam..</div></div><hr />

<br />
That says it all.<br />
<br />
I just finally hit level 60 after 2 and a half years of playing and 120 played days on Toadstomp.  At least half of those played days were probably spent on smithing - and I got up to 242 on fine plate before the big trivials patch went in (long before in fact, I did most of the fine plate before there was a Bazaar, and about half of it while the sheets didn't stack).<br />
<br />
Even more so now than then, the cost of blacksmithing is measured not in pp but in time.<br />
<br />
My present policy is to require customers to bring ALL the ingredients and a large amount of pp (amount depending on whether it's new cultural or PoP), and under only extremely rare circumstances will I make an item with my own ingredients for someone else.  I find that those who actually come back to me a month or two later with everything are quite respectful and do not tend to have me make it for them just to resell - they truly value the items I make for them.  I also cannot help but respect them for having had the patience to collect it all, so it's a mutually satisfactory way of doing business.</div></div><hr />

I know what you mean and i&quot;m still sucking.. 109 (took a break the last week).  I offered to make someone banded just as a favor and they got impatient Wailting while I made Sheets.  Think i'll Take your wise rout.  Make the Custmer get the Compoients.<br />
<br />
It will increase the respect GM Smtihs Diserve.  I'm on the Quil server and I think there are only two GM Ogres on there,  I hope to be the Third and want to Get as many Diserving Ogres and Trolls as much Curtual as possable.  I spent 12 Hours trying to Farm Blood, and got three Vials.  being Lvl 11 My plan is to Level in areas that I can Farm the Stuff I'll use later.  I already figures I'll need to be a much higher Level to get anywere smithing.  I'm trying to talk to as many upcomming Ogres and Troll telling them to hold on to Blood Pelts and such.  then meet up with me later down the road and I'll Help them.  I hope to get a Hugh Group of Trolls and Ogres and make them the most Formitable Force on the Quil server.</div></div><hr />
