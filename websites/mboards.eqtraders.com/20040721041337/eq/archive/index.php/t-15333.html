<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>THAARGOR</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have tried making Barbequed Crab Pie using the recipe ingredients and I always get the standard &quot;Cannot be combined in this container&quot; message.<br />
All of my sub-combines are successful and I have tried the final combine in a spit and in an oven with no luck.  The only change I see of late is that we now need (2) unstacked egg batter instead of eggs but that still will not create the Pie for me.<br />
Can someone please advise?   <br />
I am trying to combine the following:<br />
Barbequed Crab meat<br />
vegetables (foraged)<br />
cup of flour<br />
cup of sugar<br />
Bottle of milk<br />
Egg Batter (2) unstacked<br />
When all that failed I even tried adding a pie tin to the mix but no luck.  Can someone please explain what I am missing or doing wrong?<br />
Thanks for any advice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would make sure you have the right flour, there are two types running around.  Make sure the flour you buy is not vendor overstock, but original flour.   Also a lot of those ingredients look like each other, make sure you have the egg batter and not vinegar, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>THAARGOR</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks, I have no idea how but apparently I was using the wrong type of Cup of Flour.  It is strange as it looks exactly like the other and since there is no recipe for making flour I am puzzled as to how or why this type even exists.  Regardless, I sold all 20 of them off : )) and am now using the correct type.  The only distinction between the two that I could see was their weight by the way.  The &quot;Good&quot; Cup of Flour is .01 and the Wrong type is .02.<br />
Thanks again : )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nanndas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I believe that there is Quested Flour and vendor bought flour. It shows up in the new UI when a recipe needs flour. There are many items in the game that look exactly the same. I had a Polished steel ulak that would not show a price on my trader (I had 3) when I priced one of the others. I had to put a price on it separately..<br />
