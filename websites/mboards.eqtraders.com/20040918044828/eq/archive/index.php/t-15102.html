<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">in the uifiles folder look for EQUI_TradeskillWnd.xml and delete it, then patch (may need to do a thurough) see if that helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You mean it won't open at all, or won't open with the new UI? If it's the new UI, CTRL, right click should do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">EQUI_TradeskillWnd.xml was what I was thinking of - I'm not all here tonite apparently.  Would try deleting that first and re-patch as was mentioned.  <br />
<br />
One other thing you could try, delete UI_Chauncey_povar.ini (after making a backup of it) and log back into eq, that should reset your entire UI which might fix the problem.  If that does the specific area related to the tradeskill window is located under<br />
[TradeWnd] in the UI ini file.<br />

Its 3:30am here im probably more incoherent than I was so if I made no sense at all just call me in the morning.</div></div><hr />
