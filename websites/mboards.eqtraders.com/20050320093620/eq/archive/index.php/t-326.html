Idealy though your image would be the size you want and there would be no need to resize it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If your just want to shrink a graphic, open it in a graphics editor and physically resize it, then save it as a new file. MUCH BETTER.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kehvrynne</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is important to have the actual graphic size match the specified display size.  However, there is a reason to specify the dimensions in the IMG tag.  <br />
<br />
     I'm sure all of us have encountered a page that constantly redraws itself as the graphics load.  That's what happens when you DON'T specify the dimensions of your inline images.  It's infuriating, particularly for those of us doomed to dial-up connections.<br />
<br />
     When the browser encounters the HEIGHT and WIDTH specifications, it inserts a blank space of those dimensions in the appropriate place on the page.  This place holder allows the graphics to appear on the page as they load without having to redraw the window contents.  It's a small thing, but you notice it when it's missing!</div></div><hr />
