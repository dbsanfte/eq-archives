<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Elinea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone found a recipe it is used in yet? There's 14 tons of cragbeast and hynid meat recipes, but the GoD baking tradeskill quest that requires Taelosian wheat makes flour that no one has found a use for yet (at least that has made it into the database).<br />
<br />
I've made items using aligned and shimmering ore, pale and shimmering nihlite, taelosian tea leaves and muramite scales. So far nothing with this new wheat flour has resulted in a successful combine. I've got a notepad with all the combinations I've tried and will post em once I try a few more things. <br />
<br />
Is anyone else working on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xodar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ummm, kinda, lol.<br />
<br />
Working on it in the sense that I did the refinement quest and have been stockpiling flour, but not in the &quot;I have enough stockpiled it's hurting my bank space, let's see what I can make&quot; sense:D <br />
<br />
I plan on trying some stuff this weekend, have been thinking about it a bit, and may run through the recipes that use vendor bought flour.  I  suspect that it would not be used in egg batter, although who knows /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just a thought, try making clumps of dough with it.  most recipies I saw had 2 recipies for each kind of egg.  1 using regular flour, the other, using quest flour.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Amaruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The quest flour that refers to is the flour you get from a quest in Qeynos. There was an issue were you could end up with 2 types of flour, one would work and the other would not, but they both had the same graphic and stats. It caused a number of reports of people saying one combine or another did not work.<br />
<br />
Looks like they went though and made seperate recipies for all of the flour combines to fix this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Llientylln</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Has anyone had any more success with this recently? (or even more DNC failures?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pointee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I now have 2 stacks for the stuff and have been trying a few things.<br />
<br />
Since it is flour I have been leaning towards some sort of bread/dough/noodle recipes...<br />
<br />
Going to start a list of things Ive tried to see if maybe we can find out a use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've been working on it for a while.  Tried eggs and egg batter, DNC.  In fact, Taleosien wheat flour is NOT tradeskill flagged.<br />
<br />
Currently trying to get the haffer chef there to talk to me</div></div><hr />
