<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>amickiew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I took a break from my smithing &amp; started stockpiling when I heard about the upcoming new ui in december.  During that time, Sony's been working to eliminate some plat generators within with price structure for trader to npc resales.  <br />
<br />
Now that I'm back smithing, I'm at 196 smithing so I'd like to raise skills with LDoN armor when I'm fortunate enough to find affordable tempers.<br />
<br />
However it seems that Sony in lieu of nerfing resale prices for med qual folded sheets, they've instead jacked up the purchase price of the base components near 100x from 3 silver to over 2pp<br />
<br />
Unless I'm screwing up my math, the cost of the metal components to make LDoN armor has gone up from a few gold to 80+ plat per item.  Add in the cost of superb padding &amp; market price of tempers, we're at or over 200pp production cost for a single item.<br />
<br />
Before December I burned through over 100 tempers for 2 skillups, &amp; that cost me 7k+.  If that's going to double or triple I'm not sure I could ever afford to GM this now.  <br />
<br />
Tell me I'm wrong &amp; it's still cheap, that I somehow was looking at the wrong items despite triple checking recipe lists?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you might want to go back and check your logs on purchasing the mq folded sheets for the LDoN armour.  The sheets required to make this have always been around 30pp each, 20pp each if you are making them yourself.<br />
<br />
If you are just trying to get your skill up, then I would suggest you do the Enchanted Velium Bits, which are considerably cheaper to make now that the price of CVTs are just under 6pp each.  I believe that if you farm your own small pieces of velium, each combine will cost less than 20pp, and they will take you to 222.<br />
<br />
Good luck whichever route you take.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, LDoN armor uses the same metal as fine steel plate. The blocks of Medium Quality Ore are about 20pp 5gp best price. They've been that price ever since Fine plate was first introduced. :)<br />
<br />
So, an LDoN Breastplate is actually around 87PP just for the 3 sheets of metal and the Superb leather padding. Then of course, you add the temper cost to it and the price of the mold... *sigh*<br />
<br />
I just got past the LDoN phase a couple weeks ago, so this is still very fresh in my mind. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Unidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They do sell back to vendors at about the cost of the supplies minus the temper.  So it's not ALL that expensive.</div></div><hr />

The cost of some of the ore being that cheap was a bug/exploit that was finally corrected.  For some reason, their price mysteriously dropped, allowing people to plat farm vendors.  I'm assuming that they were brought back up again because there's just too many recipes that use MQ ore.  Mwahahaha. :)</div></div><hr />

Mwahahaha.This answers my question, since I wasn't buying the big  blocks, rather I was crafting my way up to them from the itty bitty level for the cost of 3 silver per component.  It appears that by the time I got high enough for LDoN, this bug was already in place &amp; I never new the components to have been more expensive at some previous point in time.<br />
<br />
Oh well, happy to see the plat machine fix, sorry to see my costs go up.  I guess when something seems too good to be true, it is.  Thanks for the clarification.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zeralenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They nerfed those combines upward from small pieces to prevent macroers from making a profit on the combines.<br />
<br />
So, you can't really save that way anymore.<br />
