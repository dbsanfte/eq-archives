Who wants to give me a dollar? <br />
<br />
LMAO.  This reminds me SO much of a scam a guy used to run whenever he needed cash.  Every time he needed a bit of cash, he'd run this ad in the classifieds:<br />
Send in your dollar now!<br />
PO Box 123, City, XX 12345<br />
<br />
(Obviously, with his address there.)  Yes, that was the ad in its entirety.<br />
<br />
People would rush to send in their dollar bill!  The guy would run the ad once a month, for a week at a time, and come away with hundreds of dollar bills!<br />
<br />
The police eventually shut this guy down, but I'm still amazed at the stupidity of some people.  He never promised anything at all; he certainly never sent anything back -- not even a thank you note.  Yet people still flocked around like mindless sheep and sent him hundreds of dollars each time the ad ran.<br />
<br />
Anywho ... obFan Faire.<br />

I'm trying to work out whether I can hop over to the US for the Fan Faire this year.  I have some personal business as well, so I'm hoping to combine the two and mix business with pleasure, so to speak.  We'll see how that goes. =)</div></div><hr />
