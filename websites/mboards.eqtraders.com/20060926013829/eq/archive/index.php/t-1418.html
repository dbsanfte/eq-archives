In about 40 kills I have not seen one crystal thread for the 5th shawl. Have the changed the drop rate or the mob that the drops the thread? I knew they use to be common here but have not seen them lately. If anyone has seen them could you let me know that it still drops. <br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

When I needed my threads, I went to Velks, and asked the Frenzy group if I could loot the threads in return for (insert what your class can contribute without KSing or messing up the group =)  They always said yes, and when someone left, I usually got put at the top of the list and invited into the group!<br />
<br />
I was able to get all the threads I needed in 2 or 3 sessions there, and everything was still blue at 60, so I got some XP too.<br />
<br />
For reference, this was in June or July of this year, and I haven't been back to that camp since.<br />

I was too young to fight there but was able to go in and loot off dead spiders and even help heal a monk who could solo these.   Since November though I have not seen the silks at all.  They have either changed the drop rate or the mob.  If it is the drop rate it would suck since I need 55, if it is the mob I would like to know if anyone has found which mob they drop off of now.</div></div><hr />

That is where I got all of mine, But it was a very long time ago(like a year). <br />
<br />
Of course in the last year I have only gotten 3 freaking wurm biles. But that is another story(I just finally upgraded my video card to where I should actually be able to see the glowing ones, and After 3 weeks I haven't seen a single freaking one).</div></div><hr />
