<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Benthair Dunthat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So this weekend got the last tradeskill into the 190's (pottery to 197 doing about 5000 combines - will never eat a casserole again). Others are<br />
<br />
Tailoring - 195<br />
Jewelcraft - 198<br />
Brewing - 198<br />
Blacksmithing - 190 (barely)<br />
Fletching - 193<br />
Baking - 193<br />
<br />
Coincidentally also hit Lvl 60 - YEAH!! My decision is this, I actually want to be a master tailor, but is going to take a while to get that skill to 250. I have only the first 6 AA's, and am going to try to lvl up to 65 before working on any more, since this kind of seems to be the  consensus of opinion out there - hit 65 then AA.<br />
Should I take one of the others over the 200 mark up to 250 (thinking Brewing or Jewelcraft) and get that Grandmaster item, or is it worth delaying my tailoring advancement. Any advice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is my advice, and as such, it is opinion.<br />
<br />
1. Leveling and AA skills are more important then tradeskills. <br />
<br />
2. You will not get rich tradeskilling. You *WILL* get rich selling tradeskill items to tradeskillers.<br />
<br />
3. Do not make a trophy. Buy some Tink bags/ Haversacks/ Lemming Fur bags and 2 Opal Encrusted Steins. You will save yourself a lot of money, headaches and hair.<br />
<br />
4. Do not do tailoring first.<br />
<br />
5. Do NOT do tailoring first.<br />
<br />
6. DO NOT DO TAILORING FIRST.<br />
<br />
These are my opinions. Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mewkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In regards to whether to do tradeskills or level/aa, the most important thing is to do whatever you enjoy more. Remember, the object of everquest isn't to get to level 65, it isn't to accumulate 300+ AAs, it isn't to get to 1750 in tradeskills. Those are all a means to an end. The objective of everquest is TO HAVE FUN. If you enjoy tradeskilling, do that. If you enjoy leveling, do that.<br />
<br />
As far as which tradeskill to go &gt;200 with first, I'd probably recommend going with smithing or tailoring as it's unlikely you'll finish them before hitting 65. This way you can still be playinng with tradeskills while still leveling. If you did brewing, you'd be finished with that in about an hour or two, then wouldn't be able to do any more tradeskilling till you've spent the AAs. Unless that's your objective (put off tradeskilling till you're done leveling).<br />
<br />
And as you level up, start collecting ingredients for doing the 250 push in those other tradeskills (primary ingredients for most tradeskills is pp).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Turlo Lomon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mmm... and here I was thinking the object of EQ was to get 1750.<br />
<br />
However, what was said is correct.  EQ is a game.  A game, by definition, should be fun, or it would then be called work.  For me, I have a lot of enjoyment trying to hit 1750 on tradeskills.  Shoot, I have been at it for five years.  If I start to get frustrated, I take a break, then go back to it a month later.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is this.  Do what you want to do.  Do what you feel is the right thing to do.  Yes, there is some good pointers stated in this thread, but are they the right choices for you to make?  That all matters on what your personal goals are in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I found it easier to put EXP and RAIDS first. Then when there wasnt anay raid or no exp group wanted me I did trade skills. Its amazing ho wmuch wasted time gets filled when you put everythign else first. Otherwise I found myself not exping to do trade skilsl then sitting doing nada when I wanted to exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Liandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I actually got NTCM1 as part of my 1st 6AA's :) <br />
<br />
I decided on Baking and Brewing 1st.  the reason was that these to give a reasonable reward for the time put in.  There are a few high lvl stat food/drinks that sell well and can easily cover your costs and help provide cash for the remaining skills.<br />
<br />
As for the trophy,  I just kept my eye out for the gems on NPC vendors and made the seal myself.  I have even been able to sell a few extra seals in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nitpaac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hey Benthair,<br />
as Mewkus said, it all depends on what you prefer to do.<br />
I've heard of players who are Baron's and don't even have Runspeed3, because they *had* to GM more than one tradeskill...<br />
<br />
If you look purely for the fastest way to AA, yes, levelling to 65 and then start them is the common route.<br />
<br />
But then, it all depends on your goals (for maximum fun).<br />
<br />
I for example like to prepare my tradeskill sessions. Days and weeks of gathering components, and then some evenings to burn through my stock with hopefully many skillups.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
       Nitpaac<br />
<br />
P.S: In contradiction to Splunge, I have three trophies already. Yes, it may not be wise money-wise or stat-wise, but hey, that's the crown of every tradeskill in my opinion, so it's my final goal.<br />
Others stay at skill 240 + geerlok and are happy with that, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kahmon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">First off...have fun and do whatever you want.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, here is my opinion which I have posted several times:<br />
<br />
The best tradeskill you can pick if you are only picking 1 is Baking.<br />
Every other skills big rewards are droppable. Therfore you can either buy them or collect materials and find a GM to make them for you. However, if you want the primo food item then you must be able to make Bristlebanes Party Platers yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Benthair Dunthat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks all, and you are collectively correct. Sometimes get so focused on skill ups I forget why I started the game - for enjoyment. I really enjoy tradeskilling while I am doing it, but also get a kick at &quot;r***ing and pillaging&quot; with friends. Again thanks for the feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I am lvl 55, and gave up hunting for exp. I just started Tradeskills and I will be only working on Tailoring full time until I get it to 250. I of course will get smithing to 122 and pottery to 105 for the subcombines.<br />
I will not give up, I will not stop, I will do nothing else....until I get Tailoring to 250.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kiatek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Tailoring to 250 was pretty much my obsession a year ago.  I took a break for about 6 months and came back about 3 months after the release of POP.  I was level 60 (had been so since velious era) and decided I was staying there-- All because I decided I wanted to finish Tailoring.  It took me 5 months of farming, buying, selling and clicking but I did it :)  During that time I also got baking to 250 as I needed breaks from farming spider silks.  I then experienced some tradeskill burnout and played for about 3 more months off and on and took another break from the game.  My advise from experience is to avoid obession as much as you can.  It very well could give you burnout :)  Do what you have fun doing and it will all turn out good :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Tailoring obsessed me for most of the last year, but now I'm kind of in coasting mode on it, not worrying about when exactly I'll sail through to the end. So I've started exping again. I like do a mix of it - some night I tradeskill, then I'll take an hour or two and exp a little. I don't raid much, though my guild raids a lot so I could if I wanted. But really I think you shouldn't be afraid to mix it up, and only do what you really want to do at any given moment. As everyone said, this is entertainment after all, and if you're not enjoying yourself most of the time something is very wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">if I do zero farming and only buy my ingredients......do you think I could go from skill 115 to 250 in Tailoring in one month if thats all I do? I have access to a Enchanter skill 250 with trophy to make Gem Studs for the solstice robes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I see your point. Getting to 115 was so quick. Now I am on Wu's armor and the skill-ups have slowed down a lot compared to before, and I am only at 138. I am now getting slowed up by filling sewing kit with 7 items, plus the slower skill-ups......wow this will be a looonnggg haul. I know burn out will set in at some point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Filling the kit with 7 items??? Why aren't you using the new UI?  Click Click Click.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Meriru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">As far as AA goes, does NTCM count as 3 or as 1?  (I haven't ever finished my first AA point... went back to 100% regular XP a while ago)...<br />
<br />
That is, to get Dire Charm you need to spend something like 20+ AA's in lower (general/class) AA; for the purpose of getting Dire charm does 1 point (3AA) in NTCM count as 1 or 3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Breez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">For the Purpose of your question every AAXP skill = the number of aaxp it took to buy.  So 3 or if you get it twice you will have your Baron title.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">So basically you must get your AA exp bar to go completely across 6 times, and then you get Barron title I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Originally posted by Tejaye <br />

<br />
Yes, but you have to actually spend those 6 points in General AA and not PoP AA, PoP Abilities or GoD AA (Or Archetype or Class, but you can't spend any in either of those anyways until you fill the prereq 6 in general for arch and 12 in arch for class)<br />
<br />
Edit: and just to clarify, Yes, NTCM counts as General AA, so you can get baron title and access to Archetype AA with NTCM2, though I would heavily recommend getting run3 instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends on your money supply. If you ding 250 before bank goes to 0, sure can easily be done in a month. Although bazaar might not have enough supply for all the combines needed. But if you can find it, you better have an extremely large fortune you are willing to spend.</div></div><hr />
