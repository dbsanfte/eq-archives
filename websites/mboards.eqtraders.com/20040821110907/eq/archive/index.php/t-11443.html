<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Flintforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I bet you are really tired right now of all the problems with creating it, but I bet tomorrow you will be very proud of all the things you learned getting it done. :) <br />
<br />
GREAT JOB!  and THANKS SO MUCH!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Okies, this one thread in this forum is where you can add commentary about the database.  (You like it, you hate it, etc., etc.)<br />
<br />
As mentioned in the main post, and on the front page, we're not ready to accept feature requests, so if you make suggestions in this thread, we'll happily ignore them.  ;D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">big elfie huggles!  grats and good job!  8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">After running around and exploring the site a bit, I personally have two distinct opinions on it:<br />
<br />
1)  For finding out the information you want, its absolutely wonderful.  The abilities to search for the desired item, to connect to all the recipes items are used in and link directly from the recipe back to the recipes to make ingredients ... its going to make dealing with faulty memories so much easier, and save a lot of time (on the consumer's part).  It's quite an amazing feat to have put all this together - I have no idea of how to express the degree of thankfulness for the effort put in to making this a reality, or even if a thanks or a congradulations would be more in order.  Either way, its a spectacular job.<br />
<br />
2)  I really miss the &quot;organizational&quot; listing of things.  The cultural pages with the &quot;ingredients&quot; at the top and the &quot;finished products&quot; at the bottom, the smithing conversions grouped by type (bits, sheets, studs, etc).  I figure this is more a issue for converting myself between them, as the search features and ability to look up a recipe directly will reduce the amount of &quot;just browsing through the recipes&quot; that is done, but its the one area where I keep feeling a little pang of loss.<br />
<br />
The more things I've tried to look up and figure out, the more impressed I've become with the magnitude of the database project.  I'm just completely awed ... and looking forward to using it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ame</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wow what an awsome job!<br />
<br />
and i think its time more people contributed to &quot;guides to &lt;instert tradeskill here&gt;&quot; than complaining about the inability to group certain aspects of the site. The website has a learn section so lets concentrait on increasing that.<br />
For instance how about how to tailor to 250 if your a &lt;instert race here&gt;&quot; or maybe &quot;so you farmed 2,000,000 pieces of acrylia, what can you do with them?&quot; :)<br />
<br />
again great work DenMom your efforts are greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>fredrikL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I love it.  D <br />
<br />
I really, really love it. <br />
The advanced search, the quick trivial list, the whole thing just makes me soft inside. <br />
<br />
I want to take the database out to a candlelit dinner, woo it, marry it and spend the rest of my life in eternal bliss. <br />
<br />
Did I mention that I love it ? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eqNichola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You know who this is really great for? Not so much us, the hardcore tradeskillers (though it is of course an enormous boon for us!), but for our customers and most importantly our GUILDIES.<br />
<br />
Like many others do, I suspect, I offer free combines to guildies, if they bring me all the stuff. However, with nearly all recipes that people are interested in (example: Heraldic armor!), explaining what 'all the stuff' is takes a sizeable message board post. Now I don't need to do that. I just tell them to come here, put 'Fierce Heraldic Breastplate' in the search box, and they get a wonderful hierarchical breakdown showing them what they need to buy, what they need to precombine, what they need ME to precombine, and what they need to farm. No more 'you need ENCHANTED ore =)'. No more 'I need 2 celestial essence, pop to the baz and get me some?'. Just 'Oh good it's all here, &amp;lt;click&gt;, there you go, gotta dash, /bye!'<br />

<br />
Yes.  It will always give a full expand.<br />
<br />
It is done by javascript.<br />
<br />
the definition of printer freindly does not include javascript :)<br />
<br />
therefore it will always be a full expand.</div></div><hr />

Niami and Ngreth (and others) deserve to have a nice comfy vacation.  Do something fun, revitalizing, comforting, etc.  You always seem to deserve a big dose of pampering and now even more so.

Load time a bit slower than old site and some small corrections needed (like soltice robe combinable in a small sewing kit), other than that, awesome.<br />

The one (and only, it seems) thing I don't like is that there is not (unless I somehow missed it, but I tried several ways) a simple way to get a simple list of &lt;insert race here&gt; cultural robes.<br />
<br />
I can go to Erudite Cultural Tailoring for example and somewhere in that list are the robes.  IF I know the names I can scroll down and find them, but if I don't searching through that list can be a daunting task.  <br />
<br />
The old site had a link from the LoY Recipes section straight to each race's cultural robes.  While there is a very nice listing for the Swatches, it doesn't tell you what robe they are used for unless you click on the item and then click on Find Recipes.<br />
<br />
Other than that I very much like the new database stuff.  <br />
<br />
Niellya,<br />
<br />
I think I have a way to provide that with minimal effort. I will be testing it out today. It requires no script changes (which Ngreth will like right off), just a bit of creativeness. If I can make it happen, I will post a notice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Niellya, <br />

Take a look at the end of the Recipe Page (http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g28&amp;menustr=080000000000) and see if the Legacy of Ykesha/Cultural Robes solves your problem...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Shabura</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Excellent work, much easier to see information and (I am certain) to update it.  Much easier, also, to see what is missing or needs changed ... I'm already hoping to unearth some missing trivials that this system has revealed.<br />
<br />
Many of the folks who dislike this change will come around as the database nears completion and a few more features get added in the future.  It *is* a change, and some people always fear change ... but this is a change for the better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Ranger_Lahru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Love the new DB.  Makes finding anything Much Much easier.  Only thing I'd like to see is an idicator for whether an item is stackable.  Would make planning those long combine forays much easier. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Stackable flag is there... I suppose you mean on the recipe lists, to show some sort of indicator on the item description to reflect stackability, correct?<br />
<br />
The only real problem there is selecting an appropriate symbol that people would not be confused by.  On the Item description we have the word shown... but you have to pull up the individual item to see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">We decided to NOT show stacking items on the ingredients of recipes because one starts to include TOO much information and it just gets really confusing.  It just requires that you do a bit more research and check the individual items in a recipe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Saphir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">just a short message to say a big thank you for all the job done<br />
<br />
i really like the DB features, especially :<br />
. combines exposed as a tree<br />
. link between items/combines<br />
. search of an item in the database<br />
<br />
continue like this, don't be discouraged by a few people that are never happy. critic is always easier than doing something</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Sanctum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Well done, indeed. <br />
<br />
And, I wanted to add - it is *not* easier to give constructive, detailed criticism than it is to say &quot;Yep! I like it! It's great!&quot; <br />
<br />
It's not a matter of the few, disgruntled folk being irritable and disatisfied, but it *is* a matter of those with specific ideas and helpful comments being caring and concerned enough to come forward with them.  It's not at all about not being able to satisfy everyone. <br />
<br />
Kudos to both those who found the database to be lacking nothing *and* to those who came up with specific and helpful suggestions. Thoughtful, constructive criticism can only strengthen the amazing efforts of the EQT staff.<br />
<br />
Again, I say - Well done!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Nindivenie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">I am a fairly new user so can't compare this DB to the &quot;old one&quot;, but I must say this one is an incredible feat.  I've built databases and they're not fun.  <br />
<br />
There's a wealth of info here that doesn't require a paid membership to access like another site (name not mentioned on purpose).  I've been able to Master 4 different skills just from the trivials lists and am getting near GM baker.  Any time I'm shopping and see something that says 'tradeskills' I can pop in and see what it's for.  I can easily see what I need in combines and sub-combines for any recipe.  I can print out any recipe with all combines listed, and if I think the list is too long I can copy, paste to Word and edit to my heart's content.  I can search any or all words in the name of an item, or do an advanced search if I'm just not sure what I want but I do know what I want it to do.<br />
<br />
Need I go on?  I could.  For hours.  Ok, pages. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Let's just say I love all of you.  Not for what you've given all of us.  Rather for the Dedication this required to bring to the web, and still requires to maintain.<br />
<br />
Love to you all!</div></div><hr />
