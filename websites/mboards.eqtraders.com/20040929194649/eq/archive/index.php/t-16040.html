<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wilmot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been playing Everquest for nearly five years now, with many a lengthy break, and started tradeskilling about 6 months ago:)  I had heard the practice could lead to addiction and the liquidation of dearly loved items to increase a skill I may never even use all that much.  It was a wonderously fun struggle at first.  Then someone told me about EQTC.  I am now almost finished with my 8th shawl (and soooo very stoked about it) and have GM skill level on two chars, along with every other skill to 200 with my druid until i can feasably earn and spend the aa needed to work each towards GM in turn.  It wouldn't have happened without you and your hard work and devotion.  Of the 6 or 7 sites I visit involving EQ, yours is second only to my guild site:)  You have added a new blood to my gaming experience and I love yas for it, thank you soooooo much.  Sorry it is so long winded....See you out there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Folks like you are the reason this site is here in the first place, and keeps going through thick and thin (even when I took several months away from the game last year).<br />
<br />
The Bristlebane worshipper side of me is cackling gleefully at the thought of yet another demented tradeskill addict, while the Mum side of me is just glad you found this little nook on the internet, and that it's helped you.<br />
<br />
G'luck on the completion of your shawl!  I just finished #8 for the second time and I'm alternately cheering and vowing &quot;never again&quot;.  ;)</div></div><hr />

I will believe that when I see your other characters get better shoulders than the Shawl :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wilmot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">LOL:)  Even though I am gonna sound a HUGE sigh of relief when i am sporting my fashionable 8th shawl, I know it is gonna eventually gnaw at me that my enchie has some very ugly 80's shoulderpad action and trudge right on through it again.  Here is to hoping I actually have something to add one of these days involving a new recipe, or a helpful hint on a drop:)  Til then I hope to see yas on the boards, good community is hard to find.</div></div><hr />

{sticks her tongue out at her husband} Two of the three active ones have their shawl -- the beast-ette will just have to suffer without.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You may change your mind about not getting your Beasty the shawl when you realize that there aren't really any Beast usable items out there with Extended Enhancement III or IV(except the Shawl).  Obulus Death Shroud with MP3 is about it for good shoulder items with focus effects, but if she gets 60+ it will be of less utility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heh, doubtful that I'll change my mind, since buffing is not the first order of priority with her. I play her when I need to *shred* something, after too long on my enchantress or shammie.  Her gear is more aimed at the combat side of BST, rather than the buffing/healing side.   :)<br />

Twice is enough ... trust me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ancalagon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think this is a good time as any to review the Rules and Regs of posting to EQTC.  We seem to have a brealdown here and if not curtailed here and now, this could easily turn into dueling sewing kits at 50 paces.  <br />
<br />
The rules are quite simple. They are posted in the &quot;Visitor's Corner&quot; and are certainly applicable here.  Here we go.....<br />
<br />
1.  Keep it clean AND FLAME FREE. <br />
 and<br />
7.  Personal attacks are beyond unwelcome.<br />
<br />
In my humble opinion, {sticks her tongue out at her husband} by Niami violates BOTH of these rules.  Also, I think it got Mom cooties all over the monitor, but that is another discussion.  Rules are rules.  Also Gnomes are gnomes but I am not sure what either of those facts have to do with this post.  But I digress.<br />
<br />
9.  Don't tease, annoy or bother the DenMother...she's not only a redhead, but also the owner of the site.[/<br />
<br />
I will believe that when I see your other characters get better shoulders than the Shawl  WOW.  I mean W O W.  That like violates the trifecta there.  I mean, sure, her reaction was over the top, but W O W.  That was pretty inflamatory, Ngreth.  I mean, not only did you lose your posting priviledges, but you get to sleep on the couch for a bit.  You need to work on your DenMother faction I am thiniking.<br />
<br />
But more important than all of that, is it really a good idea to have Mom and Dad agruing in front of all of us kids?  I mean, we are in a delicate stage in our lives, all 100,000 plus of us.  And seeing Mom and Dad going at it so fiercely is very disturbing.  <br />
<br />
Can't we all just get along?   :D</div></div><hr />
