<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Working on raising my smithing up (finally) and I am currently trying out the Enchanted Velium combines that trivial at 222.<br />
<br />
  My smithing was at 186 already from fine plate WAY back when I started EQ, so I have had no other combines so far in the new UI except one time doing a Quintessence of Knowledge for a friend.<br />
<br />
  With the QoK, I did the combine, and got a nice little message saying that I had managed to learn a new recipe.  Worked like I thought it would.<br />
<br />
  For the Velium I have been farming, I type in &quot;Velium&quot; in the search box and then I select the appropriate lines to slowly break down my blocks and bricks to pieces.   These recipes were already available and save a TON of time and frustration.   Love the interface.<br />
<br />
<br />
  My problem arose when I started trying to do the final combines and get some skill.   Now to get from 186 to 222 I fully expect to go through a stack of combines per point.  As such, getting that nifty UI to work is quite important to me, and so far impossible.<br />
<br />
 <br />
  I have clicked on a forge and opened up the UI.  I then clicked on the experiment key to get back to the old container style.   I then inserted my items and hit combine.   I have so far succeeded in making about 5 stacks of the item (as in 100 combines, the result is of course not stackable, and LORE), in that time I have managed probably an 80% success rate, yet I still cannot get the new UI to acknowledge the recipe.<br />
<br />
  Is there a minimum skill required in order to get the recipe to be learned by your UI?  Is this particular recipe not going to show because of the LORE, NO DROP or other tag specific to the result?  Or am I just missing something/ bugged?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Continued reading through older posts after putting this up and finally found the answer in there.   Enchanted Velium Bits was abbreviated as EVB in the entire post so I had missed it before.  It is just peculiar to this particular combine according to the post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Turlo Lomon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The problem you are referring to is that the EVB are intended for a quest. I don't think they were envisioned to be part of a skill up tree.  Although I think it would make it easier for blacksmithing, I personally don't think this should become learnable.  If you follow the story line involving the recipe, it should only have to be made once.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Maddoc-the-Wayfarer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">*cough* Lewena's ale *cough* <br />
<br />
That is a drinkable item, as are some others that you can do in the new UI that are also learnable. <br />
<br />
There are certain tradeskilled combines that resulted in things that didn't need to be made any easier to obtain than they already were, at least for now, and without closer evaluation. :)<br />
<br />
There's no clear-cut 100% method to my madness (at least not one that would make sense to anyone on &quot;the outside&quot;), but there is indeed a method somewhere in there. :cool:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Breez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;The tradeskill recipies that are ONLY used in quests will probably never be found in the UI&quot; Would probly be a more apt discription.<br />
<br />
Misty Thicket Picinic Baskets are used in a quest. but are also edible.  Many of the new foods from GoD are used in quests there for progression (and are also edible) and are learnable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Solstice Robes would be a much better counter-example (if its actually necessary to prove that SOE is not consistent).  The Robes are learnable as well as all of the sub-combines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>escotor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Originally posted by Graal <br />
Solstice Robes would be a much better counter-example (if its actually necessary to prove that SOE is not consistent).  The Robes are learnable as well as all of the sub-combines.  <br />
<br />
And that would be consistent since the robe *is* wearable and useful beyond the scope of the Solstice/Xanthe Earring.  Enchanted Velium Bits aren't useful for anything but the Oracle quest.</div></div><hr />
