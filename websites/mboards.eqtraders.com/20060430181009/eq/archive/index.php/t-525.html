they're in the center of the zone on the south and east shorelines.  They're spaced fairly far enough away to get single pulls and drop parts used in Slarg stuff poppers, blue diamonds, diamonds, raw diamonds and parchments.  <br />
<br />
Mean and nasty buggers tho...they're druids so expect to see a lot of Fire DD's, winged death, and root.  Bring a snarer as well as they run.<br />
<br />
Best way to get to them is to go just west of the nightstalker camp and then drop down to the shoreline.  There's an area further out where you drop into an area with no mobs and can start your pulls from there.</div></div><hr />

You can pretty easily pull them from the top of the cliff if you just look over the edge and drop a spell on them, then run back a little.  Simply have your FR and MR up high, and you should resist everything but Winged Death almost fully.  They are easy to tank with a charmed/decent pet...and I don't believe they gate.  They are SoW'd, however, so don't attempt to pull them if you don't have a way to deal with super-fast running mobs (hard to escape 2-3 of them).  <br />
<br />
Slime seems about a 1/4 drop for me...blood seems about a 1-10 drop for me.<br />

Enjoy!</div></div><hr />
