<br />
Is this going to turn into a marketplace only or should we turn it into the small community in a community that it was before?</div></div><hr />

I think it would be good if we could keep both the selling and the general talk of the community going, not just one or the other. Even though it is a marketplace for the community.<br />
confusing, eh?</div></div><hr />

On the undercutting of prices.  I try to match the lowest normal price out there (1 item at 1k under the normal range I let go so as not to depress the market if possible.)  When three of us have something at 1500 and one guy comes along at 1499 then I go to 1498.  Since I check the prices more often then most I'm going to win that battle if they want to fight it.  Usually I try to send them a polite tell first though.  Of course, that never works.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm a big believer in retaliation pricing, but sometimes I've been accused of that where it doesn't exist.<br />
<br />
Example: Cobalt drake belts MAY occasionally sell for 2k.  I've got LOTS on my vender (Want to see behind the scenes of my vender? http://www.eq-viatores.org/cgi-bin/vend.cgi ) at 1500 that I may have to drop down to 1k.  It's not JUST competition from the millions of other people that seem to be able to make them now, it's from other things like the Mucingiknlksdnfwhatever girdle that has dropped below it in price and compares favorably.<br />
<br />
For something like a POTC Idol or Robe, by all means, keep the price up, those leave the economy.  For the cobalt drake belt you have to look at what else can be gotten, and price accordingly.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the sooner people learn I'm perfectly willing to burn the town down around me to prevent someone from underselling me, and just price AT my price and not lower, the happier everyone will be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">thankfully... the new pop tinkering market seems to be holding.<br />
<br />
collapsed containers are a solid 500pp each<br />
the &quot;devices&quot; range from 2000-2500pp each<br />
<br />
i dont even bother making non-POP food and drinks anymore, as there are plenty of cuttroat vendors who will quickly drop 400+ HMP or GLM at 5pp each.. and I just buy a stack and move on (so I dont have to make it myself for personal comsuption)<br />
<br />
I am however interested in adding some of the PoP brewing tempers/agents..for the PoP smithing/tailoring, but I dont know how much interest or what to price at for some of these components... I guess I will play by ear.<br />
<br />
I like to trade vs buying/selling... its just my preference.  however I wont turn down a offer of rediculous amount of platinum if it comes my way :)</div></div><hr />
