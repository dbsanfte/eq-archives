<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Soxxonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First, i was thinking it may be a good idea to post a warning on alchemy recipe page that states **Warning Alchemy is Level Capped** i was smart and only did 100 combines before i realized it, but i have heard from others that spent ALOT of pp before they found out. would be a great benefit to skillers and readers.<br />
<br />
Second, <br />
maybe everyone would try to send a feedback in game asking why Potion is like one of only 2 tradeskills (i think only other is research) that is level restricted, and really there isnt a reason for it, especially since some of the potions have a Required level to use anyway. i have found that alot of things change, and are improved through /feedback.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dryanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All tradeskills that are not available to everyone are capped in regards to player level.  This includes - Tinkering (only gnomes), Alchemy (only shaman), Research (only int classes) and Make Poison (Rogue only).<br />
<br />
They're restricted skills - both in who can do them, and how fast they can advance in them.  This is a design feature to make sure that only characters of that class which are actually played are the ones who can advance to the upper echelons of that trade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tinkering is not level capped. It is only restricted in the sense that a gnome must be 16+ to raise the skill above 50 (which is where it starts). My gnome is level 16 and has 160+ tinkering.<br />
<br />
Alchemy is, Research is. I've never tried Make Poison so I don't know for sure on that one.<br />
<br />
Personally, I agree. If gnomes can raise skill to GM level without levelling past 16, the other race restricted skills should also be able to at their &quot;start&quot; levels, which I believe is 25 for Shaman and 18 (?) for Rogue. (My rogue is only 15 so I am not sure on this level.)<br />
<br />
[edit] Forgot Research. I like this one being level-capped, but it probably wouldn't change a whole lot if it weren't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lomerax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tinkering was level capped for a very long time, I unfortunately found out the hard way trying to skill up with rebreathers before kunark came out   :(<br />
Im not sure exactly when they took the level cap out, but if shamans could just be as whiny and annoying as gnomes, they might drop it for alchemy too :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I personally hope they don't drop the level restrictions.  It kinda makes sense that a shammy would have to gain more wisdom (levels) and ergo before making potions that do more.  Also, not having a million level 25 shaman alchemy twinks running around is kinda nice.  Right now it means something to be 200 in alchemy.  Not only that you've put in the time and effort to max out the skill but also that you're (supposidly) well experienced in all the ways of the shaman (there are still some high level shaman twinks).  Alchemy used to be so expensive that the level cap only really mattered for twinks, I know I used to spend all my pp on alchemy and spells and had none to spare for gear and it was ages before I could afford to skill as high as my cap.  They've already made alchemy a lot easier to skill on with cheaper potions, taking out the level cap would cheapen the skill too much imo.  Though giving us slightly more usefull potions at all skill levels so we can skill up on stuff that will sell would be nice!  (And letting focus and the pr potions stack...please?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mafdet de Leone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree with Tudani. I don't mind the level restrictions.<br />
<br />
And for those who complain about the price of SoW dropping, if it were NOT capped, think about how many level 16 shammy twinks you'd have to compete with selling potions in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
To me, it makes sense, from an RP perspective, that those who have gained levels and experience should be able to create additional secret &quot;recipes&quot; that lower levels (who don't have tthe exp) can't. After all, this is a MMPORG</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DogEye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yep alchemistery gets me a little twiked... not because of the lvl cap but the potions are so expensive to make and are low lvl buffs that only someone with a new chariture would want but would never fit in to a newbies price range...<br />
my thoughts on helping alchemists out<br />
1) lower costs of herbs that are used to make lower lvl buffs so a newbie can afford it and we can get one or two plat from it (in fact 5 gp wouldn't be bad either)<br />
2) restrict potion lvl for some of the higher lvl buff potions... this will balance the demand on some of the potions<br />
3)make it so that vendors will at lest pay you back the cost of the herbs with high chirisma (150+)or faction and if you are really on their good side or have 175+ chirisma they may give you an extra plat or two.<br />
4) just a concept but allowing the combination of 3 different potions (ie sow, turtle drink, and something else) to be combined in the potion bag making a potion with mutible effects... then being able to combine them agian to make a 5 charge 3effect potion..<br />
but maybe i'm complianing too much for having to sell sow for 85pp.</div></div><hr />
