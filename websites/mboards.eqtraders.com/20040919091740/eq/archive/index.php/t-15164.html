<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>0milrya0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just woundering if tinkering skill ups where broken I'm still only 50 in it after 140 standered bow cam combines, and 100 spy glass combines. I was sure at such a low lvl I would get at least 1 skill up from all these combines, or is this the norm?<br />
<br />
Thank you <br />

Since you say your skill is 50, then you are a gnome :) the other constraint is that you are level 16! You need to be 16 before you'll get any skillups. Yes, I hope you waited until you reached 16th level before making those combinations. :boggled:<br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm or correct this:  I think my gnome visited his guild trainer when he hit 16th level and trained in tinkering to activate the skill.  Has this changed or am I thinking of some other skill like meditation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't think I trained tinkering.  My gnome has not been to Ak'Anon since the day he was born, and I am not sure where else I would have trained him, as I do not know where the Wizard guild in PoK is.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I guess I must have trained him in Meditate, so I may have found the guild once, but I don't think I ever trained tinkering.</div></div><hr />
