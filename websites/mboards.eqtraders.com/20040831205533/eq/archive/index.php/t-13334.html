I ad an evening to do this, got out there and got the blackburrow skins, and already had 1 blackburrow cask in bank didnt take too long to get all the stuff. As you see it all now has a tradeskill flag.<br />
<br />
I did the combine with 185 Skill+Geerlok<br />
<br />
<br />
http://everquest.skystorm.net/BBSK.jpg<br />
<br />
Identifies as Blackburrow Stout Keg.<br />
Yield was 1 (one).<br />
Any ideas on qhat it is for I'm afraid to attempt to drink it, possibly a Stein of Moggok continuation/upgrade?</div></div><hr />

You could always try turning it in to Lewena. Nope, she doesn't want it.  I made one this morning and tried it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zuklaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wonder if Clurg wants it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Try giving it to Clurg, or the bartender in Freeport. <br />
<br />
Since it doesn't say its used in tradeskills, its most likely just a drink (that's not worth making) if its not a quest item.<br />
<br />
(If it *was* used in tradeskills, I'd say it would either be a Brewing item or possibly a Smithing temper.....)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bronto Thudfoot and Lenka also spawn in Firiona Vie and are part of an unsolved quest there involving Cabilis Pale Ale (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=409).  Worth a try, anyway...</div></div><hr />

<br />
the weapon nevers top chopping is handed in in rogue redemtion  quest. The case is waht those previous alcohols+blackburrow stout are turned into when combined in the bottle crate, also in Rogue Redemption.  VERY interesting however, tht the keg is right after the stout, wher eare the hand in items for stein of moggok relevant to this?</div></div><hr />

I was always wondering if they would make a TS combine fer the items needed for the SoM quest.  I tried a few dfferent combine ways back when I used this for making some plat.  Glad to here that they finally made use of one of the more well-known quest brewing recipes.  :&gt;</div></div><hr />
