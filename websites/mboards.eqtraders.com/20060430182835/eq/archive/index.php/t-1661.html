<br />
Now, however, all this smithing has greatly depleted my funds.  I need to get a quick infusion so I can get more blue diamonds and whatnot.<br />
<br />
My question for y'all is: what's the easiest and quickest thing to sell for plat?<br />
<br />
My gut feeling is Fierce Heraldic.  Been thinking about making a Fierce Heraldic Breastplate and putting it on sale for 50K or thereabouts.<br />
<br />
Any other thoughts?  What's been your most reliable source of income?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

On most other servers, prices for the BP are in the 20k-30k range, no one would buy it for 50k. <br />
<br />
If you want to conserve money, you should hang out in the bazaar and bazaar channel, and auction that you are taking orders on heraldic armor. That way you ensure yourself a sale, and you know exactly which deity to imbue it for. If you are really in tight jamb money-wise, some customers may agree to a down payment in return for a discount later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taraddar</div><div class="date">12-30-2002, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm actually a barb smith but I would have to agree that the best option is to hang out in the bazaar channel and auction that your a human smith taking orders and make the peices after you have an order. With the large number of possible imbues for humans multiplied by the potential peices the amount of things someone could possibly want is huge. Yes the fierce for the ralos zek warriors is probably going to be your best seller over all but when you need to sell something to make your money back it's best to be able to make what ever they are looking for. Probably also need to line up people or mules for the assorted different imbues or get some gems preimbued.<br />
<br />
Bp's never seemed to be that popular of a peice when I was selling. Quite a few nice bps out there as drops and MQ's availble too. Just seemed like most people who could afford a cultural bp could get something else either as a drop of bought. Bracers for almost any class seemed to be popular and for barb warrios at least the legs and boots seemed popular too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my experience, most Human Paladins follow Mithaniel Marr... so Luminant Heraldic is a good option too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meirril</div><div class="date">12-31-2002, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is probably chicken feed as far as a cultural smith is concerned, but don't forget about Acrylia plate armors. I've found there is a hole in the market which they fill (have enough plat to buy some &quot;real&quot; armor, don't have enough plat for &quot;uber&quot; armor.). Your looking in the 1k-2k price range on Fennin Ro, most poplular peices being the BP and leggings (both are hard to beat. Other slots there are dropped peices that run either slightly less or slightly more and are redialy available and similar in AC.) I wouldn't make a whole lot of either, but the sale of 1 Bp and 1 leggings would fund 1 attempt at a Heraldric Armor peice. (assuming you farm your own temper. Essense of Sunlight is just rediculously priced.) (also assuming you didn't farm your own materials for the Acrylia Plate, and bought windstones at 200pp each, blocks at 125pp each. essense of wind at less than 5pp from a vendor/player, and got BD's at about 500pp each. Once again the best selling price in Fennin Ro. Even seen a few dip lower than that.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got my start by making a pair of legs and a few bracers and auctioning those in the Bazaar channel and in the Bazaar zone. I also posted on our server board on EQVault that I was taking orders, complete with all stats and prices and the trade-ins I would accept. I also did free sickle combines - goodwill build be a very solid customer base.<br />
<br />
Best of luck to you.</div></div><hr />
