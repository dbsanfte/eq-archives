<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meriru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A friend who I play EQ with (we use phones to communicate) and I were doing some fishing (I'm at 200 on one char. and was skilling an alt while he skilled his main); we discussed making fishing into a drinking game (I have fisherman's companion and play on FV so getting ale was easy =p) <br />
<br />
I don't recall the exact rules we came up with at the time, but it was something like <br />
<br />
Rusty Dagger = drink 1 ale<br />
Tattered Sandal = drink 2 ale<br />
Spill Your Beer while bringing in your line = drink 3 ale<br />
<br />
(We were in Cobalt Scar at the time, places like Firiona Vie or LOY zones have a lot more random items you could assign drink numbers to)<br />
<br />
Just thought people might like to have a big fishing party game sometime with friends or guildies =)<br />
<br />
Also a good excuse to brew up some alcohol (if you're into that) for use instead of summoned ale.<br />
