<br />
On my server, I'm regularly looking at merchants in Rivervale. I was told to look at the one near the forge (and near the druid guild) as plp may make it there and sell it to him. Neither him or others merchants had the Vale kit, any time I looked at them, so I had to raide my smithing to make one for me...</div></div><hr />

She (I think it was a she, it's been a long time...........) had more than one.  Now I wish I would have bought all she had, and put in the bank!<br />
<br />
Any luck yet?  I'm a halfling, and my smithing is 162, and I have a gearlock.  Don't know trivs for the sewing kit, since I didn't have to go through the pain of making one, but if you get me the materials, I'll give it a go, if you're still looking.</div></div><hr />
