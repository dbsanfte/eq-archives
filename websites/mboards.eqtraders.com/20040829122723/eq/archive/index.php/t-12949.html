<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cannyar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">my baking skill is at 197 (oh so close to 200).. i spent the day making making over 50 combines of ohabah truffles and 100 halas 10lb meat pies. not a single skill up. the truffles i do in my collapsable kits. the halas in pok. my int is 249 w/o kei but i keep a kei on anyway.<br />
<br />
very frustrating to say the least. i'd like to at least break 200.<br />
<br />
anyone have any suggestions? am i having a bad day? is something broke?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hmm u tried jumping up and down while clucking like a chicken?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cannyar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if i thought it would help. i would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wordan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I hit that area from about 195-200 I had a few runs of 150+ combines without a skill up with a WIS of 235.  You will get through them just keep at it =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Elinea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thats a tough hump to get over, you just need to keep plugging away. If I had that bad of a run, I'd log off for a while (the theory is, the RNG hated my guts so if I logged off for a few, it would go pick on someone else!) It did seem to help jump start the skill ups, but that could have just been my own little delusion :)<br />
<br />
I did mine with justice fruit pies, from 192 all the way to 250. One good thing I noticed about that, was after I hit 200 there were almost no fails...I passed out pies to all my friends, alts, trader bot, etc :)<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

am i having a bad day? is something broke? <br />
No.  You are not having a bad day.  The guy who did 719 arctic wyvern combines without a single point (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=12688) was having a bad day.  You are just experiencing a slow point in your skill gains.<br />
<br />
My suggestion is (a) save your wrists and don't do Halas pies for skill gains, as truffles are much easier and (b) whenever you go through a stack or two of combines without a skill gain, stop and do something else for a while, as it will make you feel better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shrug. I skilled on g halibut and snapper from 191 - 208, 194-201 took me 56 combines with 248 int. Others was about 1 per 23 combines if memmory serves. Just bad luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>cannyar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">thanks for all the responses. i was wondering if you can't get skillups from collapsable kits or something.. well taking a day off of EQ. i'll try again tomorrow..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Diania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think it took me about 300 combines (was making ohabah truffles) to go from 199 to 200 on my paladin, then again, I had a pitiful wisdom of only 180.  Ended up with a ton of truffles, so I gave a ton out in newbie zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Elinea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As to using collapsible kits...sure you can get skillups, thats all I ever use :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>cannyar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">interesting.. last night i didn't bother getting kei, had 246 int. made about 16 stacks of H10MP and got to 200! maybe having max int/wis isn't a good thing?<br />
<br />
will get back to making more soon..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aavar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">its all luck , usually bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah, it's all luck unfortunately.<br />
<br />
Gonna have to figure out some ritual to do to appease the RNG before you do your combines... :p :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lyssabeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">262 combines of Truffles or Candied Cockroaches, with skill 200 and wis 330, with baking utensils, and still no skill up. If anyone has some verified ritual please let me know. I have tried buying a cup of flour and spilling it out in front of my cooking area without success.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Serenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Lyssabeth, just to be safe, though I'm sure you already did this -- verify that you didn't already take a skill over 200 without realizing it, and without buying the Tanaan AA......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lyssabeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I am all 170's and higher, but Baking is the only thing at 200 or higher.  I basically ran out of room on my bankers for more tailoring pelts/skins so decided to clear out my pantry banker first. It is getting slightly frustrating.<br />
<br />
At least it hasn't cost me very much (time, farming, PP) overall trying to do this one skill point, unlike my 152 combines of superb rockhopper hides and acrylia studs to ding that one point to become trivial.</div></div><hr />

if i thought it would help. i would.  <br />
<br />
It will, I promise... Oh yeah, and having someone take pictures will help even more. I hear Video guarentees a skillup. :p</div></div><hr />
