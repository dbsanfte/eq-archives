<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Weren't there a few lines for your &quot;You have XYZ unread private messages&quot;  underneath the OOC and PRimal Scream forums?<br />
<br />
Now they seem to be at the top of the forums.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then again, I just woke up, and It's entirely possible that I'm wrong.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>lonewylfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I noticed that too...kinda glad for it though, I always missed new messages with it at the bottom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Working As Designed. :)  <br />
<br />
Ngreth made this change recently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Many people were missing private messages.<br />
<br />
I know ones I have sent have been ignored :)<br />
<br />
So I moved it to the top.<br />
<br />
Aditionally... it will blink when you do have private messages... to really make sure you realize... you have private messages.  So there will be much less excuses of &quot;I did not know I had private messages&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maisie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The blinking just alerted me to the fact I had a private message....that was made on Dec 4, 2003..../blush</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I like where it goes when you hit mark forum read now too, thanks for the change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agree<br />
This was one of my biggest annoyances with using this board..<br />
<br />
Thanks Ngreth :cheers:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That must have been in the version upgrade.  It was not a change I made :)  I did look for stuff like that... but found nothing usefull, glad it changed automatically with the version upgrade :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yay for PMs being at the top. Intentional change or not, I like it much better up there. <br />
<br />
-- Sanna<br />
see, without the shift key, that would have been 'yay for pms', and no one ever says that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Arakni Spellweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Me too.  I like the blinking, as I tend to be fairly oblivious to things sometimes. :)</div></div><hr />
