<br />
My roomates and I threw a positively Bacchanal  party last night, and had quite a bit of fun, but the aftermath isn't so fun.  *grin*<br />
<br />
Who the heck asked them to make the sun so bright today?<br />
<br />
I need to work on my alcohol tolerance.  In the mean time, I need to ask you all to please be quiet, and step lightly.     :angel:<br />
<br />
And remind never to let my roomate make me a drink again.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Heading to work, but not quickly,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's cruel Phabos.  It's much more fun to pour 95 percent ethanol on his pillow so he can get that fresh, pure alcohol smell when he wakes up.<br />
<br />
Mmm, mmm tasty.<br />
<br />
Yep, nothing like feeling really sick after making a drunk fool out of yourself to make you wonder why exactly were you drinking in the first place.  Not that I'd know.</div></div><hr />
