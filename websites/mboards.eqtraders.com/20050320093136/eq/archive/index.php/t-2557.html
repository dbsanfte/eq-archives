<br />
I found out that there will be CD's available after the add-on goes live. Here is the link: http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/categories/products/product.asp?pf_id=233050<br />
<br />
This pissed me off to no extent, so I took it upon myself to contact online support, here is the verbage:<br />
<br />
(Question was) My wife and I preordered the new expansion &quot;Legacy&quot; with the knowledge that it was for &quot;Download Only&quot;. Now I find out that it will be available on CD for the same price. This is clearly false advertising. What will I need to do to receive my copy(s) of the CD's that I was duped into not purchasing?<br />
<br />
You have been connected to CSR  Chris J..<br />
CSR  Chris J.: It's purely downloadable<br />
CSR  Chris J.: There are no CDs for it<br />
(Me): There are, want me to get the link for you?<br />
CSR  Chris J.: Please<br />
(Me): One sec <br />
(Me): http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/categories/products/product.asp?pf_id=233050<br />
(Me): It will be available after the addon goes live<br />
CSR  Chris J.: first we've heard of it<br />
(Me): This is fradjulant as I purchased it under the pretence that it was download only.<br />
(Me): I would have waited to get the cd<br />
CSR  Chris J.: As far as we've known it is downloadable only.<br />
CSR  Chris J.: This is honestly the first I've heard of a cd.<br />
(Me): I will hold while you get the information. You have the link to show whoever you need to show<br />
CSR  Chris J.: If you want to cancel the order you can sign into your account on station.com and cancel it from your account page<br />
CSR  Chris J.: It's a holidy<br />
CSR  Chris J.: No one is here<br />
(Me): Then I expect a call tomorrow concerning this, this is false advertisment and subject to fines. My number is XXX.XXX.XXXX I can be reached 24hrs a day. I will expect a call tomorrow<br />
CSR  Chris J.: Like I said, you can cancel the order<br />
(Me): That is not my problem, it is Sony's. False advertisment is a serious thing. They need to fix this. I will be expecting a call tomorrow<br />
CSR  Chris J.: Ok, you can cancel the order if you want to buy it on a cd<br />
CSR  Chris J.: That's fine. <br />
CSR  Chris J.: Cancelling the order wont' affect your account or anything else in anyway, then you can buy it in the store<br />
(Me): No, what I expect is CD's to be delivered to me when the are in shipping. Otherwise I know of about 300 people who will be more than willing to be participants in a class action law-suit<br />
(Me): I expect a call tomorrow, it is obvious you cannot deal with this issue.<br />
CSR  Chris J.: Ok Sam, Thank you for visiting our SOE Chat line.  Take care and have a Good Day!<br />
<br />
The only reason they did it this way was to save their sorry butts some of the costs of manufacturing and shipping. I am quite pissed off.</div></div><hr />
