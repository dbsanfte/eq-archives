<br />
Nearly all the information comes off of the EQTC site. As I catch updated trivials, 'patches' will be posted on the site. <br />
<br />
The Main Mod has all the information that any average character needs for the Basic Tradeskills: Baking, Brewing, Blacksmithing, Fletching, Fishing, JC, Pottery, Tailoring. <br />
<br />
the Small Mods page contains the more specialized information: Alchemy, Fletching, Poisons, Tinkering. They are in their own standalone mods, so if you want Fletching without all the rest of it, it's available. <br />
<br />
<br />
UPDATE, May 22nd. <br />
Finished Mod for Coldain Prayer Shawl quests. <br />
http://www.sannask.com/misc/eq/al_fl.html<br />
Feedback appreciated. <br />
<br />
UPDATE, June 1st. <br />
A small patch with updated trivials. <br />
<br />
Coming soon: Planes of Power mod. <br />
Coming soon: Legends of Ykesha mod.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do drop me a line with feedback. I will be leaving on the 10th of June for Germany, where I will be away for 2 months, so there is a bit of a time-pressure for me, to get this all done before then. <br />
<br />
Have fun, may the RNG like you, and never get to where you can't smile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkSidhe</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 11:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does the mod include cultural items as well as basic stuff? (semi-requesting it if not, I guess.:))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanna</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cultural is not yet here. I will be doing certain culturals by either personal preference or request eventually. <br />
<br />
The Main Mod is stuff anyone and everyone could use; the recipes that are open to all. The smaller mods are the more specialized, like Alchemy in it's own mod, as presumably only Shamans would want it. <br />
<br />
Culturals will be a separate series of mods, but they will not be done till after the database opens for a couple of reasons. <br />
a) I'm going to Germany in June and July. I will barely have time to continue work on the PoP information for the mod before going, let alone opening up a new mod system. <br />
b) The static site is no longer being reliably updated, and I do not have time before going to Germany to crawl through the forums and find the appropriate trivial changes. <br />
Therefore, culturals will be done after I get back from Germany. <br />
<br />
But they are planned. ^_^ Thanks for asking. Which cultural would you like me to do first, when I get that far?</div></div><hr />
