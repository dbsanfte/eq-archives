<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The various &quot;A Cask of XXXX&quot; items are the 8 charge versions of the &quot;A Bottle of XXX&quot; brewed LDoN Drinks that have an Intoxication Effect. The Intoxication effect by some reports gives you a running speed boost. Please note, other running speed buffs have been reported to overwrite the intoxication boost. <br />
<br />
THEY DO NOT STACK (based on reports).<br />
<br />
The Database shows them as &quot;Unknown&quot; currently, due to the database wipe, and not having the information reloaded yet.<br />
<br />
Please note, if someone has the casks, please post the Right-Click information and I will get it re-loaded.</div></div><hr />
