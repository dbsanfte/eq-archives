Kind of aggravated here, so decided to start a new kind of list: people who are deadbeats when it comes to picking up made-to-order trade goods, leaving  the tradeskiller holding the bag.<br />
<br />
I have been pretty lucky when it comes to having people pick up items they have ordered. I have (until this most recent case) been stiffed only once, and only one time felt a need to request partial payment prior to making armor for someone. So perhaps I'm spoiled, which is why running into these cases irks me so.<br />
<br />
So I was thinking perhaps a list of known deadbeats might be of value to the Quellious tradecrafter community - people NOT to make items to order for unless you get a deposit for materials up front. Of course, if the deadbeat pays off, their name needs to get removed from the list.<br />
<br />
Currently I have one deadbeat:<br />
<br />
     (Names deletd by Mod )<br />
    Placed an order for some Underfoot Platemail on 16 November. Pieces were ready for him about an hour after the order was placed, but he was offline. The following day, he asked if he could wait to pick up the armor as he had found a &quot;killer deal&quot; on a belt he had been looking for and didn't have the plat for the entire order - but would have it in a day or two. We worked out a deal where he would pick up one piece of armor (paying part of the fee) and get the other later that week.<br />
<br />
   Since then I've seen him on several times. It is always a &quot;bad time,&quot; but yesterday he finally said he'd be on later. Today, however, there is a new pitch--all his plat is now apparently on his main, a monk supposedly camping the Whistling Fists in Fear.<br />
<br />
   Anyway, someone to add to your &quot;sell to with extreme caution&quot; list. Perhaps he will come through some day, but I've given up on it.<br />

Edited by Lilosh: While I can see why you would want to warn others, I have seen the Admins lock/delete similar posts warning of Scam Artists, Deadbeats, Liars, etc.  I am going to lock this to prevent a problem before it starts.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure there is a rule against openly posting stuff like this with player names attached.</div></div><hr />

Maybe he was anon at the time, but it was definitely the same name.  But he was pointed out to me by a friend in group as being an alt account of the notorius *removed*.  *removed* was one of Quellious' most prolific scammers and ninjas until he was finally banned.  He had a serial scam going for a while cheating rangers with a fake MQ of the hate (or was it poa?) stone for their epic, which resulted in something like 7 rangers losing all of their epic work up to that point.  You might be able to find out more if there's still a post about him over at Ranger's Glade.  If it is the same individual, you're lucky you got away still having the armor you made.<br />
