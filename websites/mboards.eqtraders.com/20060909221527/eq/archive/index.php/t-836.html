<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blat Splat</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's my situation.  When I started EQ over 2 years ago, I thought tailoring looked fun.  I was playing a Gnome magician and thought I'd make my own armor.  Today, her tailoring is at 162.  Over a year ago, when Verant announced that  Erudites would be able to make the best robes in the game, I started an Erudite enchanter.  His tailoring skill is at about 90.  However, the robes he is able to make are mainly for erudites and few just for casters.  I'm very disappointed in that this does not seem to correspond with what they said orginally.<br />
<br />
Now, before I go through the pain of the acrylia drops or soltice robes to raise my Gnome magician to 250, should I look at creating a Halfling or Wood Elf instead?  At least that way, I'd have some cultural tailoring to help span the gaps and I'd be able to make some useful items (like those halfing haversacks  :D)  Then I could have my Gnome magician concentrate on tinkering (and tinker some of that wonderul tinkered armor that I can't use....sigh)<br />
<br />
What would you do?</div></div><hr />

<br />
it might be a bit easier with a 200 forager, but my 120 forager might get 1 or 2 acorns in three hours of foraging, and by running around looking on the ground i might get another 6 to 8 during the same time period (and /auc buying misty acorns isn't getting me much either, at least on my server).<br />
<br />
take it for what it's worth. =)<br />

<br />
<br />
Want to make cool armor for your magician?  You dont need cultural to do that.<br />
<br />
Want to make items to sell?  Analyze the various cultural and non-cultural items , see what would probably sell, and see how hard it would be to farm.<br />
<br />
<br />
Want to hit 250 in Tailoring for the sport of it?  Cultural may provide an alternate to the normal  Acrylia/Velious/Solstice Robes that are used to get from 158-250 by the masses.<br />

<br />
Though you can make some nice items at the high end I dont see how you would ever get many skill up thru the cultural options. I have managed to get all of 14 oak barks in many hours of foraging and constant checking of bazaar. Sabretooth hides are more common but another farmable item and rockhoppers at least give some XP. <br />
<br />
I am also not willing to use the oak barks for skilling up as they are worth much more when I have the skill to do Tunarean Scout/Soldier armour around 250ish.<br />
<br />
I recommend you do tradeskills on the character you enjoy playing rather than pick a character you may not enjoy to do the tradeskills you want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with MasterKrym, play and tradeskill on the character you enjoy the most.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cultural tailoring as a halfling is a giant pain in my tiny butt.</div></div><hr />
