<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mezmera</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Bleh, 100 combines of Shape Darkwood Compound bow yielded:<br />
<br />
98 sucesses<br />
2 Skill ups<br />
<br />
I'm currently 225 and they trivial out at 235.  I did these all at one time, but have been having the same kind of luck the past three days.  Anyone out there having the same problem?<br />
<br />
But YAY the standard bow cams are stackable now. :cool: <br />
<br />
PS. I'm definalty not complaining about the sucess rate, but dang i'll take some failures for some skill ups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If standard cams are finally stackable I am going to be one happy SOB.  What a huge pain it was loading up three mules and their banks with tinkered cams while getting my ranger's fletching to 250!<br />
<br />
And yeah, bad streaks of luck with the RNG are not rare at all unfortunately.  I had a streak of over 200 combines with no skill up :(</div></div><hr />
