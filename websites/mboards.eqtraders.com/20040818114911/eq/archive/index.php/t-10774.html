<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just wanted to write this as a heads-up to the other smiths on Veeshan.<br />
<br />
I've been making and selling the LDoN plate armors for about a week now.  Sales have been incredibly good on the Gothic, decent on the Frosted and Sandblasted, and nil (not surprisingly) on the other two.<br />
<br />
At various points, I'd discussed pricing at 19pp per AC.  This is probably too low.  There are two reasons for this.<br />
<br />
When I first priced the armors, I was estimating 20pp per temper component.  I am now offering 50pp per, yet I still can't get enough.  Sellers seem to be trying for 100pp per.<br />
<br />
Second, the demand for the armors has been surprisingly high at 19-20pp per AC.  The mix of good stats and relatively low prices in an economy with as much free cash as Veeshan means that the armors will move quickly.<br />
<br />
In retrospect, these armors would probably be priced closer to equilibrium at around 25-35pp per AC.  This would account for increased temper costs and the high demand, while still keeping the profit ratio at 2:1 over cost.<br />
<br />
I'm also considering raising the prices proportionally more on the Gothic armors than the other two.  It seems the gargoyle granite is the rarest of the components to drop, yet it makes the most popular armor.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />
