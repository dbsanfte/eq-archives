Foraged Sedge Branches in Miragul's Theme can be used as a bow staff.<br />
Makes a bow midway between oak bows and darkwood bows.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Osprey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think at one point I read an interview or something that said there were new fletching recipies that were bridge recipies in the 175-215 range, but that confused me. It's not like we really needed a bridge there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Janaleea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Maybe it will be a &quot;cheaper&quot; way since the staff would be a drop item instead of store bought ... not sure how useful that would be seeing that the drop rate would never be high enough to raise in skill but ... hey ... maybe that was their thinking anyway.</div></div><hr />

Some time ago, Sony fixed/nerfed/broke fletching when they decided to -<br />
<br />
1)  Fix/nerf the profit arrows and bows in order to stop macrophiles<br />
<br />
2)  Make fletching more difficult to skill up with (increase the average number of combines per skill up)<br />
<br />
The general consensus is that these &quot;fixes&quot; have totally broken fletching post 202 - the cost to skill point ratio is extremely high now - going from 202-250 is about 1k per point now adays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>darksisco007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">looks like fletching either got forgotten or totally screwed</div></div><hr />

<br />
It looks to me like this may be a cost-effective solution to skilling up to around 215 (Don't know the trivial), assuming you have a Gnome to make cams for you...</div></div><hr />

i thought it seemed to take an awful lot of combines the other day when i went through 2 stacks for 5 skillups.  this isn't highend i went 82-87 on 2 stacks of hooked trash arrows.  have been doing much better with blacksmith, brewing, and baking.  not quite there with tailor yet.<br />
<br />
Um... Why nerf flecthing though?  jc is all vendor bought.  why nerf fletching?  its just as pricey to skill up on shadewood bows as platinum jewlery.  getting to 202 is prolly cheaper but you always use yours products up.  jc you keep them or sell them to somebody later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ceinwein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Keep in mind that the Sedgewood Bow Stave is actually superior than it first appears,<br />
<br />
The stave is Dam 23 Delay 66. BUT, it can use 2 cams.<br />
<br />
This allows for an extremely quick bow. Delay 39 was previously reserved for Carved Elm Recurve (Dam 10) or Shaped Darkwood Compound (Cost 445 plat &amp; &gt;250 Trivial). <br />
<br />
I know it is small consolation when you compare LDoN fletching upgrades compared to the other tradeskills. However, I for one (being a Half-Elf) will be glad to forage some of these to try for 212 rather than do the acrylia arrows or shadewood bows.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">the trivial for the plain sedgewood bow is 212 correct?  exactly?  i am doing my own quick fletching chart and want to be accurate.  since trivs are by the highest triv item being used i think its safe to assume the other recipes and trivs for this staff.<br />
<br />
EDIT sp&gt;me (prolly still is)</div></div><hr />
