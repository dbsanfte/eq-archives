It sits by itself, with no merchants nearby that I recall, but I've used it before so I know it works.  Kelethin has several small loom-like structures all over that look like looms but really aren't.<br />

The working loom is near the orc lift. From the orc lift, cross the bridge to the next platform (kinda leftish), cross the bridge to the next platform (hard right), and go up the ramp to the next platform.<br />

Hard to give directions for Kelethin. =)</div></div><hr />

Loom is on Platform #1<br />

Hint: Working Tradeskill Looms do not have colored fabric in the frame. The Working Looms have only white fabric in the frame...</div></div><hr />

Are you left-clicking on the loom's side or top wooden frame pieces to open the loom?  I remember trying to open the loom in Rivervale as a young halfling by clicking on the cloth in the middle of the loom and wondering why it didn't work.  :?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zallarenya</div><div class="date">01-02-2003, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Scroll all the way down to the bottom of the Tailoring FAQ (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=73). The picture of the non-working loom is even the one you're talking about in Kelethin.<br />
<br />
And, while I haven't checked the locs on the Kelethin Trade Supplies page, I don't doubt that it's incorrect - that page is quite dated I think. The correct information is in the up-coming database, and just waiting to be unleashed :)</div></div><hr />
