<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rewde</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I think I am doing good so far with this game, I haven't died yet.  :D <br />
<br />
Anyhow, I was running around Misty Thicket, trying to do the newbie armour quest that I read about here.  I was slowly killing the diseased rats, and had contracted rabies  :? <br />
<br />
This guy comes into the zone, and does an out of charachter announcement that he is doing level 60 druid buffs at the zone line.  So, I run over and ask if he can cure rabies.  He invited me to group with him, so I joined him and he proceeded to cure me and gave me some really nice buffs.  I was one happy level 5 druid.<br />
<br />
Then he gave me a lot of money, 50 platinum, and told me to go get some leather armour and my spells.  I had my original tunic that was given to me when I turned in my note, and my first piece of my quested armour, a bracer.  I was very excited, and went back into Rivervale and got the rest of the armour pieces that I did not have.  When I got back, I had about 37 platinum and some other coin left over.  I asked him if he wanted it back, as it was a lot of money, and he said to keep it.  :D <br />
Then he gave me a buff called legacy of spike, and told me he would be right back.<br />
<br />
So, I went back to killing the rats, and noticed that they started dieing a lot faster.  Some of them even disappeared right after they died, and I got no experience??<br />
<br />
Then he comes back, and gives me a couple of earrings, rings, and a magical piece for my neck.  WOW.  I was like OMG.  So I asked him how I could repay him, anything he wanted me to do.  He just told me to do the same thing and be nice to lower level people when I got into my higher levels.  He then gave me a new set of buffs, then went to bed.<br />
<br />
WOW.  Is everyone in the game this nice?<br />
<br />
On a side note, does anyone know where I can locate a giant thicket rat?  I need the skull from one, but I only have seen large thicket rats running around in Misty thicket.  And not too many of those, either.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />

You had a thorn coat on you that was doing a lot of damage, basically if the thorn coat kills something that you didn't touch, you don't get the experience, and there is no corpse to loot.<br />
<br />
If you have a coat, just try to take a pot shot at everything attacking you, as long as you get 1 damage in before the coat kills it, you get the kill :).<br />
<br />
As for people being nice.... ask Noshipa, he is on your sever, I know little about it ;)</div></div><hr />

I have a soft spot for true newbies.<br />
But only if they don't speak to me first.<br />
<br />
I was in Surefall Glade one day, for some odd reason.   I saw a human with a sword who conned WAY green to me at 30-40, attacking a wisp, and getting his behind handed to him.<br />
<br />
He died, and repopped at his nearby bind point.  Did a /who , and see he is a level 1 ranger.  I showed him the basics of the game, found a couple monsters for him to kill, gave him some basic buffs, and explained the game to him.<br />
<br />
And yes, I explained the logic in /con , and in not hitting wisps with your starting, non magic weapons.<br />
<br />
<br />
He is 45-55 right now, and in a decent guild.   I am so proud.<br />
<br />
He never once typed incoherently.  There was no u , no lol, no d00d plz.<br />
<br />
I still talk to him every now and again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morani</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately, not EVERYONE is that nice but there are a lot of people that are. I run into about 3 really cool people for every one that I think is a jerk. Those are odds I like. <br />
<br />
When I started the game, I had a number of people help me out like that (not quite as generous but generous enough). When I asked them what I could do in return I got the same thing; return the favor when I can.<br />
<br />
I now make a habit of heading back &quot;my home town&quot; and watching over the &quot;young ones&quot; by buffing, healing, giving money/gear, or just advice. I enjoy it a LOT and the vast majority of the people I help are grateful so it makes me feel good. I'm happy to say that every piece of equipment that I was given has since been passed on to other newbies in the same fashion. <br />
<br />
The community feel and the &quot;random acts of kindness&quot; (to borrow an overused phrase) are/is the thing I like the most about this game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Something to note though. If someone playing an &quot;evil&quot; race or character class is rude/mean to you it, may NOT be the player. The player may be role-playing. Sorta like Lilosh; he role-plays a grumpy curmudgeon with a very short supply of tact but those of us who've gotten to know him know is a softy with a big heart under all that.  :) The way to tell if someone in game is role-playing (other than asking) is to look at the color of the name that appears over the character's graphic image. If it's purple, that character has turned on the flag that says (s)he is a role player. <br />
<br />
<br />
And to try to answer your question: The only mention of where the rats are that I've found was  ALL over outside the RV cave.<br />
 I don't know if that was suppose to mean the cave INSIDE Rivervale (across the bridge from most of the town) or the cave in Misty Thicket that leads to/from Rivervale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anhar</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">These will be found &quot;beyond the wall&quot;, from your newbie area (RV Hole) head out till you find the wall, follow that to the enterence, where you will find several deputies on guard. Beyond that you will find higher level monsters to hunt, including the elusive Giant Field Rat.<br />
<br />
Note that this is the same for all &quot;newbie&quot; areas of Norrath. The easier monsters are close to the enterence to town, and get progressivly harder the further out you go, until you have to zone to the next area. Also beware (which I am sure you are by now) that there are several higher level monsters (mobs) interspersed with the newbie mobs. They are their to make sure you are on your toes. Nothing like killing a fire beatle, only to have the prince or queen show up and wack you a new one.<br />
<br />
Good luck in your adventures.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My answer to your question...no not everybody is as nice as the person who buffed and give you equipment.  In fact, there are many that think that Druids are there only to buff, power level and for ports.  Don't let those types ruin your fun! *roars*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">splunge</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its amazing what using English will do. <br />
<br />
Using abbreviations while fighting is one thing (try talking with someone while shooting arrows or keeping a bunch of mobs snared and rooted), but asking for help is the one real time where you should actually use and spell out 'please'. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meirril</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 09:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess there are plenty of people who've already said not everyone is this nice, and yes there are plenty of people that are nice. <br />
<br />
Some advice: take the rest of that money and bank it away for spells. You'll need every penny you can get unless you find a way to get what people want and sell it to them. <br />
<br />
My own &quot;newbie gift box&quot; is usualy things I feel guilty selling to merchants (anything magic from unrest, odd drops of mid level gear thats kinda nice), 5pp for spells (and the advice above), a stack of foraged foodsuffs (or baked if I'm in the mood, I'm not a GM but I make a decent Frost Giant Steak), and any kind of armor that drops in the zone(or tailored, I don't mind buying patterns for cloth armor). Oh, and 2 or 3 druid buffs (PoTG, Sow/wolf form, chloro. Almost never thorns, I don't think thorns are good for real newbies they need to skill up.)<br />
<br />
Most importantly, I give advice. Honestly, information is the second most valuable thing in the game. I've made many new players very happy, and they've probably forgotten me. A few haven't, and I'm very proud keeping track of them from time to time. I can't take credit for their deeds, but I'm glad to say I helped them along the way.<br />
<br />
A long, long time ago there was a dark elf in Misty Thicket. He gave me a necklace, and I kept it for a long time. Eventualy, I found a better necklace. I gave my old cherrised necklace to a complete stranger who was struggling in the world. I wonder where that necklace is now? I have alot of trouble selling gifts, they were gifts to me, they should never be sold. The only solution is to give them away, and hope for the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gargazon</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the answer to your question is no. Not everyone is this nice. I am, and a lot of people I know are, and I would lay odds that the people of this site are generally very nice. I try to help out true newbies when I can. Don't ever ask me for anything though. I'll put you on ignore. On the other hand, i saw someone struggling one day, and had some extra money, and was feeling nice so I dropped 5k on gear for him. He was one happy SK. <br />
<br />
I figured he needed the help though. I mean, not only was he and SK, he was a HUMAN SK. /boggle<br />
<br />
<br />
Nice guy though. We were friends for over 2 years til he had to quit playing. I told him to buy some lime, and dig a hole...but he was whipped =(</div></div><hr />

So, instead of dumping them on one vendor, I have been the evil person wandering about giving them away to new casters.  At this point I have given out close to 40 robes.   I will sometime just give them away and other times I will require a task.  Such as if you get my 20 robe patterns from the quest NPC you can have a Robe of Scent for free. <br />
<br />
So, if anyone happens to be getting really annoyed on Fironia Vie because their lower robes just aren't selling. I am the reason.  8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rewde</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow.  <br />
<br />
First, I would like to say thanks for all of the advice you have given me.  I got some bags to carry stuff in, advice from someone in game, and then put the rest of the money in the bank.  I don't suppose it is anything like real life and pays interest?<br />
<br />
Second, I did venture beyond the wall last night.  I saw my one and only giant wood spider that I need quest items from, but to my dismay, I wound up taking quite a beating and died.  I tried to run to the zone line, but didn't quite make it.   Before you ask, no there were no guards at the wall, as I passed to the otherside of the wall, going in, someone was killing them.<br />
<br />
Though, I did come back, and with the help of a level 11 druid, I was able to find a giant thicket rat and get the skull I needed.  :D <br />
<br />
I am now level 6, almost to level 7.  The little book that came with the game has given me some good basic information on how to group, talk to people, and in general play the game.  I am not sure if I missed it in the little book, but is there a way to yell for help if you need it?<br />
<br />
I have also perused the main site, and I think that I will enjoy trying my hand at doing tradeskills.  I have acquired a sewing kit and my tailoring is at 4  :)   haveing to make silk threads for my armour quest.  I will invariably keep stopping in and pestering you nice people with questions as I progress with my tradeskilling.  I hope you won't mind putting up with my pestering/questions.<br />
<br />
And speaking of which, besides tailoring, as it is needed for my armour quest, what other skills should I start, and is there any particular order or level when I should start them?<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It will send out a call for help and tell other players the general direction you are in.  Whether they come to help or not is up to them although most will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Start saving your veggies, fruit, berries, roots, etc. when you start forage at level 15.  Those are used for Brewing and Baking.  No particular order when to pick up another skill, pick something that interests you.  Would personally work on leveling up for now and acquiring some more plat.  Skills can get quite expense in the long run.<br />
<br />
G'Luck to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Obina</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everyone in this site is that nice for sure :)  Kidding aside, traders tend to be nice since we all need to help each other to &quot;do our thing&quot;.<br />
<br />
One bit of advice I disagree with is saving money.  I suggest spending all your money on gear and other stuff now.  That's because of the diminishing marginal value of money as you level.  Say what? Well, 5 pp is a lot to a level  1.  It is nothing to me with a toon at 52.  I get 5 pp off most mobs I kill.  I dump 3000 pp on gems for mana vials to get one skill up point (if lucky).  Spend your money now, so you will be strong and level up.  Spend 50 pp now to be equipped.  It will soon be rounding error.<br />
<br />
A good thing to spend mone on is equipment.  Although prices seem to drift down with time, unlike real life, the stuff doesn't wear out.  Every now and then you can sell for what you paid!  Cash in the bank does nothing.  Cash disguised as a Dark Ember helps you kill bad things.<br />
<br />
It is true you need enough to buy spells.  Do what is needed.  I personnaly have found no problem saving for spells when I am one level below the spell level.  And I am a poor cleric, needing to buy spells and armor!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meirril</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 10:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, here's the nasty catty part comming out  :D  :oops: <br />
<br />
Unless you can find some amazing deals in the bazaar (you have to have Planes of Power expansion installed) there realy isn't much you can buy with less than 30pp. At most I'd expect you could buy a nice peice of armor, and thats nice compaired to the cloth armor that drops from goblins. Any kind of decent weapon is going to be priced a bit higher than you should be able to reach (most weapons and armor priced under 100pp are sold to vendors as most feel they arn't worth selling in the bazaar. There are a few bargains that usualy go for 10-50pp each, but mostly for people that wear plate armor. Druid gear is usualy a bit expensive). If you do go, generaly your looking towards aquiring anything thats better than what you have (well, duh, say something obvious Meirril), but perfered is things that give bonus hp, mana, wisdom, AC, and other bonuses (about in that order too. It priorities will change as you gain levels, but that's a decent order to start with.)<br />
If you want a good weapon for your level, ask people that port into misty thicket if they just came from LoY (that stands for Legacy of Yekesha, the newest expansion). If they have ask them if they have a druid usable weapon for sale, and offer 10pp for it. There is a board with nails in it (can't remember the name) thats a decent weapon and usualy sold to vendors. <br />
 If you decided to go on a shopping trip, find the Plane of Knowledge book (book on a marble pedistle) and click on it. That will take you to the plane of knowledge. Turn around and look for a grave stone looking thing, that says rivervale. That will take you back to misty if you click on it. Hit backspace and pop up the map. Zoom out to find the Nexus port stone on the map. Go to it and click to get to nexus, run around and find the bazaar (technical advice: before entering the bazaar, open options: video and turn your clip plane down to 0%. Bazaar is a monster lag zone).  Once your in the bazaar type /bazaar to get the bazaar menu up and happy shopping. Right clicking on the name of an item will show you its stats, right clicking on the merchants name will point your character at the merchant (note, you'll have to move around walls and other players, but it realy is handy). Once your done I'd gate home if you've got gate yet. Otherwise backtrack to misty. <br />
    If you feel like it you can do a bit of exploring before you get to level 10. Once you hit level 10 IF you die, your corpse will have all of your equipment on it and you'll have to go find it to get your stuff back. There isn't much worse in EverQuest than having all of your hard earned stuff become lost. Before level 10, ya might think about exploring all of the zones that the plane of knowledge allows you access to. After level 10, be careful!<br />
<br />
Hmm...if this keeps up I'm gonna write a newbie guide. <br />
p.s. how did a new player find this sight anyways?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing about the purple flag isn't necessarily always true. A lot of people (mainly Enchanters and Druids, I think) turn on the RP flag because it hides their class while still displaying their guild tag. I do that myself, because I'm a Magician and the last thing I want is people asking me to summon items for them when I'm either right in the middle of a battle or working on tradeskills. And I don't role-play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Clerics, Enchanters, Wizards and Druids are the main people that do this.  Since the tells from people when you are grouped can get old fast especially when they don't' understand the words &quot;No I am in a group I can not go 5 zones away from where I am to rez you.&quot;<br />
<br />
On that note i also know a lot of roleplayers that don't hide their level, in general it is fairly easy to tell a roleplayer from a jerk though, since roleplayers tend to use complete sentences.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have 3 friends that play EQ. Two of which have been playing for about 4 years, and 1 who has been playing just shy of 3 years now.  I used to give them a lot of crap about all the time they spent playing this game, and that they had no social life what-so-ever... yada, yada, yada..<br />
I would call them up and see if they wanted to go out and do things on the weekend, but most of the time they would turn me down because they had a guild raid or some such thing that they had to attend.  On occasion, we would have cookouts at their house (2 are room mates with 6 computers between them.. sheesh) and, invariably, they would try to show me the game and get me interested.  My wife would give me the &quot;eye&quot;, and I always passed.<br />
Well, one day recently, I was going to the movies with one of them and there was a little time to kill before we left, so I actually got to see the game.  I liked what I saw, it had some good graphics, and looked like fun (more so then the Might and Magic series I was currently playing).  So, on the way to the movie, he explained a little more to me, and it sounded better and better (he plays a halfling druid and a shaman).<br />
So, I spent the next few days trying to convince my wife to let me get it.  Now, about $400 bucks later, all expansions, upgrades to memory and video card, and a 1 year subscription, I was ready to start playing.<br />
My friend suggested that I try playing a halfling druid, as it was an easy character to start with.  He is really into tradeskilling, and tried to explain it to me, but then gave me this website and said it would make things clearer, and there would be a lot more people here to answer my questions.  He also told me about Casters Realm as a good reference to get my character started, and that it listed all the spells I would ever use.<br />
So, now, here I am.  I only get to play Monday and Wednesday nights, deal I made with the wife.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanna</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A) Make/keep wife happy. Better for you in long run. ^_^ <br />
<br />
B) Bazaar = Luclin, not POP. But if you have all installed, doesn't really matter. <br />
<br />
C) As a druid, WIS is the most important. After lvl 15 or 20, you will NOT main-tank, and rarely secondary tank. <br />
As you get the plat to afford it, get: <br />
<br />
-- a Charred Guardian Shield, around 250p on sullon. 9 wis, light source, you'll never have to think about another shield till you start killing Lodi. And I don't actually know that druids can wear the lodi shield. <br />
<br />
-- a Shroud of Nature, 6wis i think. Ok, there are a bit nicer things out there, yes, but Boiled Leather Curias doesn't 'kick in' till 51. And the Shroud should go for around 150p, 300 max. <br />
<br />
-- Springwood Club or Sharkbone Warhammer, 1hb prim 5wis. Got the Sharkbone as a twink from roomie, don't know cost approximation ~_~. Springwood went for 250p on mithaniel, and suddenly my little lvl 4 dwarf cleric can down bats and skellies in one hit. <br />
<br />
-- Split Paw Hide gloves. 2wis, don't pay more than 25p, will probably find for 10-18p.<br />
<br />
-- Gatorscale Leggings. Don't pay more than 400p, should be able to find for about 300p. <br />
<br />
-- If your noob gear shoes have ANY wis on them at all, get them and forget about shoes till you can afford the 2k for coldain skin or 4k+ for golden efreeti. Shoes with wis are either freaking expensive or not worth the plat (imho). <br />
<br />
-- My Serpentine Bracer doesn't have any wis, but it likes to sparkle when i cast spells. 50p-100p, imho the best 49p i ever ever ever spent. <br />
<br />
-- Acrylia studded cloaks are 10wis, so expect to pay a lot... for some reason, all my cloaks i've ever had were given to me, so i have no idea on the price range for these. IF you can find a mammoth hide cloak, i love mine, adds a bit to damage. <br />
<br />
-- They say Othmir Fur Caps don't sell. I don't see why not. 60p for 6 wis. If you find for less, uber. <br />
<br />
-- Acrylia masks (the one with 5wis 5cha, i forget if it's reinforced or studded) should be rather cheap now... i got mine for 50p only because i knew the person who was selling them and that she needed the plat. i think they're around 25p. <br />
<br />
-- I have a Chrysoberyl Talisman that i got for 150. for 3wis i think that's rather high, but judge as necessary on your server. <br />
<br />
-- earrings with high wis will be expensive, when thinking about jewelry think JASPAR, JASPAR, does JASPAR have two a's? JASPER? I think it's JASPER. JASPER rings, silver, should be about... 10p each? JASPER gold earrings... not sure, maybe 30? Altho earrings can have lots of nice things, so as you get older, don't feel bad sacrificing say a jasper gold for a fishbone (down to 800p on sullon). And if you get into tradeskilling, DO the potc quest for that earring.<br />
<br />
I love my druid. I just love the druid class. Do have fun with the druid, and if you ever have druid question, feel free to ;tell sullon.iroke. ^_^<br />
<br />
D) no, everyone is NOT that nice. beware, and just shrug off the rude people as either high on sugar, pot, or their own #$%^ egos. you got it nice, man, esp for a stranger twinking.</div></div><hr />

Though, my question to you would be, where the heck am I supposed to be getting all the platinum to be spending on this stuff?  <br />
I really am not seeing where it is going to come from.  The few bodies that I have looted and gotten money from have generally been no more than a few gold, silver and copper coin.  Most things that I have sold to vendors sell for mere silver, maybe a couple gold here and there.  Though, I did get 1 platinum and a couple gold for a plauge rat tail that I sold.<br />
Please tell me it gets better as I get higher in levels.</div></div><hr />

These all sell for high gold or platinum.<br />
<br />
I recently started a druid who is currently level 11 and hunting with a partner in West K, taking down bandits, and then turning in the sashes in Qeynos for a bronze weapon.  So far I have 50 plat saved up for my 14 spells, plus have done some small but judicious purchases.</div></div><hr />

Welcome to the world of tradeskills, and the great world of Norrath :)<br />
<br />
You picked a great class.  My first character was, and still is, a wood elf druid.  Started her in 1999, and still love her.  For more druid info, www.eqdruids.com  is a GREAT site.<br />
<br />
How do you get all this plat to buy stuff?  If you have access to the Bazaar, you can sell many of the dropped items from low level creatures.  For example, animal skins, pelts, or hides (bear, wolf, cat, lion, rockhopper, greyhopper).  Also, spiderling and spider silks.  If you're killing something, keep EVERYTHING that the creature drops, and then go to the bazaar and look up those items.  See how much people are selling that &quot;junk&quot; for.  Then get yourself some trader satchels and sell that stuff.  You won't be rich overnight, but you'll eventually earn enough platinum to start upgrading :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rewde</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, Heartsong, I hit level 8 last night, wife went to bed early and I got to play for an hour.  I have killed a few goblins, discovered that I could hit multiple goblins with my invoke lightning, and they have only dropped a few silver here and there, plus maybe a rusty weapon.  I am still working on my newbie armour quest, I actually got to find and kill 1 giant wood spider, but it did not have anything on it for my quest. :(  So, I am still looking for them and trying to finish my armour pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morani</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">in general it is fairly easy to tell a roleplayer from a jerk though, since roleplayers tend to use complete sentences.<br />
&amp;lt;laughing&gt; That is SO true. We also tend to use emotes more and generally add more detail then any non-RPer ever wants to deal with.  :)<br />
<br />

It'll come. As you get higher in level it's easier to get more money. At level 38, it's not unusually for me to gather 100 plat worth of coin and sellable stuff in less than an hour of fighting. I think I and someone else already mentioned this, but click your forage button EVERY chance you can. Keep everything at this point as it's all useful and some of it is worth quite a bit. For where you are right now, pay attention for Acorns while foraging. You will NOT find them frequently but they are a VERY hot item for tradeskills. You have two choices with them, save them for yourself to use MUCH latter or sell them for money now (it's not unusual to sell them for 15-20 plat each). <br />
<br />
Here are the things you are going to run into in Misty Thicket and Rivervale when foraging:<br />
[list]Fruit - Can be used in brewing up to 142 but they are GREAT for lower trivial recipes too. Can be used in Baking up to 155.<br />
<br />
Berries - Can be used in brewing up to 148 and baking up to 142<br />
<br />
Vegetables - LOTS of recipes; can be used in brewing up to168 (vegetable oil is a great one) and baking up to 250<br />
<br />
Rabbit  - Can be baked with a flask of water and a pot to make Rabbit stew, takes you to 68<br />
<br />
Roots - Can be brewed into root beer (fun but not a great one for skilling-up) and in fishing to make prepared fish and fish bones (which are then used for other things)<br />
<br />
Pod of Water - Can be brewed into flasks of water (4 pods and a bottle, trivials at 21)<br />
<br />
Fishing Grubs - Can be used as bait to fish with (good thing considering their name. :) ) Can be used to make Fetid Essence, a STAPLE of the skill-up path. (1 grub + 1 flask of water, trivials at 122)<br />
<br />
Sweetened Mudroot - Used for your epic, you can only keep one at a time and you're a LONG way from being able to use it. You can keep it if you want to just wait until you get close to needing it.<br />
<br />
Black Root - RARE. Can be brewed into Vale Essence (black root + flask of water, triv 122) but you may want to hold onto them to use latter or sell them as is. Anyone else what to give input on this one?<br />
<br />
Misty Acorn - RARE. See above, they are VERY in demand.[/list:u]<br />
<br />

I have to say that I'm really enjoying this thread. Not only is it neat to see things from the eyes of someone completely new to it again (and all the nostalgia that goes with it) but I'm enjoying the &quot;story&quot; of your progress Rewde. It also makes me smile to see the amount of help that's coming out. I do have to say though, Redwe, that a large amount of help comes from you yourself. The way you've asked, the appreciation, politeness, and cheerfulness DEFINATELY adds to the desire to continue helping you. Just like not everyone is as nice to you when you ask, not everyone who asks is as nice as you've been.  :D</div></div><hr />
