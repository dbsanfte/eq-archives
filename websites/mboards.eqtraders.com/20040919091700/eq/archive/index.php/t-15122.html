<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nanndas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After learning here about the &quot;Egg Batter&quot; I dug out my trusty Brell tackle box and summoned a rod and a case of beer, then settled down for a quiet time fishing for tuna/crab. I combined them right away while fishing/foraging/drinking into meats. When I had 100 of each off I went to make the beer batter (why sugar is so expensive) and then the souffles.<br />
<br />
I quickly found out that my 15 Basilisk eggs I had in inventory weren't going to far. The recipe takes the equivalent of 3 eggs. 1 for the clump of dough and 2 for the egg batter. I stopped combining after around 50 attempts as I realized I was depleting my inventory of vegetables to fast.<br />
<br />
Why can't some of the subcombines in GoD baking have multiple yields like mtp? Especially the items that have to be hunted for or foraged. As a 52 druid with lev/track I can easily hunt in Lavastorm for eggs, but not all classes are that fortunate. The hard one is vegetables. In a 4-5 hour session I can't forage a stack of them. Add to that that these (eggs/veggies) are rare in any kind of volume in the bazaar and some traders want a small fortune for them. <br />
<br />

The nerf bat swung big time. When I sold off the balance of the tuna/crab meat I got 9 copper each. :mad:</div></div><hr />

I thought the Pie and Souffle recipies would be easier than dealing with MTP's starting at 226 skill. I found the same problem that you did:<br />
<br />
70 veggies + 140 egg batters = 70 attempts at beer-battered hynid pies... 0 skill ups.<br />
<br />
10 veggies + 2 fruit + 1 egg for dough + 1 brownie part = 100 attempts at MTP... 3 skill ups<br />
<br />
Perhaps it was just  a particularly bad run with the RNG, but even if I'd gotten 3 skill ups both ways, the MTP's are clearly a more efficient use of the foraged/farmed items.<br />
<br />
Then again, the stats on some of the new items are so high that I expect they don't want a market flood of them like they have with Halas Pies and MTP's. So... more MTP's for practice, and then Discord baking  to actually make food for eating. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just out of curiosity, where are these recipies that are better than the standard MTP and Halas?  Now, I can see some of the different melee classes finding slightly better recipies, but I have yet to see any GoD recipe that competes with the +30 mana from the MTP on top of all its other stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Monual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">To beat a dead horse, I'm sure, I'm also very annoyed that the recipes call for vegetables.  As a human cleric, I have *no* source of vegetables.  I have to beg my guildmates for vegetables, and while they've been willing, that won't be an inexhaustable resource.<br />
<br />
What did the recipe-makers expect non-foragers to do?  Create alts, level them up, and have them forage?  Bah.  =(</div></div><hr />

High elf cleric here.  I have a level 15 ranger for that exact purpose alone.  Usually I am too lazy though and just /ooc in pok that I am buying vegetables for a few plat apiece.  I figure I make the money back selling the MTPs anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Elyssanda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">AS far as eggs go.. Basilisk ones are 2 types.. the low yield.. and the 15 yield.. OMG go get the 15 yield.. mob drops.. not foraged.<br />
<br />
Best place to get them? basilisk genitors in the Jagged pine caves... I've gotten up to 6 eggs on a kill. at 15 yeild you're talking 90 batters or doughs.</div></div><hr />

I agree. There is no set place for the GoD recipes. As I stated in another post, they are only cluttering up the stat food market. To consume them as you level up in baking is ok, but one doesn't need that kind of volume. <br />
<br />
I have made rolls/steaks and now souffles. They just don't sell in the bazaar when hmp's are 2pp each and mtp's not much more. I sold everything prior to the price nerf except the 70 odd souffles I have which I'll force feed my alts :)<br />
<br />
On foraging SoE should check the tables again. At 182 in foraging I really don't need a pod of water every 2nd-3rd forage. I carry bottles with me so that I can turn it into a water flask at a brew barrel at least once a night.<br />

I suppose better is in the eye of the beholder. Beer-battered Cragbeast Steaks have +7 WIS. For a non-caster tradeskiller like my bard, that's good food for trade practice.<br />
<br />
I've been selling them for 3-4pp each in the bazaar on Saryrn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just a bit of an aside, but foraging in HoHB if you're flagged is pretty good for vegetables, foraging there for 30 or 45 min one day i got 6 heartfruit walnuts (mostly useless), 10 Phoenix Eggs (what I was there for, for making mephit meat pies), 19 Vegetables, and 12 pods of water, nothing else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>RawdTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have to agree with just about everything you guys said so far. I just spend ~3 hours making different GoD dishes. All the subcombines + everything yields only 1 item + forced delay to hit &quot;combine&quot; button == gets very annoying very fast. <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong - I'm not new to Baking and multiple subcombines (I GM'ed doing MTPs long before new UI was implemented). But this is way too boring with way too little resuls.<br />
<br />
Good point about vegetables, too. 6 stacks of veggies I had got depleted in a moment, I went to Bazaar to buy more - there was only 1 (ONE) seller and only 3 stacks.<br />
<br />
I won't be doing any of these combines again untill yields are increased.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nanndas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">On Drinal the last 3 nights prior to putting my trader up there were 0 veggies for sale. Same thing early in the morning when I checked prior to going to work. I made my last run of 100 MTP's as I'm out of them. <br />
<br />
I want to play my BL and he can't forage. I therefore have to play my Druid to get them. Some vendor sells &quot;Washed Vegetables&quot; in PoK. I guess the foraged ones still have dirt on the roots... :) <br />
<br />
There are to many recipes (and new ones added) that require foraged items. The biggest one seems to be vegetables...<br />

No longer needed.  As posted at the top, if it was read and not skipped over, these have been replaced with egg batter.</div></div><hr />
