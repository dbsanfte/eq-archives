<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lizzardlee</div><div class="date">12-08-2002, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I emailed Crom as he is the only dwarven smith with a high skill on emarr(probably more just the only one I know about) last night but I haven't got an email back I just thought I'd check here also. I'm looking at getting a suit of Enchanted Imbued Dwarven Plate made. I have already bought all the supplies and already have imbued the ruby's (with my cleric) and I got a friend to enchant all of the bricks needed. I have enough for 2 tries per piece with some supplies left over (ended up with more temper and padding). I propose a deal. I will farm up a backpack or 2 of velium that several of you high end culture smiths(underfoot etc..) use in trade you will do my combines. If anyone is interested email me or post here (powersurge1720@cox.net)</div></div><hr />

You have to realize a few things dear. :)<br />
<br />
1.  Crom is a guildleader &amp; very busy with those functions alone.<br />
<br />
2.  Crom IRL works full time at whacky hours.<br />
<br />
3.  Crom rather clearly states his policies here (http://www.clanbattleaxe.com/smithfaq.html) for deals such as you are offering.  His standard prices are  located here. (http://www.clanbattleaxe.com/smithprices.html)<br />
<br />
4.  He is the premier public Dwarven Grandmaster Smith in our realm.  As such, he gets plagued with requests.  Please be patient. :)<br />
<br />
Your best bet if he hasn't responded via e-mail within the next day or two is to post at our Clan message boards in the General section at http://pub92.ezboard.com/fclanbattleaxefrm24.  Please be sure to include on-line contact information such as AIM name, or a valid e-mail address in your post.  You can also view his wares that have already been made by looking for Dwarvensmith in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. :)<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lizzardlee</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 08:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know he says normally no trades but about a week ago he was interested in Blocks of Velium so I thought I'd give it a shot. I know RL and other things get in the way I didn't mean to come out fussy or anything just saying I wasn't able to get a reply from him so I thought I'd ask around here also as I'm normally not into trade skills so I wasn't sure if there were any other dwarven smiths with high skill around. I was trying to avoid posting on there guild message board trying not to bug him too much hehe. Thought I'd email him and if he was too busy or not interested I'd look for another smith that might be interested.</div></div><hr />

One of my guildies is in the process of skilling up post 200 and I'm sure that he'd be more than willing to make some effort in assisting  you, I know for certain that he's been successfull in making more than one full suit of Enchanted Dwarven Plate as he made one for my twink Gnome Warrior and he has his own full suit of the same. As for failures on combines, as long as you bring along enough stuff for extra tempers I'm pretty sure something could be worked out. Give him a tell in game as at present I'm not positive what his email is. His name is Rogart Felhammer. <br />

The tempers are not much of a problem as my cleric is now a 193 brewer. If we ran out I would just have to pick up more ruby's imbue them and bricks and track down a chanter guildie to do enchants. Thanks for the tip.</div></div><hr />
