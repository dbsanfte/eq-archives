<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nimchip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why doesn't anyone consider making these as skillup anymore? Is it a worthwhile route to GM? Why make velious tailoring over this? Just curious, I am a Tunare Wood Elf and this seems good to make for skill ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taushar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I can give you few reasons why. First of all, most of us are not Wood Elf who worships Tunare., I would think less than 1% of the total population fits that catagory. Second, the cost for making Tunarean armor is way too high. Each Chainweave requires a Blue Diamond. Currently on Xev, BDs are going for about 400pp on the average, if you can find them in bazaar. Third, mind you that I have never done this, the forage rate for Oak Bark required for the agent is just too rare to make this viable. <br />
<br />
Just as a comparison, I used Artic Wyvern hides to skill up. Artic Wyvern hides are plentiful, usually about 200pp per in bazaar since most quadders around 50 or so hunt these in CS. Only agent needed is Cobalt Cods, which can be fished in CS. The rate is about 12-15% of total catch at fishing skills of 200. This translates to about 1 stack per hour or so. Only other item needed is Velium Studs, which are made from Small Pieces of Velium. You can farm these in CC or buy them in bulk in bazaar.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is, the Velious combines are much easier to get in bulk needed for serious skill ups. Also, in the long run, it's cheaper than Tunarean. Those reasons make Velious combines much better solution than Tunarean.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kiatek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did not make these for skill up because of cost.  Even if you make wristbands or another 1 boning item, it still eats you up in cost.  If you farm everything, it is cheap yes.  But it takes FOREVER.  <br />
<br />
Excellent sabertooth hides alone are a pretty hard item to get in bulk for skill ups.  I would say 1/10 tigers will drop it if you are lucky, plus you have to kill roaming junk to get tigers to spawn.  If you buy them, average prices is typically 200+ pp each.  <br />
<br />
Oak bark isn't too terrible to get.  I can usually for 10 or so in an hour of watching tv and foraging away when I notice it's popped up.  Buying oak bark is usually at least 50pp each.  <br />
<br />
Blue diamonds are 262 pp each off vendors (hard to find lately though for me) or you can kill to farm them and it will take awhile too. <br />
<br />
So i would say 10 hours or so for 10 combines farming (given that you get lucky)  or approximately 500 pp each combine minimum, high chance of failure, no recouping costs on failure.  Bottom line:  it's expensive and it's time consuming.  I do make them to sell now but even at 250 tailoing it's still an average of 50% success.  <br />
<br />
At the time I had solstice robes as an option because the market had not bottomed out for me, but I also did velious stuff.  Velious combines take wayyyyy less time and money.  I could buy hides off vendors for around 15PP each in bulk usually.  I could fish 20+ cod in an hour.  I could farm enough velium in an hour or two for 20 to 40 combines.  Granted it's a total pp sink, but I made money off other things just to plunk it down in tailoring and I knew it was a pp sink :)  So velious I could do 20 to 30 combines for 3 or 4 hours of farming and 400 pp or so.<br />
<br />
Good luck on the journey :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>TeriMoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, I made lots of Tunare armor for skill-ups.  I did it because I wanted variety.  It may be more efficient to do velious skillups, less farming to fo solstice robes, but I couldn't stand days upon days of farming the darn velium.<br />
<br />
It wasn't the hides, eggs, fish ir anything else that broke my spirit, it was the darn velium and all the velium farmers arguing over spawns.<br />
<br />
Maybe that doesn't happen now, no idea.<br />
<br />
It was a great relief to have variety.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Liwsa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Velium farming even worse now because of enchanted velium bits takes smithers to 222.  Easiest recipe for them to skill up on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>nimchip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i see.... thanks for the info guys, im just trying to find alternative ways i haven't explored yet to skilling and i didn't even consider Cultural until some friend reminded me of it, so i came here and asked. Thanks a lot though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Heartsong_Steelsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Note: you just have to be a wood elf, not a wood elf that worships Tunare to MAKE the armor...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have been mixing int he Mithril reinforced stuff for my crawl from 187 to 200, and will use it as well up to 215 whenever that happens.  It's utter junk, but it only uses an excellent sabertooth, and a Mornign Dew (plus storebought), so it's price competitive with Arctic wyvern and solstice robes in the ranges it's good for.  Afte 215 it's still viable if you have a source of imbued emeralds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The key to tailoring GMing is in variety.  Use some of this, some of that, every type of pelt you can skill up on, collect.  You will need so many pelts, you will need all types of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>TeriMoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have to agree with that.  Have done just enough of every other trade skill for Aid Grimel, I would have to say that tailoring is by far the most time consuming and frustrating.  I leveled a lot of twinks farming for components, but there is only so much I can take of farming the same things over and over.</div></div><hr />
