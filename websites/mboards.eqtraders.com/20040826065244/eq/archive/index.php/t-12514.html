<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>couyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well i made a barbarian shaman, got him lvl`d up to 32 for the skill cap on BOW potions of 37. i placed 21 into the alchemy skill with a trainer, then i raised it to 37 out in the field. i made a batch of potions and sold them all within a few hours. i made another batch. i bought 100 of each of the 3 items needed, sat down in a corner facing a wall and opened up my bags and got at it. my results from this batch are 68 out of 100, which i find to be absurd. i can understand maybe a 10-15% failure rate. with my items on and everything, my charisma is at 120 for good prices (2p0g9s9c , 2p0g9s9c , 1p0g4s9c = 5p2g4s7c per try), my wisdom is at 171 since i am still fairly new to the game and dont have an account full of 65`s enabling me to have tons of plat. for the highend items.<br />
<br />
do i need to lvl him more and build up the alchemy skill higher past 37 for less failures ?<br />
<br />
do i need to just raise my wisdom to up over 200 or something ?<br />
<br />
or am i just not holding my mouth right when hitting the combine button. for me to break even i would have to set prices at 77p5g, which the going rate on them atm in the bazaar is 75-85 on the 10dose potions. <br />
<br />
any help would be welcomed and greatly app.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">FAQ page on success rate (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=11)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azirux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Success% = (skill - (trivial*.75)) + 51.5 <br />
<br />
(37 - (37*.75)) + 51.5  = 61% success rate.<br />
<br />
So you answer is; you are not doing any wrong, and yes, you need to level and skill up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Right idea, wrong formula.<br />
<br />
Success = Skill - trivial + 66 for trivial &lt;68.<br />
<br />
So 37-37+66 = 66.<br />
<br />
66% success rate should be expected.<br />
<br />
Conclusion was correct, you need to get your skill higher, for which you will need to level soon, as your current maximum skill is 40 at your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bryko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well if you had a 137 skill then 137-37+66 = 166.  So would that mean a person with 137 skill will have about a 166% success rate? Hehehe you knew that was coming :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you are really that interested in the formulas and all the details, there is a FAQ that details them.  It does include the information regarding maximum success rate, which, given the OPs level and skill level was not material to the question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Raskii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Originally posted by Bryko <br />
. . . So would that mean a person with 137 skill will have about a 166% success rate? . . . .You will always have a 5% chance of failure no matter what your skill/stats. Therefore, your success rate is capped at 95% :detectiv:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">From the July 10, 2003 patch message:<br />
<br />
** Tradeskills **<br />
<br />
- Tradeskill chance of failures changed - The higher your skill is over the trivial of the combine, the less likely you are to fail with a combine. This is a reduction on the chance to always fail.There should be a less than 5% failure rate now on combines which are very trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not to mention that if it is working properly, Alchemy Mastery should reduce the failure rate too.  Regardless, barring bugs producing more than the intended number of items, success rate will never be higher than 100%.  I think I can make that statement with a fair degree of confidence.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Quaackerjack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You need to raise your skills higher.<br />
There was a patch put out making a less of a failure rate at lower trivials but at a 167 skill lvl on a 40 combo batch usually I fail twice and all my stats are at 255. And try sticking out your tongue too:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Your stats make no difference on the success rate.<br />
<br />
2 out of 40 would be the expected failure rate.</div></div><hr />
