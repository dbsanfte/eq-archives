Stormguard Root Beer is the only way to go. :D Root beer floats if I feel like chasing golras for a few hours. I get rid of those pesky roots I keep foraging, and I've got something fun to hand off to newbs who actually try and earn money for spells and gear.<br />
<br />
But if you're looking for something that lasts a long time and actually has useful stats added to it then yeah, kaladim constitutionals, maybe quenos afternoon tea if you have a forage bot that is also in charge of spider killing.<br />

Ah, the beauty of Metabolism 3, a stack of Qeynos Afternoon Tea and Misty Picnics... they last me forever, and I make both</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brodder FoamyMugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Root beers, Superior Gnomish Spirits,  Double Brewed Double Stout dwarven Ales, underfoot Brown,  etc...<br />
<br />
 GOOD Stuff tah drink, so's folks knows yer no pansy,<br />
<br />
 Stormguard rootbeer is creamy and frothy and as thich as a good stout ale, so it is a fine substitute for when yer &quot;On Duty.&quot;:D <br />
<br />
 Tis why it was invented, guards can't take a normal ale break so this fills in while on duty guarding Kaladim.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bebinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I started up brewing just to make root beer floats.  I thought it was so funny that I could make them.   Now, I just made 250 and got my trophy and I havent' made floats in over a year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>hyelaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My casters drink Qeynos Tea, but if you are looking for something fast, cheap, and self-brewed, I'd suggest lemonade.  It has a few stats, and is cheap to make, so newbies are wowed if you give them away.:goodvibe:  But you need the GoD expansion to buy lemons, as they are only available in Abysmal at them moment...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lanalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Kaladim Constitutionals. :)<br />
<br />
With IM3, it takes me forever to go through a stack. My tradeskill mule still has about 15 stacks on her just because I consume them so slowly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Been making some Taelosian teas... not tasty, but quite potent...<br />
<br />
I keep a good supply of flasks of bloodwater around to drink while I keep the teas in my main slot.  I prefer to think of it as drinking the bloodwater to quench my thirst, but letting the aroma of the teas keep my stats up.<br />
<br />
As for my favorite drink... Root Beer Floats without a doubt... not only my favorite drink out of game, but well worth the time to go out and get some chunks of ice...<br />
<br />
EDIT:  now if only those gnomes could come up with an ice cream maker... seriously... with absolutely NO new tinkered stuff added w/ GoD... they could have at least given them something fun...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah - I did a stack of combines a couple months ago when I finally got around to maxing brewing, and the resulting 3-4 stacks of Constitutionals I got back was way more than enough to last me until now with IM3. I think I still have more than a stack and a half from that initial run. IM3 is great, only 3 AA to make food and drink last for freaking ever!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">so... ano... <br />
<br />
how did dwarves invent a root beer if no dwarf can forage? <br />
<br />
<br />
before the TSUI i drank pods of water (you forage way too many at 200 skill) or Fuzzles. Now, since I can make root beer with a click, I steal the roots and actually brew stuff ^_^ <br />

<br />
Buy it unless you are a gm - it trivials at 339.  We fail half the time at 250 brewing.  Still, it is what I carry - lasts forever.</div></div><hr />
