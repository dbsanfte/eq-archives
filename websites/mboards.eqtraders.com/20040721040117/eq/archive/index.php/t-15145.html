<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>huneyy_AB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">and I need some help.<br />
<br />
I've just started playing EQ again after many months and realized there is a new interface for tradeskilling (after my suffering in making the pop earring!@#%#$^%^) :P<br />
<br />
I was just messing around last night trying to make Misty Thicket Picnics but for some reason I couldn't get the recipe to pop up in the interface when I searched for it. <br />
<br />
Am I just doing something wrong or is there something going on with some of the recipes?  I was able to find all the minor recipes in making MT Picnics though.<br />
<br />
If someone can shed some light on me and this new interface it would be greatly appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqNichola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You have to make it successfully once the 'old' way (click Experiment in the new UI, then drag the stuff in and click combine as you used to) before it will show up in the list. You will get a message saying 'You have learned the recipe for Misty Thicket Picnic!' when you do this.<br />
<br />
Briefly: Some recipes are flagged 'autoLearn', and they appear in the list without you having to do anything. Some recipes (eg MTP) are flagged 'canLearn', and won't appear in the list till you've successfully made them once the 'old' way. Some recipes are not learnable at all (quest recipes and those they haven't got around to flagging yet).</div></div><hr />
