My gnome enchanter looks like a gimp. <br />
<br />
He is wearing an advisor robe, which I seem to recall being a bit ugly, and not much else visible gear. <br />
<br />
Is there any inexpensive gear to make a Male gnome chanter look good? <br />
<br />
Stats are nice, but not neccessary. He is barely equipped as is. <br />

On a gnome, that should look like a leather outfit. Gnomeskin armor is also very stylish, though if you're roleplaying, would be a little creepy.</div></div><hr />

If you dont have luclin models on it looks like you have a pointy brown paper bag on your head. With luclin models its more of a grey leather look that wraps around your had and comes down the bridge of your nose<br />
<br />
For a robe I would go with the Blackened Crystalline Robe, the price has fallen down to around 200-300pp, has a nice look, and it has great stats for an enchanter</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe let my chanter &quot;Borrow&quot; Noishpa Coldain Boots and Gloves while he is tinkering and making vials. <br />
<br />
<br />
I want my chanter to look cool.  :-) <br />
<br />
I likes my illusions, but even when I am in normal form, looking good is a must!<br />

<br />
the Froglok bonecaster robe has a real nice graphic. On my erudite chanter, it is black, but without those blue stripes the BCR has. They always annoyed me.<br />
<br />
Of course, the FBCR costs 10 times as much as the BCR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm... why do you think I chose a female Gnome? :) There's no hope for a male Gnome. At least the Luclin models of male Gnomes aren't as hideous as the originals.<br />
<br />
And I agree that leather-graphic hats on Gnomes are a bad idea. They looked extra horrible on old models, and just annoying on new models, especially with those sideburn-looking things. It's okay for a leather outfit, but looks really silly with a robe. (Illusion Erudite as a male wearing something leather looks nice, by the way.. to bad we can't Illusion: Gender.. yet (maybe.. hoping)).<br />
<br />
Of course, with my current fashion, I get lots of people saying as I go by &quot;OMG that's a bright gnome!&quot; At first I hated the look, but it's grown on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Linea</div><div class="date">02-16-2003, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">granted that i have a high elf model but Ornate Rune Shield combined with wiz-only Dagger of Frost looks really really sweet. the dagger shows up as the short sword looking thing along with a visible shield, was running around as a Battle Wiz until i got my epic. i hear the walrus tooth has the same graphic as the dagger of frost. those items along with the all leather look would be nice! imho</div></div><hr />

<br />
Robe of the Foci is a pretty nice looking Enchanter only robe.  I believe it drops in Dalnir, but I'm sure you could find one in the Bazaar for not too much.  Unfortunately, part of the problem with robes is that they don't show up in a lot of Illusions and you end up looking shirtless in any that can't wear a robe.<br />
<br />
Golden Efreeti Boots are good for the yellow shoe look, but generally shoes will only be black or brown that I've found.  Gloves are another hard one, but Coldain Skin Gloves are black/bluish and look fairly nice.<br />
<br />
Hats are very limiting as well.  Basically casters have a choice between no visual hat or leather hat.  If you prefer a leather hat (which will give you a tail in elemental form), Siryn Hair Hood is a really nice one for Enchanters.  It's a long camp (in Rathe Mts.), but still a really nice item.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!</div></div><hr />
