<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cubwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there a board function to ignore a particular user...? because there is one certain person that is driving me crazy here. Asks the same stupid, &quot;I can't be bothered to actually look things up before I post&quot; questions on three separate boards that I frequent.<br />
<br />
Sorry if this is the wrong forum for the question.<br />
<br />
To make it more PSR-ish: What do you tell people who absolutely refuse to help themselves by researching before they ask questions?</div></div><hr />

Actually, there is.  Click UserCP &gt; Buddy/Ignore Lists &gt; Input offending individual.</div></div><hr />

*offers Lothay a tall raspberry daquiri* <br />
Lothay is a trained bartender.  I'd prefer a double (twice the liquor) raspberry daquiri to a tall (more mixer) one.  But ... mmmmm rapsberry. <br />
 <br />
On second thought... Can I get two?  It's going to be a looooong day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cubwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've become a lightweight... a tall works for me, a double would do me in!  :sing: <br />
<br />
Rum + Coke = 4-5 drinks before I even get close to mild intoxication.  :faint: <br />
Rum + blended ice + fruity shtuff = 2 drinks and I'm schnockered. *whee!* :sing:<br />
<br />
the raspberry daquiri is probably the only redeeming thing about the Olive Garden restaurants. (yum, expensive mediocre italian food.  :irked: )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks Lothay!!!<br />

OK to go with the raspberry daquiri, how about a raspberry chocolate truffle cake with a nice glaze made from reducing fresh raspberry juice and a little framboise eau de vie.</div></div><hr />

any chance at the recipe for that cake since it doesnt ship well?? /grins.  or perhaps someone would like some caramel whipped cream-covered choc cake instead?</div></div><hr />

Those new disposable gald containers might work! :) sure frosting may be stuck to the top, but she can still have it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I will post the recipe for the cake tonight.  The raspberry glaze is easy but for getting the seeds out.  (And Niami/Ngreth if you send me an address I can at least send you some really excellent chocolate, I think the cake would not last the trip - it is rich so it may even go bad with priority express delivery.  If you would settle for a Sacher Torte, I can probably get that to you before it would go bad.  Would love to ship stuff to everyone, but I can only afford so much. If they ever have a fan faire in the NYC or Boston area I can bring some with me.)<br />
