<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>FelishannaSecretlight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yesterday, my magician (Suzanna) set about working on her Blacksmithing, and seeing as she had 220 skill, I decided it would be worth trying the Aid Grimel route to 227.<br />
<br />
Requirements:<br />
Must be 220 (unmodified) Blacksmithing skill.<br />
Must have the Bertoxxulous flag.<br />
<br />
Preparation:<br />
Made up 5 stacks of Acid Wash (actually made 98, 2 failed).<br />
<br />
Set-up:<br />
Placed Felishanna (cleric) by the forge in PoK.<br />
Equipped the smithing geerlok on Suzanna.<br />
Equipped Suzanna with all her +INT gear she could manage.<br />
Took Suzanna to Aid Grimel in the library and bound next to him.<br />
Suzanna then suicided down the lift shaft, to make a corpse.<br />
She then looted all her items bar one and dragged the corpse to Felishanna at the forge (where she rezzed her).<br />
Suzanna sits and med a few seconds, then gates so as to be stood next to Aid Grimel. She targets Aid Grimel (and remains with him in the target from now on).<br />
Now, I was ready to start.<br />
<br />
The loop :-<br />
(1) Suzanna says &quot;I am well versed in the art of smithing&quot; with Aid Grimel in target. She receives athe Flithy Breastplate from him.<br />
(2) Felishanna rezzes Suzanna (epic click).<br />
(3) Suzanna accepts the rez, and appears at the forge.<br />
(4) Suzanna sits down, to med faster.<br />
(5) Suzanna does the Filthy Breastplate + Acid Wash combine in the forge. This can give a skill up (sometimes).<br />
(6) Suzanna destroys the resulting Cleansed Breastplate.<br />
(7) Suzanna stands up and casts Gate. Gaining enough mana to cast this only takes the few seconds sitting down. She then appears at Aid Grimel again, ready to repeat the loop.<br />
<br />
The result:<br />
The first 60 combines :- nothing.<br />
The next 27 combines :- gained SEVEN skillups!!!!<br />
This gave Suzanna  smithing skill of 227, at which point this is trivial.<br />
For reference, with rez effects on, Suzanna's INT was at 306.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps someone.<br />

 I am a warrior so I could not do the things being suggested that easily. My wife is a cleric and her daughter is a mage, but we know another cleric and borrowed his account for a couple hours. Our thought was the CoH would use too much mana and she would run out.<br />
<br />
Here is another way to do it.<br />
<br />
Die twice falling down the elevator. <br />
<br />
Corpse one at grim.. Corpse two at the forge.<br />
<br />
A cleric at each location chain casts rez. I pick up a chest... accepted rez... combine... accepted other rez... pick up a new chest... accepted rez... etc.<br />
<br />
Just another option for all of you.<br />
<br />
It took me 8-9 stacks of combines to get from 220 to 227. Keep in mind my str was at around 268 or so because of the rez effects instead of its normal 305. <br />
<br />
I'm the mage he mentioned here (also the one running the 2nd cleric), he got about one combine per 18 seconds.  He got 7 skill ups in 1.5 hours, including set up time.  However I doubt people who weren't sitting in the same room would be able to get it going that fast.<br />
<br />
I plan on trying this too as soon as I reach 220 smithing, I just wish my rezzed INT was 306!  It's more like 284 hehe.  Thanks for the info.  One question, what is your FT?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I found it easier to bind up in the tower, hotkey the &quot;give me a filth bp&quot; text, and fly down the elevator, out the library, ramp over the wall and into the forge, hit combine and gate back up top.  Easier even than porting to pok, combining, gating, porting back down.  Anyways, I got bored after about 40 runs and just did the combines (and got 3/3 success rate on both the tempering and imbuing), though the pure velium combine i'm more like 2/5 on (and still need to do it once more).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Only having myself (ranger) and my cleric alt, I kept a corpse at the bottom of the elevator.<br />
<br />
I went up the elevator and hit the button to make it go back down. Then I talked to grimel and rezzed myself back to the bottom of the elevator. Next I ran to the forge, did the combine, and rezzed back to the elevator. Once I got to the bottom of the elevator shaft it had barely just come back down (often right on top of me as I rezzed in.<br />
<br />
If you are a non gating class with a cleric handy this shoudl work well. I did 222-227 in about 100 combines over a period of about 3 hours (including a few coffee breaks and split over one night and an hour the next day).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ellowyn dArvenost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Will this work for an Int Caster whose skill up chance is based on Int not Str?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Me as a druid, I bound at AG and ported to PoK to do the combine. It seemed faster than all the running from AG to the forge and less having to do the actual drive.<br />
<br />
It was a painful 7 points, but it sure was cheap and easier than EVB and SS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did like Chen, bound at AG, ported to PoK ran to forge.  Good thing was he didn't leave target window, so didn't even need to turn to face him to get another filthy bp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Qualous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just as a heads up, you do not need to target Grimel when you say the phrase.<br />
<br />
Also, if you are a cleric, placing a corpse on one side and binding at the other and using rez and gate works well.</div></div><hr />
