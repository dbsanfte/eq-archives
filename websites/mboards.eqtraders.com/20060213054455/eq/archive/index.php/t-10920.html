<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sadonumspa</div><div class="date">09-28-2003, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Many of you may remember me as Numsy Enfuego. At one time the highest skilled Wood-elf Tailor on Xegony. Well... Numsy has faded to black and is now total support for me..well this me.. not that me.. <br />
<br />
Sadonumspa Omnislayer<br />
<br />
I am currently working on the Aid-Grimel quest as many people are as well and took my prior tradeskilling knowledge from Numsy and put it all into Sadonumspa.  <br />
<br />
I never knew how good people with 2 accounts had it until I split Numsy on to his own account.  He forages, ports, sub-combines, bazaar surfs, and is now basically Sadonumspa's tradeskilling Beotch. (Darn shame too hehe)<br />
<br />
So.. anyway.. to announce my &quot;arrival&quot; (yeah yeah.. i know.. big whoop.. but I figure this is the best place to toot my own horn and to let people know that i'm back in tradeskilling again and that i'm available for info and help where i can).. so here goes..<br />
<br />
You have become better at Smithing! (212)<br />
You have become better at Brewing! (250)<br />
You have become better at Jewelcraft! (250)<br />
You have become better at Pottery! (230)<br />
You have become better at Tailoring! (237)<br />
You have become better at Fletching! (250)<br />
You have become better at Baking! (250)<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope all has been well with everyone and holler at me in game.</div></div><hr />
