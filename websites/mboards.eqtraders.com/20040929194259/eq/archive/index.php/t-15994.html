<br />
I had what is probably the best tradeskill day in a very long time on the weekend.  I have been trying to max my Tailoring out to 200 for about 4 months now and on Saturday night I as was able to acheive my goal.<br />
<br />
Over the last 4 months I have been buying up each and every Excellent Sabertooth Tiger Hide in the bazaar.  The hides are used in Woodelf Cultural Tailoirng to produce &quot;Mithril Reinforced Leather&quot; items, to be specific the Mask.  I was able to gather 6 stack together.<br />
<br />
On average I spent approximatly 100pp per hide, about 50pp on each Oak Bark, about 15pp on each Morning dew and 7pp on each Mithril Bit.  So give or take a couple of Kpp I spent approximatly 20k on all the components.<br />
<br />
I whacked together a Fer'dal Sewing kit, put on my WIS gear ( total WIS was 260  ) and grabbed my Sewing Geerlok and sat down in Kelethin to do the combines.<br />
<br />
Sorry, that I did not save the log on this but in 6 stacks of Tailoring tries I managed to skillup 9 times !!!  Needless to say I was absolutly stunned.<br />
<br />
So, all I needed was 1 tick to make the 1450 club.  Luckly I had 44 <br />
Acrylia Reinforced Mask tries saved up as well.<br />
<br />
I managed to DING 200 on my 4th try into the Reinforced !!<br />
<br />
I took the remaining 2 stack of components for the Acrylia and sold it that night in the bazaar for approximatly 16k - almost got all me pp back :).<br />
<br />
I won't be spending any AA's on Tanaan until I have EQ and AM3 in hand so I won't be back into the trades for a while.<br />
<br />
Thank you to everyone here at EQtraders.com.  You have helped me in my path to 1450 in so many ways I can not count.  One thousand thank you's :).<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
