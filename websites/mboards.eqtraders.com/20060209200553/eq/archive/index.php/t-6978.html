<br />
If you come to me with 3X the parts needed for a complete set, I will attempt to make the armor for you.  There will be NO guarantee's that you will get a full set from this.  The more parts you bring the better your chances :)<br />
<br />
The FIRST successful combine of each piece (2 for bracer) is free.  I.E. I will make a full set for free.  TIPS are appreciated.   Tips can include the remaining parts, but cash is always handy.<br />
<br />
If you want me to combine until I am out of parts, and you keep the successes, any successful combines after that are 1000PP per sheet per item (this is to make something on my skill for combining the wares for those who will be reselling it.)  You only pay for successful combines.<br />
<br />
You can find all the supplies you need at http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_smithing_ogre.htm and other pages at www.eqtraders.com :)<br />
<br />
This is the best way to get armor for me.  I will be the most receptive.<br />
&lt;hr&gt;<br />
If you want me to get the parts and make the armor for you...  the price is as follows:<br />
<br />
Splint (chain)<br />
veil, gorget, bracers, boots - 5000pp<br />
coif, mantle, skirt, sleeves, gloves - 10000pp <br />
tunic, cape, leggings - 3 sheets - 15000pp<br />
<br />
Plate<br />
visor, bracer, collar, and boots - 10000pp<br />
helm, pauldrons, girdle, vambraces, and gauntlets -20000pp<br />
breastplate, cloak, and greaves - 30000pp<br />
<br />
You must give me HALF before I start, and the other half when you receive your armor.<br />
<br />
Note, these prices are WELL above market price... why?  Because I DESPISE hunting for the parts for this armor.  That is why I demand half up front, because of too many times where I told a person the high price, I went hunting for the parts, and they then did not want the armor.<br />
<br />
*IF* you can agree to all of these stipulations, leave me a private message on these boards.<br />
<br />
Voidpack is my bazaar mule on Tunare.  Note... I am AFK 99% of the time on that mule, so you will very likely NOT get a response to your tells.  Any pieces you see there are from leftover parts from a tip, and those I sell at market price.  I will absolutely 100% not make custom orders from my tips.  I will make a few pieces at random, and you folk can try and grab what I make.</div></div><hr />
