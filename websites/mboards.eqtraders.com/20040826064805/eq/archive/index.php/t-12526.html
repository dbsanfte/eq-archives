<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After a long week of combines, I finally made GM in Brewing (250) today on Kane Bayle.<br />
<br />
And I did it with only a 150 skill in Wisdom as my highest stat.  Don't ask me how long it took me, other than to say my average skill-up rate was 1 in 40 combines.  My last 2 skill-ups on Kaladim Constitutional took me about 100 combines.<br />
<br />
No trophy yet - gotta save up a bit for that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Barli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I finally managed to get my trophy on the 3rd try!  Expensive, ouch, yes but the GM Corker is mine!  Summoned and converted a GM Satchel into a permenant bag.<br />
<br />
The trophy definitely is worth it from a personal goal basis.  The +50 CHA and other stat bonuses aren't bad either.<br />
<br />
Now continuing on with my smithing - 196 and climbing!<br />

Thanks to this message board and its fine contributors for all your tips and re-assurances that it CAN be done!  (Even with only a 150 Wisdom) - who says dumb warriors can't be Grandmasters!</div></div><hr />
