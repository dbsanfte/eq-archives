<br />
It's not recommended attempting til 200+ (better 240+) due to failure rate of people even at 250<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i am doing halas 10 lb meat pies.  lots of time and effort and subcombines involved.  more than mtps even.  i had some mammoth meat given to me by a friend though so gave it a shot.  at 201 currently but have a whole lot left to do.  <br />
another friend gave me a stack of brownie parts.  she kills all the brownies in lfay every now and then for vengence.  found over 2 stacks of woven mandrake on a vendor from tailors for 2pp a stack.  also got 2 stacks of veegies and a stack of fruit so once i finish meat pies and get inventory space back i am on to picnics.  <br />
dont do both at once.  bank full with loy and all but like 6 or 7 slots of invetory atm.  really need to transfer stuff to mule but most of whats on me will be cooked.  lots of whats in bank will be too.</div></div><hr />
