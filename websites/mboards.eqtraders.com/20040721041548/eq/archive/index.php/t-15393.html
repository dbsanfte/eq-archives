<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zazra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Welp, I've now failed on the Pottery step four time in a row with a skill of 232.:boggled:.  Three times on just making the urn and the last one trying to glaze it in the kiln /sigh was so close :( .<br />
<br />
Anyone have some perky words to lift my spirits?  Or should I just boost to 250 and then try again?  Oh, and what kind of groups have people gathered to get the sacred water from PoValor?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>crystilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hang in there.  I failed 3 times making the URN.  Was my first failure of the entire quest to that point as well.  Folks are bound to fail somewhere and better on the Urn than what I'm going through (5 failures on the robe with takes 3 Obsidianwood saps each).<br />
<br />
I've done the sacred water mobs with as little as an Elemental geared (not time geared) paladin and myself (took 30m healing him per mob), and I've done them with a pal/war, mage (hubby), myself, slower (if one was available).<br />
<br />
They don't need a full group, but they do require someone to keep zoning in/out because a few of the suits are in a camp with other mobs around that will aggro, but since the ones you want to kill are quest mobs, you can hail them to keep them there while their &quot;friends&quot; leave.</div></div><hr />
