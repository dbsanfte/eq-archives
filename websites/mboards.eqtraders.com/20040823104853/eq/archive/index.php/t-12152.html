<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stardestroyer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all!<br />
just wondering if anyone know approx success rates on ep pottery, currently got 242 skill + 5% geerlok all melee stats 305 and wis 355 and havent made one single successful ep combine (think Im up to 7 or something) and its driving me mad =/<br />
<br />
just want to know if this is normal or if its just bad luck ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stats don't matter at all for success rates on combines, just your skill level vs the trivial level.<br />
<br />
Don't know the success rates off hand for those, but, like most of the higher end stuff, probably around 50%, maybe lower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Velurian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Am 1/1 here (on a Ceramic Totem of the Rathe), so I'm either very lucky or your 0/7 is unusually bad. :D <br />
<br />
The success rate on elemental combines for just about every skill seems to be about 50% at max skill, and I suspect that is the case for pottery.<br />
<br />
Edit: 2/2 now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Malodium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Im at 250 pottery.  Ive only tried two ceramic totems of Xegony, but was sucessful at both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stardestroyer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well made a incense burner successfully yesterday though, so Im down to 7/8 failed .. <br />
Anyone know if the burners are harder to make then the rathe totems?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Liwsa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1/1 on ceramic burner or ro<br />
2/4 on ceramic sword of war</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ianthe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Seems to be about a 2/3 success ratio for the 40 or so combines I've done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>claver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">9/10 Incense Burner of Ro<br />
4/4 Ceramic Totem of Rathe<br />
1/1 Ceramic Sprinkler of Marr<br />
12/12 Ceramic Totem of Xegony<br />
<br />
All done with 249 pottery (last skill up has eluded me for months) and a geelok. Ironically my only failure was my first combine attempt.<br />
<br />
I find from my experience that pottery has the highest success rate of any other crafted EP items . I don't cringe when I hit the combine button unlike tailoring or fletching thats for sure....I don't even want to get into the smithing nightmares.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ragnarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Pls disregard Claver. He is an unusually lucky person QQ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aruzdail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The success rate on the skull seems to be a lot better than 50/50.<br />
<br />
I'm 1/2 on burner<br />
2/3 on gavel<br />
1/1 on shield<br />
50% on the rod<br />
<br />
<br />
Racmoor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">1/1 on C. Shield of Valor<br />
1/1 on C. Totem of the Rathe<br />
<br />
Pray to Rallos it continues.  Done with 244+geerlok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gryfalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My success numbers are almost exactly the same as Claver's, in total numbers.<br />
<br />
I think I have failed 1, MAYBE 2 total, in about 30 attempts.<br />
<br />
Elemental Pottery seems...surprisingly..easy.<br />
<br />
I am, of course, 0-2 or 3 on Breastplates tho..sigh.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>StarrsongEverlost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">3 success - 1 fail on Rathe totem<br />
10 success - 2 fail on Shackles<br />
2 succeeds - 0 fails on totem of Xegony<br />
1 succeed - 1 fail on Incense Burner of Ro<br />
3 succeeds on Sprinkler of Marr<br />
<br />
I succeed on about 3 or 4 out of 5 shields<br />
Gavel is nearly 100% - and I've made dozens (maybe fail on 1 in 20)<br />
I fail on about 1 in 5 on the Sword of War (and made and sold dozens of these, as well)<br />
Skull of Decay has very low fail rate, also (maybe 1 in 8)<br />
Haven't made a ton of the rods - maybe 20 - 25 all together - and I don't believe I've failed on more than 1 or 2.</div></div><hr />
