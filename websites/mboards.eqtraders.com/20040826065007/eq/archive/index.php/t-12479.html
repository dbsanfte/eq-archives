What kind of cush-job is that?!  How many places do that?  <br />

&quot;You sent our multi-million dollar shipment to Canada instead of Mexico?  What were you thinking?  Just for that, go home.  Go home right now and don't come back till we have all of this straightened out!  But don't forget to stop in each week and get your paycheck.  We aren't mailing that out, you lazy scum.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>sikle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh, get a job as a cop in Atlanta. Seems everytime a cop screws up there, even going as far as raping people, they get suspended with pay.</div></div><hr />

Cops always get suspended with pay, while an investigation is under way or something.<br />

Of course, in defense of this, at your job you don't carry around a gun and a stick which might have to use on people. Generally there is no investigation where they let you off with pay if it is thought that you bruised some produce. HA HA!</div></div><hr />
