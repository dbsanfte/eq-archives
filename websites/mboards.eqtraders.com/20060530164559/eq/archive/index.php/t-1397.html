<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jorg</div><div class="date">12-23-2002, 03:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i was dumb and made my troll warrior cazic thule cuz i was a newb at the time and didn't know better to make him rallos zek.  So now i'm screwed over when it comes to the new uber smithed stuff cuz i can't wear human made armor like the zek people can /cry.<br />
<br />
So I talked to many people and they all said to post here and ask because they, unlike myself, believe there is at least 1 ogre smith on this server.  I've never seen any sort of darkscale armor for sale let alone the Fulvous Darkscale (CT deity) that i need.  This really sucks cuz how am i supposed to twink my war if i can't get him the good stuff =P.<br />
<br />
So in summary if you know of any ogre smiths please let me know because i'd really like some of this made, and that ogre smith would basically have a monopoly of smithed armor on the rathe.</div></div><hr />

So if you guys get any windstones sell em to him hehe.</div></div><hr />
