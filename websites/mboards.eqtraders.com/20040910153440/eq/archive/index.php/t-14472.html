<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I see another thread that discusses how bad the skill up rate is for pottery, and what rates people are getting.  I know there are items (Geerlock) and stats that improve your chances of creating an item, but are there any stats that help your chances of getting a skill up, or is it just dumb random luck ?  CH, KEI, what ??<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yep, max your wis or int. Most tradeskillers have extra clothnig which they wear during skilling with stats solely designed to max their stats in wis or int but have very poor stats in other areas. They wear this instead of their normal clothing which has stats more evenly spread to cope with combat.<br />
<br />
After you max your primary stat then it's back down to pure luck, superstition and weegee boards to eek out the next skillup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, Max Wisdom or Intelligence If you can take it over 255. I noticed a huge difference between 255 and 280 (my current max) and expect to see the same huge improvement from 280 to 305.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the replys.  Well, if Int is my determining factor, being a caster, I have no gear to switch out since I try to run as high Int as I can anyways. So the answer for me is to simply do what I have been all along, get KEI, cross my fingers, mutter a few profound words, hold my breath, press combine....:( <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lixivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i hate to be the big ball of negativity, but with 305 wis my skill up rate is rediculous, id rather work on ANY other tradeskill than pottery because its such a pain. <br />
<br />
my averge is 3 skill ups per 200 combines. i just did 100 combines of enchanted velium bits in smithing and got 7 skill ups. its the devil =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mewkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I know there are items (Geerlock) and stats that improve your chances of creating an item <br />
your current stats have no (zip zero nada) impact on your sucess rate. Only your current effective skill level (and luck) affects your sucess rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daikoku Ashikaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Over 200 skill your skill up on successes is grater then your skill up on failures, max  int or wis then do  combines that you succed more n, oncepast a base 200 skill.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kanstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Whilst smithing was a passion for me since creation, the other trade skills came online to support it, and then to work on the coldain prayer shawl.  Now, I look to the Aid Grimel quest.<br />
Smithing.. Brewing..  Jewelcraft.. mastered, and quest stages completed I now work on pottery.<br />
<br />
My skill has raised to 216, from 205 today and would like to think I'm fortunate that it was possible in somewhere around 250 combines of unfired planar stein.<br />
<br />
As others mentioned, I've got my &quot;tradeskill / wis&quot; gear, and along with a casting of Kei, have my Wis raised to 290.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kanstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Afternoon.  :)<br />
<br />
Thought I'd make a quick update to my last post as i've done more combines this afternoon on Unfired Opal Encrusted Stein.<br />
<br />
I sourced enough parts for 160 combines, raised skill from 216 to 222 and only had a handful of resources left.  So, guesstimate 157 or 158 combines done for the 6 skill ups.<br />
<br />
Which is holding a similar pattern for my previous run discussed before.  Back to the recipies to see what is next.<br />
<br />
But first, i'll call by Aid Grimel, and make sure all is in order. :cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ouchies.  My maximum wisdom is 255, and from 222 up to my current 240, I only skilled at 255 wisdom.  I did idols of various sorts, and one black marble mortar and pestle.  I went through 21 stacks of idols to go from 222 to 240, so 21 * 20 = 420 and 420 / 18 = 23.3 combines per skillup.  I agree that it's a devil, but it sounds like you're suffering from the RNG devil.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i just did 100 combines of enchanted velium bits in smithing and got 7 skill ups. <br />
<br />
I would kill for that rate (14.2857 combines per skill up.)  I'm getting more than twice the number of combines.  Around 3 skill ups per 100 combines, at a STR of 235.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kanstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Okies folks.  Terribly sorry I can't recall the exact number of combines done, but I will call it in the ball park of 300.<br />
<br />
For this, I used various &quot;unfired idols&quot;, consuming lots of magic clay, vials of clear mana and imbued gems... Ambers... Ivory..  Plains Pebble.<br />
<br />
This carried skill up from 222 through to 235.<br />
<br />
Equipped with the geerlok, I felt bold enough to give the Aid Grimel pottery a whirl... and succeeded!  Word of caution, both the wheel and kiln actions were not trivial - nor did it declare the actual triv in the wizzy bang uber UI.<br />
<br />
So... the message can be hammered home to all, get those stats as high as you possibly can before going nuts on combines for skill ups!<br />
<br />
That means... have KEI and change your gear to something that gives shifts in WIS.  Melee.. put away your uber armours, your mass HP rings, time to get WIS or INT gear.. doesn't matter which.. just get one of them as high as you possibly can!<br />
<br />
Mines varies between 290-294 depending which spell I get from an enchanter.  I'll soon be purchasing the Wis +10 aug from LDoN and that will shift me 300-304. :)<br />
<br />
No more clay for me now.... oh joy...  needle and thread time.  Come back Forge.. all is forgiven! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Burkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Does success rate have any chance on skillups?  I realize this discussion was concerning pottery but If I attempt an item with say a 10% success rate and fail the majority of the time will this affect skillup rate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kanstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">a combine.. is a combine.. is a combine.<br />
<br />
success or failure, they still get a skill up test applied vs the stat.<br />
<br />
Folks have told me that achieving in making the items is better for skill ups than failing.<br />
<br />
I can't say there is more chance of a skill up on success, and conversely, less chance with a failure as I've not studied it.<br />
<br />
All I can say, you *do* get skill ups on both successes and failures.<br />
<br />
At least with successes, you have item for sell back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Taushar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Originally posted by Tumi <br />

<br />
Tumi  <br />
<br />
Well, if you are high enough level to receive KEI, I would suggest trying for Tranquility or VoQ.  They don't last as long as KEI but they do provide extra wis/int. Sometime, every bit helps. <br />
<br />
Taushar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>scaevola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">IF YOU CAN...I highly recommend getting 65 and getting Innate Enlightenment( +10 wis /int per level -5 levels)-pures&amp; priest only I think and Planar Power 5 to all stats ..5 levels<br />
<br />
355 int makes a really big difference Or 355 wis on skill up ratios.<br />
<br />
I feel truly sorry for hybrids and melees who are  tradeskillers ..they got the short end of the stick.. would kinda of make sense to let hybrids get Innate Enlightment(not sure if they can -enc here).<br />
<br />
but melees got it really hard.<br />
If you planning on doing leveling a skill max int/wis gives you a huge return on skill ups /per combines in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Battlewagon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Agree with ya Kanstorm,<br />
<br />
199-216 took me 547 combines unfired planar steins, 32.2 combines per skillup.<br />
<br />
216-222 took me 170 combines on Opal encrusted steins (yes i fired them for the 3p 4s) 28.3 combines per skillup.<br />
