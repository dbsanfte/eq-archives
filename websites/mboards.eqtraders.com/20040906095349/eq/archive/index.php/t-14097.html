<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I use the search feature. I surf many boards.<br />
I explore zones. (as much as I can, been crashing in GoD)<br />
I ask friends on line who explore.<br />
<br />
Could anyone please provide help as to what the name of the mobs and what zones, and maybe even where Pale Nihilite or any sort of Nihilte drops?  Also Aligned steel?  any ideas how or where or what?  I know a few have found cause I see some mob levels and of course suggestions to go and explore.  Heck I figure this board is here to help all find the information they need to tradeskill well, so...<br />
<br />
Don't be afraid to give lots of detail, and no need to flame or spam other info if you feel the need.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />
