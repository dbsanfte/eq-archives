<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was told that Pottery will require a lot of IMBUED items.<br />
Before I start Pottery, what Class/Deity will I need to do the most common types of Imbues?<br />
I currently have a Druid worshipping Tunare and a Cleric worshipping Mithaniel Marr.<br />
Do I need another Class/Deity combination?<br />
I like to be self-sufficient if Imbues are needed. I will create another alt if necessary.<br />
What do you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maisie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you dont mind leveling another alt to 29 , I would make a cleric of Erollisi Marr for the imbue star rose quartz, the cheapest gem.\<br />
<br />
* of course a Cleric/Druid of Karana does Plains Pebbles which are &quot;free&quot; because foraged but nice to use store bought :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">OK...I only have time to level One alt to lvl 29.................should it be a Cleric of Erollisi Marr or a Cleric of Karana. I already have a Druid of Tunare at lvl 55.....so I wanted to know which Cleric would be more important.<br />
Would a Cleric of Erollisi Marr be more important than a Cleric of Karana?<br />
Now that the P.C. zone ZEM has been nerfed from 75% exp to like 25%.......it will take a bit longer to Power Level an alt.<br />
So I wanted to create the one that will benefit Pottery the most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">People suggest erolisi marr, as star quartzes are very cheap gems.  Also cheap are jades and ambers, so if you have a shaman that worships rallos zek or cazic thule you are set.  Don't do karana for pottery, you will find yourself wasting too much time in the karanas foraging.  If you have a lot of money, just stick with the druid and do emeralds.  Not the cheapest, but certainly a viable way if you don't with to make another alt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Iannyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Or an enchanter to make the enchanted clay.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaaba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Plains pebbles are pretty easy to forage, I have an alt on a 2nd computer and when I'm raiding I often park her in zones with good forages and check every hour or so and EK is great because she gets tons of plains pebbles and tea leaves (for brewing).  In one several hour session I can get a couple stacks of each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zephaus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm not sure who has told you &quot;a lot&quot; of imbues are needed.  You're more likely to need enchanted clay than anything else.  <br />
<br />
For skilling up, you shouldn't need any imbues you can't already do as a druid of tunare.  You'll find a JC enchanter more useful than any imbuer.  <br />
<br />
If you plan to sell items as a GM, your tunare imbuing shoud let you make the most popular non-planar item for which you'll need imbuing, the golden idol of tunare - though competition is high on these items, and there may not be much profit in them.  The other golden idols are not great moneymakers, in my experience.  Faithstones and Spiritstones are going to need distilled mana, not imbues.  The real cash is in PoP items, and you'll need 60+ imbuers for that.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cubwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I recommend the Cleric of Errollisi route for imbues. It saved me a very large amount of money when I GM'ed Pottery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What kind of Imbues and for what recipe is the Cleric of Erollissi needed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A search of the database using the word &quot;Erollisi&quot; would have led you to a page showing the Golden Idol of Erollisi Marr &amp; the Unfired Idol of Erollisi Marr.  <br />
<br />
Clicking on either, and reading the recipe, you would see that the gem is Imbued Rose Quartz.  (note: googling &quot;imbued, gem, erollisi marr&quot; , 3rd result down is a link to Everlore with &quot;Imbue Rose Quartz (Erollisi Marr) right there in the accompanying text, no need to even click the link)<br />
<br />
Since the Golden idol is rather expensive to make, we conduct a new search of the EQTC database for Imbued Rose Quartz to see if there are any alternatives, click on &quot;find all recipes that use this item&quot; and then at the bottom of the 2nd page of results we find a recipe for &quot;Unfired Idol&quot; which is a bit simpler and less expensive (no gold bar, clear instead of distilled mana) but trivial is still &gt;250 (255)  YAY!<br />
<br />
Here is the link: Unfired Idol (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=4937&amp;menustr=) <br />
<br />
Class dismissed :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LexBardMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I didn't check the upper pottery recipes at all before I started the skill.  By sheer luck I realized my cleric is Bristlebane and can imbue peridots.  I doubt I will use that ability anyway though, the best route to me seems to be making ceramic bands and then finishing it off with star ruby steins.<br />
<br />
As a side note.. for some completely dumb reason.. unfired red ceramic bands gain more tribute points than fired ones do (29 VS 12 points/each).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">http://www.eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=186&amp;rsa=Cast%20Spell&amp;sub=&amp;sb=item&amp;menustr=080045000000<br />
<br />
This is a page of the various imbues and enchants.... inclusive of the gem imbues for pottery... telling you what you need to use for the imbues/enchants.<br />
<br />
http://www.eqtraders.com/recipes/pottery_recipe_page.php?article=115&amp;rsa=Pottery&amp;sub=deity&amp;sb=item&amp;menustr=080090040000<br />
<br />
This is the page of diety specific pottery combines, telling you what you can make with what.  Note, this doesn't inclued the PoP imbues, but then those aren't diety specifc, nor are they what you're asking about.<br />
<br />
If you are just now starting your ibuer alt, you will only be able to imbue 1 type of stone (the one that matches your god), as the bugs/exploits/fubars that allowed any priest class to mem any imbue, reguardless of god, were fixed/removed/nerfed.  <br />
<br />
So, you'll want to make your imbuer for one of two things... to make a specific item, which means you'll have to choose that specific god... or, to expidite skilling up... which means you'll want to coose a god on the cost/accesablity/trivial of the gem that they use.<br />
<br />
If the former, well, you'll know what you want to make, so go for it... if the later, then accesablilty is moot, as the only dropped only gems are higher value.. the lowest being black pearls (which sell to vendors in the 19pp range).  so, it comes down to cost and trivial... which Maevenniia's post above has noted E Marr being best.<br />
<br />
I doubt I will use that ability anyway though, the best route to me seems to be making ceramic bands and then finishing it off with star ruby steins.<br />
<br />
The cheaper route might be to find someone in your guild that can imbue the star rose (E Marr, although those people seem dang hard to find), or amber (CT... think iksar shamans).  That would bring you to 248, at a lower cost than most other paths.. except cucibles of escape, however, with Gorge of King Xorbb being totally screwed up for the past 4+ months (and absolutley no attention payed to /bug, /petition, and /feedbacks), crucibles of escape are virtually impossible to farm clay for.<br />
<br />
If you have a 24/7 vendor up, then you might be able to recoup some of the plat from star ruby sitens however, althought, it'll probably be slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Maisie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I JUST hit 250 pottery and I am also a Cleric of Bristlebane, I did white ceramic bands, then idols of bristlebane, then star ruby steins.. was expensive but I am glad I am done :)<br />
<br />
Honestly it was probably the only time I will ever imbue dots, so I was glad to have a chance to use the single and mass imbue spells I bought from my complusion to scribe every possible spell I can  :boggled:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It is said that Star Ruby Steins are the cheapest to make compared to the other routes. Just how cheap are they?<br />
If I stick with my Tunare Druid for Imbues, how much more expensive would my route be?<br />
If I am saving only 10 to 15k in the long run, I am not sure if it is worth it to PL an alt to 29 to make a Cleric of Erollissi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">OK I did research and found an answer. Yes the Clerics that worship Erollisi Marr can imbue Rose Quartz that sell for under 2pp per gem. But I would have to PL a new Cleric alt to do that.<br />
I found that my Tunare Druid could imbue Emeralds. Those Emeralds cost 13p per gem.....so it will cost a bit more, but nothing that substantial. It is just too time consuming to PL an alt to 29, by that time I could have made back my money farming or hunting.<br />
I did see how expensive the other Imbues are. I have access to a Brell Cleric and a Mithanial Marr cleric, but the gems needed for those Imbues cost from 100 to 200pp each.<br />
So what do you all think.......can I get by with the Tunare Druid Imbuing Emeralds.<br />
Is Golden Idol of Tunare a good skill up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">from 222, i did roughly 750 combines, and i felt lucky getting by with that.  if the difference is 11 pp per combine, that'd be another 8k+ i'd have spent... up to you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Is Golden Idol of Tunare a good skill up?<br />
<br />
Yes, because there is a steady market for them for the Solstice Earring and you can make a bit of side money from selling the imbued emeralds to other trade skillers. Woodelf cultural fletching, for example, consumes imbued emeralds by the bucket full.<br />
<br />
By churning out GIoT you will eventually get to the trivial and make a tidy profit as well but it will take a lot longer than other methods discussed above unless you are prepared to take the cash hit and only make the unfired idols. One thought however is to try to see what you can sell the unfired idols at. I've noticed some potters selling the unfired steins and idols in the bazaar at a discount compared to the finished version - that's how I picked up the stein I needed for my main's Solstice Earing for a fraction of what it would normally cost<br />
<br />
For one of my alts I went the route of a Halfling Druid of Karana with an eye open on the market for imbued plains pebbles and their use in Karana fletching but the other option I considered was for a Woodelf Druid of Tunare. I finally decided on the Karana route because my halfling could also double as a tailor to produce Leatherfoot Haversacks and Stormreaper Chain Armour in the future.<br />
<br />
That said, I also have to level a Gnome Cleric of Brell to 29 so that I can have a steady source of cheap imbued rubies for my Main's tinkering efforts. Rubies might be expensive but they are a dashed sight easier to get your hands on than the Bertolox imbued black sapphires.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>LexBardMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It is said that Star Ruby Steins are the cheapest to make compared to the other routes. Just how cheap are they?<br />
<br />
I don't know if they are the cheapest but at least you can buy everything from vendors (need clay enchanted of course).  If I remember right, I think it cost about 65 PP per combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Here are the steps I chose.<br />
<br />
Step 1: Create an enchanter and PL him/her up to level 8.  This is so that you can enchant your own clay, so that removes having to find an enchanter for quite a while.<br />
<br />
Step 2: Decide whether you can get ready access to a higher level enchanter to make vials of clear or distilled mana.  If you can't, then you'll have to skip doing idols at all, or buy your mana vials in the Bazaar.  If you don't have access, don't want to PL an enchanter up yourself, or can't afford/can't find mana vials in the Bazaar, then do star ruby steins all the way to 250.  It'll cost a lot, but you'll be self-sufficient, bacuse the only part you need an enchanter for is the clay, so your level 8 alt will be up to the task.<br />
<br />
Step 3: Corner your enchanter and get a steady supply of clear mana.  Wind up your druid and make lots of imbued emeralds.  Get your enchanter bot out and make the clay (most enchanters high enough to make the mana won't want to waste the time on clay, so don't be mean to your enchanter by double-tasking him).  Make unfired regular idols of Tunare (not golden) to about 240.  They're much cheaper, and you should just discard them unfired rather than waste divine crystalline glaze on them, since they don't sell or get much for tribute.  You can mix in crucibles of escape or star ruby steins to keep from getting intolerably bored.<br />
<br />
Step 4: When you reach 240, and can equip a Geerlok to get modified 252, switch to Golden Idols of Tunare (and convince your enchanter-for-hire to switch to vials of distilled mana).  You'll still end up building lots of them (and when fired, they do sell), but you'll have best chance at success, so you're not losing your shirt on them after 240.<br />
<br />
There you go.  Best of luck to you, and happy throwing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What does BOT stand for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Taushar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">What does BOT stand for?<br />
<br />
Is that used as a verb or a noun? If it's a verb, it's usually means to using a second account/character in conjuction so you can do run two characters at one time. If it's used as a noun, it stands of Bastion of Thunder (BoT) which is one of third tier zone Plane of Power (PoP). <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Obina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Chanter for mana vials is more important than Priest for Imbues IMHO.  I did pottery mostly on Opal steins, SRES and GIOT.  Never had trouble finding Imbued emeralds in bazaar.  Did some heavy clay crucibles too for variety. <br />
<br />
I still make GIoT for pocket change.  This has funded my smithing up to 222 so far. :)<br />
<br />
And the chanty created for mana vials is now lvl 60!</div></div><hr />
