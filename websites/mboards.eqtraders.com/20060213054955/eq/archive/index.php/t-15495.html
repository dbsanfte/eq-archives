<br />
Leaving tonight, not sure if I'll be back before or after the weekend.<br />
<br />
Hopefully when I get back someone will have a bunch of Metallic Substances for me.  :D  <br />
<br />
P.S. I could use another Earth Temper (or just the Liquefied Earth &amp; Earth Mephit Blood).  I'm one temper away from trying to make some Livestone Plate Vambraces.  :angel:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spent most of the trip in the studio, not understanding a thing being said...  But I was there to play my cello, and I got to do a few voice-over bits.<br />
<br />
What all this is about is, a good friend of mine wrote a series of books that were published in Japan.  Now they are working on an Anime based on those books.  Every once in awhile he gets together with my Cousin's Father-in-Law and brings us all out to Japan to see how things are going.<br />
<br />
I get tapped to do a bit of music (one of the support characters plays a cello) and some background voice stuff (many parts of the story take place in foreign lands, so they're having the &quot;crowd&quot; speak in English!)<br />
<br />
It's all quite fun, but very confusing at times... especially since my Japanese is about as good as my Spanish! (Read: nearly non-existant!)</div></div><hr />
