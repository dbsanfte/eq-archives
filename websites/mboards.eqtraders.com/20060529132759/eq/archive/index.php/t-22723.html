For instance since we have to skill up anyways why not make stuff we are going to need...maybe not this shawl but the next. For instance had I known I needed Coldain Tempers for Shawl #8 I would have worked it into my brewing skill-ups thereby killing two birds with one stone. You get the idea....</div></div><hr />

That was just an example of something i could have made as I was working on my skill ups which could have been used later on.</div></div><hr />
