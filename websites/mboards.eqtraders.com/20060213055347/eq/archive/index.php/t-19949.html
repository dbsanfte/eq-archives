Give me a shout in game, usually online as Darremon lately (pushing for level 49), Auliesa (foraging her lil heart out), or my own emerald self with Infinite Jest guildmates working on epics or LDoN points.<br />
<br />
Always, always willing to work swaps of tradeskill materials - especially with regards to spells.  Have 2 extra Words of Apparition stored against the day I find a couple more Yaeth's Page 73 (right) to combine em with, and would love nothing more than to trade them or the finished spell RGC for some of my own mage spells.</div></div><hr />

Well, I won't ask you for Rune of Sorcery, or Tears of Prexus... since I know you need those for your Cultural Tailoring just like I do.<br />

Drop me a line... Adelie is almost always up.  I'll see about getting that RGC from you. ;)</div></div><hr />
