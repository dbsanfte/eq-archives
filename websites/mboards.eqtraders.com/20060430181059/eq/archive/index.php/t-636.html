I have not gotten one, and I can't stand these little level 1 or whatever they are monsters.<br />
<br />
Vendor farming in and around Shar Val has been just as ineffective... I haven't seen one bloodling carapace.<br />
<br />
I've asked and been told these are the right things to kill.. What is the drop rate here, 1 in 500!? What's the graphic, is it the same as all the other beetle shell looking things?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did this quest some time ago, but I've noticed a lot more people after broodling carapaces recently.  Has something developed in the world of smithing that makes everyone want to try this?  If its just people looking for a quick way to skill up to 250, they will be disappointed in learning they have to farm the wailing and shreiking bits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The hammer is kinda holding me up in making some humming orbs. I'm slightly inclined to park my butt in OOT instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blaide</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the drop rate of these things sucks.  Heres another horror story though, I managed (after many hours) to gather up all the carapaces I needed, brought them to the forge, had everything ready to go, hit combine...and failed, thus wasting at least 9 hours of work.  See if you can find someone whos done the quest and has the chain tunic to turn in, just give it back to them when you get your hammer.  I was lucky enough to have a friend do this for me when I failed my combine.  Yes im still bitter about it btw!  :evil:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trethyl</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">man i litterally spent 9 hours killing these things yes even my druid with centi hammer killed em in one hit. and after 9 hours i had half what i needed and i mean i was doing whole sale slaughter (you start feeling bad when newbies start calling you names for taking their kills)<br />
after all that one fo the newbies felt sorry for me and gave me thiers.<br />
this after i was /auction WTB carapaces 100pp<br />
and i got my tunic and i got my hammer and i made i got all the way to making my luclinite hammer then out of habbit i left my hammer in the forge cause i forgot something in bank.<br />
yes i lost my hammer hehe and the guards chose just then to get some bug where they were multi spawning in the same spot and i kept loosing my quest stuff or it wouln't work blah blah blah <br />
that was a horrible horrible day</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaman Arriana</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 02:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your best bet, is to just skip this whole step. It horribly sucks.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, I found a friend who already had the tunic. Hand that to Barhkam, and he'll skip you up to the first hammer. You even get the tunic back. Let someone else do the work for you.</div></div><hr />

I knew I would eventually go ld in the middle of a combine or something similar.  Glad I had planned ahead when the inevitable happened :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BuilderOfCastles</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In shadeweavers thicket, off to the left (from shar vahl) is the newbie area where these little bugs live.<br />
<br />
Now, first, everything over there is a place holder for broodlings.<br />
<br />
And second, Those bugs only have two things in their drop table.  Both of these items are rare drops.<br />
<br />
Third, you need 16 of them.  arrrggghhh &amp;lt;-- I didist shout<br />
<br />
Fourth, you can't start the quest unless you are a Vahr Shir citizen.<br />
However, you can start it in the middle by buying the carapice<br />
shield frame.  (and then another)<br />
<br />
<br />
The 'other' rare drop on these bugs can make you faction thou.<br />
turn 4 claws into the guy standing next to the clock tower looking<br />
thing, just out from Shar Vahl.<br />
<br />
Also turn in to him 4 of the claws you get from Lesser Shades for faction.<br />
And lots of drops off of bandits (which gives you faction) can be turned into him in groups of 4 for faction.  Rings, insignia, etc.<br />
<br />
In other words, welcome to the club of a rotten camp<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kradlum</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 05:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found it slow going at first, but once I figured the spawn pattern it was easy. The main thing is not just to kill the bloodlings, kill everything in the newbie area and after a while you will either get a whole load of silk worms or a whole load of bloodlings to spawn. <br />
<br />
I'm sure there is a &quot;feature&quot; in EQ that works out whatever it is you are hunting for and makes that appear less - when looking for a pristine forest drakeling scale, I never found one. As soon as I bought one and didn't need to find one anymore, I found 4! Go figure.<br />
<br />
I think it took me about 4 hours to collect all I needed once I had figured this out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mamutoi</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I spent about 10 minutes farming for these things, got one, got fustrated then checked the vendor that is in the newbie zone and found more then enough on him. <br />
<br />
I am not sure about needing to be a citizen to start the quest. I have never done any faction killing or any quests there before and was able to do the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hah!<br />
<br />
I didn't read the quest text and didn't realize that you needed to hand in a TUNIC.  I made 2 bracers, then read the quest closely when he ate one of them.  Ooo, you should've heard the swearing.<br />
<br />
Only took me 4 or 5 hours to get the hammer.  It's not that bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">burnttoastv</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess I have to throw out my stats too.  Took 6 hours to collect enough to make the tunic.  Later that week ran into an iksar higher lvl then me trying to collect plates, I lent him my tunic which thankfully he returned.  I carried the tunic on me for a while because in the end I ate 3 hammers and one anvil in accidently closing the forge (once a slip of the hand on the mouse and pressing the clicky finger).  This was before the new UI and I was juggling bags looking for ingredients to forge my first shadowscream item.  The third time was the last, haven't tried it since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kradlum</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 04:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the forge eats your hammer/anvil then petition. I stupidly did the same thing - put them both in the forge, then as I was searching my bags for the other components accidentally closed it. I was the most miserable ogre on Luclin. I petitioned, and when a GM asked how they had been lost, I said I had gone linkdead while loading the forge  ;) . I got my hammer and anvil back, and might have got a stack of Swirling Shadows too, if I hadn't told the GM that I would have no time to smith them before logging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tearion</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started the Vah Shir Smithing quest this past weekend.  I'm a High Elf Cleric (you don't need to be a Citizen of Shar Vahl to do the smithing quest). <br />
<br />
Vah Shir Apprentice Mallet<br />
<br />
It took me about 3 hours total to collect 16 carapaces.  They spawn in the low level area between the PoK book and Crossroads in Shadeweaver's Thicket.  They appear to be on a cycle opposite of the silkworms.  I just ran around killing everything for 3 hours.  As a consolation to low levels in the area, I offered healing and HP/AC buffs.  The low levels were more then willing to offer up carapaces that they found, which I gladly gave platinum in return for.  I also ended up with 6+ stacks of shadeling silks.  Both of my combines for the Tunic were successful, but I was starting this quest with a 93 smithing skill.<br />
<br />
Vah Shir Anvil<br />
<br />
Only glitch for this section was that each guard appeared to have duplicate spawns.  By the time I made it back to the guard, the one without the shield was gone.  I solved this problem by stopping at Master Barkhem for another repair order on the way from combining the immaculate shield.  I gave the repair order to the guard, returned the immaculate shield, and then destroyed the second dented shield.  Required a little more running around, but was able to finish this in about 15 min or so.<br />
<br />
Luclinite Hammer<br />
<br />
For this I traveled north in Shadeweaver's Thicket and proceeded to kill every skeleton that spawned around the rocks in that erea.  I looted just about a stack of Swirling Shadow in a little over an hour.  I failed a couple of combines for the Shadow Disks, but was able to make the required 8 and a few extra that I shared with low levels.  The effect (Distort or something like that) is an approximately 14 AC buff.  Each Disk has 5 charges on it.  Shadow Disks became trivial at 108 for me.<br />
<br />
That's as far as I've made it so far, now on to Humming Orbs.</div></div><hr />
