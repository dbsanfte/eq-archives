<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nepper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As a lvl 38 Rng, and having been 202 since lvl 24, I decided it was time for another run.  Figured I'd make a go at bows.  Dex equip on, maxed at 255... 10K from my bank (took a while to get it too!)92 combines later 203.  Only spent about 1K (2 failures on bows), and I wimped out...  Figured I could use some equipment upgrades instead.  <br />
Should I just level a while and wait 'till pp is easier to have at hand, or just go for it and 250 prior to 40 if I can?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">sounds like the RNG was a bit rough on you...<br />
<br />
But also note, one train of thought is:<br />
<br />
&quot;To improve your chances of skill up, WISDOM or INTELLIGENCE (whichever is higher) is used as the basis. The only exception to this is that STRENGTH increases the chance of Skill up for Blacksmithing&quot;<br />
<br />
To the best of my knowledge, this is the only thing Sony has EVER stated in forums, or in response to Fan-Faire questions as affecting skillup. There has been some possible implications that you can increase your skill up chance be making items that have a trivial &quot;close to&quot; your current skill level. But I don't think Sony ever said this was true or not.<br />
<br />
Based on this... it would not matter if your DEX is 1, 255 or 305...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DeegerStormcrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dex is used for fletching skillups as well, at least last time I checked :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">just because rangers have a horrible time uping wis as much as they can dex for tradeskilling their own arrows.  <br />
<br />
you had a bad run.  it hurts.  at lv lv 38 you can own the lesser shades in shadeweaver's and prolly get some decent equip.  raise your smithing up some and do arrows instead.  arrows &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;pp than bows.  good luck.  i am 43 and baking tons.  averaging 1 skillup per 50 combines almost since 192 but i am sure the rng will make tailoring easy for me now instead. :)  <br />
i am positive or i would start screaming a lot.  i have 255 int.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>lonewylfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dex does affect fletching...just go to make a new character and read the dex description.<br />
If it didn't, there's no way I'd be 243 right now...my wis is in the dumps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shadowshot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Why does everyone say that bow's are expensive? Without failures, and i had like 6 from 202-215, you only lose about 20 pp a combine, thats not all that expensive is it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Greymantle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If your not in a hurry, farm substance's for arrow heads and acrlyia for shafts and skill up on arrows. Wayyyyy cheaper but not a fast.</div></div><hr />

Why does everyone say that bow's are expensive? Without failures, and i had like 6 from 202-215, you only lose about 20 pp a combine, thats not all that expensive is it?  <br />
<br />
Because, depending on your skill, and what you're making, the successes cost more per combine when making bows than when making arrows.  And, obviously, the failures hurt a LOT more.<br />
<br />
Spending usually under 1900 plat for 120 mithril arrow combines (making the stuff myself), that comes to usually under 15.833 plat per combine on mithril arrows.  With the essentially zero sellback cost, they're still cheaper than the 20 plat loss for the bows, on a success.  As I understand it, the karana arrows are priced similarly to the mithril arrows.<br />
<br />
Acrylia arrows, when you farm the ingredients, are a HECK of a lot cheaper per combine.  Its only when you look at buying the ingredients from other farmers that acrylia arrows become more expensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heh, I have 2 backpacks full of Sedgewood for this.  After LDoN came out and we figured out what the heck the sedgewood did, I bought out the bazaar several times.  Still do sometimes.  Most folks have NO idea what it is for and I've bought stacks and stacks of it at 5 plat each.  When I buy that particular point of AA, I'm skilling on Sedgewood bows.</div></div><hr />

Incorrect, Karana arrows are a MINUMUM of 32pp per combine of arrow (steel Guardian).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wander how come steel is so much more expensive then mithril...isn't the opposite suppose to be the case? :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd have thought that steel would have been along the same price as mithril for fletching.  Of course, the added cost on WE fletching is the emeralds for the imbued arrows.  The prairie pebbles for Karana imbues are foraged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>curyllic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Aye, 1 brick of steel is 55.5pp.<br />
And that brick only makes 2 arrow shafts on a success.<br />
Then you still have to make the arrow head from a smaller sized brick of steel, like 6pp or so.<br />
<br />
So you see, there is really no advantage I see to doing Karana cultural except to get a ranger that 1 arrow.<br />
At 32pp or so per arrow you don't want to not have Endless Quiver.<br />
<br />
So a less expensive way is actually to just make bows and sell the successes back to the merchants.<br />
I am dissapointed SOE didn't make this as a viable skillup route as a boon to those Karana rangers. Its definetely not equal.<br />
Stop opressing the Karana folk now!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">karana can be done by any race following karana though.  that wood elf karana worshipper can do both you realize?  it lets humans and normal non fletching cultural folk do it in addition to there cultural.  not bad if it costs a bit more.  think if it made 5 arrows shafts or the brick was 40 pp would help a lot though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm I'm not sure its possible to be a wood elf and follow Karana.  I play a Wood Elf Ranger and My only option was Tunare.  Which is just as well imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">my wood elf warrioress follows karana.<br />
<br />
which sucks cuz i'm a high elf smith and the good plate armor i can make, she can't wear. ah well.<br />
<br />
so yes, at least if you're a warrior you can follow karana and be a wood elf =)</div></div><hr />
