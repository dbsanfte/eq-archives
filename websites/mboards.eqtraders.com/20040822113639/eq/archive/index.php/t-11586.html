<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vondo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First time poster here... my research skill is 160 atm... after about 30+ combines and 5k ... without 1 skill up (no i did not get the &quot; you can no longer advance your skill msg) i was pretty dissapointed. <br />
<br />
I know this would be difficult to do because of the way research components are aquired, but is there a table or link anywhere with some type of &quot;route to mastery&quot; ? Maybe to combine spells with higher end trivial rates who's components are common and relativily cheap in bazaar. Just a thought and figured i should at least ask before dumping another 5k without a skill up. Thank you :)</div></div><hr />

Note: Only the actual guildmaster in the caster guilds can train you all the way to 200. The other trainers can train you only so far (possibly 185.) Trainers in PoK can also train you to 200.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vondo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Arrrgh.. i was afraid of this reply as i'm out of skill points =( thx tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nimphe Wildwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh no.  :(   Perhaps an Int caster will be able to supply with you another alternative.  My Necro is lvl 50 and relatively new to Research.  <br />
<br />
Good Luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The first question is.. what level are you?<br />
<br />
At 30+ combines without a skillup, my first thought is... are you level 47?<br />
<br />
If you are, you can't gain a skillup until you level.  If you're above 47, i would stongly recomend you just gather components for combines as you hunt (paying for them is just going to cost you dearly, seeing the silly prices people want for components in the bazaar).<br />
<br />
For 5k, if you had build points, you could buy it from 1-200 at a trainer.  Paying 5k for 30 combines.... makes no sense.  If you can gain levels, do it and use the build points.  If you're level 65.. there is no reason not to farm the components from an area where lots of components drop.  Not all the components you get would be your classes, but some will.<br />
<br />
The practice research runes are also an option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vondo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Lvl 65 = Arch convoker heh... well the 5k was mainly spent on components that werent so cheap ... i did make a few spells for my alt shammy. However without any trainer points ... doin this little trick of making spells for skill ups doesnt seem resonable unless i just hit a bad streak hehe .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mendatenrognabs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Check out Practice runes made with the concordance of research, as well as swatches... Swatches are under the research recipes section, not sure if the practice runes are there yet...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Can you go to 200 on practice research?<br />
<br />
49 runes/pages/words are easier to get than the stuff for practice research. They trivial out at 182 though. After that I'd start buying up the common stuff for 55+ spells in bazaar. Remember you can do all priest class combines for skill up too.<br />
<br />
And yes, I think you just hit a bad streak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vondo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sweet thanks for the info guys. Looks like im making mage spells till 182 skill lol. Too bad there wasnt another way to get trainer points :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mendatenrognabs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Magi Runes trivial 180&lt;x&lt;=182 from what I have heard and personally seen...<br />
<br />
I would disagree, getting brownie parts from steamfont, shark skin from kedge, and giant toes and FS blunt/pierce weapons from Rathe Mountains is easier in my opinion than killing random monsters levels 44 to 56 to get the spell research drops.  At least thats the way it seemed for a Magician.  You might get lucky in the bazaar with the spell components though if you have cash.<br />
<br />
I do agree that almost all the other Concordance Runes are a pain tah do.<br />
<br />
Unstackable NO RENT Burntout Lightstones... what a joke.</div></div><hr />
