<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cherryflavour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Golden earring, drops from some NPC's, and I have seen a couple of NPC's who sell it, has no sats, it now has a tradeskill flag. I don't see any listing for it on EQTC, and have never found a recipe that uses one. Any Ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Doremi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Radar Love? :angel:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's had that tag for a while.  We're all still puzzled by it.<br />
<br />
Maybe we'll find something with the new UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cherryflavour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just ran into a possibility I didn't even think of but the lighthouse beacon quest uses a copper ring which is also jewellry, I suppsoe there is no rason it could not be a quest related combine.<br />
<br />
<br />
/bonk Doremi<br />
Good song tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">try melting it down into a gold bar.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I added it to the DB with sources within the past week, because someone had posted it on the Submissions forum with lots of mobs that dropped it. They did NOT list any recipe...<br />
<br />
As for what it is for, I don't know. I was simply trying to get the Sources up to date and have a few more big posts still to go (Jagged Pine Druid Quest Armor being one). <br />
<br />
It MIGHT be a quest item... put it (and other things) in a Quest Container, hit combine... do a turn-in. And EQ -MIGHT- consider it a tradeskill item.<br />
<br />
OR...<br />
<br />
There might be some recipe where you apply a Glaze, a gem... or something to give it some &quot;new and improved&quot; capability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cherryflavour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If anyone has some suggestions I'll try it, I'll look into possobilities for melting it down  Also, glazing is an interesting idea. I've tried straightforward JC combines IE+Peridot or +Amber, +jasper, +Sapphire, +Diamond, +Blue Diamond, etc, all DNC  <br />
<br />
Going to try melting, also, jar of acid, celesital essence some other sutff like that.</div></div><hr />
