<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wildheart</div><div class="date">04-16-2003, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started a twink a few weeks ago, and he is a frogloc.  After seeing the states for a paly on luminant heraldic armor, I decied that is the way I want to go.  I have 2 questions, first, does anyone know if froglocs can make luminant heraldic armor (I know they can wear it).  2nd, if I farm for pp, how much will I need and what should I expect to pay to buy a set.  Farmers are a 62 warr and 62 cleric, so I can bring in money at a desent rate.  I am wondering about how much these items go for, and what is standard.  It will be a few weeks, but can anyone toss up some information or contacts of some people that make this stuff?<br />
<br />
Thanks, Wildheart</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only humans can make heraldic armor (human cultural smithing).  See this page (http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_smithing_human_qeynos.htm) for more info on ingredients.<br />
<br />
Can't help you on cost, I'm afraid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jugador</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">there's a union of human smiths that sell this and other heraldic armor.  The last pricing schedule I heard was 10k for 1 ring items, 17.5k for 2 ring items, 25k for 3 ring items.  However, I think those prices have dropped a bit since the last pricing schedule that I was told.<br />
<br />
I have a 250 human smithy, however I rarely have time to farm tempers and such with my busy rl/raiding schedule.</div></div><hr />
