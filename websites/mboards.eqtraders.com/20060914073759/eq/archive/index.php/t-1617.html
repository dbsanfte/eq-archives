I seem to remember from experiences with my GM jeweller that 190 to 210 was REALLY bad...</div></div><hr />

Naeen thinks 200-210 is bad, yet in my post below (skillup date 200-245) I got most points in under 10 attempts in that range. It's just luck. Figure on 20-25 combines per skillup over time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The high 180s to low 200s are definately tradeskill hell levels though - those are the skill ranges that encounter the most rants and &quot;I've done 400+ combines with no skill up at 191 skill.<br />
<br />
I can definately confirm that most of my skill points in both JC and fletching from 190-200 were 100+ combine skill points and my troll is trying to break the 191 barrier in baking with 140+ combines so far and no skill up.<br />
<br />
Some folks might get lucky in those levels, some folks might have thier INT/WIS so maxed out that they don't get hit as hard as the rest of us, but that is DEFINATELY a hell level area for all tradeskills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dedori</div><div class="date">01-06-2003, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If it is true that there is a greater chance for skilling up on a successful combine then there will be natural &quot;hell levels&quot; each time you triv one type of combine leaving a greater chance of failure for upcoming combines.<br />
<br />
Using 188 as an example, with skill 187 one should make a successful combine just about every time which yields an increased probability of a skill increase just about every time.  Once 188 is reached the next triv is 215 (?).  Now your chance of succeeding has dropped dramatically and with it your chance for increased skill up opportunities due to successful combines.  This would explain why there are natural peaks and valleys in our progression rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meirril</div><div class="date">01-06-2003, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started making studded acrylia around 155, that's 30 points below the triv. My success rate has been very good (about 4 out of 5 combines.) and has taken me quite quickly into the 160s. As long as your less than 50 points under the trivial I belive your success rate is worth making attempts at combines if you actualy want the item in question (note that &amp;lt;250 combines are Over 250. Where not sure what the actual trivial number would be so we can't say when we're within 50 of the trivial. On some recipees we may never reach the within 50 mark!). It seems your most likely to get skill ups when the trivial is about 20 above your current skill (the last 5 points on a trivial usualy take alot of combines. I usualy skip to the next recipee.). I just &quot;mastered&quot; JC a few nights ago (went from 40 to 170 skill for 8th shawl) and I progressed rapidly after I remembered about the &quot;20 above is best&quot; logic. Before that I was doing 10 above my current skill and taking about 8 combines per skill up, after switching to 25-15 above I went down to 3 combines per skill up (at 255 wis). I know skill ups in the 188+ world are harder to come by, but that dosen't mean the same tricks used at lower levels of skill shouldn't be used anymore when you can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had much better tailoring skillup success on Wood Elf Cultural than on Velious recipes (trivial 250+). On my way up, I made cultural with trivials of 215 and then 228. While this doesn't prove that you get more skillups when you are reasonably close to the trivial, it is very strong supporting evidence.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">travman</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well this is great, im thinking 49 is a hell level for tailoring ( i hate making heady kiolas, over and over!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lunariel</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My worst in tailoring was at 190. I needed around 170 Solstice robe attempts before I got to 191. And I only made one robe from those attempts.  :cry: I had some other bad levels around there too. After 206 I don't think I've ever gone over 30 something attempts without a skillup and I've had an average of roughly one for every 20 attempt. Today I did 95 combines and got from 222 to 228. :D <br />
<br />
In jewelcraft I also noticed it slowed down around 185 to 210, but I don't think I ever needed over 100 attempts.<br />
<br />
And earlier this week I tried 120 Minotaur attempts at 191 in brewing. Not a single skillup.<br />
<br />
There's definately something strange going on around 190 with skillups.<br />
<br />
I'm now at 189 in smithing and can't say I'm looking forward to going through that range with the current state of smithing.  With broken acrylia, no cultural and sickles too expensive there's only one thing left. Hollowshade, here I come...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wiggume</div><div class="date">01-11-2003, 01:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with 190-200 being hell levels.<br />
<br />
I did 140 combines to get 1 skill up at 199 in brewing. Im on like 60 combines without a skill up at 193 in baking. 191 in fletching is stuck too. I dont specifically recall tailoring being really hard at 190-200 but I was progressing a lot slower over all in tailoring. As Ive been trying to raise all my other tradeskills to 200 ive definately noticed a brick wall at 190.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cylestria</div><div class="date">01-12-2003, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hell levels I remember, 168, 188! (me too arugh!!), 197 boy was I stuck there, and the rest of the 90's were kinda a push.  I'm just glad I passed 210 *wipes forehead*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shjinn</div><div class="date">01-14-2003, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, high 190's are hell levels for many tradeskills, it seems.<br />
<br />
For me, I went through 207 combines at 198 before going to 199.  Then in next 25 combines, I got 3 skillups.  Since then, I've averaged 1 skillup per 19 or 20 so combines.<br />
<br />
Keep at it.  Dont' give up.  I know I almost did. :)<br />

<br />
190-95 combines<br />
191-102 combines<br />
192-95 combines and still trying....<br />
<br />
Does it get better after 200?<br />
<br />
P.S. This was with an average skill up rate of 1 skill per 20 combines prior to hitting 190.  I have had only one success in all of those combines too :(</div></div><hr />

I went from 188 to 194, with 108 Acrylia Reinforced attempts, with a Wis of 243.  What is your Wis?  I can attest to the fact that a Higher Wis WILL inprove your skillup rate.<br />

I even have my greerlock equipped since it has usually been my experience that more successes equals more skills ups.  I am still only level 60 and refuse to level just to increase my wis for my tradeskill fix.  Going to do another 30 or so combines tonight, hoping that it will get me to 193.</div></div><hr />

Good luck to others in that point of skilling.  I know i might reach it again but sure feels good when you get a good streak going =)</div></div><hr />
