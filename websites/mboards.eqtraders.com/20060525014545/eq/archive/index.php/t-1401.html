Unfortunately, the trend I've seen lately is to keep jacking these prices up and up in Bazaar. There are a couple of vendors who are putting flawless rockhopper on their mules now for 300pp each, and this is encouraging other vendors to raise their prices as well. Any time I see rockhopper below about 120pp, I buy it as quickly as I can, cause I'm pretty certain these other vendors are also just buying the cheap stock and putting it back in their own sales stock at the higher prices--essentially trying to corner the market.<br />
<br />
Other jacked prices: I see othmir now running as high as 100pp per hide. Silks as high as 10pp each. Arctic wyvern as high as 30-50pp each. I don't know about you, Jack, but I can't afford to pay those prices.<br />
