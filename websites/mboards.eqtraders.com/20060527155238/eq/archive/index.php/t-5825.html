<br />
Munwin made my Stormreapers belt last night!   YAY!!!<br />
He met me in PoT, I handed him everything (I had done all the subcombines), and he made the belt on the first shot!<br />
<br />
Being the super great person he is, he even provided the Acorn oil, since I had informed him 2 hours previous that it was Iall I was missing, And I would forage one.   He told me not to worry, he had a spare.<br />
<br />
So, I just wanted to let you all know that Munwin is an Awesome tailor, and you should all buy lots of things from him!<br />
<br />
And the best part was, I got a couple of screenshots of myself in a 50 person Triton Raid!   He invited into his group to watch the combine, and while he was combining, I noticed the &quot;You have joined the Raid&quot; message.   I opened up the raid window, and got a nice screenshot of myself in a group, and a 50 person raid of Level 65 people. <br />
<br />
*grin*  I know it's silly, but it made me chuckle.   I've been on a Trion Raid.   (In the letter of the law, not the spirit.)<br />
<br />
Does that make me UBAH?<br />

   &quot;Yeah, it was another night in the Plane of Water, Wise had just dropped. So i handed him the stuff and he made the belt. Was no big deal actually&quot; As the little maidens in the bar swoon and offer to feed you your supper.  ;) <br />

I'll confirm too that Munwin is great to deal with. I sold him a bunch of Dire Wolf Tufts and when he found I had 1.5 bags of it he gave me a nice bonus! This was some time ago but thought I'd mention it!<br />
