<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanna</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, MithMarr! <br />
<br />
I have a character on this server named Clico, a leetle Dwarven Cleric who's sole purpose of existance is to find many dwarven cultural trivials, but who is also finding many 'plain' ones along the way. IE, Velium/Acrylia/Enchanted stuff. <br />
<br />
The price of acrylia is rising slowly but steadily in the bazaar, and HQore if bought from a vendor is very expensive. Thus, I send out a request to you, and hope that anyone you know will hear it too.... <br />
<br />
I am looking for raw supplies. In general, the raw-er, the better. <br />
<br />
-- FINE STEEL weapons (to make HQ ore). If you see this drop, please may I have it. If you need payment for it, I offer 6p a piece, or a trade if i have something you want. <br />
<br />
--ACRYLIA in small bricks or larger. If you let me take a potshot at the combine, to test the trivial, you may certainly have the result back if you wish, or perhaps we can work out a trade, or even a payment that's fair enough to you and still saves me some plat. <br />
<br />
-- VELIUM, preferrably small and large bricks atm. Again, either free, trade, or less-than-bazaar payment, and I will love you. <br />
<br />
<br />
Also, aside from me begging for supplies, I offer my services. If you want something rather low-end made and don't feel like sitting in front of the forge, I'll do it for just a little over cost.  <br />
<br />
I also, at any given time, have an assortment of odd smithed 'things'. Like, a partial stack of metal studs, good for tailoring; a few velium bits, some acrylia bits, a few sheets and a folded sheet of some kind or other. If you want Coldain Velium Temper for less than the 26p the man in Thurgadin wants, talk to me. <br />
<br />
My current skill level will always be posted in the sig, as long as Clico remains important. If you want something made, armor or the like, or a combine done, that is relatively within shooting range of my level, bring me the stuff and I'll attempt, free. (If it's below my level, trivial to me, I'll charge a little, but not much.)<br />
<br />
As I go higher, I will have random assorted 'things' up for sale... various pieces of armor, esp banded as I get there. Just send me a tell, see what I have, if I might have anything you want. ^_^ <br />

<br />
Might you mean trivials?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanna</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh, haha, that should have been 'cultural trivials'. <br />
<br />
read my mind, lilosh! hee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calliopeia</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had I known your alter ego was Sanna, I would've been much more cordial when you sent me that tell initially.  You see, there is a common scam on Mith Marr that consists of making a low level character and then pretending to know a higher level character from somewhere else.  The scammer eventually asks the high level character for stuff rather mercilessly.  So I admit that I was quite wary at first, but I would not have been if I had known you were the Sanna with the wonderful Storyline recipes and other great tradeskil helpers.  I always enjoy meeting fellow list geeks.<br />
<br />
BTW, I saw Astyanax doing some enchanting for you.  He's a sweetie for sure.  If you need additional enchanting in your quest for trivials, let me know.  I inherited an enchanter from a friend who quit, and poor Malikie's sole purpose in life now is to make me vials and enchant stuff. <br />
<br />
Welcome to Mith Marr!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanna</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 02:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">aaaaah. i forgot my own first rule.<br />
&quot;Never assume that the other person knows what you think they know.&quot;<br />
<br />
I got left behind for a Kael raid once because of that. You'd think it'd have been enough to make me remember. ^_^ So sorry, ma'am. <br />
<br />
Altho..... do you know of a 39+ rogue? I'll eventually be needing a whooole lot of earthen tempers, which means lava rocks (Steamfont mining, ick) and drops of mercury. And since at least the mercury can be made, it would behoove me to find a rogue who will do the combines for me at relatively free cost. ^_^ <br />
<br />
And Mith Marr is a very great place to be! ty so much! ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calliopeia</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do know a kind rogue with a maxxed poison skill.  When you get to the point where you need lava rocks, I am sure if you bat your eyelashes a few times, he'll happily combine ingredients for you.<br />
<br />
As for your fine steel collection, I will be in Permafrost to collect some more crystals pretty soon.  If Clico is of the level where she won't die instantly, you are welcome to tag along and pick up all of the fine steel you can carry.  I'll look for you when I get ready to go back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanna</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">woot! i will have to head to steamfont and slay things (er, try to slay things) and get lava rocks. And i can sure buy up the things to make the mercury. <br />
<br />
fine steel, yay! altho i finally broke down and bought a bit from the pok kitty merchant. icky. i think i'll take my chances with smithing them up. i am a click ho, after all. ^_^ <br />
<br />
i know you can't friend interserver names, grrrrrr, but if you can remember, send ;tell s to sullon.iroke if you are bored and want to haul her around EF/perma. the way things are going now, i can't seem to keep xp on iroke, and it's a bit frustrating to be on sullon. (ALL i wanna do is group with my roomie! is that really too hard to ask?? ^_^!!!!!)<br />
<br />
and if you ;tell sullon.iroke and i don't respond, it means i'm in trader, and the stupid /afk messages don't cross servers either. <br />
<br />
woman, you rock. ^_^ ubah woot, and i apologize for not explaining meself clearly the first time. ^_^ i get bored on mithmarr, b/c i don't know anyone, so i get overly chatty. ~_~ sorries.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calliopeia</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Will do.  I'll be out of the game till June (yay, vacation time!) but I'll look for you then.</div></div><hr />
