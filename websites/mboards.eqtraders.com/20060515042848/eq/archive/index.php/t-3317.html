<br />
Ideally, a guild that might actually assist me in tradeskilling (i.e. save a foraged veggie or two, go hunting with me where stuff drops when time permits, &amp; so on).<br />
<br />
Or if not, one that would at least accept and support me the teensiest little bit, and act like maybe my getting to 212 baking (so far) is almost as good as starting a new character and getting to level 10.<br />
<br />
Ooops, a little bitter. Sorry about that.<br />
<br />
Anybody know of a guild, or want to start one? I think &quot;The Encumbered&quot; would be a good name. ;)<br />

<br />
I dont think there are any guilds that are run with tradeskills in mind, especially not on a PvP server like ours.  I think your best bet is to join a guild and start making friends with those foragers etc, once you can start making STAT food, you will see your reputation in the guild go up, and more people willing to collect/save stuff for you.<br />
<br />
As a cleric i dont think you shoud have too much trouble finding a guild.  Look around and find one that suits your playing style.<br />
<br />
GL in your Tradeskill future, and keep us posted in how you are doing here.  I am trying hard to gather the tradeskillers to this forum, so we can keep up with each other and stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nhin Impious</div><div class="date">02-05-2003, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, I've pretty much come to the conclusion that I just gotta train up the current set of guildies right. <br />
<br />
I'm trying to figure out how to put &quot;You have become better at Sharing with the Baker (23)!&quot; across their text window...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pootle</div><div class="date">02-06-2003, 07:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do it in guildchat - this way everyone will get the message that you are collecting baking components...<br />
<br />
Nhin tells the Guild : Pootle has become better at Sharing with the Baker (23)<br />
<br />
maybe followed by -<br />
<br />
Nhin tells the Guild : Pootle will soon become better at eating [link uber stat food here] (47)<br />
<br />
This way other guildies see the great stuff you are making and want some themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nhin Impious</div><div class="date">02-19-2003, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For some kind of weird reason I got accidentally removed from my guild (bug or something). Nothing to do, so I did some baking and then thought about making my trophy.<br />
<br />
So yesterday morning I went toddling around PoK and ran into my Favorite Erudite Enchanter™. Thanks to his wonderful generosity I was able to get my vial of mana for my trophy, and also my mounted gems (after a hair-raising trip to Thurgadin...you don't know nerves until you're walking through a city alone carrying 2K...)... I was flying high. I had to rearrange about ten times to get everything made and into the kiln, and a few times dropped my food, my water, or something else on the ground while I did it. I was SOOOO overflowing with stuff. But...<br />
<br />
4 rubies @ ~130pp each = 520pp<br />
4 various gems @ ~200 avg. = 800pp<br />
8 bars velium @ 285pp (oooh, what terrible faction you have!)= 2280pp<br />
1 dairy spoon = &gt;1pp<br />
<br />
Seeing &quot;You lack the skill to combine the items&quot; = priceless. Farkin' priceless.<br />
<br />
Ran into my guild leader on the way back to the bank and got re-invited to the guild. I'm telling you, there is nothing worse than having 55pp to your name and nothing to show for the 3000 you've spent....unless it's having your guildies joking about it....no, wait, that's not the worst. This is the worst.<br />
<br />
INSULT TO INJURY...<br />
I had to make another **** dairy spoon.<br />
<br />
THAT'S IT, SONY! YOU ARE ON MY LIST!!<br />
<br />
three thousand plat AND a dairy spoon. Of all the things to do to a poor defenseless cleric...<br />

<br />
I recognize both your names from around the boards and had no idea you were on vallon. nifty nifty. I have a leetle 6 DE Cleric that I putter around Nek Forest with, trying to find those silly cracked helms so i can write up a better noob gear quest for Denmother-sama. <br />
<br />
That would be nifty to be able to find a guild with actual tradeskillers. Somehow Nolyfe ended up in Obsidian Empire, and it's a behemoth, I feel so lost. ~_~ would not mind guild-switching at all. <br />
<br />
great to make your aquaintances, i feel honored. ^_^<br />
<br />
/comfort Nhin on the failure</div></div><hr />
