<br />
lv 10-25 go to buthcherblock moutains and kill goblins then sell there heads and blood watch out for crazed goblins there lvs 30-35 the heads and blood sell for 4 pp the blood is stackable(also the are enraged goblins that are 15+ i think)<br />
<br />
lvs 20-30<br />
go any where with spiders EC,F0B for instance and loot spider silk and spiderling silk then check the bazaar for how much they sell for(dont sell to NPC)<br />
<br />
<br />
15+also you can go to PC and loot armor there thats sells around 1-4 pp<br />

OK, this threw me for a loop.  For some reason, I thought the word had a completely different meaning and I started driving myself mad trying to remember it.  After quite a bit of mind-wracking and searching Google, I finally figured out why I was so confused.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Reed&quot; is either a plant or a vibrating piece of wood or plastic used in a musical instrument.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rede&quot; (I'd heard this term from BattleTech, if any of you catch the reference) is a Middle-English word that means &quot;advice&quot; or &quot;proverb&quot;; in some cases it is taken to mean &quot;guidelines&quot; or even &quot;laws&quot;.<br />
<br />
Sorry, just had to post after that bit of befuddlement on my part. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The problem is, you can't blackmail the people who have no shame. Unluckily for me, I am not one of those people. <br />
<br />
Luckily for me, I am not on Kiz's bad side. No, Kiz likes me. ^_^ <br />
<br />
<br />
Of course, he has absolutely nothing he could blackmail /me/ with. <br />
/nod. <br />
<br />
<br />
Lessee... All the 'mounds' of plat I aquired either came through gifts (friend gave me 21kp for my 21st birthday), or Baking (12+kp selling Halas while skilling up on it, before the TSUI), or having a chanter and selling mana vials and chanted metal (and neither gouging nor undercutting). <br />
Or just killing mobs and looting their cooling corpses and selling the stuff on em. <br />
<br />
<br />
Getting plat is not quick process. EQ is not meant to be played fast. Fortunes are not built in a day, etc etc. That's just how it is. Smile and take it. <br />

The problem there is, Piff never actually /develops/ any pictures she takes. Ever. So even if there /were/ pictures to be had of me, the likes of which you speak, which of course there are not, my roommate's laziness &gt; Noishpa. <br />
<br />
<br />
Unless you speak of the nek'd Iroke pics...  in which case posting those will get /you/ in trouble, not me. : P <br />

of course, I'll never be able to run for President anyway, will I ^_^<br />

<br />
WTS naked Iroke pics!!<br />
<br />
In all seriousness the best way to make money is to buy something for less than it's worth and sell it for more.  Perhaps that is obvious, but once I had 20k or so in the bank, I just lived off buying things that were undervalued.  I supplement this income with the Zek-only method of killing stupid people (10k off some guy who didn't QUITE get to the casino), as well as overcharging people for blessed fishing rods.<br />
<br />
The more relevant question IMHO is, what do I do with all this plat?  <br />
