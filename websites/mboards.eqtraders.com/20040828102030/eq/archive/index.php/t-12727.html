<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cerpicio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Enchanters are a lot of fun to play.  There are many things you can do just screwing around.  Minor Illusion is always fun to pull out while your group is medding or a guild is gathering for a raid.  All of the racial illusions are fun to play with, too.  Someone will make a comment about the &quot;cute gnome&quot; and I'll pull out the ogre or troll illusions.<br />
<br />
We can charm anything (ie. not limited to animals or undead).  I have my Preserved Chokodai Vocal Cords (clicky Voice Graft) for when I finally get Dire Charm.  We're supposed to be getting a &quot;doppleganger&quot; spell to turn us into whatever we have targetted.<br />
<br />
We can enchant things and make vials of mana for profit.  We can sit in PoK and cast buffs, too.  We don't have to worry about seperate CHA gear when buying from NPCs.<br />
<br />
I can get into any race's home town, which is fun for exploring.<br />
<br />
Crowd Control is fun.  Stopping a 60+ mob dead in its tracks is pretty impressive.  Saving the group from a bad pull is thrilling.<br />
<br />
Faction usually isn't a problem for us, either.  Got an uppity Erudite vendor?  One cast of Alliance and he's your best friend!<br />
<br />
I'm not saying Enchanters are the best class, but they seem to have a lot of potential for fun stuffs outside of groups and XPing.  I'm not as familiar with other classes, but I can't think of any that have so many &quot;extra-curricular activities.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Just sayin'<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">best feeling so far was aeing the newbie yard.  big and impressive.  lots of &quot;holy crap&quot; and &quot;omg&quot;.  :D though the voice graft and having a guard comment on anothers but would be cool.  can you have an npc run through quest dialogue with the voice graft?  have an sk agree to save the children or something.  make the pladin shout the praises of bertoxx.  that would be interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Silound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">DC a Freeport guard and have him shout some off hte wall stuff and attack other guards. Then Mez and blur the guards. fun stuff</div></div><hr />

Granted, I make a hella-ugly ogre, but that's the point. <br />
<br />
Oh, btw, Illusioning:Troll while in Rivervale DOES cause the guards to attack you, nevermind that they liked you before. And clicking off said illusion does not cause them to stop coming after you. <br />
<br />
<br />
I love being a chanter. They need to allow our bind wound skill to go above 100; this not-being-able-to-heal-thing is slaying the druid core of me. <br />
<br />
Druids and chanters, /nod. Who needs anything new? We got plenty o' fun with what we got. <br />

And clicking off said illusion does not cause them to stop coming after you.Actually that depends on how much they liked you to start.  Race just modifies your base faction a given amount, same as taking faction hits does.  If they love you enough to start then that adjustment won't make them kos.  If they are max ally you might even stay ally, depending on how much of a modifier that race has with them.  This is why people think some npcs &quot;see through&quot; illusion when a kos npc is still kos after becoming that race.  They don't see through it, they just hate you enough for your class, diety, and faction hits you've taken that they aren't any more tolerant of you.<br />

I love dinking around with my little enchanter! But the gnolls of Blackburrow totally kicked my butt when I tried mezzing multimob pulls, so she has stayed little. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
the point of the experiment was more about answering, 'if you click it off, do they still chase you?' Which is 'yes'. Hehe. <br />

My high elf enchanter can walk around unmolested in Oggok :-) Warmly to the guards (ally in Ogre form). :sing:</div></div><hr />

I found the other day that when in Illusion:Ogre, I can Slam.  <br />
<br />
How do you Slam when you are under an Ogre Illusion?  Do you suddenly get a new hotkey?  Isn't Slam triggered off a hotkey?<br />
<br />
What about Iksar Illusion, do you get the tail swipe? I've never noticed either of these.<br />
<br />
<br />
You may not look good as an ogre, but I've found I look great as a Guktan!  (And did you know, you can see over the top of your horse's head very easily when in Guktan Illusion? Very Handy.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cubwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ogre, Troll, and Barbarian illusions get Slam, you have to go to your hotkeys and create the key.<br />
<br />
Tail Swipe is a monk ability, so therefore an enchanter will not get it...</div></div><hr />

Wait - froglok eyes are in game?  Where the heck do they drop?</div></div><hr />

Life saver-&gt; Dark Elf illusion has saved my life soo many times in Overthere... everyone else in the group has to run from the goons but i can stand there and bat my pretty eyes.:angel: <br />

I plan to go to steamfont, and use mana till I get a clockwork spider pet, then put on my newbie armor (looks like leather) and tell people I'm the new gnome beastlord class. :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lyron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Reached 34 and tried it - couldn't summon a clockwork spider in either Steamfont or Ak'anon.  In steamfont I got 3 different types of drakes (gray, red and green - only the gray native to Steam), kobolds, harpies, minotaurs, and two different types of spiders (one not native to the zone).  I couldn't get clockwork spiders, rats, mechanical rats, mechanical gnomes, yellow recluse spiders, or any skeleton or elemental forms (elementals spawn in steamfont).<br />
<br />
Tried it in ak'anon - all I could get was something that looked like the earth pet.<br />
