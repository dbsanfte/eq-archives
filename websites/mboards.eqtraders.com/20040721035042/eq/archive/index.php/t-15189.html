<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Diani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last nite Chosen Heroes helped me get my 8th shawl. A small army of 23 people, avarage lvl of raid 53, had no problems with the encounters.<br />
<br />
Big thnx to all Chosen Heroes.<br />
<br />

I was wondering what the required force needed would be.  I've had the 7th shawl for over a year, although I took an extended break.  Came back and there are only like 5 people left in the guild.  <br />
<br />
Would a group of levels 60-65 be able to do this?  Breaking it down, we have 65 cleric, beastlord, and druid with tons of AA's, me a 62 ranger, another 60 ranger with EQ and working on AM, and either a 65 war or 61 necro.  Maybe be able to get a rogue and another cleric to help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thicket Tundrabog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A single group of 60+ might be able to do the Walk. A well-balanced single group of level 65 can certainly do it. My level 65 druid can tank any giant/wolf spawn except the named, and solo nuke it to death. I've got decent gear and AA, but am not uber by any means.<br />
<br />
The key to do doing the Walk is not doing anything dumb. Casting AE spells that aggro the general and lousy pet control are too common mistakes. Having a 'chanter memblur the General is excellent insurance against the 'oops, I didn't know that I shouldn't do that/I was AFK when the instructions were given' folks.<br />
