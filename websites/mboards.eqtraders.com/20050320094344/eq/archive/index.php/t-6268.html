<br />
I know this wouldn't work with that paticular clock, but there are clocks that will run backwards with the battery in backwards. My science teacher kept the battery in his clocks in backwards just to make us all think anytime we looked at the clock</div></div><hr />

A pack of batteries where bought specifically for that clock because it was the only nine-volt battery driven devise in the house and the &quot;convincing&quot; happened while she had the nine-volt in her hand and was about to change said battery.  :)<br />

She was better than another friend of mine though who fell for &quot;speaker bearings&quot;.  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morani</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A friend and I where &quot;complaining&quot; about people who try to pack their own speaker bearings without the right tools and proper training. That you can always tell when an amateur did it himself by the noise they make. I then sighted the example of the car that pulls up next to you with the stereo blasting and that near metallic buzzing when the base thumps (actually cased by the license plate vibrating against it's housing or the car itself). We carried on for about 5 minutes before ANOTHER friend blew it 'cause he could keep from laughing any more. We've also had discussions about how you can never tell if a person is just not using their turn signal or is out of blinker fluid. :D<br />
<br />
At one point I was in a school science fair and made up a fake ad for a fake &quot;sponsor&quot;. I don't remember the name I gave the company but it was advertised as an electron supplier who claimed to stock electrons from the 100 most common elements. There was an 800 number to call (the local electrical power company's phone number) and even a special of the month: &quot;Act now and we'll throw in an order of neutrons at no charge.&quot;  :D<br />
<br />
My friends and I in college almost set up a website for the Ideal Physics company, maker of massless metal, frictionless surfaces and (cough) totally rigid bodies.<br />
So how many orders and serious inquiries where there from universities/labs/scientists?</div></div><hr />

Cite. Spellchecker got the better of me on that one as I wasn't paying enough attention.<br />

Looks like I'm going to have to modify the old saying &quot;Nothing kills a joke better than having to explain it&quot; by adding &quot;or someone correcting your spelling/grammar.&quot;</div></div><hr />

According to a mechanic friend of mine, he said that often to people, who would always respond with &quot;How much is that gonna cost?&quot;<br />
<br />
I highly doubt the validity of his claims though.</div></div><hr />
