				 Q: Can you give us an idea of what new tradeskills to expect? Will this just be an expansion of the existing skills through new recipes, or will new skills and/or new ways to utilize old skills be added as well? <br />
<br />
RB: We’re not adding any new skills for this expansion, but there’s going to be a number of new recipes available. Specifically, Paul Carrico and Jason Mash are working on some new recipes that fill a few gaps in progression for fletching and smithing.

Smithing is one of the hardest trades to advance in.  And with the advent of EQ2 coming - I bet SOE wants to keep the interest alive in these tradeskills.<br />

I just hope these new recipes don't make things too easy, but rather soothe some of the pain for part of the journey.</div>

		<div>No way I want everything vendor sellable because then the uber folks chasing trade skills for quest rewards will all jump on it and flood the market with high level smiths.<br />
<br />
I would rather they put a path in that would allow us to earn XP at the same time we hunt the components.  I would never mind Shadowscream if I were earning XP and maybe even a bit of minor loot at the same time.  The tedious part of the Shadowscream or even anything requiring windstones is killing thousands upon thousands of low level, no xp, trivial loot mobs.  Where is the fun in that?  The only time it was fun was when you had an AOE type person to assist and you played games seeing who could get the biggest train going.<br />
<br />
Give us a mid 50 to 60 skill path that would allow us to earn xp at the same time as we gather components.  This killing level 7 to level 20 mob over and over and over again for 300 to 400+ hours crap is for the birds.<br />
<br />
I had no problem with tailoring even as hard as the 158+ skill up was pre-ribbons because I could gain xp as I went up.  Now that I am higher level and the xp for hoppers totally sucks, I am not as keen on it though.  I dont mind hunting AC at all though because xp is only a bit less than decent.  <br />
<br />
I would hate to see another vendor bought method though, so the rich could just buy their way into it. :(  Make the components drop off the higher level mobs too, so they have a viable xp/skillup route.<br />
<br />
Heck add in the trivial code and make it drop off mobs of multiple levels so there are camps for everyone to gain xp while they gather and hunt for their components.  I think it sucks we can either XP OR go farm components, but we can't do both at the same time.</div>

		<div>The old Deathsteel weapons come to mind as something to revive and re design for a post 188 route. Currently the weapons require Mt. Death Mineral Salts and Grinning Goblin Brew for temper components. Now, we all knew that the reason Deathsteel really wasn't a good route to take was because the salts sold so well for Chardok faction. Therefore, make soemthing else drop that is part of the temper instead of salts, or make something drop a temper period. &quot;Death Goblin Blood&quot; sounds like a good temper that could drop. And make the parts have a fairly high drop rate. This allows a post 188 way that aslo gives xp to farmers AND if it's easy enough, will draw high level farming classes off SS, leaving it for the lower level smiths and those who cannot farm well. Perhaps a *slight*, and by that I mean half a hair's worth, nerf to the SS components drop rate, just to encourage high level smiths to take the Deathsteel route instead of farmng SS parts...<br />

		<div>The SS drop rate is already Appauling. If there is more than 1 person there to farm bears or wolves it is horrid. I spent 5 hours AOE'ing with a 56 druid there and only got an average of 1 essence off every 10-15 mobs. For my entire time (5 hours) I was only able to get 32 of each essence. Any Nerf to that would cause me to go into the poor house to make it to 250. Already the Blessed Full Mithrial items are selling for BARELY more than the componant costs on Tunare.<br />
<br />
I am hoping for either a Store bought or another SS like item that might have some use this time. <br />

With the way LDoN works, you can't really farm low level mobs.  The difficulty of the dungeon is established to roughly correspond to the level of the group involved (although you might get interesting results if you included a level 65 warrior in a group that was otherwise all level 20).  Further, since the dungeons are instanced, you don't have to worry about competing for drops against anyone except members of your own group.</div>

That's what they did with tainted planar essence, remember.  Imagine if tainted essence was the only drop for a triv 218 smithing recipe.</div>

You can farm windstones while getting XP in Grimling forest outside Acrylia Caverns as well is in Umbral Plains.

I have never, ever seen a windstone drop in Grimling Forest, and I spent quite a few hours farming the mines there both before and after the change, and a huge number of hours doing the camp battles.  It's possible they're simply very rare, (as they are in all other locations where they drop) but that's not any better - very rare drops make for incredibly infrequent skillups from those drops and/or silly prices in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Which means even more farming.<br />

I had just the opposite experience.   I just went to the caves in the NW corner of Grimling Forest just a week ago and within the first 15 minutes had 3 Windstones drop.   I was beginning to think they were common drops there.   But 3 was all that dropped and the rest of the 3 hours spent there (although deeper in)  did not produce any more of them.  Guess I just got lucky with the 3.<br />
<br />
They were at the first &quot;T&quot; intersection in the mines that lead to the Acrylia Caverns.<br />
<br />
PS - I just love that Grimling that looks like Bob Marley!  Dreadlocks and all - ROFLMAO<br />

		<div>I _lived_ in Umbral Plains for more than six months.  Long enough to loot a Dathor Great Hammer, a drop so rare that there are a ton of people saying it no longer drops.  It does.  Oooh...maybe every six months or so?<br />
<br />
Relevance?  With constant killing there of the mobs that drop them, I got very few windstones the whole time.   And I mean huge hours per week, more than a sane person needs, two-boxing my 60 monk and 60 shaman(very well, thank you).  Doing Umbral as a way to get windstones is extremely foolish.  Do ANYTHING but, and then sell the results and use them to buy windstones, maybe.</div>

		<div>In my experiance i DEFINATLY DO NOY WANT  smithing to be vendor bought until 250.  What I would like to see is more options other than acrylia and windstones available till 250.<br />
<br />
I would definatly like to see an improvement in the weapons that are smithable, making them comparable with uberness of the tae ew armor that we can make.  Being able to tell your guildies &quot; Look what I just made&quot; is one of the best things about trdeskilling:)  <br />
<br />
Final note, having to farm stuff, increases the value of the end product, and also helps create a sub economy for the items that are farmed.  If you dont like farming, stuff will always be available in the bazaar for those willing to pay:)<br />

		<div>ummm what do you mean they are dead? i'm busting my furry butt trying to get skill ups. oh by the way i just trivialed on fineplate so i'm really happy.  i don't see what you're complaining aobut. there are a lot of recipies that are too outrgous to buy in baz to make, not just smithing. hell i'd be happy if i could get my tailoring to 200...i relaly don't wanna make acrylia armor. takes too much time and i'm not that interested in raising it. <br />
<br />
windstones for points is aobut as good as that shaded armor for tailoring. its too hard ot get the supplies and the resell isn't worth it<br />
