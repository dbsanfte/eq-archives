<br />
*  I stopped drinking Coca Cola after I found out that it's good for removing toilet stains.<br />
 <br />
<br />
*  I stopped going to the movies for fear of sitting on a needle infected with AIDS.<br />
 <br />
<br />
*  I smell like a dog since I stopped using deodorants because they cause cancer.<br />
 <br />
<br />
* I don't leave my car in the parking lot or any other place and sometimes I even have to walk about 7 blocks for fear that someone will drug me with a perfume sample and try to rob me.<br />
 <br />
<br />
*  I also stopped answering the phone for fear that they ask me to dial a stupid number and then I get a phone bill from hell with calls to Uganda, Singapore and Tokyo.<br />
 <br />
<br />
*  I stopped consuming several foods for fear that the estrogens they contain may turn me gay.<br />
 <br />
<br />
*  I also stopped eating chicken and hamburgers because they are nothing other than horrible mutant freaks with no eyes or feathers that are bred in a lab so that places like McDonalds can sell their Big Macs.<br />
 <br />
<br />
*  I also stopped drinking anything out of a can for fear that I will get sick from the rat feces and urine.<br />
 <br />
<br />
*  I think I'm turning gay because when I go to parties, I don't look at any girl no matter how hot she is, for fear that she will take my kidneys and leave me taking a nap in a bathtub full of ice.<br />
 <br />
<br />
*  I also donated all my savings to the Amy Bruce account.  A sick girl that was about to die in the hospital about 7,000 times.  Funny that girl, she's been 7 since 1993...<br />
 <br />
<br />
*  I went bankrupt from bounced checks that I made expecting the $15,000 that Microsoft and AOL were supposed to send me when I participated in their special e-mail program.<br />
 <br />
<br />
*  My Ericcson phone never arrived and neither did the passes for a paid vacation to Disneyland.<br />
 <br />
<br />
*  But I am positive that all this is the cause of a stinking chain that I broke or forgot to follow and I got a curse from hell.<br />
 <br />
<br />
IMPORTANT NOTE: <br />
 If you send this e-mail to at least 1200 people in the next <br />
10 seconds, a bird will crap on you today at 7pm.</div></div><hr />
