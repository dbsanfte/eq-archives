<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>violeteyes1337</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just finished up getting 150 by finishing up filets in cream.... my goal is to start making halas10lb as soon as possible and as cheaply as possible how can I do this and not spend 100s of pp  note. I am not afraid of doing one combine up to 250.... if its at least semi cheap...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>violeteyes1337</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">and I dont have GoD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Buttonz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you are in a decent guild, and or lvl 62+ you could work on Jord Meat Pies, Vann Toe soup from BoT, and if you are PoTactics flagged you could use the Boar meat from down in the pit. All of which are very simple combines. Have your guildmates/friends save you the meats as they drop quite frequently during exp sessions in both zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You could also get someone to bring you back a few dozen stacks of Ground Pepper from GoD...<br />
<br />
That's the only part you need for Beer Batter... the Hynid/Cragbeast/Tuna/Crab meats you can find on vendors still, usually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nanndas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Patty Melts will take you to 191. Go to JPF and buy the cheese required. I bought it 1/2 a backpack at a time. I parked my Druid there and purchased what I needed and then put it in the shared bank..<br />
<br />
Nan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Faerwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">MTP's MTP's MTP's.... it sucks until you get the recipe in your list, then it's cake.  I did from 170 to 225 in a couple hours once I got started.  Assuming you can snag a stack of brownie meat and tons of veggies and a small amount of fruit from the bazaar.  Think the brownie parts ran me 200, and guildees gave me 20 stacks of veggies, total cost was probably under 2k (and I made about 20 stacks of MTP's that I gave away, which could have sold for 10pp each)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Either patty melts or pasta until 191 man.  Pasta is cheaper, but requires farming/foraging for eggs to make noodles. Patty melts can be all store purchased but requires the nonstick frying pan (smithed or get one in bazaar) and the cheese is annoyingly only found in JPF, whereas the meat and bread is found in Thurgadin.<br />
<br />
Then do your HMPs to 220.  They sell fairly well in baz for 3-5pp each and at skill 191 + geerlock you're near effective triv so you'll get lots of successes.<br />
<br />
Then either PoP (Jord meat, Vann Toes, Mephit Meat, Boar Meat) or MTPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>branagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Easiest way i found to get over 200 was using Storm Salmon.  Fairly easy to fish up stacks of them, and I think you can get to around 210 using them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">IF you can Forage and IF you can hunt successfully in Jaggedpine and IF you're not in a hurry, you can make 250 in JPF making Veggie, Griff and Anaconda Casseroles. <br />
<br />
This route is slow as Christmas, but it's dirt cheap and almost zero competition for the drops. You'll run out of mana long before you run out of targets; and I've sold countless meats and forages for 25pp each after I got to 250.</div></div><hr />

What is &quot;geerlock&quot;? Something to increase your Baking skill?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Froondor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What is &quot;geerlock&quot;? Something to increase your Baking skill?<br />
<br />
A Geerlok is a tinkered item held in primary slot while doing a tradeskill which increases skill by 5%. Each tradeskill has a different Geerlok: e.g. Geerlok All Purpose Baking Utensil, Geerlok Automated Hammer, Geerlok Gem Setter.<br />
<br />
On Tarew Marr I see them in Bazaar for 50pp to 1000pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">And, as stated about 40 billion times in other posts, as well as the FAQ, a Geerlok does not increase you chances for a skillup. It only increases your chances for a successful combine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BUT as was recently released from the Faire, you have greater odds of skillup when you succeed, or when the triv is closer to your skill.  So it does indeed increase your chance of a successfull combine and thus an increased chance of skillup, and it will increase sellback profits.<br />
<br />
AND<br />
<br />
If you had READ my post, you would have seen that I suggested a geerlok for successes so you would have more HMPs to sell, which it DOES do for you at skill 191 from patty melts.</div></div><hr />
