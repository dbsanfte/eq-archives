<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Memadil</div><div class="date">01-18-2003, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When the recipe was first implemented and VERY few people could make acrylia studded they did sell like hotcakes.  I helped a friend for weeks straight getting skill to 158 so we could attempt combines.  Once we started making them we couldn't keep them in stock.  We were selling cloaks for 2500 and tunics for 3k (other pieces raged from 1500-250).  This was all before the bazaar was created (grrrrrrrrrrrr).  The first week bazaar was about the prices dropped 1k on everything.  We quit messing with it anymore after that.  Now prices are around 700-900 range on cloaks last time i checked :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meirril</div><div class="date">01-18-2003, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On Fennin Ro the &quot;price&quot; of an acrylia studded cloak is about 900pp.<br />
<br />
I say about 900pp because I've seen a few people sell them for 700pp, most sell for 900pp, and I price mine at 1k. You'd think I'd never sell any at 1k. I sell ALL of my cloaks. It takes a bit longer (average selling time is 4 days per cloak.), I could sell more if I charged less (probably alot more), but I make a comfortable proffit at 1k. About 300pp per cloak (I usualy end up buying all the Acrylia, and I have a small supply of rockhopper hides I use and ocasionaly a friend will hand me a few hides to pay me off for giving them a cloak or some other tailored item. Most haven't repaid me, but what the heck, their friends after all. Occasionaly I buy hides when I can find them for less than 100pp. I haven't bought any for months as the price keeps going up.) That 300pp of proffit takes care of any loss I get from the occasional failure and still leaves a few coin for other things. I don't feel bad about charging more than others. My price is based on what I WANT to sell the cloak for. If anyone meets my price they have a cloak, if not then I'll have one of these for a new alt, or more likely for when a friend wants one (or the very rare gift to a newbie. I'm reluctant to give away something I made to a complete stranger instead of something that I got from random hunting somewhere.)<br />

Well, hope my rambling post dosen't upset too many people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrron</div><div class="date">01-19-2003, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On Vazaelle I sell them for 750pp.  I have seen them as low as 600 on some people, but I've never had problems selling at 750.  I have noticed that they do not sell well above 800.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pockets FullOfGold</div><div class="date">01-20-2003, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">because I farm all of my ingredients, and I make a few hundred PP per Acrylia Stud while farming Acrylia in TM, I don't really worry about selling Acrylia Studded Tunics or Acrylia Studded Cloaks at the going rate in the Bazaar.  If I get a tell from someone asking for me to make them a Tunic or a Cloak and I gather the components, I sell it to them for 200 PP.  I do know the going rate for the Cloaks is 800 PP on The Rathe server.<br />
<br />
I made 2 Tunics for someone yesterday and he gave me 4 PP for the Paeala Tannin I had to make for the combines.  He gave me all the other components.  I really didn't look to even take that 4 PP but he felt he should do something for me since I did the combine.<br />

Terris has a lot of high level tailors and the market is pretty well saturated with all types of player made items.  Items that people make for skill-ups you can't give away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sir0die</div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, my tailoring was 155 (cloaks triv 188),  I wanted it for myself(my cloak had no wis bonus on it). i went broke buying the stuff to make one. i finally scrounged and had all the materials in my sewing kit, geerlock equiped, mouse poised over the combine button, fingers crossed, eyes closed....................................click...  .........................................<br />
<br />
<br />
lo and behold, what was that dangling on my mouse pointer, but my Cloak. Not only was it a successfull combine............but i got a skill up on it also! That +10 really makes a difference, before my wis was 202, but when i equip geerlocks my wis would drop down to 197. Now it's 212 and drops down to 207. Stay above the 200 mark has made a noticable difference.<br />
<br />
This was the first self made item that was actually an upgrade to anything i was wearing. I've handed stuff down to mules that were naked, but an actuall self upgrade, NICE.</div></div><hr />
