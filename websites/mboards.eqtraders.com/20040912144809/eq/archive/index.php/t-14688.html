<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Akanae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm sorry if this has been posted before, I did a search for it and didnt come up with any results.<br />
<br />
I cant get smoked hero parts, spiced hero parts, or hero sandwhiches into the new baking UI. I have done sucessful combines and got the &quot;you have learned x recipie&quot; messages on all 3.<br />
<br />
But I cant get them to show up on any searches or lists in the UI so I can add them to my favorites! <br />
<br />
Is anyone else having this problem? Are they just not letting us add the popular recipies to our favorites?<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had this exact problem last night.  Here is what I found.<br />
<br />
I first combined the Smoked and Spiced Hero parts in my Collapsible Spit, then I made a Hero Sandwich in my spit, all in experiment mode.  After each success (one of each), I learned the recipe.  Then I opened the spit in the new UI and searched for &quot;Hero&quot;, but got nothing.<br />
<br />
I then went to the Oven in PoK.  Without doing any manual combines, I searched for &quot;Hero&quot;, and all three recipes appeared.  I was able to select them and combine as normal.<br />
<br />
I double checked my collapsible spit, and they just weren't showing up there.<br />
<br />
I believe this is a known bug (or at least, a symptom of one).  Maddoc and Tanker have stated that the list of recipes that you can learn and search for is continuously being updated, so I suggest we wait until the next (major) patch for them to sort all this out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think this is a common problem they are working on.  Same as with recipies not showing up in the Faydark Fletching Kit. (havnt checked lately to see if fixed).  It doesnt hurt to point out these problems though.</div></div><hr />
