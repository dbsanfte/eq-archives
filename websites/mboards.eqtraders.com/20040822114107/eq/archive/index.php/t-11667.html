<br />
I'm currently working on a Foraging &quot;guide&quot;. <br />
<br />
The first section lists all the foraged items alphabetically with all their information.<br />
<br />
I also have a second section that lists the drops by zone.<br />
<br />
One comment I received was that it would be nice to include hyperlinks for the foraged items. <br />
<br />
I can't think of a better place to hyperlink to than your fine site.<br />
<br />
So, what process do I have to go through in order to receive permission to hyperlink to your site? <br />
<br />
Currently the working section format is basically a copy of your foraging page, with links included. The source material is acknowledged at the bottom of the list.<br />
<br />
Anything else I can / can not or should / should not be doing?<br />
<br />
Please feel free to contact me at ceinwein@shaw.ca</div></div><hr />
