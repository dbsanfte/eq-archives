A level 49 Ranger swears to me he has his Brewing at 210, Baking at 205, and Fletching at 202 RAW skill without geerloks.  He says the only geerlock he even owns is for Brewing.  He also said he reached those levels in the past week.<br />
<br />
Can anyone see if this is really possible at this time?</div></div><hr />

Multiple characters is the only way, I would think, unless AA points were opened up to pre-51 levelled characters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No, he said it is all on one toon and no aa  ::shrug::</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ask for a screenshot :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>tsbaity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Then he is mistaken. No way you can have more than 201+ on more than one of the main seven tradeskills on one character prior to level 51.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aeryl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There is one possible way and that's if the person was 51 or higher and purchased the AAs, then was de-leveled to 49 and got the skill-ups.  I really doubt that's the case here though, I think the ranger is pulling your leg.</div></div><hr />

If indeed he did this he would have the title of Baron for having 6 aa in general abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aeryl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No one said that he didn't, but yeah that would be an easy way to check that possibility.  Although I play with names totally off for any raid or only first names showing for anything else.  So it's not necessarily something the original poster would have noticed right off the bat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I actually have 300 Fletching skill, 450 Tracking skill, 12000 unbuffed HP and im next in line for being the Pope.<br />
<br />
And no, i wont show you screenshots.<br />
<br />
People lie just to look impressive and sucker people into talking about them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Let me try this again :)<br />
<br />
Yes, it is possible that the person who made the claims was not being truthful.  Although he has no real reason to lie to me about it, especially given the context of the conversation.  While I (my alt actually) have grouped with him several times, he did not know I was into tradeskills, and we were just chatting about how boring/frustrating it is waiting to find a group.  His casual comment was that he was so bored, he had been working on tradeskilling and mentioned his stats.  OF COURSE I told him that was impossible, and even gave him an out to save face by saying .. oh you mean with a geerlok equipped.  <br />
<br />
I am not new to tradeskills; I know that it is SUPPOSED to be impossible to have more that one tradeskill over 200 unless you are level 51+ and have invested AA into NTCM.  However, as a Druid who currently has a Tracking skill of 130 out of a possible 125 (with no AA invested in it), I also know that it IS possible for skill caps to be bugged.<br />
<br />
I do not know for sure what the situation is here.  I posted about it in hopes someone would be able to test it, as opposed to just dismissing it on face value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hmm, yeah, if he had previously levelled past 51, gotten the three skills over 200 and then de-levelled (lots of unrezzed deaths) or let a necro sacrifice him down to level 49, that would certainly be another valid explanation.<br />
<br />
No one is questioning YOU Auricula, but while you might think he has no reason to lie to you, doesn't mean he didn't.  Some people get their kicks out of the weirdest or most inane things.<br />
<br />
Basically, the only proof I'd accept would be if he gave me his account info, I logged on and verified that he had no AAs, 3 skills over 200 on the same character, and the character was level 49.  (Screenshots can be doctored)<br />
Since that's not gonna happen, I'll stick with my opinion that he's pulling your leg...<br />
<br />
And if it really is true, then perhaps he is using a 3rd party program to exploit, such as those programs that allow people to give themselves Bard speed, warp to any coordinates, etc...in which case, divulging this abberation of his  wasn't a really smart move, was it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Qedin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have baking or brewing at 199 or so and smithing at 219 and have no TS aaxps.  Ill test it out and see if its bugged.  It very well could be bugged the way this game is goin these days lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If he's not lying, he's most likely not the original owner of the account and has been sacrificed to a necro. He'd still be at least baron.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here (http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/forums/showthread.php?t=7002) is a thread that talks about the Druid tracking skill cap being buggy for a short while.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I have a level 49 Baron.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was true of Tracking for druids and bards (and perhaps rangers?)<br />
This was true for some of the Secondary Forte aa that allowed casters to raise a 2nd specialization.<br />
It does not seem unlikely that the same bug would affect New Tanaan Crafting Mastery as well.<br />

<br />
Actually the Secondary Forte bug was that you could go over the 100 max, but you still had to have the AA ability to go from 50 to 100...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Could be a Bug... If the Character was a Rogue or a Gnome it is possible to have 2 skills over 200 (Rogue Poison making and Gnome tinkering) the Class or Racial Skills do not count tward the only 1 skill over 200.<br />
<br />
My Friend did Poison all the way to 250 then started Brewing and we thought he could not get beyond 200... Well he did not pay attention and got brewing to 201 before he knew it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It is possible that he had his character deleted by a GM and restored. <br />
<br />
Recently I had a friend who had this happen to them. When they logged on ALL there skills where maxed and they had every spell from 1 to current level. Plus there current AA they was working on was giving.<br />
<br />
But that being said, he is not claiming all of his tradeskills are maxed so unsure...<br />
<br />
So possible, but very @#$@ unfair.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">That's possible. GM-flagged characters are max in all tradeskills. They don't have AA, since they don't want GMs with titles hehe. If a character was restored and logged on by a GM, it's possible that it was mistakenly GM flagged or bugged somehow in regards to tradeskills.</div></div><hr />

I agree that it's possible that he managed to skill up when a bug was present in the game.<br />
<br />
Rangers were not included in the tracking 'bug'. Personally I'm hoping they 'fix' the people who have their tracking higher than it was suppose to go. Fading Memories/Exodus and better than Ranger tracking make for too easy scouting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Silound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Interesting thing I tried. <br />
<br />
Used a friends monk who was 51 with baron title. Had him saced back down to 50, he still had the title. Took his 52 necro who had title as well, killed him back to 50, he didn't keep title. Unusual in a way. Note that niether character is ever played, he's currently infatuated with a ranger.</div></div><hr />
