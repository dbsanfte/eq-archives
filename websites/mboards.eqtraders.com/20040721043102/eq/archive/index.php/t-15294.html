<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Emptybuckets</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone help me out, here?  I just recently got my brewing skill to 248, and want to do some of the LDoN brews.  But I haven't seen a single brewing drop besides Sand Verbena... any ideas which LDoNs to hunt in to find these?  Specifically, lookin' fer venemous leech, to make the ancient deathbrewed wine.  Any of them would be helpful though.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Slime covered Planarians (from another LDoN recipe) are fished in Deeper Guk zones, so you may want to try fishing in one of the zones to see if you find a few leeches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Venomous Leeches are in the game because I had some a long time ago.  I do think they were fished in a Deepest Guk adventure.    I remember submitting a list of items I fished there, but the information got eaten in the great database crash a few months back :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Emptybuckets</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wow - you have to do a ldon and spend the time there FISHING?  Huh.  I guess I'll have to see if I can get my guild to go there and let me hang back and fish while they go beat the crap outta everything, heh.  :boggled:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">After you complete an adventure, the instance stays up for 30 minutes.  Thats 30 minutes of fishing for you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Emptybuckets</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just use regular bait when I fish there, and no lures, or will something help me fish more specific items?</div></div><hr />
