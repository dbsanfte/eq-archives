<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sigrah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The robes in question:<br />
<br />
Robe of Immaculate Air - Robe of the Oracle<br />
Robe of Primordial Waters - Robe of the Kedge<br />
Robe of Eternal Fire - Red version of Ice Silk Robe (aka, the Banana robe)<br />
Robe of Ancient Earth - Brown version of the newbie robe<br />
<br />
So why is it that the Air and Water robes got decent graphics while the Fire and Earth robes are so plain?  Would it have killed things to give the Robe of Eternal Fire the &quot;Crimson Robe of Adeline&quot; look and the Robe of Ancient Earth the &quot;Shining Metallic Robe&quot; look, or something else fancy?  I hate that 2 of the best tailored robes in the game look plain, not to mention I really hate getting tells from people who like the stats but won't wear either because &quot;they look bad&quot; and therefore don't want to buy either.  I really wish SoE would get their heads out of their rears and stop giving good items common or poor graphics.  Anyways, gripe done.<br />

I don't think of it as a poor look, but rather as understated elegance, as is found in only the most exclusive of boutiques.</div></div><hr />
