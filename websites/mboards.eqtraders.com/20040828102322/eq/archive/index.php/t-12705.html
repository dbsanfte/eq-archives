<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Robintun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was doing some skilling up last night with gems that were dropping for me while farming. I made a Golden Pearl Choker with non-enchanted gold bar (no stats, just purdy) and I noticed the end product said that usual line from the components &quot;this item is used in tradeskills&quot;. I looked it up on the recipes page and it is used in no recipes. Is this just an error in the visual for the Golden Pearl Choker or is it acutally used in some trade skill recipes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So far there have been no reports of the Golden Pearl Choker as the component of another recipe.<br />
<br />
But it could be used as an item in a Quest Combination (put it and other items into a Quest Container and hit combine). It is believed those are considered &quot;Recipes&quot; by EQ.<br />
<br />
Or it may be used in a recipe that has yet to be discovered.</div></div><hr />
