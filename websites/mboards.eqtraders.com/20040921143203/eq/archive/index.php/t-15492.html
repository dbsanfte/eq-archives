<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Soulfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Did anyone notice today that mobs were all hiding underground?<br />
<br />
I went to NK and no mobs to be seen, all had to be pbae'd up to the surface to be killed :(<br />
<br />
So pisses me off that they rushed to upgrade to DX9.0 without fully testing it :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Im so glad i play a ranger. Track, snare. Mobs are ALL MINE! MUAHAHAH!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was playing a ranger today in East and North Karanas on Stromm and was totally flumoxed when I repeatedly kept tracking trees. I tried zoning, camping and even a total reboot but no matter what I did I could see no moving mobs and everytime I tracked a moving mob I ended up at a tree.<br />
<br />
My suspicious were confirmed when I watched a single gorge hound wandering around totally on it's own. I followed it and as it touched a tree it appeared to catch, then suddenly warped over one side of the zone. Still on tracking and targetted I found it again and watched it do this a second time. Then on the thhird time the gorge hound totally disappeared but the tracking told me it was inside the tree.<br />
<br />
Can't help but come to the conclusion that there has been an almighty.......... mistake made with the latest modification to teh collision system and all the roaming mobs are getting stuck inside trees.<br />
<br />
Here's hoiping that there is a roll back on the hurryup or else today's farming effort is a a total bust.</div></div><hr />

Playing in POJ things were normal I was hunting Sentries, and one of them while doing the death-march came to a tunnel intersection.  Instead of going straight or turning, it aimed straight for the corner itself and poofed.  I checked down both paths with no luck, and could not cast spells on it.  It obviously reappeared somewhere, since a few Gaolers came chasing after me about a minute later (54sec), although I never did see that sentry again (when I zoned&amp;came back, the hallway where it paths was void of sentries).</div></div><hr />

Not the areas I'm used to soloing in.  I'm aware that the problems with the raiders pathing has been a long-time problem, but lately all sorts of mobs have now have been spawning underground and have been &quot;warping&quot; that didn't used to.  There's a thread about it in one of the druid forums: most noticibly the frogs that are a common solo (and never used to do this) are now doing it too.  So maybe it's better to say that more Plane of Storms mobs are doing it than before.<br />

Say youre tracking 'a spiderling'...<br />
<br />
A spiderling is straight ahead.<br />
(take 1 step forward)<br />
A spiderling is behind you.<br />
/tar a_spiderling (put underscores where spaces are)<br />
Hey! Keen!<br />
/cast snare<br />
Bingo.</div></div><hr />

Bingo.  You cannot see your target. <br />
:(<br />
At least that's what I tend to get, since my offensive spells (pal, mag) require Line-of-sight, which most &quot;stuck&quot; mobs don't seem to want to provide...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We had an experience where we got a runner in one of the eyeless worms in PoJ caves. Fearing the worst we braced ourselves for the train he'd bring back. But he seemed to have gotten stuck someplace out of the world since we never saw him again in the next 3 hours and the spot where he popped didn't have another mob in all the time we were there. Our ranger had him targetted for a good while and he didn't depopped accoding to the ranger, just slowly regened and stayed gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Furyrpied</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">if you know that a mob is 'right there' but it's stuck in a tree/wall/what ever do this<br />

Just a.... it will target the nearest thing that starts with an a<br />

Like<br />
a spiderling<br />
an ebon drakeling<br />
<br />
Then attack!<br />
<br />
This is how i hunted in Misty Thicket while the 'issue' was occouring.<br />
<br />
:)  also helps with those LDoN 'whirlwind' type mobs that are hard to target to loot them.<br />
<br />
/target a<br />
/loot<br />
<br />
Works like a charm!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Good point and thanks for that idea Furyrpied.<br />
<br />
As a chanter I tend to end up being made ML most runs but in LDoN Mistmoore I have huge problems targetting corpses that are stuck under cobwebs especially the harvesters (whirlwinds) which have targetable areas so small it almost impossible to loot them if they fall on floors covered in cobwebs.<br />
<br />
That solution should solve most of my problems with this - cheers =)</div></div><hr />

the gorge has been screwed up like this for over 3 months (so not related to the recent snafu), and i finally gave up /petitioning, /bugging, /and /feedbacking some time ago, as it was falling on deaf ears.</div></div><hr />

Could be worse...We were heading over to the temple in PoE and 3 of the 3 Triumverates from the Stone Ring jumped us from their hiding spot in the wall ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Those triumvirates of soil are from dust ring, not rock.<br />
<br />
Dust is a funky ring, our first attempt we got about 40 blue con adds on the Pristine Warder (and wiped at 0% even after a necro lifeburned at 0%), and then last night we just got 3 red con Triumvirate of Soil adds (same mobs as the second wave of the ring event, though they didn't spawn another warder after they died)</div></div><hr />

The Gorge is massively fubared. I ran the entire gorge 4 or 5 times and saw only 7 mobs over a half hour (with one other person in zone, who was killing at the Evil Eye altar).</div></div><hr />

<br />
This technique won't help much in Plane of Storms cause it'll get you killed if it works, but otherwise it can be useful.  Track the mob you're after and determine to within a few feet the spot where it is trapped.  Then get someone with a PBAoE spell (clerics, druids who can do the tracking themselves, chanter stuns MAY work not sure) and have them cast it in the area.  Wherever those mobs are, in Innothule at least, it kills them all and drops them back into reality.<br />

I haven't been able to get on much recently so I haven't experienced the problem in Karanas etc. but someone may want to try it.<br />

Wth the right puller, this will work in PoS too.  Takes a brave druid , though.   Or a druid/wizard with AoE snare.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, In PoStorms, everything is KoS to wolf form.    Group a monk/sk/something  with a druid/ranger, have the druid share wolf form, and have the monk run past the area you've tracked all the baddies to.<br />
<br />
Just make sure they can run hella-fast.   With the right puller, you can not die this way.<br />
