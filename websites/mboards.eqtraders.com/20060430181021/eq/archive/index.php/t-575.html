<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">myrdale</div><div class="date">12-08-2002, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well thanks to my guild, i finally gat my 7th shawl *Cheers* . But it is a little bitter sweet because now i gat to start getting smithing up. I use to smith ALONG time ago and gat it up to 129 going through the long list of lanterns, scalers, pots, sewing kits, etc.<br />
<br />
It looks like i will be making Ornate Chain and Fine Steel Armor from here on out. I am trying to figure out the best path to take. Here is what i have so far, (assuming my math is right). The prices below are just the price for ore. I did not worry about priceing patterns and molds even though they vary from 1pp or so up to i think 7pp. Also i did not include the price of padding since i can make that myself.<br />
<br />
Item---------------Skill--------------Price (In PP)               <br />
Ornate Coif -------132------------------19 <br />
Ornate Tunic------142------------------28.25<br />
E. Sleeves---------135------------------21.3<br />
E. Mail -------------148 -----------------30.55<br />
G. Mantle-----------135-----------------29.7<br />
G. Coif ------------146 -----------------29.7<br />
G. Mail -------------155-----------------38.95<br />
All Platnium Ornate   N/A<br />
FS Bracer ---------168------------------21.9<br />
FS Helm -----------179 -----------------43.8<br />
FS Brestplate ------188 ----------------65.6<br />
<br />
From my best judgement i am Looking at...<br />
<br />
Ornate Coif - 132 - 19pp<br />
E. Sleeves   - 135 - 21.3pp<br />
<br />
G. Coif       -  146 - 29.7pp<br />
FS Bracer    - 168 -  21.9pp<br />
<br />
FS Helm      - 179 -  43.8pp<br />
FS BP         -  188 -  65.7pp<br />
<br />
Does this look like the best path to take or is there a better one. Also should i skip the Gold Ornate Coif altogether being that it is almost 10pp higher than the FS Bracer. Thanks guys for your help. Oh and does anyone have a rough idea of ABOUT how much it will cost. I spent 100pp on 5 attempts of the Ornate Coif and gat one skill up. Just looking for a round about figure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ishwar</div><div class="date">12-08-2002, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have not done the math, but conventional wisdom is.<br />
<br />
EO bracer 128<br />
GO bracer 135<br />
GO (2 ring stuff) 146<br />
FS Visor 163<br />
<br />
<br />
Most people do Gold bracer over Electum sleeves, because it is so small difference in price, and quite a bit easier to to the one ring bracer, especially if it saves restocking the HQ merchant. <br />
The chain paterns do actually cost up to several pp, so you should include them in calculations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nizanko</div><div class="date">12-08-2002, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The sellback (to merchants) on ornate chain is about two-thirds what the storebought component price is.  If you're buying your HQ ore instead of farming it, that means you're costing yourself about 11 plat per gold sleeve success, for example.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the sellback for fine plate is right around the price for components (a hair more on some items, a bit less on others).  Ultimately, that means the best time to switch is where your failure rate on fine plate balances out with the low sellback on ornate chain.<br />
<br />
According to my calculations, using formulas that have appeared on these boards in the past, you should probably switch to doing fine plate around gold bracers (135) if you don't have a geerlok.  Since the formulas are linear, you can switch earlier if you do have a geerlok.<br />

Take a look at the prices link, everything is laid out in a handy table that should help sort what the best priced piece is for each step along the way. It worked for me.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jonwin</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My skill is not as high as the questioners, but this has been my path so far.<br />
I make only collars and bracers as they have the cheapest patterns and only use one ring. I went from s, e, and am working on gold collars at 127  skill.  <br />
Therefore my advice, unless you have the piece sold, make what is cheapest, using a few components as possible. I will switch over to FP once I reach 135 for that reason.</div></div><hr />
