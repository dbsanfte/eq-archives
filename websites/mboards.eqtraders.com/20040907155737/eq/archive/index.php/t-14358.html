<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krexel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">At 175 smithing I can make all of the compenents easily for the Underfoot Plate armor.  I am hoping to find a GM smith on Xev and pay him/her to make me the armor.  To aid in the endeavor I wanted to enough of all the ingredients to cover normal failures.<br />
<br />
What I would like to know what the normal failure rates for the Underfoot Plate bracers is (its listed as a triv of 335). <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 206-222 (+5%), I've generally had a average success rate of almost perfectly 1/3 on Underfoot bracers.  I know the old number for 250+5% was &quot;around 50%&quot;, which seems reasonable from my experience.<br />
<br />
But remember, that's average - for one, I had a nice run of 1/13 bracers once at 220+5% (yes, that one is factored into my long-term average).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zacatac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Percentage = (skill - (trivial*.75)) + 51.5 <br />
<br />
That's the basic formula used.  So at 252 (max skill) you have --<br />
<br />
% = (252 - (335*.75))+51.5 <br />
<br />
% = 52.25 <br />
<br />
Now that is only for final combine though, it doesn't take into account the trivial combines along the way that can make use lose ingredients.  You might fail several of the combines before you even get to the final combine.<br />
<br />
I've always quoted people 40% success rate when they ask, because it can be very streaky.  I've had days of making 4 out of 5.  And days of making 1 out of 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wombat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">40-45% is a reasonable figure on my results with maxxed skill. <br />
<br />
If I want to make 2 bracers I get the subcombines for 5 bracers. <br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've always seemed to get about 40% with 250+trophy, on human cultural (heraldic).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Leewei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If the formula posted in the success rates thread is any indication, the odds of success work out pretty much as follows:<br />
<br />
Skill modified by Geerlok - 199 = expected success rate.<br />
<br />
If this number is lower than 5, the 5% minimum success rate rule applies.<br />
<br />
For those with some math background, the proof follows:<br />
<br />
Success = Skill - 0.75 * trivial + 51.5 (round up)<br />
<br />
Success = Skill - 0.75 * 335 + 51.5 (round up)<br />
<br />
Success = Skill - 251.25 + 51.5 (round up)<br />
<br />
Success = Skill - 199<br />
<br />
Since all cultural blue diamond recipes appear to have a trivial of 335, this formula predicts a maximum success rate of 53%.  It also shows how overwhelmingly useful a Geerlok is in the low 200s when attempting this type of combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Reph</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">According to a write up here somewhere from dev's remarks, high trivial combines have a built-in failure rate that the trivial level doesn't take into account.<br />
i.e. an item may have a triv of 335 and, according to the figures, therefore have a success rate of c.53% but in actuality may only be around 40%.<br />
<br />
This is noticable on PoP pottery combines that have a 295 triv vs. PoP smithing combines that have a 335 triv. The success rate for the pottery vs. the smithing doesn't seem to match the supposed trivials at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Krexel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the info. I have should have the base stuff for a stack of 9 sets of ingredients.  The limiter will be the combine for Folded Sheet of Infused Brellium. I havent finished that combine because of the lack of blue diamonds for the celestial temper. So now I am farming that dino in OOT.  It has blue diamond on its drop table and it seems to drop a jewel, from the listed table at Allakhazam's, every time you drop him. Also I found out he respawns very quickly the hard way :(.  The dino hits very fast for  lvl 50 mob.  <br />
<br />
I did find I had to quickly raise my brewing skill :rolleyes: to above 136. And boy does that new interface rock. I went from 68 (what i needed for tumpy tonics for crafted silk) to 135 in about 2 hours. Mainly because of the speed of the new GUI for grabbing the ingredients from inventory. In that 2 hours hour I did over  320 combines :shocked:.  I know this because i had 4 man-made backs I was filling with indredients for making Ol'tujim's Fierce Brew.  I filled all 4 packs 2x and only filled 2 on then final run to trivial.<br />
<br />
So if all goes well on the final combine for the Infused Brellium I will have 9 sets and that should make any GM smith happy.</div></div><hr />
