<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I must say that I really hate the Tracking skill.<br />
<br />
I hate even more that the three classes that have the Tracking skill also have some of the fastest movement in the game.<br />
<br />
I was helping out a young-ish (early 30's) Paladin last night.  We were killing the Skeletons, trying to get a Commander so he could get one of the relatively nice drops from it.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for us... unless a MoB popped practically right on top of us, it was tracked and attacked by one of the Bards/Rangers/Druids running around at top speed.  He did manage to get a Mask that someone left rotting, but it quickly became obvious that he was better off getting help from one of those Trackers than he was getting help from me. :\<br />
<br />
And I don't even want to start talking about the Fabled Quillmane...  :steamed:</div></div><hr />

This is dumb in the aspect that they are there for their own self interests.   But the Devs and game boys are too blind to either see this or deal with it.<br />
<br />
Im just getting sick of the stupidity of &quot;those behind the scenes&quot; of this game.<br />
<br />
Game is fun until they do stupid events like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Footsore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lotsa stuff to be consided in game &quot;balance.&quot; For example, would the solution to the trackers having an advantage also need to address people getting help from higher levels? <br />
<br />
I'm sure there were also some yet lower level people there complaining about that Pally's friend buffing and healing him and taking all &quot;their&quot; spawns.<br />
<br />
If you ask 10 different people, you will get 10 different opinions of &quot;unfair.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed.  There are lots of &quot;imbalances&quot; in the game that exist because different classes can do different things.  I can't track, but they can't rez.  That ranger is tracking all of my spawns, but wait until he and your friend and I are standing in the center of fifteen mobs on a bad pull, and I can run for the zone, protected by a divine barrier, and your friend can lay on hands, and he has to hope for the best.  Wait until that high power nuking wizard is at fifteen percent health and can't sit to med for all the extra agro.  Sure I can't solo kite, but realistically, is it the clerics or druids who spend more time with LFG turned on?<br />
<br />
Everything has balance.  There are some things that are more balanced, and some less, but thinking some other class's advantage is &quot;unfair&quot; just begs them to suggest which of your advantages to nerf.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I play a ranger so I can track. However I cant charm mobs so I couldn't solo my sacred waters. Unfair? Nah I can track and forage ;) <br />
<br />
I cant solo with the same exp rate as necros, mages, wizards, druid, etc. Am I bitter? Nah I have good dps and many uses that makes me great for groups with also some soloing ability. <br />
<br />
Each class has it ups and downs. If every class could do the same as all others (the only way to truely balance) EQ would be dead in a matter of weeks as we'd all play the exact same class.</div></div><hr />

I hope they weren't complaining...  I was healing/Buffing anyone who wasn't Red to me. ;)<br />
<br />
The thing it, it leads to situations like the Hill Giants in RM.  Unless one of them pops right on top of you, or everyone else is already fighting one (and that doesn't always help!), then the fast moving Trackers are going to get to them first.</div></div><hr />

Got each of them the staff, and bone necklace, and our mains each got a couple goodies also=) <br />

I think we did quite well for not having track=) [and i got divination skillups, and an aa point=)]:p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Iannyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The reference was to a long lost post condemming enchanters because they could create vials of mana, enchant metal, and had a &quot;lock&quot; on the tradeskill market.  I almost always post &quot;enchanterz are teh suck&quot; in reference to any &quot;class or ability&quot; balancing post, because there are simply some things some classes are better at than others, yet are deficcent in other areas.  Being an enchanter myself, I typically use the tounge in cheek enchanter comment to remind people that it is only a game.  <br />
<br />
Feel free to edit this one out.  Just explaining my comment :)<br />
