<br />
i was thinking of putting a twink in felwithe to store the bricks on as i make the combines into rings. If you have bad faction there, i could buy you the spell and the bricks and move to the bazaar, or PoK, or where-ever<br />
<br />
so if any of you enchanters want to make some extra cash, and help me out along the way, would really be appreciated.<br />
<br />
i do not know how much to charge for this, or how long it would take at all, so any info or an easier way to get smithing up, would help a lot too =)<br />

<br />
  I can help you if you find me online. Lately I've been hanging around in Shadowhaven, practacing JC.. (Which is why I need money..  ;) )<br />
<br />
  It will take a long time enchanting that much.. Each cast is 325 mana, which means that you'll probably get less that 10 on a full bar of mana.. I have no idea what to charge for this, but I'm sure we can work something out..<br />
