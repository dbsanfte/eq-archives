<br />
You can also buy for 2aa a pop ability that raises the maximum for all stats an additional five points.  This can be bought up to five times (once per level 61-65).<br />
<br />
You can also buy for 3aa a pop ability that raises the maximum for wis and int only an aditional 10 points.  This can be bought up to five times (once per level over 60) as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Docc</div><div class="date">01-09-2003, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">new max for wis/int is 355 (i think). the real issue is how much mana you get for points over 200. So far it seems to be the same as before. So its a nice change but not realy life altering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cravin</div><div class="date">01-09-2003, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">POP required to get past the 255 cap but you can go to 280 on all stats by getting to 65. After that you can raise both INT or WIS to 355 with AA abilities. Now weather or not this has any noticable effect on tradeskills is a differant story. I myself have not noticed any increase in either Success or Skillups with the new Caps. when I tradeskill my INT is 290 (current AA abilitis cap) and my WIS is around the 240 mark. Maybe somebody will have had better luck than I with the new caps.</div></div><hr />
