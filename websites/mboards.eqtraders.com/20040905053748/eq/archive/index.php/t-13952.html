Serrated Arrowhead (188 triv, fletching)<br />
Class 3 Steel Serrated Tip Arrow 7dmg, 25 range, NON magic (227 triv)<br />
<br />
Longer Version:<br />
There are two fletching vendors in Abysmal Sea, a male and a female.<br />
<br />
The male will tell you about Taelosian Stones, which he claims can be made into arrowheads sharper than any yet known.  If you do 400 combines for him, he'll &quot;give&quot; you a compound that will help you work with the Taelosian material.  I didn't actually receive anything from him, but got the impression that I received something like a tradeskill character flag that would allow me to work with Taelosian stones.  When you first talk to him, he also gives you a book that claims that &quot;even&quot; with ordinary fletching components, serrated arrowheads make &quot;great&quot; arrows.<br />
<br />
The female talks of Taelosian stones and apparently more powerful Discord stones which we may be able to imbue with magic properties.  She'll teach you how to work with the materials if youhelp her with 10&lt;x&lt;400 combines, provided you have some Taelosian stones to sacrifice to her.<br />
<br />
Having chatted with these 2 vendors on the ship ride over to the new continent, I asked my Expedition group if I could keep the Chunk of Taelosian Rock that dropped.  Having done 40 combines for the male Abysmal Sea vendor without apparent result at that time, I returned and simply handed the chunk to him.  He gave me 2x Taelosian Stones.  The book he had given me said these could be crafted into arrowheads with water and a file.... so assuming some consistency in recipes I headed over to the forge and tried them without result.<br />
<br />
I then gave the female vendor one of the Taelosian stones, which she promptly ruined by turning it into 10 small stones and 10 small files that I was to combine for her to help with her &quot;duties.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was only then that I discovered that if you helped the male vendor long enough, he would actually ask you to do something different.  After 100 Wayfarer Arrows, 100 Wayfarer bows, 100 Wayfarer Bow Staves, and 100 Wayfarer Arrowheads, he said some text about having given me a compound needed to work with Taelosian stones that would then be available to me for any future fletch combines.<br />
<br />
Taking a cue from the Wayfarer Arrowhead combines, I put my final Taelosian stone, file, and water in a regular fletch kit, which yielded 2x Serrated Arrowheads (triv 188).<br />
<br />
The book said the arrowheads would make great arrows even with ordinary arrow components.  Wanting an extraordinary arrow to replace my Blessed Champions, I tried the following:<br />
<br />
Traditional mithril recipe<br />
Serrated Arrowhead + Mithril Shaft + Mithril Fletch + Small Nock = DNC<br />
(in woodelf cultural fletch kit, regular kit, and planar kit.)<br />
<br />
Traditional acrylia recipe<br />
Serrated Arrowhead + Acrylia Shaft + Shield Fletch + Small Nock = DNC<br />
<br />
It being very late by this point I simply swapped out the acrylia shaft for a steel shaft, and came up with the very disappointing result:<br />
<br />
Class 3 Steel Serrated Tip Arrow (x10)<br />
7 Damage, 25 Range, NON-magic, 227 Triv<br />
<br />
Hopefully the Discord material, or a hypothetical imbued Discord material will return more impressive results.  My guess at this point is this is simply a tradeskill bridge for arrows between 202 and acrylia, and not a potential mainstay arrow for the rangers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">not bad though.  ceramic vanes instead of the acrylia shield cut fletch i beleive should return better results.  <br />
<br />
rangers get endless quiver.  the only thing stopping a mainstay ranger arrow tag is the arrow is lore so a quiver can't speed up the firing rate.  :D  for the rangers not there yet and the other classes though this doesn't look too bad for skill ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maddoc-the-Wayfarer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ahh, looks like a couple arrow components I missed in there -- I'll evaluate these and see where we come out with the values. If they're not something silly-broken, I might add them in. ;) <br />
<br />
-- Maddoc<br />
<br />
Edit: I just noticed the range on that one arrow (25 Range) -- I think that's probably a typo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'll add the obvious.<br />
<br />
If the new stones are frequent drops, then this might be a good skillup path from 202-227. <br />
<br />
<br />
-Lilosh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Paxyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Unfortunately, the 25 range is not a typo.<br />
<br />
While other 'old-world' arrows with shield cut fletchings and small nocks typically had ranges of 50, this one is only 25.<br />
<br />
As for the arrow being 'not bad' consider the following comparison with a pre-Kunark recipe:<br />
<br />
Serrated Tip + Steel Shaft + Shield Fletch + Small Nock = 7dmg, 25 range, non-magic arrow, triv 227<br />
<br />
Silver Tip + Steel Shaft + Shield Fletch + Small Nock = 7dmg, 50 range, Magic arrow, triv 202<br />
<br />
The jury will be out for a while until all the facts are in, but as I said in my first post I think these arrows' main purpose is an arrow-based skillup bridge between 202 and acrylia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Originally posted by Paxyn <br />

I think you misunderstood what Maddoc, the SOE Tradeskill Dev, meant when he said it was a typo. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ceinwein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So if I understand correctly, the new point is:<br />
<br />
Serrated Tip<br />
Dam 2<br />
Rng -25<br />
Cost N/A<br />
Triv 227 (Triv when used in an arrow, not to make)<br />
Arrow Name: ??? ??? Serrated Tip<br />
<br />
I agree that such a point is a little less than amazing. However, as someone pointed out, this is another non-plat method of getting fletching above 202.<br />
<br />
I must admit though that it is a little dissappointing. I would have expected an arrow component with a greater trivial than Silver Tip to be advanced in SOME way. Even if it was just Damage 3 with everything else the same (non-magic and range penalty).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't understand what you are saying here Eniamn.<br />
<br />
Are you saying that Serrated Tip arrows are Lore!?!<br />
<br />
Also I believe that Endless Quiver means that you never use up whatever arrow is in your ranged slot. <br />
I also believe that arrow haste is conveyed simply by having the quiver in your inventory. I don't believe you need the arrow type being fired to actually be in the quiver as well. <br />
Someone can certainly correct me if I am wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>darksisco007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hate to ask, but do you think it keeps track of the number of stones you give them? so that if you hand him 40 stones and then hand them all to her, will you get some flag to get something else from them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i think the haste only works if their is an arrow in the quiver.  thus with endless quiver rangers will get 2 arrows.  one for ammo and one for quiver.  if that is true then they might not want the uber lore arrow because it wouldn't get haste from the quiver.  i might be totally wrong though.  it woulnd't be the first time.<br />
<br />
i know of no lore tag of these new arrows it was speculation about possible reasons rangers wouldn't want them.<br />
<br />
it still looks to be a cheaper skillup path than darkwood bows especially if the drop rate is decent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Greymantle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No the quiver just need to be in inventory to give the reduction. Don't need to have any arrows in it oddly enough. It is a bit of a pain, as it basicly wastes a slot for lugging junk around. Mind you i do keep a selection of arrows to use in mine as some mobs have specific resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ok then.  their is nothing they can put on an arrow to stop an endless quiver ranger then.  <br />
<br />
it most likely should be better than silver arrowheads with because it has a higher trivial.  however it is a cheap skill up route now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Seraph</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">CLASS 6 Steel Serrated Tip Arrow: Serrated arrowhead + steel shaft + ceramic vane + small nock = 8 dmg 100 range NON-magic. triv 227<br />
<br />
Look familiar? It should...<br />
<br />
best possible &quot;old world&quot; arrow:<br />
<br />
CLASS 6 Steel Silver Tip Arrow: Silver arrowhead + steel shaft + ceramic vane + small nock = 8 dmg 100 range MAGIC. triv 202<br />
<br />
<br />
So we get to farm components to make arrows that are inferior to what can be purchased off vendors, though they trivial higher.<br />
<br />
Possible catch: I heard a rumor that serrated-tip arrows may ignore the new &quot;resistances&quot; that GoD mobs have to certain types of weapons. I haven't yet tested this or directly spoken to anyone who has, but it almost makes sense. IIRC, most stuff i've punched while switching weapons in GoD has not been INVULNERABLE to non-magic, so the lack of MAGIC tags on these new arrows almost makes sense.<br />
<br />
I'm still looking for discord stone...maybe arrows made with it will be better or possibly worth using?!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>drtyaty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">So, did we figure out what to do for the female vendor, or did I miss that part?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nepper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">They are saying that even with old world stuff...  To me that means that there are GoD components available to make great arrows, but the heads can still be used with old world to make stuff too.<br />
The progressive Potery quest has you making Unfired Wayfarer Arrow Shafts...  Anyone also a master potter that wants to look into this?  Possibly a more advanced ceramic shaft?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Seraph</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">So, did we figure out what to do for the female vendor, or did I miss that part? <br />
<br />
Give &quot;Chunk of Taelosian Rock&quot; to the male vendor in exchange for &quot;Taelosian Stone&quot; (x2). Give &quot;Taelosian Stone&quot; to the female vendor for a stack of 'fast-track' combines. The female will also be the proper NPC to which to give &quot;Chunk of Discord Stone&quot; when those are found, for, presumably, &quot;Discord Stone&quot; (x2), should you not want to make that combine yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Scymure</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Note on the quiver taking up an inventory slot - It's not a complete waste.  I keep 2 other types of arrows in there for fire-, cold-, or fire- and cold- immune mobs (Think SRT): 1x10/3cold Karana arrow and 1xShadow Tipped Acrylia Arrow in addition to the Blessed Champion Arrow in my ammo slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kizicthil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The 2 npcs are basically redundant. If you do the 4x100 combines that the male wants then he hands you the ability to turn chunk of taelosian into taelosian stone and presumably discord. OR you can turn a chunk of taelosian into the female and she will eat it but GIVE you the ability to combine the chunk of taelosian and presumably discord into taelosian stone or discord stone and then into arrowheads.<br />
Basically you earn the ability by doing the combines or wasting one of the items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>karmody</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">OK, I did the quests at the vendors.  The idea is that the woman will &quot;reward you more quickly&quot; than the man.  I did quests for both anyway, though.  My trivial was already 202, so it wasn't a big deal.<br />
<br />
Chunks of Taelosian Rock are pretty infrequent drops.  I was lucky enough to buy some on the bazaar for cheap, but now people seem to think they can sell them for 30,000pp, which is outrageous.  I mean, they are uncommon, but NOT worth that much!  Anyway, initially I could convert the rocks to Taelosian Stone by turning them into the man, he returned 2 stones per 1 rock.  To do the woman's quests however you need to give her stones.  So I did all those quests until she didn't need my help anymore... then went back to the man and finished his quests, then he &quot;shows&quot; me a compound that can be used to convert the rocks to stones myself.  I didn't receive any actual compound, you just automatically can do it yourself now without having to go to him.<br />
<br />
Excited, I put a rock in my fletching kit.  HOWEVER... it only returned 1 stone!  In his last message it says that there's a way to improve this skill, so I assume it can be improved to return more stones.  I don't know how though.  Which really SUCKS since I might as well just have gone to him to turn in a rock and gotten 2 stones instead of 1.  I guess that's the price for convenience of not having to wait for boats to get to him!<br />
<br />
Anyway if anyone has been able to progress further, or found some other way to make more stones out of 1 rock, please post :)<br />
<br />
Oh and the arrows that get produced can be found on this site, the serrated arrows, which are not all that great but at least they are a cheaper alternative to trivial after 202.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The stone conversion gets better the more combines you do.  You start out getting on average 1.5 of the converted material per stone.  This is a bit less than you'd get doing the turn in.   But...as you do more, you'll eventually get 3 of the converted material per stone, which is significantly better than the turn in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>karmody</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">hi, ok I did notice that right now it seems that there's a chance to get 2 stones from a combine.  Glad to hear it gets better.<br />
<br />
re: serrated tip arrows, I did some combines and noticed that the trivial of 227 does not seem to be directly tied with the serrated tip.  I believe I made serrated tip + ceramic shaft + parabolic cut fletching + small nock, and the trivial for that arrow is 202, not 227.  However if I replace the ceramic shaft with a steel shaft, the trivial was 227.  So that kind of throws the fletching chart off a bit...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gaeathorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I attempted standard low level combine:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>draethor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The best arrow I've seen made from the serrated arrowhead thus far (confirmed, I made it myself) is this:<br />

The only difference between the discord arrowheads (kt drops) and the serrated arrowheads (natimbi drops) is *1* damage. The arrows are still non-magical. So the discord one is:<br />

Although they are not tagged as magic I have not seen any mobs that are invulnerable in my use of them in LDoN, Kael- AoW, AR- Shei, Pop- BoT, HoH ... leading me to believe they are indeed magic whether they are flagged or not.</div></div><hr />
