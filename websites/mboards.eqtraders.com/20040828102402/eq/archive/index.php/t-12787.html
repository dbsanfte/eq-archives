You baked a shield !?!?  ;)  <br />
<br />
Why do you think they call it a CHARRED Guardian Shield?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">this actually (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=27271) but i had to bite my tounge so i didn''t lol.  :D <br />
<br />
no he accepted 12 stacks of picnics and 2.8k for the shield which is about 5k on luclin server.  was selling the shield for 10k at first and i said high can you go lower?  glad he wasn't afk.  dont think i could have been much happier if i had found ornate sleeve after that.  they are basically what i'm going for next.  well that or decent pants. hehe.  started hugging all the guildies i found and random ppl when i couldn't find more guildies.  :hyper: :love: :wizard: <br />
<br />
the emotes say i'm a hyper love wizard but meant to express my good mood.  <br />
<br />
its kinda like hitting 65.  i worked hard and noboy is very impressed with 231 in baking but saying you have it gmed is good.  nekkid i can still cook.  :)  (omg that sounded worse than i meant)  :angel: HURRAY!  i feel bubbly.  now i can cap some other skills and say i can't get them higher till i level some.  lfg for hours or soloing alone and boring has more pull when the fun tradeskills are capped for the moment.  MWAHAHAHA.  its ok you can laugh.  my wife did and she's sick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bzarth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Congrats on GM.  I bow to you.  <br />

I'm sitting at 217 for now.  I do Picnics in batches of 400 at a time.  I've done a few other random combines, mostly about 30 JFP, 20 C.Cockroaches, and a few other things, but overall less than 60 combines other than Picnics.  Started doing them with INT of 173 when my skill was 190 (I couldn't look at another Pinemyer Pasta :boggled: ).  I've since gone up in level (so I can get KEI) and have INT gear that I swap in, so I do my combines with 225 INT now.<br />
<br />
Batch one: 190-197 (173 INT)<br />
Batch two: 197-205 (200 INT)<br />
Batch three:  205-217 (225 INT)<br />
<br />
So I figure I've done around 1260 combines (1200 Picnics, 60 other) to get from 190-217 (skillup in 1 per 47 combines).  Three or four more batches should take me the rest of the way.<br />
<br />
I live on the Luclin server too and my major problem is that the Picnic market on Luclin is totally flooded with product.  I can usually only sell them for about 7-8p each and my bank space is full.  I've been giving them as gifts, trades, and donations for KEI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">gave most of my runs to my guilds at first cause i didn't want to unload them slowly auctioning.  most of the time i set up in pok auctioning tradeskills, ports, and whatever i have made (picnics) for sale.  i do 10pp each or 175 a stack.  most of the time when i check bazaar they are 10pp each.  the discount for a stack is the bonus above the bazaar though.  sell them quickly enough since i start chatting and porting ppl to keep me busy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>iasmin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">On Stromm, at least when I'm online, it seems a rare treat for anyone to auction food. In fact, in the last 4 months, I've not seen it happen except for on Halloween (and that was for free food, not for sale) and last night (also for free, not for sale, to the first person to send a tell ... I got it *grin*).<br />
<br />
Considering that I know for a fact there are a number of GM bakers on Stromm now, I'm curious as to why that is outside of the general Server Life (TM) differences. There's a pretty brisk trader in MTPs on the server in the Bazaar though, and prices run a bit higher than the 10pp on your server, no doubt because of its youth.<br />
<br />
Have you found, in your new GM status time, that you would prefer trying some other things? Truffles? Casserole? King Crab in... oh wait, is that a recipe yet? ;-)<br />
<br />
Grats again.</div></div><hr />
