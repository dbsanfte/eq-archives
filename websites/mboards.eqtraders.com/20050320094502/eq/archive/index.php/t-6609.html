<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Farnyr</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before I get into this, a small disclaimer. Im posting this here, because I respect the opinion of the posters of this board and would like to hear what I consider, for the most part, well thought out responses. Also, we have just about every class use this board, so I wont get biased answers, like I would if I did this at the Druids Grove of Graffes. Well, ok, Ill still get them, but Ill get them from every class  ;) <br />
<br />
So I was sitting in class today, bored, and my mind started to wander, and it came to Everquest. I started thinking about what I was gonna do when I logged in, stuff like that. Having recently just dinged, I need to buy spells, so my mind got onto spells. Thats when I started to think...<br />
<br />
Why is it that Tunare grants her followers the same spells that Innoruuk does? That doesnt seem to make sense at all. Being a cleric, I started to think of what each of the clerical dieties would actually offer their priests. Then I thought, well heck, what would all of the dieties actually offer their worshippers. <br />
<br />
Now, I wrote these spells out in a Roleplaying mood. I thought about the dieties moods and the classes the spells would be used by. Also, I had to leave out bards, they are just too complex and worship too many dieties, sorry bards, no songs. Also, these arent to be game changing, class unbalancing spells, but I think most are aimed to be scribbed in the 50's or 60's.<br />
<br />
Now onto the spells:<br />
<br />
Bertox: &quot;Plauge&quot;- A big dot. Bert is the plaugebringer after all. <br />
<br />
Brell: &quot;Brell's Bulkwark&quot;- AC/HP buff. Figured this would be best, because Brell is usually followed by Pallies and Clerics. <br />
<br />
Bristlebane: &quot;Trickery&quot;- Targetable weapon proc buff. This one was a bit harder, but I figured Bristlebane is a trickster, why not make it so he can rig up a &quot;Gag&quot; to make weapons do more damage?<br />
<br />
Cazic: No idea for a name- A more powerful fear spell. Cazic's plane is called &quot;Plane of Fear&quot; and he sure is scary looking...<br />
<br />
Erollsi Marr: &quot;Symbol of Love&quot;- Pure HP buff, just like a clerics Symbol. Or if not that, &quot;Love&quot;- Hate reduction spell. <br />
<br />
Innoruuk: &quot;Hate's touch&quot;- Bigger undead nuke. Clerics, SKs, Necros follow Inny, it fits in my opinion. <br />
<br />
Karana: &quot;Storms Blessing&quot;- Aoe/Group heal(not sure which). This one was tricky, first I thought that an AoE nuke would be good, but then I remembered, Rangers and Paladins worship Karana too. So then I thought &quot;Well rain....it falls everywhere, it makes things grow, its a heal!&quot;, and thats not so bad for Rangers/Pallys. <br />
<br />
Mithaniel Marr: &quot;Cry of the Follower&quot;- Group Yaulp. Not sure what level Yaulp to use(maybe a new form of it), but with Paladins and Clerics following him, it works. <br />
<br />
Prexus: &quot;Might of Prexus&quot;- Low resist, longer duration stun. Like the cleric stuns(force, stun, holy might). Took a bit of thought, but I imagined it to be like getting hit with a big wave. <br />
<br />
Quellious: Um....can any caster worship her?<br />
<br />
Rallos Zek: &quot;War Cry&quot;- Agro buff. He is the warlord, would be great on those poor warriors.<br />
<br />
Rodcet Nife: &quot;Prime Heal&quot;- Big heal, or bigger Celestial Heal type spell. Come on, hes the prime healer! Of course he would give awesome heals. <br />
<br />
Solusek Ro: &quot;Buring Spear&quot;- Low resist, big fire nuke. Burning prince, see Rodcet Nife for explination.<br />
<br />
The Tribunal: This is the one god I actually forget(sorry Barbarians), and I cant think of anything off the top of my head. <br />
<br />
Tunare: &quot;Nature's Faith&quot;- Regen. Tunare, shes a tree hugger, wants things to grow...go with it!<br />
<br />
Veeshan: None. I know for a fact that no casters can worship her(with exception of the Zek's and FV I believe)<br />
<br />
Ok, thats it, what do you all think? Good/bad/Game wreaking class unbalancing?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would think it would be some sort of Harmony spell, seeing as how she is peacefull, my monk also worships her for what it is worth.<br />
<br />
Might be unbalancing to give an Int caster harmony, but this is just a suggestion thread, they aren't exactly looking for new spells ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Farnyr</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, well for just such occasion that I was wrong about Quellious, I had this!<br />
<br />
Quellious: &quot;Peace of Mind&quot;- Self only clarity spell. Shes so peaceful, makes sense that she meditates well, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varlik</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 03:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">**** Bristlebane: &quot;Trickery&quot;- Targetable weapon proc buff. This one was a bit harder, but I figured Bristlebane is a trickster, why not make it so he can rig up a &quot;Gag&quot; to make weapons do more damage? ****<br />
<br />
Well, if Bristlebane is a trickster, the spell could be on the mob to cause it to &quot;trip/fumble/drop&quot; the weapon and hurt themselves.<br />
<br />
Mob_01 is hit with Trickery.<br />
Mob_01 drops his weapon.<br />
Mob_01 falls on his dropped weapon and dies.<br />
<br />
If it is a weapon on the &quot;good&quot; PC it could cause them to hurt themselves or maybe less/greater damage to themselves. Remember he does like to play tricks, that would be a good one.<br />
<br />
Player_01 is hit with Trickery.<br />
Player_01 hits Mob_01 for 1 pt of dmg.<br />
Player_01 hits Player_01 for 10 pts of dmg.<br />
Player_01 Hits Mob_01 for 108 pts of dmg.<br />
<br />
Just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EnfinitiStarr8</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bards can follow Veeshan. And the AE Heal for Karana is not that bad, Rangers and Pallies are under Druids and Clerics so it can make sean we would get one. Be a HUGE argo item, nice for Pallies, Rangers might die but if it's to save my whole team....I'd do it again. I like the ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quinner Sparrowhawk</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tribunal - a Damage Shield since it represents Justice. That whole eye for an eye thing.<br />
<br />
I do like the idea of each Diety granting their followers a specific line of spells or abilities for non-casters. It would make things interesting and add variety. It would make sense for it to get progressively better as the character increases in level. However, the Vah Shir would need to be thrown a bone to be fair - Just them, not the Agnostics of all the other races.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twofury</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like this idea, but i always figured dieties granted different spells to their folowers based on what the diety wants them to do. But basically they grant their folowers so many spells that whatever diety you worship, you have acces to spells that have the same effect as the spells granted by other dieties.<br />
<br />
In short: everyone gets different spells, but in the end they have roughly the same effect. <br />
When i DM in D&amp;D, i change the names of spells slightly for each different god, but the effect stays the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While this might seem a good idea, it will probably end up being abused if the spells are at all useful.  Consider the number of, say, high and dark elf clerics you see versus human or gnome.  Why? Starting wisdom and stat optimization.<br />
<br />
So adding a self only clarity spell for Quellious worshippers would increase the already high number of erudite wizards. Especially if none of the other gods granted any more useful effect. Adding Yet Another Lure Spell to wizards wouldn't be anywhere nearly as beneficial as more mana.<br />
<br />
In the same way, the having useful effects would give powergamers another dimension to optimize and further skew the already crazy class distributions (seriously, when was the last time you saw a half elf druid over level 50?).<br />
<br />
Given that the trend has been to balance classes, adding another option to min/max would counter that trend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morani</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a neat idea and I like it. Perhaps make it an &quot;effect&quot; type of spell so that they can only be cast so often like LOH but not necessarily be without a mana cost. Most Deities want people to follow them so I see the spells as being more of a type to affect others (and atract followers) rather than self-affecting. Some of the Deities though make more sense to have a self-affect (Like Rallos Zek). Here are my alternate offers, I left out the ones that I couldn't come up with anything that I thought was better.<br />
<br />
Brell: &quot;Brell's Bulkwark&quot;- AC/HP buff.  <br />
Now that conditional effects (charms) have been added to the coding I suggest a modification: an ok ac/hp buff when outdoors but it improves when cast underground.<br />
<br />
Bristlebane: &quot;Trickery&quot;- Targetable weapon proc buff. <br />
Too much like the Rouge's poison skill IMO. I'd suggest turning it around to put a &quot;proc&quot; on an enemy's weapon so that when it goes off the &quot;proc&quot; does damage to the enemy. (Basically a cursed weapon.)<br />
<br />
Cazic: No idea for a name- A more powerful fear spell... <br />
Alternate idea; a medium duration, AE, fear immunity.<br />
<br />
Erollsi Marr: &quot;Symbol of Love&quot;- Pure HP buff, just like a clerics Symbol. Or if not that, &quot;Love&quot;- Hate reduction spell. <br />
Love is also a great motivation, how about a haste, STR, and DEX buff?<br />
<br />
Karana: &quot;Storms Blessing&quot;- Aoe/Group heal(not sure which). …So then I thought &quot;Well rain....it falls everywhere, it makes things grow, its a heal!&quot;, and thats not so bad for Rangers/Pallys. <br />
Karana's followers are also typically nomadic people so how about something dealing with travel? Safe Journey: single target or self-only spell that, for it's duration, sets ALL factions to indifferent (stay with me). Attack buttons and spells are grayed out so they can not be used and all mob/NPC's will react as if the character is invisible to them (I.E. no interaction what so ever). Spell clears at the end of it's duration or if the character zones. This would allow characters to scout zones or run though zones that would be dangerous but NOT interact at all with (or be attacked by) non-PC's. (Alternately, a healing spell like was suggested but it happens in waves like XX point's of healing over 3-5 waves)<br />
<br />
Prexus: &quot;Might of Prexus&quot;- Low resist, longer duration stun. Like the cleric stuns(force, stun, holy might). Took a bit of thought, but I imagined it to be like getting hit with a big wave. <br />
I like it but I'd add a knockback.<br />
<br />
Quellious: &quot;Peace of Mind&quot;- Self only clarity spell. <br />
Possibly VERY controversial: Blessed Peace; AE spell that sets EVERYONE'S hate lists to 50. Castable ONCE per day or less frequent, lots of mana to use.<br />
<br />
Rallos Zek: &quot;War Cry&quot;- Agro buff. He is the warlord, would be great on those poor warriors. <br />
Victory is a BIG thing to Rallos so another conditional spell: AC/HP buff that lasts 1 hour and increases for every mob the recipient gets the kill message of (&quot;Soandso has killed a Whatsit&quot;)<br />
<br />
Rodcet Nife: &quot;Prime Heal&quot;- Big heal, or bigger Celestial Heal type spell <br />
Stealing an idea from DAoC (don't know if it'd even work with EQ's coding): Make the heal a smart AE heal: spell heals up to XX amount TOTAL but its spread out so that those who need more get more. One character might be down 70% and get 900 while another might be down 10% and get 150. <br />
<br />
Solusek Ro: &quot;Buring Spear&quot;- Low resist, big fire nuke.<br />
He's known for his destructive side but not much for his other side. A fire DS with + to Fire Resist that is better (or has other effects added) in certain zones like Deserts, Sol A &amp; B, and others than make sense based on the fire/sun theme.<br />
<br />
The Tribunal: This is the one god I actually forget(sorry Barbarians), and I cant think of anything off the top of my head. <br />
I bet this would be difficult but it'd be NICE: Gavel of Justice: AE spell -400 agro on all characters EXCEPT Warriors and adds &quot;gathered&quot; agro to warriors (splits evenly). I.E. There are 4 non-warriors (NW) and 2 warriors (W) present. NW 1, 2, &amp; 3 have 600 in their hate list and NW 4 is at 250. Gavel is cast and NW 1, 2, &amp; 3 go to 200 each, NW 4 goes to 0 (assuming negatives are not possible) with 1450 &quot;points&quot; gathered and W 1 &amp; 2 each get 725 added to their hate list. For game balance in raids, spell is AE but only works on party members (I.E. up to 6 people).<br />
<br />
Tunare: &quot;Nature's Faith&quot;- Regen. Tunare, she's a tree hugger, wants things to grow...go with it! <br />
While the healing spells for Rangers are almost a JOKE (I could bind wounds for more points of healing at 35 than my best heal spell could manage) and I would LOVE to see better healing, Druids and healing tends to be a sore point for Clerics and other &quot;healers&quot;. Tunare is also known to be fiercely protective so how about something in that line: a protection buff of some sort that gets progressively better as time passes. Every so many minutes the mods increase. Any subsequent casting cancels the first so the clock starts over again.<br />
<br />
Veeshan: None. I know for a fact that no casters can worship her(with exception of the Zek's and FV I believe) <br />
Bards are the only class that can follow her and they DO have mana. She's a Crystalline Dragon so… Crystallize: Mana costing, single target song. (Rememer, cn only use it once per set amount of time so no twisting) I'm not sure which I like better; as a mob affecting or PC (must be grouped) affecting spell. Effect: target is completely paralyzed but takes no damage nor receives healing from any new sources while Crystallized (DoT's, regens, and such that land before hand run their course.) Alternately, all changes to the target's HP are stopped completely.<br />
<br />
Vah Shir: The reason they don't have any Deity they follow is because they are tied heavily to the spirit realms and can communicate/interact with the spirits. This &quot;supercedes&quot; any religion for them. So, I offer Attune Spirit: Binds any PC to the Vah Shir (limited by the same number that you can /consent to). If the PC dies, they will come back to the location of the Vah Shir; wherever he/she is. If the Vah Shir is not online then the PC defaults to the Vah Shir's bind or camp point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some of the suggestions are, admittedly, quite powerful but if they are limited to 1 casting per so-many minutes I think balance could be maintained or even helped some. I was also keeping in mind the targeted level for the use but I would like to see an evolving line with maybe 3 steps in it so that a weaker version is available to lower levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quinner Sparrowhawk</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Total immunity to stun would be a cool effect for one of the dieties, perhaps Quellious.<br />
<br />
As for power gamers abusing certain classes, Diety granted powers could be used to balance the classes and races. The whole point would be to make a Human Mage worshipping Mithaniel Marr different from one who worships Karana and totally different from the High Elf Mage follower of Tunare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Farnyr</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 09:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As for power gamers abusing certain classes, Diety granted powers could be used to balance the classes and races.

<br />
This was the point of my spells. Diety at one time was pretty much useless, literally. The only time you worried about it was as an enchanter(gotta be agnostic!). <br />
<br />
But now you have to put thought into diety because of cultural armors. <br />
<br />
So I thought, why not make casters think about diety also? Humans would of course be the most versitile, and you might say that some race/diety combinations might get screwed over but....you dont like the spell youll get? Guess what! Go play the other race and deal with the draw backs. Sure you may not get max starting stats, or you may be night blind, but youve got that great spell to look forward to in 50+ levels(*snicker*).<br />
<br />
Kiz, these spells were meant to be used in the 50+ crowd. By the time a wizard/caster gets to 50+, they have Mod Rods, Harvest, KEI, PoTG(from someone in the nexus/pok). So as wrong as this sounds, so what if its another mana buff? Make it something like an extra FT1 even, not game changing, but helpful. I dont care what the power gamers think or do, they will twist any thing they can get to do what they need. They've shown this time and time again. These are for the roleplayers, and to add a new variable in class/race/diety decesions. <br />
<br />
Also, the &quot;Burning Spear&quot; isnt for EVERY wizard, only Sol Ro wizards. You want it, worship the burning prince. <br />
<br />
I like the idea's that people gave for both &quot;Trickery&quot; and the Tribunal. An enemy proc could be very useful, kinda like a dot if you think about it. An eye for an eye makes perfect sense for the Tribunal.<br />
The Tribunal: &quot;Balance&quot;- DS. lol<br />
<br />
I already said that I dont want to deal with bards since I dont know too much about them. Sorry Veeshan.<br />
<br />
Um, think thats everything I wanted to address.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ngreth Thergn</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Feel free to discuss that... I don't want to discourage that.<br />
<br />
But I also don't want peoples hopes getting up.<br />
<br />
SOE has already nixed this idea, as balance issues are a nightmare, and they just don;t want to spend the time to deal with the ballance issues.<br />
<br />
Again... feel free to keep discussion it, it is a lovely idea :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kiz, these spells were meant to be used in the 50+ crowd.

<br />
You miss the point.  Free mana is free mana.  If it wasn't, no one would ever sell KEI. A lure spell for wizards wouldn't add anything to the class.  They already HAVE lure spells.  Unless the spell had significant recommendations to it, there is no way any wizard in their right mind (or at least a min-maxer) would do anything BUT make an erudite quellious worshipper.<br />
<br />
Any power you give would, in addition to being deity themed, would also need to be balanced with the other deity powers. Free mana versus another lure spell isn't balanced.  QED.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't agree that it's a good idea for the reasons I outlined above.  I just picked those two because it's, to me, the most obviously unbalancing difference.<br />
<br />
In the same way, the bertoxx DoT has the potential to turn clerics into shaman-like individuals, without the insane mana regen.</div></div><hr />

If they weren't, Ngreth to care of that. :) So game ballance isn't really much of a factor. The discussion is about new ideas, what would be neat and fun, and what would fit the &quot;story&quot; of EQ. If you think there's a better way to do something Kiztent, offer it up; I'd like to hear it. Please don't just nay-say an idea; offer an alternative. I've seen you come up with some interesting things and would like to see your contribution. While we know that Sony will never impliment deity spells, I'd LIKE to think that someone on the design/development team might read this and get an idea for something else or a new way to do something. Some very inovative ideas come out of these kind of discussions and if nothing else, they are just plain fun. :)<br />
