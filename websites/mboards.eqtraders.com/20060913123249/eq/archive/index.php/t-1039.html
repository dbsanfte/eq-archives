<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Canto Wolfheart</div><div class="date">12-14-2002, 11:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've made a bit of the Tunarean scout/soldier gear.  It sells a little slowly though, I suppose my saving grace is that wood elves are popular.  But I'm left to realize, why are wood elf tailors forced to supply only such a small market?<br />
<br />
All the &quot;new&quot; smithing lines, and the erudite tailoring line, have an imbued and unimbued version, leaving the option to the maker to create armor for a wider market with a little less stats, or armor with better stats for a specific market.  Is it possible there's a bit of wood elven cultural tailoring that has been overlooked by players?  Or was it overlooked by VI?<br />
<br />
Similarly, it would make sense that we would be able to create armor with an imbued gem for Karana, why are halfling druids/rangers left without a cultural armor from this line that serves so many?<br />
<br />
P.S. I apologize if this has been covered somewhere, I've never seen it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heartsong_Steelsoul</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 07:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fistly, wood elves aren't alone with not having a non-imbued - barbarians and ogres don't, neither do halfings.  Erudites don't really need rigid steelweave, as all of their plate classes must follow a deity.<br />
<br />
Halfings make leather, chain and plate armor, all imbued for Karana, so halfing druids and rangers are covered, and paladins - it's their rogues, I believe, who are left in the cold, just like wood elves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jorev</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hfl rogues can wear dwarven made chain imbued and non imbued, yet wood elf rogues have no NEW cultural to choose from.<br />
I mentioned this back when NEW cultural was released.<br />
The simplest way to fix this would be to add Elf to seafarers chain which is a non imbued human-freeport chain made item.<br />
<br />
I always wondered why Hfl tailors were given so much more to make over Elf tailors, seems imbalanced.<br />
Hfl tailors get the Karana plate market, since their version is better than the human version, and they also get to make weight reduction bags.<br />
I think it would have been fair to give the bag recipes to Elf tailors in order to balance against the Hfl karana plate advantage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heartsong_Steelsoul</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">High elves and wood elves have a much closer relationship than halfings and dwarves, so it makes more sense than the dwarf thing - especially with dwarves making that plate armor they can't wear! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delandril</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 09:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or they could add Rogue to the Wood Elf scout armor, since in fact, The rogues refer to themselves as &quot;scouts&quot;. I think that would be the easiest solution without having to add any armor to the Database. I also think rogues got a bump deal with cultural fletching, as they can use the wood elf bows, and not the arrows &amp;lt;scratches head&gt;. Of course, non Tunare worshipping rogues would still be screwed, but who cares about them anyway?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thicket Tundrabog</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually like Wood Elf Cultural tailoring the way it is. I currently wear 12 pieces of Tunarean Soldier armor (all available pieces except face). If more folks could wear this armor, then more would be able to make it. I kinda like the exclusivity... and green is my favorite color LOL.<br />
<br />
The wood elf cultural market is slow on my server, but I have enough trouble stocking up a full inventory of arctic wyvern and tigeraptor stuff, and a partial inventory of cobalt drake to want another armor line to make. Hehe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froni Thunderpaws</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am confused.  Halfling tailors can make the Steelweave stuff for Karana paladins and the expensive weight reduction bags.  There aren't any wood elven paladins, so I don't understand how this is unfair.  Halfling rogues and wood elven rogues don't get any of the uber cultural so that is matched.  Wood elves get all of the nifty mithril fletching stuff and can wear the cool mithil stuff that high elves can make.   I think things are pretty well balanced although I could complain that halfling druids (and caster gnomes) should get to wear enchanted brellium chain stuff as fellow short chthonians. :roll:<br />
<br />
OK I see that halfling rogues can wear the dwarven uber smithed cultural and wood elven rogues don't have a high elven smithed mithril substitute or any other for that matter.  That needs to get fixed, but as far as cultural balance between halflings and wood elves it doesn't seem too bad.</div></div><hr />
