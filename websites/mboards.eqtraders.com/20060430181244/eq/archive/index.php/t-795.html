<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pooka</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 02:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sure in this age of 60+ lvl chars few people bother with this anymore, but I've made leveling up my smithing inexpensive by this method so it may do for most folks to have a more accurate bit of info about the rusty-&gt;Tarnished-&gt;Ore supply route.<br />
<br />
Namely that the yields on the smithing tables aren't exactly right, some of those conversions yield more than one piece of small ore.<br />
<br />
I know for a fact Tarnished Spears give 2 pieces of ore, and I think there's something that gives 3.  Rapiers may give 2 but that's a weaker memory. Spears are a confirmed fact (by myself anyway.)<br />
<br />
I don't know if the yield info is to keep the box a certain size or whatnot, but I'll post all the small-piece yields here as I gather them.</div></div><hr />

Rapiers and short swords both yield 2 as well.<br />
<br />
Daggers and shortened spears yield a single piece of ore.<br />
<br />
I think that's all of them, though I'll keep checking.</div></div><hr />

For quite a while there was a problem with these recipes returning incorrect numbers of ore. It's good to see that there have been some changes to fix yields a bit.</div></div><hr />
