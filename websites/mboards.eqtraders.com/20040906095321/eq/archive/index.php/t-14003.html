Allright, it's time for some people to just back down! This board exists solely by the good graces of Denmom and the House Ogre. They do this out of a love for one aspect of a game. While you may have a right to free speech the following is a list of things of that are not your rights in case you weren't quite sure.<br />
<br />
1. You do NOT have the right to make demands. This site is maintained on a VOLUNTEER basis. Most of us do NOT pay for it so we should be grateful that the site even exists.<br />
<br />
2. You do NOT have the right to insult Denmom or Ngreth, EVER! PERIOD!<br />
<br />
3. You do NOT have the right to complain to Denmom about SOE. That is much like complaining to the Curator of the Smithsonian about how bad your local library is. There's no point and it only annoys Niami and Ngreth.<br />
<br />
4. You do NOT have the right to expect sympathy for nerfs to exploits. If we didn't abuse things, SOE would never need to nerf something. The channels were running rampant with info on how to cash in on the easy points so everyone and his cousin crashed the system.<br />
<br />
5. You do NOT have the right to assume things about this board, EQ, SOE, or anyone who posts here. Idle speculation, especially negative, brings nothing but grief. In case you didn't get it, SOE is not out to get you, Tradeskillers are not out to get you, Uber Guilds are not out to get you. <br />
<br />
6. You do NOT have the right to whine, complain, or otherwise grouse in other parts of the board. Scream here if you really need to but realize that if you are always ranting, raving, and otherwise badmouthing EQ it's time to either play something else or start some new medication.<br />
<br />
7. You do NOT have the right to get mad with how the information is presented here just because it does not meet your needs. <br />
<br />
8. You do NOT have the right to post here without having a basic understanding of; the rules of this board, how to access information through the features of message boards, how to say please when asking for help, and how to say thank you when your question is answered.<br />
<br />
9. You do NOT have the right to flame people for having opinions contrary to yours. Rudeness only begets rudeness. You do have a right to your own opinion but so does everyone else.<br />
<br />
10. You do NOT have the right to always be negative. This last one is for your own good. Excess negativity will shorten your life span....there is no sense in suffering hypertension over a computer game.<br />
<br />
Who am I to say all of this? Just someone who sees that society is becoming more and more ungrateful, rude, and egocentric. If I insulted anybody with this Bill of Not Rights, then TOO BAD! Take it up with me on Quellious :p<br />
<br />
On a more serious note, I hope my bit of writing here reminds you all to think about the feelings of Denmother, Ngreth, and other posters before going off about how the world isn't meeting your needs. <br />
<br />
P.S. - Thank You Denmom, Ngreth, Verdandi, Lothay, and all of the other moderators and contributors for all that you do to make this board happen.</div></div><hr />

for #7 I say you can post an opinion of what you would like, but not DEMAND it :)  And don't expect it either, it may not be feasable.</div></div><hr />

I think there is un unwritten exception to this rule, but it only applies to Denmom and Ngreth.  :D :p ;) :angel:</div></div><hr />

(psst... good post.... #11 made me die laughing, especially because my first thought was, &quot;I can so be negative!  It's my life!  So there!&quot;  I think I'm going to post #11 on my cube wall here at work.)<br />
