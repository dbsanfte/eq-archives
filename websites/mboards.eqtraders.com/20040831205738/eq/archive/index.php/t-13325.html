<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you have LoY, the Iksar in Dulak's Harbor also drop blood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mahlig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dulak has some iksar mobs that drop blood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>xavious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ahh, forgot about Dulak, thank you much  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Only ever killed one guard in Cabilis and he didn't drop it :)<br />
<br />
Dalnir Iksar Necros will drop blood sometimes. Is a decent place to try if you're lower level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>grossbottom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dalnir provided my supply. First and second levels you'll find iksar necros and monks...both seem to drop it very rarely (by rarely I mean in a triple respawn of a level you might get one drop). <br />
<br />
I used to do it back when the blood was selling for over 800 a vial on my server, but for months now it's been down to around 300, which isn't worth it. Whether increased supply or reduced demand is the cause, I'm not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like Dulak's for Iksar Blood... Seems to drop more readily off all the Iksar there.<br />
<br />
I also Pitty you as an Iksar smith, your temper is used for Tae Ew and Thus is in contention everywhere</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tingteng</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">thanks for your sympathy. Do any other cultural skill require you to use your own race's blood? doesn't make sense to me.<br />
<br />
I can see Snark and froglok, but MY OWN FREAKING BLOOD? lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I always found that irritating too...can't I just prick myself with my spear and get some?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">that would rule if necros could suck it out of you.  be like sacrifices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tingteng</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have great regen I bet I could pump out a lot of blood fast :)<br />
<br />
Heck make the Gnomes create the Anizok Phlebotomy Contraption :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wow, you get a *5* for Phlebotomy! Grats!<br />
(And i do NOT give out 5's willy-nilly.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tingteng</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'll slip into l33tspeak soon and the world will be set back in order:)<br />
<br />
(Thanks btw:))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Caleem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Dulak hands down for getting Iksar blood.<br />
<br />
As for other races using their own, Dark Elf's use elven blood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">dark elves use hie and wood elf blood.  you only drain blood from other dark elves you don't like.  you then make little trinkets and dyes with it to give to the family at the funeral.  you don't smith with it when its so much more fun to bleed a pale or brown elf.<br />
<br />
(hehe my de is also a necro.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ummm Wow... That Post was some what disturbing...Eniamn. But back to the Subject at hand... The reason I pitty Iksar more than DE's for smithing is that the Scale Temper is also used in Tae Ew Bits... Makes it more frustrating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">lol.  sorry.  i believe the vast majority of dark elves should evil.  all the dark elves holding hands with high and wood elves in the brotherhood makes me sad.  my erudite main is puzzeled but my evil de necro is disgusted.  my de is evil but has long term goals so wouldn't mind grouping with a high elf for gaining levels but surely sometime during the ship building a few more of the high elves could have been in an accident.<br />
<br />
i am also on cold antibiotic for a cold so i tend to be more loopy.  <br />
you have never had an evil dark elf?  the rape the women, sacrifice the children, tortue the men sort of evil?  i don't often but if you've ever played a D&amp;D paladin for 3 months, you so just want to beat the answer out of people when you fail at diplomacy and can't.  your next character just skips the diplomacy and beats it out of them anyway.  i am currently playing 6 lawful good (paladin alingment) characters in a game so my evil gets more evil when it can.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Seriously... as a ShadowKnight who regularly uses Deathly Temptation, lifetaps, numerous sharp weapons, bandages, and gets used as a bloody meatshield... I should definitely be able to get some of my OWN blood...<br />
<br />
Bind wound should produce an item:<br />
<br />
Bloody Bandage Cloth<br />
MAGIC  NO DROP<br />
Weight: 0.2  Size: Small<br />
Race: *yours*<br />
Class: ALL<br />
<br />
Combined with poison vial in mixing bowl to produce some of your own blood...<br />
<br />
EDIT:  make that a mortar and pestle, cause I probably freaked out a bunch of bakers...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">nah.  mixing bowl is fine.  i have one of them.  <br />
<br />
(um i'm trying to find some erudite parts to cook.  how freeked out would a little blood make me?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Daikoku Ashikaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">depending on gear a 46-50 can solo dalnir, lower levels can group it.  Dulak is the best place of all for the blood I have found (and i have got about 10 skillups on tae ew,  farmed more before I felt confident in making shields in a partnership.  mid 50s can solo the ore cart drivers, the best source as they are 4 static spawns,  there areroamer dock gaurdians that seem to drop more often per mob, but less of them and they, like roam.   the leather clad iksars in the buildings seem to have the worst.  there is the 1 boat, but as a an SK with 2 pieces of time gear, a Dain belt, one set of bot shoulders and the rest elemental, I do not like soloing there much they hit a bit hard, but pull my wife on her level 60 cleric it gets her some XP as we farm.   As an SK i would not want to try soloing seb jail until I was 65/VT geared.  (Dulack, post drop nerf is still near as good plat.)<br />
