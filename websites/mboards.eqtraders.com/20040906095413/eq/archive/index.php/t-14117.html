<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Flintforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey,<br />
<br />
I just wanted to see whta GoD has done for the 188+ skill path.<br />
<br />
LDON addressed some of it and helped get to 212.<br />
<br />
Does GoD help after 212 with good stuff to skillup on instead of shadowscream/sickles?  (or cultural for some)<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zeralenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As far as I can tell so far (and that isn't much because no one has posted and I have not yet hunted those zones), the GoD recipes are not likely to provide much more than another alternative and then only for high-level characters, due to the metals needed only dropping in the new, very high-level zones. <br />
<br />
At least to 222, LDON -&gt; EVBs is going to be the way, and so far looks unlikely anything is going to prove superior to that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Damuri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">OK so now I have myself at 222 smithing.  How do I get the rest of the way?  I have more plat than time at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">sickles.  take money but pretty quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am also at 222 now.  I think I am going to try my luck with Iksar cultural.<br />
<br />
Since I turned 65, I can solo the Windscorn for Iksar blood and blue diamonds.. and I hear.. not sure yet, that I can turn it in for tribute points... hey at least a use for it now!<br />
<br />
Getting steady AA's there too, not fast, but steady.  Sure beats trying to aggro kite in the planes with a 160 sk dot and a level 41 warrior skelly causing trouble, then turning around to fight greens for cash on other days.<br />
<br />
As far as GoD, I have been looking hard for the components for the 233 or so trivial weapon combine ingrediants.. seems they are random so far.  No real good place to farm.. like windstones.<br />
<br />
I have just been asking my guild to keep an eye out for windstones (Luclin for acylia armor 242 trivial), nihilite ore (can't spell), aligned ore (from GoD) etc and I buy or do friendly trades.. combine when I can get.<br />
<br />
Just can't farm shadowscream all the day long, just can't, but that is the cheapest by far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No.  Gates smithing is based on farming at least one portion of each attempt.  The drop rates on these are small, very small, ExTREMELY small.  After 14 hours on sunday of non-stop hunting in Natimbi, Riwwi, and Snpool (sewer expedition) I got a total of TWO aligned ore.  Its about on par with farming windstones, maybe worse.   You also need multiple nihilite (or others) for just one attempt.<br />
<br />
As said above, sickles is still the fastest route to 250 if you can fund the eaddiction for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flintforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LOL, I cannot place what EVB's are hehe.<br />
<br />
I was planning on switching to underfoot after 220 or so.  I just need to get to 220 :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice.  Thats too bad the smithing components are so rare.<br />
<br />
Maybe they dont want us skilling up on them, only making them to sell or something since they aren't so good as to be something we could use.</div></div><hr />

Enchanted Velium Bits.  <br />
<br />
1 coldain velium temper<br />
1 spell: enchant velium<br />
2 small pieces of velium<br />
<br />
Lore and no drop.  Not sure what it's used for, other than skilling up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">phylactery quest.  thats what its supposed to be used for at least.</div></div><hr />
