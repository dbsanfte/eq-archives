<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>slimslim pickins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am having a real hard time combineing gem studded chains.  Normally when I have people do them for me they are about 50/50 success.  I got 250 jc, made trophy, used gearlok, buffed int 255, dex 255, cha 230, and had the legacy of jewel crafting book open.  I had a 100 percent fail rate out of 8 combines.  Is there a trick to making combines,  something that I am missing or whats the deal.  It's kinda frustrating expecting to get a terrible success rate of 50/50 then fail 100 percent of the combines.  Any help would be much appriciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">rng bit you.  50% fail rate on 8 combines can lose them all quite easily.  if you went 100/100 failed you could prolly bug it.  up to 20 the rng is just a meanie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Stat buffs make no difference on success rates.  Having the recipe book open makes no difference on success rates.  Adjusted skill level and JCM AAs are all that matter for success rates.<br />

You got very unlucky on your combines, it happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Galain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wow.  I thought that myth about having the book open/on you died a long time ago :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>slimslim pickins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">let me explain this.  while doing the trophy i failed 4 times strait.  so i said what the heck let me buff my dex cha int and open the book and stand on my head while spinning circles and see if it worked.  on my 5th attemp guess what??  i made the trophy.  i'm not saying the myth of the myth isn't true or not just saying it is kinda my security blanket lol.</div></div><hr />
