<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Deathseekerdan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there. Last week I decided to get back into smithing. I've been 185 for a long time now, so I looked around and found the recipe for EVB's. So I spent a few days farming velium, and got enough to do a couple hundred combines.<br />
<br />
So I start combining, and everything is going well. I got a success on the third combine, and another one on the fifth. Then I got &quot;You can no longer gain skill from making this item&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now I'm wondering if maybe I'm missing something, or if they've really been nerfed. Would be kind of depressing since that means a heck of a lot more farming to get my smithing up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Make sure you used the spell Enchant Velium in the combine. If you forget it you make bits which have a LOW trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>haplo888</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can anybody else confirm that EVB trivial has been lowered?  I read this elsewhere as well.<br />
<br />
Somebody with 190-220 skill give 1 combine a shot..<br />
<br />
edit:  found somebody saying they got skill up: ;) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The trivial has not been lowered.  People accidentally leave out the spell scroll in their combine and get regular bits and run here screaming nerf.  There's been no change to the trivial level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>buurpie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Is there a reason I cannot add this recipe to my tradeskill window list?<br />
<br />
(btw i'm at 190 and it is NOT trivial)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pardick_KB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Quest items are not added to the UI since you shouldnt need to make them twice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Trentazra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;Shouldn't&quot;, but you ought to see all the failures it took me to come up with ONE 6th shawl!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Solarax_Manastorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">quick question .<br />
<br />
say i have 355 unbuffed int and my goal is to get to 222 from 189. <br />
about how many combines or stacks of combines you think that would take? i can havea mule next to me holding 8 bags of spells plus i can hold another 7 bags and 1 bag of velium bits and tempers. just wondering how much running i will have to do and since the spell cost isnt listed ill need to calculate that as well( actualy it might be listed on caster realm let me check) ahh about 12.6 plat so each combine im gonna eat about 24 plat plus farmed velium peices so roughly 500 pp per stack <br />
i have the hammer of ironfrost from xtc ( got it today woot) for 15% mod but since these are nodrop that dont really matter.<br />
so basically i want about 33 skill ups. would you say it takes 20 combines at 355 int? 25? 30? 40? if it takes 40 combines per sill up that will cost me about 30k :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Pardick_KB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you have the hammer from xtc why not just do the pop etheral ring combines till 212 then do the EVB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Solarax_Manastorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">can eitherial rings be done with modded numbers? didnt think so but havent had the oprotunity to try yet cause of the patch<br />
<br />
and if it does work i will do those first if possible to save some money</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Pardick_KB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes they can this is what so many people talk about as free points from 210 to 212 with a greelok</div></div><hr />

&quot;Shouldn't&quot;, but you ought to see all the failures it took me to come up with ONE 6th shawl!  <br />
<br />
You only ever make your 6th shawl once. Since you can't wear two shawls at once people rarely make the same one again ;) Recepoes are only added on successes so adding the shawls to the learned list wouldnt make sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>StPatrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I just can confirm that trivial is still 222 (at least). Just yesterday levelled myself to 221 with EVB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I made them the other day, at 201 and they were not trivial.</div></div><hr />

Anyone want to buy some leftover veliums on AB? hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dumpty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">bumps rock. along with repetive thread on enchanted velium bits nerfage :eek:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would say you should average between 18 to 25 combines per skill point.  Since you need 33 points, that means it will take you between 594 and 825 combines to get to 222.  If you farm your own velium (something that I am doing, since I refuse to pay 100pp for 1 small piece in the bazaar) then each combine costs about 18pp, which would be between 10629 and 14850pp, not counting the money you'd make back by selling velium weapons and gems that drop off the orcs.  I was about even (give or take) when doing the combines.  The money I'd spend on the spells and the temper would be just about made back by weapon, gem, rune and other drops.<br />
<br />
YMMV</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vivamort-Rodcet Nife</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ok I'm missing something obviously, but it says these aren't used in any recipies when you click on them in the EQTC template.  What exactly are these used for?<br />
<br />
Vivamort</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>LexBardMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The Coldain shawl quest, apparently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Phylactery quest actually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Trentazra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You only ever make your 6th shawl once.

<br />
I was referring to the sub-combines, namely the spool ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bregalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well, with the new skillup formula available, at 189 skill + 15% mod, making a 222 triv item, you got a steady 95% success chance.  With that, your skillup chance comes up as about 4.22% or 1 skillup per about 24 combines.<br />
<br />
So, from a statistic point of view, given a perfectly random number generator, you are looking at 33 skillups taking 782 attempts.  Of course, EQ RNG is not perfect - it is very streaky.  I tend to avoid long skillup sessions - If I don't get a skillup in first 25 combines, I usually stop and come back another day.  Worked for me - past 190, I been averaging a skillup per 12-15 combines on EVBs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">RNG has been mean to me with EVBs.  Did 70 or so combines with zero skillups.  Skill is 212+Hammer of the Ironfrost, Wisdom is 315.  Prior to that, with Ethereal metal rings, I was getting about the expected skillup rate.  Will be trying more EVBs when I feel like farming for velium.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>AnnaaDruid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I just got 222 on EVBs last night, and that's where they trivial.  Those things have been a godsend.  I got 212 to 222 last night in 5 stacks of combines.  Now for the long hard slog to 250 with shadowscream, and all tradeskills will be maxed.  If only that 1 skillup every 10 attempts thing would hold out, but I get the feeling it won't...</div></div><hr />
