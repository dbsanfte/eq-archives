<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, the other day I get a pickup group for PoJ.  Exp is slow, so after a few  minutes we decide to head to PoI.<br />
<br />
During our time there, someone, a self-designated ML I guess, looted 3 coiled springs.  I have guildmates who are high level gnomes and would love this.<br />
<br />
I ask the group if we're going to roll for the springs, or I could even buy them.  No replies.<br />
<br />
3 /group's later, still no reply, send this self-designated ML a tell, no reply.<br />
<br />
OK, whatever, I'm not going to stress over this too much, guildies would like it, but I'm not going to stress this.<br />
<br />
PoI started to get crowded, so we decide to hit a LDoN.  Cool.<br />
<br />
One of the loots was a +5 WIS aug.  Being a tradeskiller, I was ecstatic.  I rolled.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, the self designated ML pipes up &quot;You're a rogue, you have no need for that, I'm not counting your roll!&quot;<br />
<br />
I then (maybe not so) politely say, &quot;Well, I tradeskill a lot and I need the WIS for skillups&quot;.<br />
<br />
Her response?<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't care&quot;.<br />
<br />
Neither of us won the roll anyway, but her attitude landed herself on my /ignore list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Almost all groups I've been in would agree with your ML.<br />
<br />
Even the guildies I've grouped with , who were Melee Types who tradeskilled, passed on the Wis/Int augs to Casters.  You may need it every now and then , when doing skillups sessions, but that druid, cleric, shaman, beastlord, or ranger needs it every moment he's fighting.  <br />
<br />
Again, NBG is a funny thing, and your mileage and definition may vary.   Just clarifying that his &quot;Rogues can't roll on WIS augments&quot; is a very very common stance.<br />
<br />
But the Coiled Spring thing would have annoyed me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Some people dont see a secndary set of gear as &quot;necessary&quot;. Myself I looted two +6 wis augs for my trade skill set. As a ranger it put me at 302 wis which helped a lot. However I didn't loo them unless any priest class did not want them. However if I wanted to roll I would have been able to. I would think that person should never be allowed to ML again, how is it he gets to determine who gets what and why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Qutie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Always have a clear understanding of how drops are going to be dealt with BEFORE you head in. There would be no surprises later that way. <br />
<br />
I've seen groups where... OMG, you can't loot anything because I need all tradeskill drops for ME ME ME :rolleyes: Like there aren't any other tradeskillers in the game... (sigh)<br />
I've been in groups where someone loots Everything... and either destroys the items or drops em on the ground without saying anything... :steamed: <br />
<br />
Now days, I say what items I'm interested in and if there's more than one of us wanting it, it goes around the group so we All benefit from grouping up to do something. <br />
<br />
In a /random all group, I wouldn't have had a problem with you looting the wis aug.  In a NBG group... well, I tend to have very little faith in these these days ... since even most twinks are better geared than I was at 60.  But... I'd go along with soandso needs x item.  <br />
<br />
With all that said... I'd never group again with your greedy looter there... and I'd have dropped group after the 2nd ignore of my /g statement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Serenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, I rolled my eyes at and ignored a warrior guildmate when he rolled on a wisdom augment in a guild group.  Even though, yes, he does tradeskill, and I'm sure it would help, it was more important for the priest classes in the group.  On the flip side, I don't roll on sta/dex/agi/int items.  We all roll on mr/fr/cr resists though, and I took 2 cha items for my steins when no one else wanted them.  And too, I'm almost at max wisdom with gear/food/drink, at which point I'll pass on the wis augments myself.<br />
<br />
Pick up groups are different though -- I consider it considerate to pass on rolls in favor of those who will get more use out of it, but I don't enforce that unless it has been stated up front.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree with Qutie that that group would have lost me as soon as I could politely leave.  Being ignored is a huge pet peeve of mine.  Being ignored by a pickup group when loot is involved is inexcusable.  I have more fun by myself than with a group like that.  <br />
<br />
Was this looter person a gnome?  If not, after her snide comment about the aug I would have asked her why she gets the coiled springs when you couldn't roll on the aug. :p<br />
<br />
The vast majority of the pickups I've been in have been without roll rules.  People usually pass on things that they can't use, but if someone insists then they are allowed.  Of course, if they push it too far they are quietly added to lists of people not to group with, too.  That would have been my attitude towards the aug.  The wis is more helpful to a wis caster.  It is also much easier to get wis for secondary gear than it is for primary gear where there are the other stats to consider.  But you were there earning the stuff along with the wis casters and had never been told any rules to restrict your rolling rights, so you should have been allowed to roll.</div></div><hr />

&quot;I was in some random pick up group and this rogue started whining about loot he couldn't use to give to his 'friends' - which we all know sells very well in the bazaar.  Then we went on an LDoN and he rolled on a WIS aug because 'he's a tradeskiller' when the cleric didn't have anywhere close to capped wisdom and really needed the aug badly.  What a loot ... um ... prostitute, I'd never group with *HIM* again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sound like anyone you know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Poohjure</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I guess I get lucky here, when I go on adventures with my guildies, just about every single augment rots except hp augs which are rare as a solar eclipse anyways &gt;&lt;  So I have been fortunate enough to have enough wis augs to max it at 305 and no one has cared if I loot.  I guess one benefit of the elementals /shrug =p<br />

best way to avoid loot problems in groups = guild groups.<br />

worst way to keep your tradeskill mule neat, organized and not stuffed to the gills = guild group.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Sound like anyone you know?  <br />
<br />
I see the point, but I only took 2 loots because the corpses were about to rot, maybe a PP or two.<br />
<br />
What is bugging me is that she was completely ignoring me, one reply &quot;sorry, I'm saving them for the split&quot; would have been OK (which I would have agreed to splitting a lot more than what a merchant would pay (since they sell for less than a gold) with the group).<br />
<br />
Our cle and dru both said they didn't want the +Wis aug.<br />
<br />
I didn't complain about any of the other loot she nabbed, mana batteries, gears, etc.. all which sell for a few plat to a merchant.  I didn't complain about the suprisingly low split from the LDoN, I didn't complain about the diamond that was looted in PoJ.<br />
<br />
I know, I'm a rogue, or more commonly known as a &quot;thief&quot;, and I like money, but when I'm grouping, if something is looted that is destined to be sold on a merchant, I will offer to buy it for usualy a lot more than what the merchant will pay for it.<br />
<br />
Trust me, if I am in a greedy mood, you'll see me in Rathe killing HGs, EK killing everything to sell at the bazaar, or even Xzorbb killing the EEs for their gems.</div></div><hr />

I fully agree, but my guild is small and most of the people are on when I can't be.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Carmaris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Another thing to keep in mind, Draggar, is that what a merchant will pay for a drop isn't necessarily the value of the drops.<br />
<br />
Yeah, returns on coiled springs, innovative bolts/gears, etc are low when selling to a merchant.  But if you can pop 'em on a bazaar trader and sell to other players for 30pp or so each...well, that make's 'em a heck of a lot more valuable, wouldn't you say?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Coiled springs have a wide range of prices in the bazaar, and I would have been willing to split how much they were worth there with the group.<br />
<br />
But the main point of my rant is that she completely ignore all my /grouptells and by direct tells.  She didn't offer to pay the group for it, nor was our split at the end anywhere near what the number of springs she had would have sold for (our total split was less than 25PP after the adventuring and a LDoN).<br />
<br />
I would have been more than willing to /roll for them, pay the group.  There were no gnomes with us, so no one needed them for that toon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I sympathise, Draggar. After the first two /g questions, minimum, she should have said something, &quot;sure, here&quot;, or &quot;sorry, [fill in reason here]&quot;. <br />
<br />
If a priest passed up a +wis aug, then a /rand should have sufficed to see who loots. <br />
<br />
/comfort. There are days I wished everyone wasn't so obessed with every little plat. I play EQ to get away from the same trains of thought that pervade RL.... oops. <br />
