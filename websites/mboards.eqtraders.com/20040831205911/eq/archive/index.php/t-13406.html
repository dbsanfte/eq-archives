<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When I catch something, I heard there was a way to automatically get that catch put into your inventory, without manually dragging it into a bag.<br />
I heard /autoinventory, but when I type that on the screen nothing happens.<br />
Is there anyway to do it?<br />
The manual dragging into bags slows me down.<br />
Also...is there anyway to have the Fishing Hot key (a legal way that is) to go on its own a few times?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">look down the page.  there is a thread called legal fishing macro.  it should answer both your questions.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If the dragging is slowing you down... you could always postion your mouse over your autoequip area, then hotkey fishing to a number.<br />
<br />
Voila: press 1. When fish appears, click.<br />
<br />
If you're fussy about how you position your fish in your bags, rearrange them while you wait for your fish to take the next bait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">OK...I took the advice from the threads here and set up my Fishing Macro as :<br />
/doability 4<br />
/pause 100<br />
/autoinventory<br />
****The problem is that half the time my catch Automatically goes right into my bags, the rest of the time my catch stays on my cursor until I manually put it into a bag.<br />
But when my catch stays on the cursor.....if i rotate my character with my right only arrow key in a Full Circle, my catch then goes into my bag.<br />
If I dont rotate, the catch just sits on my cursor.<br />
****Did this ever happen to anyone?<br />
Help Please <br />

Sorry all for a duplicate post. I was frustrated. I cant believe I actually did that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Your 10 second pause (/pause 100) may be just a little bit too short.  The pause command seems to be affected by lag.  I found that /pause 120 (12 seconds) works nearly all the time for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thank you Brody I will try it out. What just seemed really weird was that if the catch stayed on my cursor, when i would do a full rotation with my character to the right using my right cursor, the catch would then go automatically into my inventory.<br />
I have Forage set up so everytime I hit my right cursor, I forage and that 100% always goes automatically into my inventory.<br />
Now I wonder if that rotating to the right with Fishing is connected somehow to my Forage being set up with my right cursor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is.  Based on your saying that your forage always gets bagged correctly, I assume you have the /autoinventory command in your foraging macro.  When you move right, you forage, then autoinventory.  When forage is unpopped, moving right just does the /autoinventory, so you turn right with a fish in hand, the system forages (I'll assume that it can't because the button hasn't repopped), waits for whatever your macro says, then does /autoinventory and you drop your fish in the bag.  Test by turning right only a littl bit and then waiting, and I bet you bag your fish.<br />
<br />
If so, then the easy answer (and the one I use) is to put /autoinventory both before and after you fish.  Then, if lag keeps the second one from working for whatever reason, when you hit the fishing button again it starts by bagging your fish, so you don't get the &quot;can't fish with stuff in hand&quot; message.  Like so:<br />
<br />
/autoinventory<br />
/wait 120, /doability (fishing number)<br />
/autoinventory<br />
<br />
Simple!  Happy fishing!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks Silverfish I will try it out.<br />
On your screen it looks like you could put The pause before the doability#......i didnt know that could work. I will try it exactly as you have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My Fishin' macro:<br />
<br />
[Line 1:] /pause 125,/doability X<br />
[Line 2:] /autoinventory<br />
[Line 3:] /pause 125,/doability X<br />
[Line 4:] /autoinventory<br />
[Line 5:] /doability X<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
<br />
No space after the comma following the /pause command.<br />
<br />
The pause length seems to be affected by lag. Sometimes I could use a pause of 110 (11 seconds) and other times I needed to increase it to 130 (13 seconds).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">An interesting Fishing Macro copied from some guy on Eqdruids:<br />
<br />
Another macro I have while fishing is:<br />
/autoinventory<br />
/doability 2 [fishing]<br />
/doability 1 [forage]<br />
/doability 3 [begging... make sure you keep Booboo targeted or stick in &quot;/pet target&quot; instead of forage]<br />
/autoinventory<br />
<br />
This one helps raise the oh-so-useful begging skill while fishing (another oh-so-useful skill to have). Use this one in money forage zones that have water to kill 3 birds with one stone. I use mine in PoG to make Blessed Fishing Rods. Not only do I work up fishing (and begging), but I am foraging for Planar Oak at the same time which I can turn around and sell or make into poles once I GM fishing.<br />
<br />
Another macro suggestion is for dragging corpses. Just macro 5 &quot;/corpse&quot;s into one button. This will greatly cut down on losing corpses while being chased by Toilers halfway across Maiden's Eye.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I set up my Macro:<br />
/autoinventory<br />
/pause 125,/doability 4<br />
/auctoinventory<br />
*****WOOT works AWSOME and lag never effects it anymore.<br />
My catch goes &quot;right into the bucket everytime&quot;<br />
Thank You All....especially the Fisherman that posted that specific advice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jhales</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">/autoinventory<br />
/pause 2<br />
/doability x<br />
<br />
<br />
As soon as your catch appears on your cursor (or you get the didn't catch anything message), click the button again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>greenwood_d</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Is there a command i can use for autodestroy?? - hence two buttons one for keep and one for throw back.????<br />
<br />
TY</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grimsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">When I'm fishing I usually sit here and read whle fishing so I have my macro set up like<br />
<br />
/pause 115,/doability 1<br />
/autoinventory<br />
/pause 115,/doability 1<br />
/autoinventory<br />
/cast 1<br />
<br />
That will fish, pause, put the catch in a bag, fish, pause, put the catch in a bag, cast the spell in my first spell gem.<br />
<br />
The spell in my first spell gem is a low level spell that has a loud sound effect. <br />
<br />
I just keep my finger resting on the key and hit it when I hear the spell cast while I read and just look have to up from my book every once in a while to make sure I havn't broke a pole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Raolinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">/cast 1.........The spell in my first spell gem is a low level spell that has a loud sound effect.  <br />
<br />
Now that is a great Idea. Gonna steal it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Piikaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Also, with a macro, you can position yourself to fish, beg, cast (raising skills in all three), if you position yourself correctly. Good way to max them all out at the same time. Also, once you raise your spell-casting skill (say Divination), you can change spells to raise another one.</div></div><hr />
