<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">catynnefeesh</div><div class="date">03-26-2003, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I need a massive number of belts of leathery fungus flesh, and I am getting sick and tired of Paludal.<br />
<br />
I currently have a deal with a friend to pay 200pp per 10 belts or in trade for random gear I have around my bank.  I'm looking for one or two others who are poor enough to think this deal is worth their time.  It's not great money, but can be done at a semi-low level.  If anyone has a friend/guildie who is low(ish) level and looking for a way to make money, could you ask them to contact Catynne/Bleeu/Xtiky in game?<br />
<br />
The mobs are around level 10 to 15, in paludal caverns, and soloable by any class by level 20.  Level 30ish is better for farming though (no downtime).</div></div><hr />

<br />
a good cleaning of Shadowhaven usually yeilds about 50 to 90, if it's been a couple of days since the patch.<br />
<br />
However at the current rate I'm going, that's about .5 of a skillup.</div></div><hr />

Along with other items such as sensi lens and all... If you want, I can save those for ya as I farm for other tinkering goodies... *Still hoping for haze panther eyes*<br />
<br />
Anyways, I'll save those for ya on my rounds... btw, is catynnefeesh your online char's name?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">catynnefeesh</div><div class="date">03-28-2003, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm just Catynne.<br />
<br />
Thank you, if you want to save them for me. :)  I got a couple of tells from people about farming, too, so I think I might finally have enough to see me through their trivial in a couple of weeks.<br />
<br />
Do you do vanishing devices for skillups, or are just making some?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qallainx</div><div class="date">03-31-2003, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm making vanishing devices for the clerics from my guild atm.  Got quite a few other classes that want them,  but going to try and get the clerics done if I can get enough haze panther eyes.<br />
<br />
So far I've been lucky and gotten 3 for 3... :)</div></div><hr />
