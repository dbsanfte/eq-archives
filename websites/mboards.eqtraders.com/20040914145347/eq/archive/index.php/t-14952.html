<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nihixul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am but a 200 baker, and I have not even tried any of the new recipes. However, I can't help but ask...<br />
<br />
Why so many? <br />
<br />
I don't mean to ask that rhetorically, either. There might indeed be a very good reason. I guess variety is always nice,  but it just seems a bit strange for the devs to say, &quot;Ya know, in real life, you aren't so constrained by particular recipes to make things, etc., so let's just open it all up!&quot; and then proceed to do so,... but only in the very narrow sliver of GoD baking. <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I don't want this explosion everywhere, it just seems weird that they decided to explode the &quot;realism&quot; (so to speak) in this one area.<br />
<br />
What do you think? <br />
<br />
Do you like this explosion? You might ask, &quot;What is there not to like?&quot; Well, it just seems a bit overwhelming and unnecessary.<br />
<br />
I mean, what if the next patch introduced 4200 new baking recipes with pre-existing items? (Trying to make my point through showing an exaggerated example.)<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not quite sure how I like it so far.  Yes, variety is nice, but trying to explain all of the new recipes to a non-tradeskiller is quite a daunting task.  I get many &quot;what should i skill up on next&quot; tells since the new UI came out, telling them MTP/PoP or new GoD recipes comes back to bite me in the butt a lot.  Maybe it will be a bit easier once all the recipes are finally pinned down with trivial levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jylarien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dunno.  Variety is good I guess, except for the fact that the main ingredients that make so many dishes (lemon, garlic, etc.) are all vendor bought.  It would have made more sense to me if those items were forageable, then you have the mentality of 'hey, there's a crapload of recipies here to accomodate whatever you happen to come across'.  I was definately happy to see that the horror of farming blood ravens in PoN or any of the other hard farms I was having to deal with are now a moot point.  <br />
<br />
With new GoD recipies I leveled up quicker and moved on to a more profitable line of work:  MTPs.  Now I can actually make some decent money with baking while skilling up and it didn't take retardedly annoying PoP recipies to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nanndas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Most of the GoD recipes for crab/tuna/hynid/crag are foods that give lower stats than MTP and HMP's. They just seemed to clutter up the stat food market. They are a good avenue for skill ups, but there is no resale market for them. I had stacks of steaks, rolls that never sold. I finally sold them to a vendor the other night to free up inventory space on my trader for a little less than the going price in the bazaar. <br />
<br />
They should have made recipes that had some unique properties. Like a food that if it were to be right clicked to eat would give a short endurance boost or even lev, enduring breath etc. Make them a little more complicated to make like mtp/hmp.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">good ideas Nan.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">By the end of tomorrow, I hope to have made all the sauced GoD baking recipes once (more!) to get them added to my recipe book (again!).  When I get that done, I will post any trivials that are still missing.  I am =not= keeping track of the stats on them though.</div></div><hr />
