<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shamata Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello All,<br />
<br />
I would like to commission a Dwarven Smith on our server (Rodcet Nife) to do the major combines for a full set of Brellium Armor for a 52 Dwarven Warrior (RL son) on RN.  A skill of 250 is desirable because of the expense of the materials for this armor.  I know there are at least 3 maybe more on our server with this skill but I am not sure how many of them still play and or practice their trade.<br />
<br />
As there would be no skill up for a 250 smith a mutually agreeable cash (pp) combine fee is expected and encouraged for the combines.<br />
<br />
However a smith of close to 250 might work as well as we (my son and I) have included about a 10% failure ratio with our materials. The point being that it would be nice for someone to maybe get a skill up from this as well.  In this case we would still be amenable to a cash (pp) combine fee but maybe not the same as the no skill up smith. <br />
<br />
Now as far as what we will do and what services we require hopefully the following will help, as we have been planning this for a bit and really hope we have all the basis covered if we do not please let us know.<br />
<br />
We will be doing most of the running around together (a bonding thing lol) to get any of needed materials; I always have padding and the molds I can get. I assume you would have the Dwarven smithy hammer and file and a cultural forge as and if needed. I have the brew skill to make the earthen tempers and we will hunt the mobs that drop the components so we can provide these as well. <br />
<br />
For the enchanted brellium jointing and the sheets of infused brellium I can provide all the bricks of brellium (I will also get all the brellium bricks enchanted) and we can provide all the blocks of velium, along with the coldain tempers and I have the brewing and pottery skills to provide the celestial tempers (as needed).<br />
<br />
<br />
Summary: Note our spare material (which will be on hand) is based on a conservative and approximate + 10 % failure rate, it is assumed that you will provide the file, Dwarven smithy hammer and the cultural forge as required. We will provide as many stacks of dwarven ale as needed for any of the combines so they are not listed in the summary below.  <br />
<br />
Initial Combines<br />
<br />

<br />
·We will provide 13 enchanted brellium ring component sets (5    spares)<br />
13 enchanted large brellium bricks (as this combine is             trivial at 63 we might try to get a lower skill smith to do, it is up to you).<br />

<br />

<br />
Folded sheet of velium<br />
<br />
·We will provide 24 folded sheets of velium component sets (5 spares) (as this combine is trivial at approx 48 we might try to get a lower skill smith to do, it is up to you.<br />

	24 coldain velium tempers <br />

<br />
We have no smithing skills, if there is anyone that would consider doing this that would be great. Please post here with your interest if any.<br />
<br />
One last thing; man I never realized the amount of work required to make one piece of armor never mind 13 pieces.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ilona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Expect 40-50% success rate on cultural at max effective skill (240-250 + geerlok/trophy).<br />
I'm afraid you won't get a full set of armour if you only provide 5 extra sheets...<br />
<br />
(High elven and Human smiths here, so I'm afraid I can't help you on the actual crafting side)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hando</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Send me a tell in game and we can talk.  My skill is 250 and has been for some time.  <br />
<br />
As the above post said, expect no better than a 50% success rate at best, usually a bit lower.  It all depends on the mood of the RNG that night.  I will also warn you that it is  very disheartening to see that much work and time poof with a few clicks of the combine button, so be prepared for that.  I have gone 9 combines in a row with out a single success, and in a run of 13 (attempting a full suit for a friend all at one time)  I was only able to get 2 pieces made.  On the other hand, I have gotten as many as 11 of the 13 in a single sitting.  It is very random.   I just want to give you fair warning.<br />
<br />
If you haven't found someone already, let me know.  I am sure we can work something out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shamata Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hi Hando and Ilona,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the responses.  <br />
<br />
Wow that’s is a little of a shock the 40 to 50 % success rate but we will have to adjust our game a plan to that scenario. <br />
<br />
Hando thanks for responding to my mule in game this morning I will try to talk to you in game tonight at 10:00PM EST.  <br />
<br />
Based on this new information we are thinking to actually get my son to 100 + in smithing over the weekend and do the trivial combines on the jointing and the sheets so that you will only have to do the final combines. <br />
<br />
We would pleased if you would consider making the combines Hando and please be thinking about a fair fee for the combines (for you as well as us) as we both appreciate the time and money required to get to that skill level in any trade.<br />
<br />
So do you recommend that we have the materials on hand for the extra 50 % items or actually have the extra infused sheets and jointing made prior too the combine. Is there a market to resell them to at least recoup our cost if we have a better than 50 % hit rate? The tempers, molds and padding, ale etc are no big deal and we will have extras of them on hand.<br />
<br />
One last question, do you recommend going with one combine say like the BP until you get it or just continue through a full set.<br />
<br />
We did have all the materials we needed but we are going to have to get more based on the above so the time frame for the final combo looks like next week maybe Tuesday, or Wednesday at your convenience and provided you want to do it, we can work out the details.<br />
<br />
Again thanks for the response,<br />
