<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>yeroca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This morning I tried to take my bard to the Abysmal sea to work on pottery skill ups.<br />
<br />
Well, I got on the boat in Nedaria's crossing, and when the boat moved, it slid out from under me and left.<br />
<br />
Hmm... well, maybe I can catch it again in Natimbi.  I zone into Natimbi, boat arrives within 5 minutes, and I get on.  Once again, it slides out from under me, leaving me hanging in mid-air.<br />
<br />
How fun.<br />
<br />
So it appears that unless you are bound in the Abysmal sea, you can't get there.<br />
<br />
Note, all of this is AFTER the 3/25 patch.<br />
<br />
I bugged it, but I doubt it will be fixed real soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azirux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you have to get there and have Levitate and SoW, follow the boat. When it stops, you have 30 seconds to get close, and you will zone with the boat. First time I tried it I wasn't fast enough, so I marked it on my map and waited for the boat to loop thru the zone again. I don't recommend following the boat in Natambi - if you do wait for it to come out of the channel on the far side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am having the opposite problem (although I didn't check today) if I am standing anywhere near the boat it pulls me in below deck and I can't move until it zones and pops me above deck.  It grabbed me 3 or 4 times in a row and I was not happy.  I didn't need to be in the path of the boat just near by (less than 50 yards) and it would grab me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zuklaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had a similar problem, I fixed it by moving back and forth, then it seemed to grab me. Had to do it at the dock in Nedaria's Landing and the zone in to the Abysmal Sea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i knew that bringing boats back into the game was a mistake!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bocote</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I had that problem happen about 2 weeks ago.   I was running around on the boat while it was moving though so decided to sit the next ride and it went fine.   dunno if that'll help ya.<br />
<br />
you used to be able to zone into abysmal from natimbi by just running the same path the boat goes with or without the boat, but it made hunting sirens kinda irritating when suddenly you start zoning mid battle.<br />
<br />
I remember pre kunark the boats seemed to work pretty well.   Its all downhill after that though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Laurelleii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I had that happen to me yesterday. Fortunately I caught it before the boat could get away and dropped lev and everything was fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I had a slightly different problem with the boat myself.  I got on the boat in the Abysmal Sea, and rode it to Natimbi.  While it was sitting still after zoning, I got agro from one of the sea creatures.  I could not see the creature (no pun intended), nor could I attack it, and it kept after me when the boat moved as well.  The first chance I got to see it was when I ran off the boat and up the shore to the magus, and I could see it when it came out of the water after me.  By that point it had hit me six times for nearly a thousand points of damage that I couldn't return, nor defend against, nor run from.  It seemed a bit unfair to me.<br />
<br />
So, be warned, if you're a low level character.  You may have a corpse run on your hands if you use the boat to return from the Queen of Thorns.<br />

Bwahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
*tries to breath*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes...when you get on boat at dock in Nedarias Landing, the boat will leave with you standing over water. You must swim very fast....u should be maxed out in swimming.....of levitate and follow the boat. The boar pauses for 30 seconds before it zones. Stand on the side of the boat. After it zones, u automatically get dropped onto the fishing platform on QOT. You get a message that boat left without you so u are out on safe spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>yeroca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I got on the boat again last night with the idea that I would just run in the direction that the boat was moving and that hopefully I could stay up with it, using bard selo's.<br />
<br />
Well, that worked, but not how I expected it to.  I ran with it for the first second or so, and after that, it seemed to lock me down to the surface of the boat.<br />
<br />
So maybe you just need to move a bit just as the boat starts leaving the dock to get it to wake up and realize that you're on the boat. <br />
<br />
Since I was called to a raid, I gated back to Thurgadin with a potion, and didn't have to suffer the mobs that hit you from no where, though I did see some messages about some mob baring its teeth at me as the boat was moving through the channel toward the Abysmal sea.<br />
<br />
Bottom line: try moving in the direction of the boat just as the boat leaves the dock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>tnexus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">From what I learned, the boat will knock you backwards. The boat left me a few times, so next time I just went towards the front of the boat and it knocked me back some, but I still stayed on. A few times I missed it and caught it on the other side of Natimbi as well.<br />
<br />
Oh, and word of warning. I dropped lev so I'd stay on the boat  which I did, but when I zoned into Abysmal, I fell for 20k damage. Had I been lev'd I would have been fine, but unfortunately I wasn't. Needless to say I wasn't happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Eileah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">All the more reason that port spells should have been made to take people to Abysmal Sea and not Natimbi.<br />
<br />
I have given up tryig to run my young Ranger to AS because of the agro that you get on the boats and at the camp in Natimbi where you catch the boat.<br />
<br />
Even at 65 I have a hard time if I get too much agro from mobs while on the boat, there is NOTHING I can do about it, no way to defend myself against it or fight back.<br />
<br />
But does it matter now? I tried to get to AS last night on the boat and was thrown off when it started moving, we tried to catch it but were unable to /shrug<br />
<br />
No visiting AS for me for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>crystilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My husband spent 2 hours about 2 weeks ago (after the change that caused this) with a Guide watching him cause he had the same problem.<br />
<br />
It would sometimes deposit him in the water but more often than not it would leave him floating in the air when the boat moved away. <br />
<br />
The guide said the usual stuff - delete zone info and repatch.  It did NOT help.  He then went back to the Magus and got on the boat from that zone and had the same problem.<br />
<br />
2 others in zone had the same problem.<br />
<br />
The only way he was able to stay on the boat WAS to move forward once it took off and wanted to leave him there.  On the boat he had to do it twice.<br />
<br />
~~<br />
Side note - last night going up the elevator in PoK the same thing happened to me; it left me behind, so I had to move forward when it first started moving (up or down) to stay on it and not float/stay behind.</div></div><hr />
