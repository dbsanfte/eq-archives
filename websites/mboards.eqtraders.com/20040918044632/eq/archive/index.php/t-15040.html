Yeah, that didn't make it in this update, unfortunately. They should, however be converted in the next one (and on Test server tomorrow. :))<br />

Wonderful, which means we get to wait another three weeks for something that was ready to go in if someone had bothered to remember to put it on Test.  I still don't see why they had to break the new UI for non-rogues when using a M&amp;P until they could move the recipes to mixing bowls; rogues are still the only ones who can make any use out of poisons.  Providing such a stress-free way of making these buggers that always seems to be needed in bulk, and then yanking it away has just got me in a bad mood I guess. /sigh</div></div><hr />

I crank them out in lots of 100 or so. Only takes a few minutes... *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mendan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Guess I'm just spoiled at the ease of all the leather paddings I've made with the new UI.  Being able to quickly make thread, skin pelts to LQ, and make the padding all from the same window is quite nice. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Carmaris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd abandoned the new UI for CE's even before they made it inaccessible to non-rogues.  I can just make 'em faster the old way--and I'll make about 54 stacks at a sitting.</div></div><hr />
