<br />
I'm sure you know the real url...<br />
<br />
The ultimate tradeskills guide is pretty much a total rip of the site, though some of it is out of date. I thought you might want to know this, and you might want to talk to a lawyer to get this piece of fecal matter. :steamed:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Berusa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Umm, show us :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Like, google kinda sux sometimes :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dahna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Jfyi this list can be found through p2p programs, as well as &quot;how to win eq illegally&quot; books, but you know you can find anything there...so I don't really think Denmom can do something about it. Anyways it is not really a problem since this &quot;bible&quot; is already out of date as you mentionned it /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>falkahnhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, any &quot;Guides&quot; and such that are posted on the internet are considered copyrighted even if there is no formal copyright issued for the guide, atleast that's my understanding of the law.  I'm sure denmom could e-mail this guy and ask him to take it down, if he's making money off of it and he refuses then you could always sue him if you could prove the information he is using was provided by eqtraders.com.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In many cases, the stolen electronic content would cost us more in legal fees than we'd get as renumeration from what they sold.  I think this is what most such criminals count on.  And the moment we get one of these guys to stop, there are 10 more waiting in the wings to sell the stuff.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aandaie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Plus you can't copyright raw information, which exists in <br />
another form (in thise case the video game everquest.)<br />
<br />
You can copyright text/formatting/html, as in if its ripped exactly, but anyone could come here and copy the ingredients and every recipe while not infringing on copyright. You are talking about a recipe which exists in Everquest.<br />
<br />
So if they did just rip all the copy as well, they are really lazy since they could have been legit. Of course, in being legit they should cite references.<br />
<br />
Generally money and knowledge of what the person requires prevents people from paying for such guides. If someone was that interested in EQ tradeskills, they'd check what they could find for free and then come here. Most people want things for free. I highly doubt that the makers of any of these guides get much more than what their server costs are and a small bit of spending money, while living at Mom and Dad's.<br />
<br />
Word gets around fairly fast how crappy such guides are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kandrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Meh. The real value to eqtraders is the people behind it and the community that's formed around it. Other sources may have  much the same info, but I hazard a guess that most tradeskillers will value here over there... <br />
<br />
/teh brotherly hugs to teh denmom, while warily eyeing teh house ogur. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It is an exact rip.  Including our old graphical buttons, and the shawl guide even has Verdandi's name still in it.  He changed a few words here and there... but that does not stop it from being plagerism.</div></div><hr />
