<br />
Already in pain?  <br />
Herbal vs. OTC drugs?  Heat vs. cold?  <br />
<br />
Interested in what others have to say about this issue.  <br />
<br />
The more we learn about proper tradeskill techinques, the better off and pain-free we all become.   :D</div></div><hr />

Then figure out where to locate it where it's comfortable ( I have mine strapped to the armrest of the chair I use.) You won't believe how much better it is once you find that sweet spot. Now I can tradeskill for better than 6 hours straight without pain if I want to. I've heard of people setting them up on an angle so you don't have to keep the hand rotated flat also. Good luck and good tradeskilling. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morani</div><div class="date">01-16-2003, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have an extremely low-tech partial solution that I use (help a LOT last night when I made 850 wolf fillets in cream since that equals something like 7200 clicks): a spoon. I keep a spoon with a bend in the top of the handle next to my computer to hold down the control key when skilling up. <br />
<br />
The process is simple:<br />
1) Press down the control key.<br />
2) Slip the end of the spoon handle under the key to the inside of the control key so that the curve bends up under the next-door key.<br />
3) Gently let gravity hold the spoon in place. The weight of the spoon will hold the key down.<br />
4) (Optional) you may need to find the balance point with the spoon so it'll stay in place without falling over.<br />
<br />
Now you only have to use the mouse to click with. I alternate my hands so I can give them a rest.<br />
<br />
Note: you can not open containers while the control key is pressed so you might need to remove the spoon and replace it when switching bags.</div></div><hr />

While the visual on this is great... I think most people use a penny.  Might need to use a dime/nickel/quarter depending on your keyboard....<br />
<br />
Or tape, but I've never had tape at my desk, and my pockets almost always have a spare penny.<br />
<br />
P.S. I was really hoping you had some awesome balance spoon holding key down and the other end of the spoon pressing you're mouse button type thing going on for a second there.... that would have been impressive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The other that's important is proper posture and support for your arms (such as on your chair arms, if your computer desk and chair work that way).<br />
<br />
Drink plenty of water/fluids (dehydration is terrible for joints) and get up and stretch every once and a while if you're doing a long run.<br />
<br />
If joints are swollen and feel hot, then cool is good (like run under cool water for a few minutes, put your hands on top of your head so you get some blood out, etc.). If they're achy and stiff, then warm is good (Tiger balm feels wonderful - I also recommend tea tree oil as it soaks into your deep skin and upper muscles and does good).*<br />
<br />
And me - I do Advil Extra Strength Liqui-Caps. =)<br />

Just a couple pointers with it.<br />
1, Don't hit ESC with it held down, it used to crash you to deasktop not sure with the advent of normal EQW.<br />
2, You won't be able to send any kind of chat whit it held down.<br />
3, you can't open bags butyou can close them<br />
<br />
Also if you can't affored a trackball, sence they can cost upto 150 american dollors for one. Look into a optical mouse if you don't have one all ready. Max you mouse pointer movement rate in game, and learn how to move the coursor from one of the screen to the other with just your fingers.<br />
<br />
A good armrest is a must.<br />
<br />
Also if at any point you well any kind of pain in your wrist elbow or arm, stop clicking after that combine and flex you arm for a min or two and move all the joints you can in the arm, pop the fingers, wrist and elbow if need be. Basicly streach your arm, and hand every hour or so. It saves alot of pain in the end.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dunthor Warsmith</div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally go for comfortable mouse (Logitech Trackman Marble series has been my favorite.  The vanilla Trackman Marble, my fav, is no longer produced, so I've been stocking up from EBay, but I've used the modern incarnation at jobs and such (really easy to get a boss to get you a new mouse when you talk about becoming injured :P), and its pretty good as well.  Wired cost $40-50US, wireless $10 more.  Older ones generally go for similar prices on EBay).<br />
Also comfortable desk &amp; chair.  Experiment - do you need a wrist rest?  Do you need a chuck of desk in front of the mouse to allow for a straight arm?  What is your elbow resting on, and is that a painful pressure point?  How does the height of the chair arm compare to the desk, how does that make you hold your arm, and how does that impact the way it feels?  How is your arm situated during long runs, and is that helpful or harmful?  What is the desk edge like, sharp edge, rounded edge, raised edge, and is that changing how you hold your arm to deal with it?<br />
<br />
Just some of my own mental checklist ... goodluck on finding something that works for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morani</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since we're talking about how to avoid repetitive stress injuries, another useful thing is to vary how/where you rest your arm, wrist and hand. Find 3-4 comfortable positions and alternate between them. Each time you change the angle, you alter the stress on the complex system that makes up you hand. By altering it, you &quot;spread the stress around&quot; and make different parts work harder and others relax more. In addition to stretching, squeeze a ball (or something) in your hand a few times. <br />
<br />
Also, here's something I do when I'm working on someone with who has carpal tunnel; pressure. When I'm working on a wrist that is inflamed I wrap both my hands around it and squeeze hard (start out gentle and work up the pressure so you don't hurt the person). I then hold on for a few minutes and let up for a few. Rinse and repeat. The pressure relieves the pain for a while and forces the area to relax. If you are doing this to yourself, experiment with a book and a couple of rolled towels to find a comfortable way to press down on the book with your other arm.<br />
<br />
Someone once stressed the importance of stretching and “warming-up” BEFORE you do some extended activity like typing (or tradeskilling) and likened it to sports. Paraphrasing: “You would never consider getting up in the morning, throwing some shoes on and going out to run a marathon without stretching and warming up first, so why should it be different when you are going to TYPE a marathon?”</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Roll of clear scotch tape - for taping down the Ctrl key once i have my bags all set and ready to go. (its inexpensive, disposable, and easy to remove to chat or type)<br />
<br />
2. Nice long padded tube sock - with the toe area cut out. (Rolled up makes a very inexpensive and comfortable wristband)<br />
<br />
3. Emu oil products! This isnt the brand i have but is same effect : ((WindSoft™ Pain Relief is an all-natural pain reliever unlike any other. Most topical pain relievers contain only a small percent of pain reliever in a largely inactive chemical cream base. WindSoft™ Pain Relief is pure 100% essential oils and plant extracts, each one with recognized benefits, in a base of penetrating, anti-inflammatory 100% pure emu oil.))<br />
Boyfriend sent that to me and stuff works!</div></div><hr />

<br />
On my way to 250 JC this week my hands and wrists really started to hurt, and since I'm a computer support person IRL I couldn't have that happening.  So, I did 3 things:<br />
<br />
1.  Found something heavy to hold down the CTL key (thanks for the idea to the spoon person above).  In my case it's a can of vanilla frosting (I don't like vanilla frosting, so both it and I are safe with it on my desk.  The clear tape idea is nifty too, might have to check that out).<br />
<br />
2. Got my old ergonomic keyboard out and attached it to my new computer.  Has anyone noticed how keyboards are getting smaller and smaller?  Man, were my hands getting cramped together on the keyboard that came with my computer from Dell.<br />
<br />
3. Redid my new workstation at work to make it more comfortable.</div></div><hr />

However, I have problems sometimes while hunting swirling shadows in Shadeweavers.  I kill them usually in one round of combat, so I am switching my hands around a lot.  After about an hour and a half of this, I have to take a break for a few minutes to let my wrists rest.</div></div><hr />

I realized that I hadn't gotten up, hadn't eaten, gotten a drink, etc. in over 13 hours.  (Gotta love the weekends.)  <br />
<br />
When I get up after an EQ bender like that, which usually involves some farming and major tradeskilling, I can barely walk and every part of my body is screaming.  Mom suggested setting an alarm.  When I tried that, I kept telling myself, &quot;I just have to combine one more stack of xxxx and then I'll get up&quot;.  Then one more stack.  Then one more.

Well, it's a bit of a help for tradeskills, but I've found it even more help while playing the game - the Microsoft Strategic Commander.<br />
<br />
http://www.gamersdepot.com/accessories/microsoft/strategic_commander/001.htm<br />
<br />
It's basically a programmable pad/joystick for your left hand. Up to 72 commands can be held within 3 x 24 command profiles.<br />
<br />
I've got one main game profile, allowing me access to hotkeys, spells, and main game commands. A second profile for when I'm grouping, and the third is pretty empty, except for one button assigned to CTRL - guess what that' for!<br />
<br />
As I say, the spoon/coin/other hardware tricks for holding the CTRL key down work as well as this item for tradeskills, but I love having my whole arsenal of spells and hotkeys at hand. it's programmable through either the supplied software, or in-game. Very handy!<br />
<br />
If anyone's after one, there's one on ebay.co.uk for £6.50, and 2 on ebay.com ($23 and $9.99).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cendorly</div><div class="date">04-20-2003, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a logitech trackball that I have been using for as long as I can remember.  However, the problem I was having was that I was putting too much pressure on the palm of my hand while resting it on the desk or end of the trackball thingy, thereby not only causing hyperflexing of my wrist (and pain) but pressure pain on my palm.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, this was escalated to a major problem when I started baking and doing MTP's (long before I did smithing and tailoring).<br />
<br />
Anyway, the way I solved the problem was at the suggestion of a guildmate at the time who told me to get a wrist wrest, or try rearranging my desk.  The next day, I went to Office Depot, looked at their mouse wrist rests, found a nice gelled purple one and VIOLA!! Now my wrist is in a straight line with my hand, no pressure on any one point, and the wrist rest is actually quite comfortable.  I call it a pillow for my wrist  :D <br />
<br />
I can do tradeskills for hours on ends with endless combines/clicks, etc., with absolutely no pain at all.  I don't know what I would have done if I didn't find the wrist rest.  It definitely added to the comfort when I use my computer (not only play EQ, but also general computer use).<br />
<br />

<br />
Just an FYI from some one that already does have repetitive stress because of my job.  Wrist rests, regardless of the type are the fastest way to get Carpal Tunnel.  basically because you are then putting pressure right on that area of the wrist that the nerve runs through.  Was the first thing that the ergonomist got rid of when she re-did my work area.<br />
<br />
For me, when I do a long run at TS, I add pillows to the arm rest under my forearm (no extra pressure on the already sensitive wrist area.  Penny on the keyboard (as others have said make sure all your bags are open.<br />
I also switch to my non-dominate hand (it really isn't that hard to click with as it may seem)  then ice the arms after i'm done to keep the tendons from swelling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aandaie</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I found works well is to do things which pose stress in an equal and opposite action (ahah i typed &quot;faction&quot; first)<br />
<br />
Such as doing tradeskill stuff then later working at a job or riding a bike or something where your hands strongly grip, or perhaps squeezing a ball.<br />
<br />
For the most part, though, I found that through originally tradeskilling in UO then some in EQ that my wrists are kind of shot for it now and if I was to continue much I'd end up with carpal tunnel. For me, it is not worth it.<br />
<br />
If it is really bothering you, the best thing to do is stop. Don't fiddle with wrist things while doing it or junk, its time to stop. Its just not worth it in retrospect. &quot;Hey, it bothers me to type much now because I had to click on some tailoring slider in Ultima Online, a little game that was a piece of crap 5 years ago!&quot;  You just feel like an idiot now when you think that, for EQ it will eventually be the same way.<br />
<br />
Save up the tradeskill enthusiasm for games that do it easier instead, all games starting with Anarchy Online, World of Warcraft and probably SWG are not doing it the EQ way. In AO you add points to a tradeskill as you level, then you use the skill and you automatically always succeed if you had enough skill for said item, if you don't have the skill you can't even attempt to make the item instead it will say &quot;you need X amount of skill in mechanical engineering to do this&quot;. You ten go out and get some more XP, knowing what your goal is. So there is no making junk to get the skill up, there is no making junk and failing to make better junk, etc.<br />
<br />
Once again, it is not worth it.<br />
<br />
Valid suggestions, though, might entail not only getting in a good postiion in an ergonomic chair, but often changing it so your arm is not always in the same position. Don't have the arm resting on a wrist rest or anything (as the above poster said not to) As one poster who has a trackball shows, it may be best to have TWO devices and use the trackball sometimes then switch to a mouse. Keep your wrist guessing and it won't be as apt to get the repetitive stress because it will be constantly working in different ways. So these are all ways to prevent it BEFORE the damage is done, if the damage is done, as with me, its time to stop.</div></div><hr />
