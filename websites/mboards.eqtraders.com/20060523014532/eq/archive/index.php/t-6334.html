I have a Dwarven Cleric who's sole goal in life is to find as many trivials as she can. Her name is Clico, and her current skill is 20.  But I'm afraid if I say much more, I may derail your thread. <br />

Any who desire to help find trivials could sure check out<br />

Yeah, '20' points in smithing a smith do not thee make. But I will get there.</div></div><hr />

There are four bazaar merchants that sell for their dwarven alts on a fairly regular basis. My Dwarf is at 191 and slowly climbing, and my friend also has a dwarven alt near the same skill. The other two who generally sell in the bazaar, I know the merchant's names, but not the dwarf associated with them. I also know of at least two other dwarves that are either at or near 250 who don't generally sell in the bazaar as far as I know.<br />

He's the 250 dwarven smith of the Kettle.  Although he doesn't generally do combines for non-guildees, I'd be happy to see what terms he'd offer to an old friend of a guildee.  :)</div></div><hr />
