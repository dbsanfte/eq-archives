Since my real-life baking skill is about 2 (basically putting frozen dinners in the microwave and pressing &quot;start&quot; is all that is trivial to me...and even then I have decent failure rate :)  my wife will be handling the cooking.  She's good though, so I worry not.<br />
<br />
Everyone have a good time, get fat, sleep-in and be happy.<br />
<br />
See ya back here on Black Friday.<br />
<br />
Cheers.</div></div><hr />

Going to be a small, reasonably quiet gathering here this year. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It is that time of year where we here in the US of A gather 'round the table and feast in celebration of the bounty of the Earth and the good things that have come to us in the year past.   In honnor of that spirit, let me give a list of the things for which I am thankful this year. <br />
 The many friends I have made, both in and out of the digital realm of EQ.  The countless hours of fun and enjoyment had in their company.  The safety of my family, friends, and fellow citizens. The little things that often get over looked in the busy day; the love of a good cat, the smile of a happy child.  That once again, I've made it this far, and I have a wonderful journey still ahead.<br />
Thank you all that come to EQ Traders for adding a little brightness to my day, and sharing your experiences here.   May this festive time bring you warmth and the comfort of family. <br />
