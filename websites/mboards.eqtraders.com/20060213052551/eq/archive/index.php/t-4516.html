I will NOT do heraldic armor combines for free or even click combine on some ingredients for a fee - it's my biggest moneymaker and I don't like devaluing my market.  Special exceptions to this can certainly happen, but if you're some random joe, sorry, no dice.<br />
<br />
Tae Ew armor - I charge 3k per failed attempt, and 6k per successful attempt - you prepay 3k each attempt, and then tender the remaining 3k when item is traded to you<br />
<br />
Planar armor - uhhh umm people actually try to get this stuff? O.o<br />
anyhow, fails are free of charge, success is 5k per sheet/ring<br />
<br />
I will NOT look up recipies for you - ESPECIALLY since you're reading this here.  If you ask me what a recipie is, be prepared to have a large trout smacking you upside the head.  EQTraders is my main resource, and it should be yours as well.  <br />
<br />
I will not supply any components except smithy hammer, and a file, maybe flask of water if I'm in a good mood.  If you want a free combine, bring EVERYTHING<br />
<br />
Sickles and Acrylia plate are not to be resold - don't want to completely put other smiths out<br />
<br />
Do a /w all Kuronekosama before asking me.  If I'm not in the bazaar, nexus, ok, or maaaaaybe qeynos, then I'm not free to do the combine.  Deal with it - pestering me will make it so I don't want to do it.  <br />
<br />
No, I will not make you 300 metal bits - I'm not going to do your subcombines for your smithing, mmkay?<br />
<br />
Anyhow there you have it, any old human cultural or /gag seafarers is free.  Sickles are free in moderation - I'm not going to do 10 for you if you're a random person, 1 or 2 for a friend is ok  - Anything else should be just fine.</div></div><hr />
