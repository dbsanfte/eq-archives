<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zriza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Purified water can also be made by combining a foraged water reed (or moss root) with a purification tablet (about 3 sp cost) in a Tracker's Water Extracter (about 1.5 pp cost, 2 slot container)The tablet and extracter are bought from some cabilis merchants, including those outside of town (like Field of Bone).<br />
<br />
I've personally foraged water reeds at Lake of Ill Omen and the moss roots in Swamp of No Hope.  The combine makes 3 purified waters and is no-fail (it doesn't increase brewing, but I decided brewing was the best place to put this).<br />
<br />
Besides faction issues, the only problem with using this method is that the purification tablet is LORE and is consumed in the combine, so you have to stand next to the merchant and buy a new one for each combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NightGod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can buy purification tablet from the brewing vendor (forget her name) at the top of the &quot;newbie ramp&quot; in WFP that leads to NFP....had to get mine there back when that errand quest came out with PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zuklaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think each of the 4 zones outside Cabilis has one forage that can be turned into purified water, will have to take my Iksar Shaman out and verify.<br />
<br />
Well took a while, but here are the results:<br />
<br />
Lichenclover - Field of Bone<br />
Moss Root - Swamp of No Hope<br />
Sop Bark - Warsilk Woods - doesn't stack<br />
<br />
All combines of the above with a Purification Tablet in a Tracker's Water Extractor - yield 3 Purified Water.<br />
<br />
These I remember, but have not reverified.<br />
<br />
Water Reed - Lake of Ill Omen<br />
Wet Clay - The Overthere<br />
<br />
Verified: Water Reed, Wet Clay</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ozmandias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Most foraged items from Kunark work this way.  A long time ago when Kunark was still young I figured out how it worked and showed a Dev (there were a few other issues with it, like each combine locked your mouse up for 5 seconds, etc) and was told I was exploiting since &quot;purified water is not active in the game currently&quot; *shrug*  <br />
<br />
Left for DAoC for 6 months and came back and the dev was gone and a month or two later purifed water was in the game as a CE combine with a use.  I posted here about it, acutally was prolly the ezboard incarnation, and post was never replied to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zriza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How were you &quot;exploiting&quot; when many of the guards mention buying a water extractor, lol.  I didn't see the method under the recipes, so I thought I'd post it here in case it was cheaper than buying the solvent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cherryflavour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the tablets are not horribly common for sure, but acn be bought in other places I'll reply when I see more but I'm quite sure I saw one for sale in Fungus Grove when i was making faydwer shakers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Candiil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Frost Crystals can also be used to make purified water.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Footsore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Samfort Ruggen in Fungus Grove sells the Purification Tablets.<br />
<br />
He's the first merchant you come too, in the first building on the right, if you zone in from Echo Caverns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>tindiyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Grrrr  add another  box with a combine button that doesnt work anymore due to  new ui</div></div><hr />
