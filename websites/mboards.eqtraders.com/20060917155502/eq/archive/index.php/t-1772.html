It took me 108 combines just to get from 211 to 212 tailoring.  It then took me approximately 60 combines to get from 212 to 213.  Is it going to get any better or do I need to dump another 10k to get 2 points?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stop counting.<br />
<br />
It happens...<br />
<br />
I actually put skill ups in a separate window, then shrink the window so i can't see it.<br />
<br />
Then I do 100 combines or so, and check my skill... usually its up 1 or 2, a bit easier that way than constantly seeing no skill-ups.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just make sure your Int/Wis (depending on class) is as high as you can get it naturally.</div></div><hr />

I noticed I will start a tailoring session get a skill up in the first 5-10 attempts but then not get another in the next 25-50 attempts sometimes.  I have decided to combine for a skillup then do 5-10 more  if no second skill up  stop and save my components for my next session.  I am combining for skill-ups not for successes so I feel I am wasting my materials when I got a skillup and then blow through 25-50 more combines with no skill-up.  This has happened a few times so I am going try out my new method and see if it works for me.<br />

You know, I just can't imagine tailoring being much tougher than this pre-&quot;tailor-fix&quot; patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aelorean</div><div class="date">01-02-2003, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You may also be attempting things for which the trivial is very high.  This lowers your chance of getting skillups.  For example, if you're doing attempts on something that's trivial &gt; 250, you will get less skillups than doing items that trivial at 228.<br />
<br />
I find that I can get at least 1 skillup a stack doing cultural armor, while I can go 3 or 4 stacks without a skillup doing veliuos armor and I'm at tailoring 217.</div></div><hr />

This is the best voodoo I have yet encountered! It's like looking away from the screen while you click combine, which a lot of people do, but taken one step further. I'm gonna have to try this one soon :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyrdlan</div><div class="date">01-02-2003, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It helps, for me, to focus on average, instead of individual combines.<br />
<br />
The only problem comes when you have three or four consecutive points that are well above average and you watch that average start slipping upwards.<br />
<br />
My worst run was 143, done in many sessions over several days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ive just had 2 Skill ups from 211 to 213 in a total of 150 combines :(<br />
<br />
I know that if I stick it out Ill get some good runs too.....just hope I dont get too pissed off imbuing Emeralds and hitting the **** combine button !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pojodan</div><div class="date">01-02-2003, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At skill level 15 I did a run of 70 combines and got only 3 skill ups, considering I got 118 to 158 is about 250 more I'd say it was simply just a bad run...<br />
Basically after 118 everytime I'd do some combines I'd do 10.. if I got no skill ups I'd stop and go get a drink or something.. come back, do 10 more.. if I get a success, do 10 more.. repeat.  Longest bad run I had after that was 18.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MasterKrym</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have had Tailoring runs of 160 combines without skill ups (around 190 skill level) with multiple 50 plus runs also. It is not uncommon - just try to enjoy those runs wher eyou get 2 skillups in 10 combines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">data9724</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My worst streak were 300+ combines from 191 to 192. But generally the 190 range were at least 75 combines a try for me (were before they made it easier, dont know if that have anything to say), got better after 200 skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pisaster</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the worst I had was point #182 - 160 combines.<br />
<br />
What some folks said has worked for me:<br />
<br />
  1. Don't go for high trivial items, trivial just over your current skill means more successes, successes easier to lvl then failed combines.<br />
<br />
  2. Jack up your stats Int or Wis, Dex.  Dex seems to affect success rate, success affects skill ups. Your primary Wis/Int helps big time, I have a complete set of gear in the bank just for tradeskills to jack my Wis up over 262.<br />
<br />
  3. Practice costs, when you get to an item that is reasonably successful to make, start selling your results for reasonable profit in the bazaar, the profits can be re-invested to buying more supplies.  Currently my skill is over 220, by making reinforced acrylia armor that sells easier in bazaar, I get more money to buy more pelts, farming the ore saves me pp, and I can make the mantles, tunics, legs, instead of just making masks for skill (which don't sell for shiznit).<br />
<br />
  4. Patience.  Tailoring is THE worst skill to raise up in this game.  Fletching, Baking, Brewing, Pottery, Jewelry you can sit in one zone for a day and max out at 200, ya knew ahead of time the horrors from tailors, so be patient.<br />

<br />
Please try to avoid the &quot;My tradeskill is harder then yours.&quot;  <br />
<br />
While tailoring is hard, there's no reason to compare apples to oranges.<br />
<br />
There was more to this post, but It was irrelevant.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kinare</div><div class="date">01-04-2003, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before tailoring skill ups were improved I think I had one run where I had 260+ combines for one skill up. You younguns have it easy. =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velurian</div><div class="date">01-04-2003, 10:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's nothing unique to tailoring... I was stuck at 194 in JC for about 250 combines.  Really discouraging, since it coincided with a bad run of failures.<br />
<br />
But the RNG gave back what it took away -- I got 4 skillups in my next 30 combines, and didn't fail anything for several stacks afterward.  :D <br />
<br />
(Of course, having just gotten to 158 in tailoring, none of this should be taken as saying that I'm looking forward to the next bunch of points there...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tilnoom</div><div class="date">01-07-2003, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think we've all been there at one point.<br />
<br />
My worst ever run - from 194 to 195 took me 153 combines. I was only counting because I had sat down for a massive 300 combine session and was determined to hit 201 with the run (which incidentally, I did :) ). Pre-190, I was averaging out at about 1 skill up per 18 combines... so the 153 run came as a bit of a shock (although I knew I'd been riding my luck for some time).<br />
<br />
I have however been stuck at that point ever since. I tend to do anything between 1 and 20 combines in a session now.<br />
<br />
Incidentally... 80 combines and counting to 202 :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chenier</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My advice, just don't count how many combines. When I was tradeskilling hard, I'd make up a ton of components (mostly solstice robes) until either a) I didn't have any more bank/mule room to hold the supplies or b) the cash to support it. Then I'd do the combines, hopping up and down on every point.<br />
<br />
I have no idea how many combines it was. Nor do I wanna know.</div></div><hr />
