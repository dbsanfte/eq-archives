<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Waildar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im a new wizard who just hit 16 and found the mind numbing &quot;joy&quot; of spell research and I was wondering where can I find the Concordance of Research at. I bought the Lexicon, only to find its not what i need.....doh! (btw i am just making practice runes)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't bother making practice runes. You can't raise your research skill until you hit level 19.<br />
<br />
Even then its not worth it for the most part. Just sink your 5 training points into it every time you level up. Theres really nothing else worth dropping training points on for wizards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vihanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">To answer the question though...it's been a long time, but I believe you can obtain a Concordance of Research bygiving a greater lightstone to Smith Tv'Ysa in South Ro (for the evil types), or to Myrsila at the gypsy camp in North Karana.  Both of them will also take regular lightstones and give you a random book which lists some of the practice rune recipies, if you don't want to just find them on the web somewhere :cool: <br />
<br />
My little enchanter made her first 150 plat doing this quest, actually (we're talking ancient history here).  Hunted wisps for a week straight then made the big scary run from Freeport to North Karana.  The Concordance sells back to vendors for some decent change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mavick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have been playing up a magician and have not touched the practice runes at all.  Once I hit 20, I simply looked up the easiest research components I could find and made that spell until it trivialed or until I reached my level cap.  I'm 36 now and have no reason to think I've made a mistake.<br />
<br />
I admit I also bought some levels, but mostly I tried to keep as many training points as possible.  I just don't want to have zero points when the components start getting REALLY expensive in the higher levels.<br />
<br />
The components weren't all THAT hard to get (PoK vendor diving), and it saved me a great deal of time running around to the 'green' zones and farming weird (and sometimes unstackable) stuff.<br />
<br />
I know I've sunk some money into research, but I can consider it a good investment/trade in increased exp/played time.  And once you reach 20, LDoN helps a great deal with both leveling and plat!<br />
<br />
So... long story short, buy some levels and research some spells.  It will work out bettter in the long run.<br />

That is true but you left out some details..Click on this link and you can learn about that..This is also an awesome necro site so check it out while you are on it..http://necro.eqclasses.com/guides/research.asp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">right in the FAQ (sticky thread so its up at the top with a couple of others) there is the following:<br />
<br />
Q. Components seem really rare, is there any other way I can advance my Research skill?<br />
<br />
A.  Yes, there are a few ways.  First, you can make swatches (http://www.eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=125&amp;rsa=Spell%20Research&amp;sub=other&amp;sb=item&amp;menustr=080105120000) for the INT Caster Robes introduced in the LoY expansion.  <br />
<br />
Or, you can do the Concordance of Research quest and try  Practice Research (http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g91&amp;menustr=040095000000).  The Concordance of Research quest can allow any of the four research classes to create Practice Runes from various items that are not spell components.  The quest for good alignment characters is here: Research Aid (Allakhazam) (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=374), the quest for evil alignment characters is here: Evil Research (Allakhazam) (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=303.).  Esentially, give lightstones to the NPCs to get copies of the Research Tomes I &amp; II, and a Greater Lightstone to get the Concordance of Research, a six slot book/container used to make Practice runes only.  Once made, each pair of Practice Runes must be combined in your regular/advanced research tome. By the way, the Concordance sells for ~9p at vendors!<br />
<br />
Finally, if you have enough Training Points and Platinum, you can train your skill all the way to 200.   Note: Only the actual guildmaster in the caster guilds can train you all the way to 200.  The other trainers can train you only so far (possibly 185.)  Trainers in PoK can also train you to 200.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There are a few handy links there, including the quests for good &amp; evil aligned characters to get the Concordance of Research.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Yanari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have been playing up a magician and have not touched the practice runes at all.

<br />
Mavick is right.  Don't waste your training points for low level skill ups.  Save those training points for the time when components are no longer easily available or cheap.  This is especially true if you are going to take your skill to 200.  <br />
<br />
Practice runes (I'm convinced) are simply a waste of time and effort.  They require a lot more ingredients and result in a useless item (which you can sell to a vendor).<br />
<br />
Low level spell ingredients are easy to find on the PoK and bazaar merchants.  You can take your skill to 142 this way.  I bought the points after that from the guildmaster.  It got pretty expensive toward the end, but was well worth the investment.  <br />
<br />
Making and selling one copy of Cannibalize IV repaid me the cost of those final skill points, with some change to spare (4kpp on my server).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Smartheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am a wizard. Smartheart is my one and only character. 200 research skill and a bank full of components.<br />
<br />
On Saryrn server - every researchable spell is for sale in the Bazaar for very low prices. I make sure critical spells like Circle of Force are available at low prices. <br />
<br />
If you need a spell - buy it in Bazzar - OR - get the components and on Saryrn we get shoots and /ooc's all the time in PoK for a master researcher to do a combine for someone who has accumulated the components. (I do for free for those that offer to donate &amp; always form a group so that rare failures are observed)<br />
<br />
Since all the spells are available for very little plat in the Bazaar, the reason to become a Master researcher is to make money making spells and selling them in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
Since the rate at which you level depends on your INT I hoarded runes until I was about level 50 (prior to LoY) and then did all my combines - made most efficient use of the runes I had. (I think I got to about 188 that way - then bought my way to 200 after LoY was released). <br />
<br />
I saved runes from groups. <br />
Since I was/am a quad kiter, I collected lots of runes quadding.<br />
My friends saved runes for me.<br />
My guild members were very generous in donations ( I offered to buy at all times for vendor prices)<br />
<br />
Hope my experience helps you. Good Luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>cannyar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i'm just curious. what does everyone bother to save their training points for? i'll admit i dumped about 100 into research to bring it up to 200. i still have 30 or so and have no use for them at all. you can't use them on tradeskills, i've learned all my languages from other players. spells and skills go up through use. am i missing something here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Some classes have a harder time raising skills than we do. Int casters tend to have points left over.<br />
<br />
<br />
But say you're a warrior... you use 1HS all your life then suddenly one day when you're 60+ you get a nice 2 hander. You have 0 2HS skill.<br />
<br />
Know how hard it is to raise a 0 skill weapon when you're 60+? Especially with low int/wis?  Its agony.<br />
<br />
Other things people commonly blow points on: Poison Making, Disarm, Conjuration (wizard and rangers only... as we wizards have only 2 conj spells prior to getting familiars and they are both mostly useless... fizzling multiple bars of mana trying to get flappy is no fun... also rangers don't get their first dot spell till way in... level 35 or something and only 1 other conjuration spell before that which is useless)<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are other examples.<br />
<br />
I blew all mine on research and conjuration.</div></div><hr />

i'm just curious. what does everyone bother to save their training points for? <br />
Most it's just paranoia for me. Who knows when SOE will implement some kind of new skill that you have to train? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Disgaeaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm a lv 16 wizard and i was wondering why i get a message say that i can't combine the items in this container. What i'm trying to make is the spell called Project Lightning. I have the fallowing itemsrune of fulguration, rune of periphery, and lexicon. what am i doing wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Keep in mind that as a tailor you can also increase your research skill by doing scribed swatches.<br />
<br />
Keep your eyes open for the spell components that are used in scribed swatches everytime you hit the bazaar. Rememer that even those swatches you can't use for tailoring robes yourself can still give you a skillup in research and selling that swatch on to tailors of the right race who can't themselves scribe the swatches will at least pay for the cost of the components.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Alindawyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There are two different runes of Fulguration.  One is used for the level 16 spell Project Lightning, the other is used for the level 29 spell Energy Storm.  They're not lore and there's no way to visibly distinguish between them even if you have one or more of each, other than they won't stack with each other because they're different items.<br />
<br />
I think you can cast identify and tell which one is Azia (for Project Lightning) and which one is Beza (Energy Storm), but I don't remember if that worked.  It's been ages since I researched those spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bregalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">At low end, research can't go up till you hit 19. Cap is (lvl-15)*5, meaning at 18 your cap is still 15 - and you already have 16 from that starter point.  Concordance stuff is waste of time.  You want my advice on research - resist the temptation at this time.  Make sure you stash all the components you come across at this point.  Make a storage alt for them if needed.  Get your research-only spells on bazaar.<br />
<br />
Once you get to 30's, you should have acquired some more INT items, or if you are ok tough it out till 46 when you can get the extra 25int boost from KEI.  Now, sort through your stash, and do all the combines possible, starting with the easiest.  If you start stashing early, you should be able to get all the way to cap. (at 30, cap is 60).  At 39, once you pass 100, head to Gunthak and pick up your advanced research tome.<br />
<br />
High-end research: once lvl 49 spells go trivial, it's onto advanced recipes.  Though I'd say once you are at 170+,  just buy up the rest of the skill with training points.  But you also can scour the bazaar and look for cheap advanced runes.  I know on Xev, a lot of common components sell in 5pp vicinity.  However, do the math.  Training 199-&gt;200 costs 68pp, and ones before it only slightly less.  Say if you buy 5pp runes and it costs you 10pp per attempt, and you get skillups more often than once in 12 attempts - that might be a viable thing to do, especially factoring in potential spell sales.  Personally, I found that spending 30 of my 100+ remaining points and ~2kpp at a trainer was a far less tedious option.<br />
<br />
Research viability: the real question you should ask is weather you'll be able to constantly monitor bazaar, seeking rare components at bargain prices, so you can combine and sell premium spells.  I have a trader bot running on secondary box almost 24/7, which allows me to snag a lot of bargains.  There are very few spells sub-PoP spells that still command premium prices.  I cannot say for mage/wiz/necro spells, though I know that certain runes for wiz spells like EER and GSS are rarer than spells themselves.  Levitation and Everlasting Breath sell well.  Dementing Visions, Speed of the Brood and KEI for chanters.  Malo/Torpor for shamen, though Malos/Quiescence are slowly driving them out.  Moonfire for druids, and Divine Intervention/Blessing of Aegolism for clerics.  Remove Greater Curse is highly prized, though Yaeth 73 right needed for it is insanely rare.  <br />
<br />
Basically, if you have strong bazaar presence, there's good money to be made from research.  I made over 200kpp on research alone in past half year.</div></div><hr />
