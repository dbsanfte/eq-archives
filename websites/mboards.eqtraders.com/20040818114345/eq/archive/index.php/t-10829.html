<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i went vendor diving today and got my level 49 ice comet spell today.  is it really that cheap now or did somebody goof.  glad i got it as i'm a wizard though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kahmon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It happens when a spell drops and nobody of that class is in the group. I have found EVERY ShadowKnight dropped spell except for 2 on vendors. The 2 I have not found are both rare drops from 1 particular mob each. A friend of mine even found the driud pet spell on a vendor once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ice comet is an old world research combine.. and yeh, i've noticed a few on vendors recently.  Most likely it's just some  wizzie trying to get a few points in his research instead of buying it up.  After so many combines of spells, it gets old /t'ing every wizzie of the appropriate level to see if they need a copy.<br />
<br />
As for dropped spells on vendors, i've noticed more and more of the ones that used to be &quot;rare.&quot;  LDoN has flooded the servers with stuff to research the 50+ spells, so a good many of them simply aren't rare any more.. which is great for casters, bad for bazaar vendors.<br />
<br />
I've gone to asking people if they need spells now, before buying.. where it used to be there was some spells you bought if you were lucky enough to find.<br />
<br />
Grats on your new boom spell :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cragzop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm sure that the ice comet drops are from folks like me that were working on their research skills. One day I cleaned out my bank of the two runes and ended up with 12 ice comets.<br />
<br />
I personally held onto them to give to other aspiring wizards but I can see selling them to a vendor to free up space.</div></div><hr />
