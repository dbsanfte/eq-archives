<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Balderak Stormlight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Finally dinged the big 250 late last night.<br />
It has taken 1 and a half years and thousands of combines but I got there in the end!<br />
<br />
I was usually getting roughly 2 skill-ups every 200 Picnic combines. Last night however, I did 200 combines and got a whopping 7 skill-ups!!! I'll never understand how it works :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, a big thanks to my fantastic Guild, Twilight Brethren, who helped me throughout with nice PoP meat drops etc.<br />
<br />
Now I turn my attention to my Spoon :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>cannyar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">what are the odds on creating a trophy? anyone know for sure? i know it's your base skill. what's the difference from say 200 to 250? i had read so many horror stories about repeated tries on here i was very nervous after shelling out 5k for an artisan seal and trying the combine. oh, as a side note, you can not make the spoon in a collapsable bowl. i tried. it said it couldn't combine the items in this container. so i did it in the Bazaar oven just fine. combined on the first try. i am very happy. since i don't have the AA points to blow i would try for other trophies if i thought i had a semi-remote chance.</div></div><hr />
