<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Candien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone found a good spot to &quot;farm&quot; these? They been lacking in the bazaar lately</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Elyssanda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">*snicker* you mean these actually are farmed somewhere? I've only seen them on vendors.<br />
<br />
(Sorry couldn't resist.. am dopey this early in the morning and it just struck me as funny)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Deedolith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">on Tunare, I always find 2 to 6 in the bazaar, getting them at a reasonable price was another issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Candien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Notice the &quot;farm&quot; :D <br />
<br />
Am just collecting for Cultural Robes, and Bazaar is getting empty for Tears :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Anaxo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I used to farm them from vendors when I was working on research swatches. ;)<br />
<br />
Seriously speaking, there's not really an efficient way to mob farm old world research components, since they randomly drop off the appropiate level mobs. The best way is the vendormine them off highly traffic merchants and merchants that exist close to zones that hold mobs high enough to drop Tears of Prexus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mewkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Do you know the appropriate level for mob to drop Tears? Do they only drop in the old world or can they drop in Kunark/Velious/etc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Candien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Saw one drop in HS near Drus, so guess its from fairly high lvl Kunark mobs :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Andara Lan`Gstrom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have seen tears of prexus drop from giants on the Naggy run too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Teledriel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Diid the same thing, and still do. Every day , when I first log in, I pretty much run the Vendors around PoK Eastern Tradeskill building and PoT vendors and buy things I need if they are there. The Eastern Tradeskill building is usually the one most dump to when they head for the bank, espcially the ones on the bank side. (Found Earthtwine silk once this way :D ).  Always see Tears of Prexus on them. <br />
<br />
Now if the silly Tailoring Cleric can just have enough PP after dots for the ribbons.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sharrien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I seem to remember a lot of tears dropping in acrylia caverns.  So check the kitty venders in grimling forest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ChaseFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've had good luck finding LoY cultural robe items on the Jaggedpine merchants and the merchants at the lighthouse in Gunthak. I suspect the merchants near the bank in Thurgadin would also be good (and I may just check there when I get home tonight!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Candien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks for the replys, guess Vendor diving works the best :)<br />
<br />
And now to the Berries :boggled:<br />
<br />
So ubah, found 37 berries in Baz :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aamdor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Dont forget Runes of Sorcery and Nilitim's Grimoire P.115.  At tailoring 201, they will help the skillup path as well.  I have seen quite a few tears drop in Seb but never have &quot;farmed&quot; them so can't really confirm this as a good spot.  Occassionally have found them in bazaar for quite reasonable prices (&lt;=10p).  It takes me about a month of heavy vendor mining to get about 100 attempts worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Candien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sylvan Berries a too hard to make Runes of Sorcery a viable option imo, way easyer to make Solstice to 210 and get the 2 free skill ups..<br />
<br />
Only thing is, its kinda hard to make Solstice with 500pp left after spending all the money on it :boggled:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Optimum1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've had steady Tears drop at my fave undead camp in Nadox. I solo 8 or so on the rotation and I have been getting one or two an hour. I'd kill myself before I'd actually &quot;farm&quot; them though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Cherryflavour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you need to make celestial Essence - <br />
<br />
http://everquest.skystorm.net/EQStorymods/storyCelestial.txt<br />
<br />
You can download this storyline window addon I made, lists all items that can be used to make Celestial Essence, all are drops, and one can be bought on a few vendors. All info inside it came from EQTC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Benthair Dunthat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Not sure if it is worth the time/trouble for the reward - but I am getting 3-4 Tears each evening I play (3 hrs or so) from the grimlings at the entrance area in Acrylia Caverns. Also of course the acrylia ore drops are nice. I am farming that area with a 65 monk/56 druid without any problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Optimum1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Cherry, he clearly stated the ingredients were for cultural robes and furthermore, wouldn't you be more blueberry flavored?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kirstie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If you can ae sebilis, tears drop there a decent amount.   Don't try to just do one camp, I really only see any reasonable number drop when we spend time just aeing half of the top floor.<br />
<br />
Kirstie</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Back in my quading days I seem to recall them dropping quite often off the Raptors in Timorous Deep.</div></div><hr />
