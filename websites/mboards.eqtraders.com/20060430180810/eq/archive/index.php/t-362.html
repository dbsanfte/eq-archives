<br />
I am sorry if this question has been asked before,  I looked on the old board and just could not find the answer.  My dwarven smith has a skill of 210 unmodifed.  I trolled the boards and found the recipe for Etheral Metal Rings, and they are trivial at 246.  Well, I see on the boards that it cannot be used as skill ups.  Is that true?  Even if it is not trivial, you won't get skill?  If someone could answer my question, I would really appreciate it.  My EQ time is whittling down, and smithing in PoK would just be too cool.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

On top of it, you need to have a unmodified skill of 210 to even attempt the combines, and they SUPPOSEDLY then trivial at 212.<br />
<br />
Doesn't make much sense, but the block was put in place to keep people from powering smithing/tailoring from skill 200-250</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will do that with my smith when I get to that point (Do ethereal for 2 points); ethereal is much easier than anything else.</div></div><hr />
