<br />
I have 6 Scale Tempers.  If anyone has Tae Ew Blood (and Pristine Tae Ew Scales, not required), but needs a Scale Temper to make a Lizard Blood Temper... please just ask.<br />
<br />
I will continue looking for Tae Ew Blood &amp;amp; Iksar Blood on my own, but I am also willing to help out my friends here.<br />
<br />
P.S. The Scale Tempers ran me about 15p each, so I'm not looking for any compensation... but if you want to bring me some Morning Dew, I won't say no. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
We need Pristine Scales!<br />
<br />
I still need 1 Tae Ew Blood (still have 2 Scale Tempers, so that's 1 spare), but I only have 1 Pristine Scale right now... I really want 5 more, 'cause I really want some Tae Ew Plate Greaves!<br />
<br />
The sad part is, I know some 51+ Plate wearers for whom the Tae Ew Chain Tunic (and possibly Leggings) would be an upgrade!</div></div><hr />

I can't wear the chain or plate, but I know folks who can ; )</div></div><hr />

<br />
5k each is not a fair price for Tae Ew Blood (especially how common it's reported as being).<br />
<br />
I'd personally pay 1k each, but no more.  It's not worth more than that to me, since I'm not terribly interested in making anything but the Plate.<br />
<br />
Iksar Blood is a bit more rare... I'd think 500p each is fair, since it's not needed for the recipies that most people are going to be doing right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The hardest pirate ship in Dulak Harbor, the Windscorn, is populated by DE casters and Iksar melee. Had a group there for an hour and walked out with over a stack of iksar blood and one blue diamond. Not to mention all the elf blood and various racial meats and body parts...<br />
<br />
My group consisted of mid/high 50's and the encounters got exciting at times with pulls of 3 or more. Very high aggro range on that boat. Experience rate was low for tons of dark blues.<br />
<br />
<br />
From the other boats:<br />
2nd hardest (Oceancrasher): gems (diamonds &amp; lower) and a decent chain bracer<br />
3rd hardest (Dandolak's Run): dry, but we got our cleric Temperance quest items we were after there<br />
4th hardest (Lady Dirulia): gems (like you'd see drop off Seafuries) dropped like candy. I kid you not.<br />
Easiest (Stormwave), nearest the zone line: was already camped :(</div></div><hr />

There are lots of coerced Iksar, so they may drop it?<br />
<br />
I'll go check first chance I get unless someone knows for sure that it doesn't drop there.<br />
