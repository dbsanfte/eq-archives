<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>subzero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well,i'm now trying to get my little bard skilled from155 to 188<br />
need lots of leather paddings i think.<br />
could anyone tell which zone has more animal skin and spiderling silks drop?<br />
thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Elyssanda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hun, many threads regarding this in the tailoring area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>grossbottom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A new hunting ground I've discovered is Innothule Swamp. The newbie area near Gukta seems overrun with spiderlings. Probably the highest concentration I've seen anywhere. Coupled with occasional trips to the mini spiderling dungeon in Field of Bone, and you'll have enough silks to choke a Trakanosaurus. <br />
<br />
Just watch on the faction thing...two froggie guildmasters are in the area, and they definitely agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Those are two good places.  I spent a lot of time in FoB getting the silks.  The Ferrott is another good zone with a lot of spiderlings.<br />
<br />
However, I found that the best place is Shadeweavers.  If you kill the lesser shades, they drop shadeling silks and sometimes swirling shadows.  Keep both.  If you use shade silk thread and LQ rockhopper hides, you will make leather padding too.  You cannot use this thread with regular pelts though.  I found that they are both pretty easy to come by.  The swirling shadows are used to make the shadowscream armor, which will take you up to 250 (if you choose to farm your way up here.)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drakkiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">While farming for my shar vaul smithing i picked up 160+ Silks and because i was passed padding didn't think about picking up the LQ MQ HQ hopper hides that i was seeing...   Was out by PoK book and back to the NPC tents.  Give it a few mins and you'll figure out the area ok.  Just slaughter it all cause most of it drops something useful</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Liandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One thing about the area around Gutka.  The spiderlings only spawn during the day.  At night they are replaced by Skeletons and Zombies.  <br />
<br />
So by day you can collect silks for padding and by night zombie skins for pottery vials. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>scharazade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I used the luclin way.   <br />
<br />
If you are a wannabe tailor you will pass a lot of time killing rockhopper for their flawless and perfect hide.  If to be a tailor does not interest you then find a tailor to hunt with him. He would be happy to have someone help him kill the beast and take the least interesting hide.  I never had to work too hard on the hide for ther padding because of that.  I had simply too much of them because I was working on my tailor skill at the same time. <br />
<br />
Since you have the hide you now have to kill everything that move in shadeweaver ticker in the part of the zone were you get the silk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Froakakhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">have done about 4 chars to 190 smithing now solely for the shawl, and the best method i have found for getting the padding is this:<br />
<br />
for pelts i took my wizard to EK, used his staff of temperal flux to pull about 20-25 mobs at a time (doesnt take more then a minute per pull), then used Jyls static pulse to AoE them, i try to pull everything i see to get the zone respawning and after about 45 minutes of doing this it goes smoothly.  Have found that the AoE will kill everything except for the black spiders, usually they will run after the first aoe, but most stay together so i follow them and aoe again.  you can get MQ and HQ cat pelts off the lions pretty fast, i get about 50 per 2 hours of AoE, then just cut them down to LQ.  Also you can get snake eggs and spider silks, the snake eggs are now used for high lvl baking so you can either sell them or give to friend/guildie, and the spider silks sell well also or (if you dont have tailoring already for the shawl make Wu's armor with these) can give them also to friend/guildie i average about 200-250 silks per 2 hour hunt.  I usually just hae Po9 and KEI and my health/mana never drop below 80.  he is level 61 btw, cant remember level on the AoE tho.  Move between the ares, up on the mountain where tarbul roams, down in the plains.<br />
<br />
the spiderling silks are a little harder, before they implimented the ogre newbie quests i got all of mine in feerrott, but now i use my ranger (leveled to 30 solely for farming :P) and track them in Nek forest.  if you sold the  snake eggs/spider silks you can use the money to buy ling silks in bazaar (did with my last and finaly char) easy way to get both of what you need.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps as it would have helped me when i started that tedious shawl so long ago ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If your Bard is a Wood Elf you could attempt to get past Fine Plate by doing the LDoN Chain... Just a Thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>FeroceFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Seeing as bards are a plate class, I don't get your point.  LDoN chain is nice, though, for just about any class that isn't a silk/leather type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I found the best place was in ShadeWeavers.  Lesser Shades there drop tons of silks, plus you can pick up swirling shadows for higher level smithing (or selling.)  There are hoppers there that drop pelts too.  I downgraded any medium quality to low quality, discarded any ruined pelts and kept all the HQ ones to make backpacks.  There are also little blue mushroom looking things that are  groundspawns that yuo can use to make Shar Vahl Essence, that will take your brewing up to 187.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>dmuerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If your going the luclin route the best place to get thet low quality pelts are maru seru, gather alot of the little &lt;bleeps&gt; there and pbae them all.  I easily got enough for 5 stacks this way one day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Laeamilea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">For silks I'd suggest shadeweavers like the others, the xakra worms drop 1-4 most of the times and of course there are the lesser shades to kill.  <br />
<br />
For hides, marus seru, pop off the greyhoppers, they almost always drop a pelt and only have 2 possible drops, greyhopper hide and lq rockhopper hide.  Much much faster than killing rockhoppers.</div></div><hr />
