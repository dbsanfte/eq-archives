Never did like the print quality of Lexmark printers when I sold computers for a living anyhow.<br />
<br />
They just didn't seem vibrant, like they were trying to save ink by not being too dark or something.<br />
<br />
We'd be getting paid more to sell them than the HP's, and I still couldn't get myself to do it, DPI be damned, look at the printout ;).<br />
<br />
Granted that is 3 years ago, times are different now.<br />

GL in the search, hope you land in a better place.</div></div><hr />

Desktop printers, eh? That's a rough market. Too many companies fighting for the market share...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know, probably every big company in the US works like this, the fat cats get fatter and the rest of us wallow in the streets. But still. I vowed never to drink from Starbucks again after they charged emergency workers on September 11 for water for the victims, and I've held to that ever since. So no Lexmark merchandise for me or my extended family.</div></div><hr />

It really is sad to see how today, a single person is getting a &quot;bonus&quot; that could pay 5 people for a year. Yay capitalism  :roll:</div></div><hr />

<br />
FIVE PEOPLE??? Please tell me where you live. I (and many others) would LOVE to make 20% of the $250,000 each of those five people would make that year. <br />
<br />
I'd put the number closer to 35-50 people splitting his bonus.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately that all looks all too familiar...<br />
<br />
An interesting added bit of info; about a year ago, Allstate Insurance decided that any printers that need to be replaced will be replaced with Lexmarks (nation wide). That's a LARGE number of printers. However, Allstate has it's own outsourced tech-support... (BTW, USE to be HP's)<br />
<br />
If you are still in your apartment and need to break the lease, find someone to take your apartment. Not as a Sub-Lease but as a new lease. A landlord can not charge you loss of rent if there IS NO loss of rent. If you break your lease and someone starts a new one the day after yours ended (for the same space), they can complain but that's it. Any fee for breaking a lease pretty much comes from the idea of loss of income from the property.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That sucks about the situation.  Yes, the rich get richer in all big corps.  But look how he &quot;took one for the team&quot; in 2001...only $150k bonus.  See?  He was hurting.  He so obviously deserved the $1million bonus in 2002.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i worked for a company who cut my hours so that my general manager could get a larger bonus. she was already getting one; she wanted a BIGGER one, so cut all of our hours down so that we could no longer get benifits. she moved my hours to when i was in school, and i had to quit because i couldn't file for unemployment (can't do that if you're a student). i reported her to our internal unfair business practices hotline (we had our own hotline---that should have been a blaring warning sign), yet years later she's moved up in the company.<br />
<br />
i worked for another company who bribed a 22 year old employee to keep her mouth shut about unfair business practices. they couldn't afford to fire her/let her go or she would tattle on them. her christmas bonuses were larger than our yearly salaries. <br />

As I have sadly found out, small business are just as bad.<br />
<br />
Worse even... because they cultivate this &quot;we really care about you&quot; image... that's completely false. At least big companies don't pretend to be nice!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've read several times about companies dumping a CEO who has almost ran them into the ground, and giving them a BONUS when they let them go. Unbelievable.<br />
<br />
(Its probably a clause in their contract, but the clause should have a loophole in case the CEO performs badly, imo)<br />
<br />
P.S. Screw NAFTA. That needs to be repealed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And, as much as I hate to say this after Enron, there is more accountability at a larger company.<br />
<br />
When an accountant hired to straighten things out at a company that's a month behind on payroll says, &quot;Your problem isn't that you're not making enough money...&quot; before being hustled out the door, you have to wonder.</div></div><hr />

Just the thread has moved on to the discussion of &quot;dirtbag employers&quot; and as such belongs elsewhere now. <br />
