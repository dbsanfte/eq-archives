   I just made the spell Everlasting Breath with Yaeths Pg 63 left and right.  This is the Recipe for the Enchanter version, But the spell says that is use able by Enchanters, Druids and Shamans. <br />
 I have heard that the Enchanter Components are easier to find than the Priest class components, So i hope this helps you guys out.<br />

EDIT:  Ok i feel like a total schmuck now :(  , i swear that i read that the preist recipes  were priest only useable, and the caster Recipes were caster only useable. That is why i posted.  But after looking around the MBs some more i found that this wasn't true and has been posted.  I tried to delete the post but it wouldn't let me.  My bad. sorry.</div></div><hr />
