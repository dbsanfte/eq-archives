<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In the midst of exploring this new zone I was invited on a couple of adventures with some friends, so I didn’t get to explore it as much as I would have liked.  But the zone is very similar to Jaggedpine Forest, even down to being able to forage plant shoots.  The mobs are much lower level, but there are griffons and anaconda.  Has anyone found them to drop meat?  I only had time to kill two or three of each.  I didn’t see any meat drop, but that was a very small sample.  If they drop meat this zone will make baking much easier to grand master.<br />
<br />
Just in case someone might be interested, I’ll add the zone description I posted on my guild’s web page:<br />
<br />
Well, I visited the new zone last night.  The graphics are really nice, with an ocean beach, two waterfalls and lots of trees.  There are bears, wolves, panthers, griffons, turtles and frogs.  I also found schools of salt-water fish swimming together in the crystal clear water.  All the animals were very green to me at 62, but someone in OOC said that everything was blue at level 34.  For the moment the only way to get there is to run through Jaggedpine Forest, which is a much higher level zone.  But there is a wayfarer’s camp near the water and I expect that at some point we’ll be able to access the zone via the adventure camps.  <br />
<br />
This will be a nice addition for mid level characters.  The zone is very reminiscent of Jaggedpine Forest, including the ability to forage plant shoots, but with lower level mobs.  It will make a very good hunting area for many characters.  I found some of the animals to be aggressive, such as the wolves and bears, but others, such as the turtles, frogs and ancient anaconda, completely ignored me.  <br />
<br />
This is also a great zone for farming pelts.  I looted several varieties of bear and wolf pelts, including high quality bear pelts, while I was there.  I’m hopeful that griffon and anaconda meat will also drop, but I didn’t see any from the few creatures I killed.  I did a little fishing, but thunder salmon were the only zone specific fish I found.  There are a few things you can make from the salmon, but nothing extraordinary. <br />
<br />
From what I’ve read this new zone is simply a staging area for a new expansion connected to the wayfarers.  Still, it’s useful in and of itself.  It’s a good zone for level appropriate characters, it provides a new source for some trade skill items and it’s graphically appealing.  All in all not a bad deal for a zone added during a patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nepper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Was this zone added to all servers?  I must have missed that message in the update.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Iannyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have a feeling this was the new Stormhammer only adventure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The message wasn’t exactly in the update.  There was a hint about talking to the town criers that was supposed to lead us to the new zone.  Plus Sony seems to have “broken” the port gem from Surefall to JP for a time that dropped some people into this new zone.  The SF port gem worked fine for me and then I ran across JP to the blocked tunnel that was no longer blocked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope.  I asked the similar question in the tailoring thread.  It is live on all servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Myrrha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've killed all of 5 griffons and gotten 4 meats, and foraged a few plant shoots.  Where was this zone when I was getting GM in JP? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Now I'm excited, sounds like my 31 druid can hunt here!<br />
<br />
Altho I'm wondering if killing critters here will mess up my critter faction in JPF...being somewhat true to druidishness I haven't killed bears or wolves anywhere yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Woo Hoo!!  I’m glad to hear that the griffons drop meat.  Perhaps the ancient anaconda do as well.  I only killed about three griffons and two anaconda with no meat drops. I’m happy to see I was just having a bit of bad luck.  <br />
<br />
Grenoble, I wouldn’t worry about faction hits.  There are only two zones that I’m aware of that give faction hits for killing animals.  Don’t kill the bears in Surefall Glade or you’ll tick off all the locals.  For some reason the bears in Surefall don’t like Vah Shir shaman.  I had one aggro on me once when heading to Jaggedpine to buy cheese when I was about 30th level.  I knew better than to kill it so I headed towards the zone line, with several of the locals hot on my tail, quite literally.  And killing the bears, wolves or cats in Jaggedpine will lower your faction with the locals in that zone.  The griffons, wisps and anaconda are faction free so you can kill them to your heart’s content.  But these are the only zones where you have to be careful.  You can kill bears and wolves for days on end in places like East Commons and North Karana without taking any faction hits.  The only reason not to kill these critters when playing a druid or ranger is for role-playing reasons.  And personally I feel that it’s the role of druids and rangers to keep the population of these animals from becoming too large as well as from becoming endangered.<br />
<br />
While in this new zone I killed griffons, cats, wolves, bears, snakes and turtles.  None of them gave a faction message.  So it seems this zone is perfectly safe to hunt in.  And if the griffons are indeed dropping meat I expect this will be a heavily hunted zone indeed.  Unfortunately, I bet those who can gain experience from the kills will have to compete with high level characters who need the hides for tailoring/smithing and the meat for baking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thank you for the help, Cal!<br />
<br />
As to competing with high-levels, I've become used to it.  I hung in Everfrost for a bit...my main is doing pies so I thought I could use the mammoth meat, but the mammoths were also giving me excellent xp!    Same with crag spiders in EK from level 25-27.<br />
<br />
To no avail.  Every time I'd start tracking one...'you have lost your target'.  <br />
<br />
Although on the plus side, some ubers killed the corrupted mammoth in the Wayfarer camp and I got my chilled tundra epic piece <br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">hehe i was killing the corrupted mammoth at lv 30.  not very uber and that was solo.  it rotted i think every time.  might not have once or twice but i killed very many mammoths.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I’m kind of sorry Sony placed a wayfarers’ camp in Everfrost.  What happens, and I say this from personal experience, is that people end up waiting around either to get into a group or for other group members to show up and they get bored.  And when they get bored they start killing things.  The mammoths have always been over camped in EF because they are one of the few mobs at that level that give both good experience and good loot.  And with the adventure camp set in the middle of the main spawn area the poor beasts have an even shorter life expectancy.  <br />
<br />
Realizing what’s going on, I’ve tried not to kill the mammoths.  Though I must admit to having killed a few.  Instead I try to buff those who are hunting them for experience or I hunt snow orc troopers for their wrist bands and turn them into Halas for faction.  <br />
<br />
Obviously it’s too early to tell whether we’ll have the same problem in NL.  Hopefully the critters will respawn quickly enough to provide everyone with something to hunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">god i love mammoths at the levels they are exp.  not too hard and great loot.  exp is also **** good.  need to get meat from ew mammoths but comp is slow and hard to kite them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>casikoto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">just wanted to say i was the hunting the sea turtles in this new zone and they were giving me Sea turtle eggs.. haven't tried them in recipies yet.. wanted to get a few more before the experiments... also the cove frogs drop skins..no idea if they are for tradeskills yet.<br />
Overall i like the look of the zone.. but its kinda hard to reach.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>YurienStonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">warning warning warning<br />
<br />
be careful hunting in this zone or you will fall to your death. heh i was mapping the zone and found that it is split into two levels. there is a path on the northern side. as for the griffons and anaconda i got a good drop rate on meat from griffons but none from anaconda. no faction hits wiht any animals and the psycadelic frogs and schools of fish and crystal clear water are great f/x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Trixzie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I went to Nedaria's Landing tonight to check it out and map it. (And thanks for the warning about falling Yurien ;) )<br />
<br />
I killed a few griffs and got some meat, so wandered over by the water to do some turtles. The only drop I got from them was a &quot;Sea Turtle Shell&quot; no-drop item. I suppose it is for an, at this time, unknown quest.<br />
<br />
I also killed a few frogs and got a frog's eyeball also no-drop.<br />
<br />
I think this will be a great zone for 30's type people to hunt and get griff meat if the higher level people leave them to it. (By the way, I was the only person in the zone or I just would have mapped and moved on).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, I went last nite with my 31 druid Pan, and yes, I was in heaven.  The zone is so beautifully rendered!<br />
<br />
Anaconda meat was a stingy drop!  Hunting-wise, experience seemed very slow, but I was enjoying myself and foraging like a maniac, so I didn't mind.<br />
<br />
But...of course, then I was saddened..the high levels invaded.  Some were very nice and only there by accident :p   these I chatted with as we all explored the new land...the beach/ocean...it was like I could FEEL the sand between my toes!<br />
Found Morden and Tondil, but no other NPCs.  <br />
<br />
Then a 65 druid flew in and killed a wolf I was preparing to pull, so I got depressed and left.  I did send in /feedback tho...if they want to help noobs or even mid-levels out, a zone like that with a level cap would be fantastic...sort of like anyone above 52 can't zone into Naggy's lair.  <br />
<br />
But I'll be back again tonite.  I really liked the place.  Perhaps this time I'll remember my fishing pole!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gozak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I went there last night as well... and it is nice. No one knows or cares about the zone, and it's a Baking Paradise.<br />
<br />
Anaconda Meat is infrequent, and I didn't kill enough Griffawns to check the drop rate for their meat. Be warned about them though- almost every time I had to run to zone was due to an add from a Griffawn.<br />
<br />
I need to spend more time in the zone, but so far it looks great. Thank goodness SoE decided to that players need a Jaggedpine Lite.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I just remembered this. Zoning into Jaggedpine from Surefall Glade, the druids are there no more. Instead, at night, Gnolls populate the village. I don't know if this is a bug or what, but you can still get cheese by going to Jaggedpine through Blackburrow.</div></div><hr />

This is just speculation, but I'm thinking that the zone will not remain as it is forever.  I'm getting the distinct impression that this zone will be updated in the future, probably becoming the jumping off point for some new content.  I'm guessing a full-fledged expansion, judging by the severity of Calliav's vision, but a LoY-style &quot;extension&quot; or something smaller also seems possible.  Anyway, Morden's got the Brotherhood working on a ship &quot;as big and as beautiful as any of Norrath's cities.&quot;  If you explore the water-filled portion of the zone, you'll see that it's rather vast for having nothing in it.  My guess is that this ship will eventually fill that space.  Now if that's the case, I don't know what would become of the rest of the zone.  I wouldn't bet on it remaining as it is now though.<br />
<br />
Again, just a theory.  <br />
<br />
Also, I don't know if it's just me but there's something eerie about that place.  I really can't put my finger on why though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">This is the most gorgeous zone I've seen in EQ to date.  I about freaked when I saw the school of fish in the water.  And yeah - literally half the zone is water past the beach.<br />
<br />
There is a bear cave along the north of the zone that is in 2 sections.  I'm thinking a named may spawn here, gonna hang out and camp it for a while.<br />
<br />
Also - thank god for safefall, I was running full speed with SoW and found that lovely cliff in the middle of the land area.  Wheeeeeeeeeeeee, thwump.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Myrrha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">RE:  Gnolls in the village in JP<br />
<br />
Are you sure someone hadn't just killed the named gnoll in the caves and the gnolls had taken over temporarily?  Killing that gnoll is one of the final steps in the Qeynos Badge of Nobility quest and often rather than trying to protect the village, people just kill him and then get out. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would have to go back and check... but I was pretty sure I was the only one in the zone. Also, there wasn't anyone there during the day, although it's probably me just not realizing that happens with a quest. D'oh :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Yes, I am a n00b. Didn't realize that happened with the Badge quest... oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gishi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It's a shame that the exp isnt better here.  I hunted there with my level 33 beastlord for an 30-45 minutes and my exp bar didnt move more then 2%..    Seems a waste but perhaps there's more to the zone and it's not finished yet?  <br />
<br />
I did notice that there's a bug with the jaggedpine gem port to surefall.  Seems if you click it, it takes you back to nedaria's landing.. so if your a youngin and want to avoid the nasty red npc's in the water before the zone in, click the gem!<br />
<br />
I agree the zone is pretty and I love how they did the waterfalls but content wise.. it's lacking a bit..</div></div><hr />
