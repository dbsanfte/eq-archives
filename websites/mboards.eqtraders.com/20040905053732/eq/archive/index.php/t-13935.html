<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darklens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have yet to test all of collapsed containers (LD a lot in the Abysmal Sea), however the one I use the most, the Collapsed Mixing bowl, does not show up with the new UI.  <br />
<br />
I have tried the different alt/ctrl - clicks all to no avail.<br />
<br />
Is this currently a problem for everyone?  If not did you do anything in particular to rectify the problem (if it was a problem to you in the first place).<br />
<br />
Just curious and looking for an answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Simple pair of questions: (yes these are idiot type questions)<br />
<br />
1. You have expanded the mixing bowl, right?<br />
<br />
2. Have you opened ANY other Tradeskill container with the New UI? If yes, try closing everything else... and open just the Collasible Mixing Bowl. <br />
<br />
I think I read somewhere that you can only have one Tradeskill Container Opened with the NEW UI active... so if you are standing next to an Oven (or have your Spit) open with the New UI, the next Tradeskill container you open will not have the new UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Darklens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes I have expanded it  and am using the expanded mixing bowl, just have been doing the combines manually.<br />
<br />
I have tried with and without an oven open but it doesn't seem to make a difference.  (No other Tradeskill containers open at the time)<br />
<br />
I have also tried it with default UI vs the custom UI I am using and still No Go.  <br />
<br />
I will play with it more tonight and see.  Had a lot of LD issues last night  and couldn't get on the night before so I'm a bit behind in the experimenting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As a data point: My Collapsed fletching and sewing kits Do bring up the new UI.<br />
<br />
And they remember recipes even if you destroy the summoned item and then recreate it later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Trixzie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Both my mixing bowl (summoned) and my spit (also summoned) are working as intended with the new tradeskill interface.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cannyar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">my collapsable bowl opens with the new ui just fine. it will only do so when other containers are closed. like the oven.. when i'm doing mtp runs. if i open it while the oven is open in the new UI the bowl opens with the old one.<br />
<br />
this is fine with me. the windows for the new UI are huge, i  wouldn't want to juggle 2 of them plus some open bags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darklens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmmmm......  Ok  tonight  (LD gods willing) I will work with it some more.....  must be user error!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">One more thing to check.... the new UI will not work from containers in the bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darklens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">well...  logged on last night and much to my amazement, my mixing bowl UI worked like a charm!  Dunno, Maybe I WAS still in another container when I opened it.  Anyhow, it's working now just find so it must have been user error.  Sorry for the alarm and thanks for all the help!<br />
