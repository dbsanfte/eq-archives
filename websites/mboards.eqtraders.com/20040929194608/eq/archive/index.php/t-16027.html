<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meerina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm wondering if anybody has any idea how many combines it takes to start seeing an average of 2 out of each of the GoD conversions (raw shimmering nihilite -&gt; shimmering nihilite for example).  10s?  100s?  1000s?<br />
<br />
Also, does converting the &quot;lesser&quot; version help with converting the &quot;greater&quot; version?  For instance, would converting raw pale nihilite -&gt; pale nihilite count toward helping with greater yields on the shimmering version?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Greymantle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm i do the stones for the arrowheads, i have allways recieved 2 back from a conversion.</div></div><hr />

I have done about 40 of them so far, and the percentages still hold at that.  I have not tried the Discord stones yet, as I don't have any.  If anyone has any raw data on this it would be nice to see.</div></div><hr />

We don't know if it will be gradual or sudden.  We don't even have any reason to think it works at all.  I'm guessing that it's bugged and will be fixed sometime in 2005.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, it does.<br />
<br />
The common and the rare forms are tracked as the same as far as learning to refine them is concerned.  But aligned ore and nihilit, for example, are learned separately.<br />

Secondary question related to refining stuff: when the recipes were purged from the UI, I lost the &quot;recipe&quot; for refining shimmering ore. I can still do it - I haven't lost the capability - but it isn't listed in the UI, so I need to do it normally rather than with the UI. Performing the combine since the purge hasn't re-added the recipe, either. Can I do anything to add the recipe back in?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't remember hard numbers, but I do remember being told that the increase in average conversion yield was a set of hard numbers, and that it wasn't related to int, wis or phase of the moon, but how many conversions that you'd performed on that &quot;set&quot; (i.e., taelosian tea and taelosian mountain tea are a &quot;set&quot;, shimmering nihilite and pale nihilite are a &quot;set&quot;, etc.)<br />
<br />
The conversions must be performed by you, in the proper tradeskill container to count, iirc - handing things in to the NPCs to be converted does not count.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm 100% positive that we didn't remove the &quot;Learnable&quot; tag from these recipes, so that shouldn't be the problem, however I recall an issue at some point where you'd learn a recipe like Silver Ruby Veils and it was being displayed as a Rat Ear Sandwich or something similar.<br />
<br />
Aside from not being very tasty, it'd be hard to find in the new UI window that way, so I'll double-check that sometime tomorrow.<br />

Thanks for the clarifications, any hints on how many you have to refine before you start getting better than an average of 2 per refine ?<br />

That should work just like any other recipe.  You do it again and it shows up.  It should be learnable, so I don't know why it's not showing for you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Turlo Lomon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There are a few recipes like that, Absor.  Off the top of my head, the pottery conversion one is also broken.</div></div><hr />

Found the problem.  Was affecting all but one of the alchemy recipes.  I just fixed the scripts and hopefully you'll see it working on test the next time we patch.<br />

Yesterday i was luck to get 2 back and i never got 3.</div></div><hr />

That's not related to the patch, it's related to the fact that you've been practicing with the material.<br />

/shrug if you say so.<br />
<br />
I just thought it was strange that yesterday i rarely got 2 and now i usually get 3.  I hadnt read any reports here from people getting 3 back yet.  <br />
<br />
Not that i am complaining.  Getting 3 Bars of Shimmering Steel per combine is very nice.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>binke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I can say from 1st hand experience, after combining over 12 stacks of aligned steel... That I had never gotten 3 results. I am not sure were it says that we'll get a chance at 3, because I can’t find it anywhere. Also I think the turn in quest for refining the item will result more in the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jarak_akn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Cant say I'm not going to add to the suspicions, but before the pathc I had never got 3 back. Yesterday 2 attemps, both 3s.<br />

I aint complaing</div></div><hr />

Has anyone had luck with the higher level tradeskill items dropping more frequently?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Elyssanda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">well, I searched but I couldn't find the post I made a while back; about a month ago I was getting a few returns of 3, about 2 out of every stack, the rest was split pretty evenly either 1 or 2. so I guess that works out to a return of about 33 from a stack of 20. This was on chunks of taelosian rock for arrowheads. I almost have 2 stacks ready to combine again, so I'll post results from them soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Nex Alacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Last night, the first time I ever worked with Muramite Etched Scales.

<br />
I hate to say this, but it also sounds like a bug...  I'll have to go look at it again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>ppatti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">After over 50 conversions of the Taelosian tea leaves, I am finally getting about half of them to convert to THREE leaves, the rest for two leaves.<br />
<br />
Of course, this is all after the latest patch which could have employed a stealth fix to GoD conversions not working properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Delores Mulva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I saw where you posted this as a bug, Absor, but perhaps it could be converted into a feature? Folks have been a little peeved that, until you've done many, many combines, you get a better return on conversion simply by handing the items to the conversion NPC. This dissatisfaction led to people asking for a higher drop rate on tradeskill stuff, which has been implemented.<br />
<br />
But what if, instead of a high drop rate, there was a high conversion rate instead like there is now? Since the minimum yield is two, a player is rewarded for doing the conversion quest immediately. Because each conversion gives one more item than before, the effective drop rate is boosted by between 33 and 50 percent. That should be sufficient, combined with the old drop rates, that tradeskillers can find what they need without servers being flooded with 16/20 one-handed weapons. <br />
<br />
Based on the number of such weapons I see in the Bazaar on my home server (Quellious), I believe the new drop rate is too generous and there is a serious risk of massive mudflation. The guilds doing Kod'Taz and above have no need for (almost) any of the products made with GoD tradeskills, but do have a severe need for cash because of the Qvic armour quests (10500 pp per piece). Since GoD, for all intents and purposes, doesn't have any droppables that could be sold like in PoP (spells), all the guilds can sell is tradeskill weapons. Since the raid zones are instanced, and the tradeskill drop tables are common to all Kod'Taz+ mobs, every guild with Kod'Taz access can be farming components for these weapons at the same time. The result is what I've seen on my server: multiple guild bots, each with up to 10 16/20 weapons of each type (1HS, 1HB, piercing, HTH), trying to undercut one another to sell out before the demand dries up. Last time I checked, one of the 16/20 piercers was selling for the same as a 31% haste belt. Having a dagger which, in the hands of a rogue, will likely out-DPS any piercer from Luclin back be priced the same as a common haste belt tells me there's a vast oversupply of daggers.<br />
<br />
Oh, as for my original post: I've done the refinements post-patch, and the recipes have been learned again. Thank you very much for the prompt response.  :) <br />

EDIT: PPatti, every combine is yielding one more item than it should. My guild has one shaman converting every sludge we find (for kicks, I guess), and she currently gets three or four per combine because of how many she's done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Xerelise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I can confirm that since the last patch I have been seeing returns of 3 when before I wouldn't.  I have done over 10 stacks of taelosian teas without ever getting 3 and suddenly now I get returns of 3 for nihilite, aligned ore, teas etc and I have converted only about 5 stacks of nihilite and aligned ore so far.</div></div><hr />
