<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keddari</div><div class="date">04-11-2005, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">...of me getting to an acceptable level in Make Poison and making a GM Trophy for around 20K?<br />
<br />
I already have a 210 + 5% Make Poison, so really I could start throwing away plat on the Trophy in as little as 40 Skill-ups.  Does the chance of making the Trophy significantly increase as my skill passes 250?<br />
<br />
I was thinking of SoS'ing to 275 and giving it a shot...make sense or should I try something else?  Dex unbuffed is ~190, Int/Wis/Cha ~90.  Was going to snag some buffs, so figure ~255 and ~125, respectively.<br />
<br />
Have a 66 Dru and a 66 SK if there's something farmable with a good drop rate that'll save me a buck.  Also, I hear they removed Make Poison from Stanos/PoK GMs a while ago - that still true?<br />
<br />
Anyways, thanks in advance all.  ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Akishka</div><div class="date">04-11-2005, 10:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes they removed the poison training ability from Stanos.<br />
<br />
My husband went from 0-250 in under 10k so I can't imagine it costing you 20k to get those last points.<br />
<br />
Also, keep in mind you can attempt a trophy at any skill level.  Yes you will have a better chance of making a trophy on the first try if you skill up but you are still not guarenteed success.  So, if all you care about is the trophy, it might be worth it just to try and fail a few times rather than spending money and endless combine time on the skill ups.  <br />
<br />
My personal opinion is to at least skill up until you max out the storebought combines (275?) and then just attempt the combine.  Never know when that higher skill might come in handy and it will probably cost similar amounts in pp either way :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KB1</div><div class="date">04-12-2005, 03:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't forget Warlord's Rage. No celestial needed. Cystallized sulfar and succulent saps, and etheral and sealed vials. Can also do the shrivled flesh combine. I forget name, but it is two shrivled flesh, drops from Kith undead at night, plus etheral and sealed. Think that one trivs at 295 though. Easy to get a couple stacks per cycle. Easier to get more with a good puler who can train em all to one spot and then a wizzy or other ae class to blast em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keddari</div><div class="date">04-23-2005, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I got to (275) and picked up a pair of Seals from Kyroskrane for around 10K I think.  Did the combine first try, so now I have an extra for after I complete my GMAS (to get my GMAV back).  Feels good to be non-ass at a Tradeskill (the Dain reference in my sig is for my Druid who has nothing above 200).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KB1</div><div class="date">04-24-2005, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now go for skorpikus venom, shrivled flesh(off Kith undead at night), crystalized sulfar plus succulent sap, no hope moss, Mt death Mineral salts. All are 295 or above afaik. No celestial or advanced needed. For exact recipies just search here on each one.</div></div><hr />
