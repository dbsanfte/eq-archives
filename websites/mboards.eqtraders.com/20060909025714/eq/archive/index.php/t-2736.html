<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Itzena</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I'm trying to make as much leather padding as I can in as short a time as possible.<br />
<br />
So, should I stick with killing the leopards in Stonebrunt and having to hunt spiderling silk (bearing in mind newbie zone farming is a little trickier on a Zek), or should I lay waste to the greyhoppers in MS and then kill all the worms, shades and shadow aliens in Shadeweavers?<br />
<br />
Or is there another, better place for LQ pelts that I'm missing?<br />
<br />
Advice please. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velurian</div><div class="date">01-23-2003, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Never played on a Zek server, so I'm not sure my appraisal of how that would affect things is correct.  That said:<br />
<br />
I'd go for Marus Seru myself.  You won't get MQ or HQ pelts from the rockhoppers (so more LQ pelts), and relatively few unwanted adds.  (Other rockhoppers, and the zelniaks and crawlers that are aggro all.)  But more importantly, in my experience, MS tends to frequently be virtually empty, so less need to watch your back...<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you have something to do with the MQ and HQ pelts (other than skin them down to LQ), I'd go for Stonebrunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eumerin</div><div class="date">01-24-2003, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On a blue server, Stonebrunt is usually only recommended when you're specifically looking for HQ Cat Pelts.  If you're primarily looking for quantity of pelts as opposed to quality, then EK is usually the spot people recommend.  Of course, on a Zek server, competition over pelts can actually get quite cutthroat (pun intended), so I don't know how that would work for you.<br />
The primary advantage that Stonebrunt would have over Mars Seru is that cats drop two pelts more often than not.  Ergo, one kill provides double the reward for your work.  The downside to Stonebrunt is that in my experience, the hoppers are much more plentiful than the cats in Stonebrunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cattywumpus</div><div class="date">01-25-2003, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something else of note,<br />
<br />
If all you want is silk for the padding don't bother with the Shak Dratha in SWT. The silk they drop makes swatches for shade silk armor not the threads you need.  Lesser Shades and Xakra Silkworms are the only ones you will need to kill.<br />
<br />
In Marus Seru most players hang around the zone in so hunting is much better if you're brave enough to go out into the desert.  The best area I've found is just to the right  (as your facing Sanctus Seru) of the gate to Sanctus Seru.  Pretty much available most of the time and has a good respawn rate and being in the hills gives you a slightly reduced chance of aggroing Zelniaks (you will aggro a lot of them anywhere in the zone though, biggest aggro range I can imagine on those buggers)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahlysh</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really, I do think taht if you're looking for low, medium or high quality cat, bear or wolf pelts head to Jaggedpine and the bandit camp located in the south east corner of the zone.  There's a camp of about 18 to 20 poachers there that respawn about every five minutes or so.  When ever I'm on a 'make padded leather for my sweetie's smith' run I go there and hang out for a while.  <br />
<br />
At lvl 55 the poachers are light blue, kind of ok for AA exp (thanks to the amazingly low respawn time) and are very rarely camped.  Even when they are camped the poachers are, at least on Bertox, broken into 3 sub camps and I haven't seen more than two groups there.  Usually though the poachers are empty.  After a full days hunt (roughly 5 hours for me) I usually have enough leather to make 3 stacks of leather, over 200 plat, sometimes some items, a boat load of runes and stuff like that.   Best thing about the poachers is that they never drop ruined pelts.  :D <br />
<br />
Then it's off to Lfay to pick on the Brownies and the Spiderlings in the Brownie outpost for more exp, brownie bits, and the Spiderlings can drop up to 6 silks per kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ChaseFV</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having farmed primarily in the Old World for the pelts for my skill-ups so far, I can say the the kejek leopards and leopardesses in the Southern reaches of Stonebrunt are easy to hunt, spawn like drops of rain, and never drop ruined: only LQ, MQ, and the rare HQ. Fairly good drop rate, 2-3 per, and at high level, very little should bother you in that part of the zone. If it's HQ you're after (but you're not), the Karanas are a much better choice (where I farmed for my reinforced and my quivers). As for the silks, I'll throw Misty Thicket into the mix if you can get there safely. The spiderlings and large wood spiders both drop spiderling silks, so you increase your chances of stumbling across a mob that drops what you need.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,<br />

There is never a shortage of cats in the zone if you can track. I usually get all the leopards in the south end of the zone before heading north for leopards and tigers for awhile allowing the southern area to respawn. All quality drop but out of 20 you might typically find 3HQ, 8MQ and 9LQ. When I was lower level doing quivers to get tailoring to 115, I hunted the karanas for HQ cat. But I am currently holding 14 stacks of HQ cat in the bank for a friend that has started tailoring that all came from SB. That should give you an idea how much padding I sell, skinning all MQ to LQ and get all my ling silk from the Feerrott.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saruton</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 04:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I prefer MSeru. Lots and lots of Rockhoppers which drop LQ and MQ Hides. Just cut the MQ to LQ Hides. And you do not need ShadeSilk threads to make the padding out of rockhopper hides. Simple Silk Thread will do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Theresa24</div><div class="date">02-02-2003, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me tell you of my personal experience.  Granted, you may have different luck.<br />
<br />
I went to EK before I realised that Marus Seru was a good spot for LQ pelts.  With an enchanter who DCed something and was killing everything, I was able to walk away with maybe 50 pelts combined.  This was in about 4 or 5 hours.<br />
<br />
Funny thing about EK was that darn crag spiders kept spawning.  I think I got more silk then pelts.  Also, consider that many lions/lionesses even those matriarchs/patriarchs are either empty, contain ruined pelts or have the ruined lion skin.<br />
<br />
So I go to Marus Seru the next time.  I take my 62 cleric-finally a real use for all those melee skills we got-farming!  Anyway, the rockhoppers drop a greyhopper hide or LQ hide nearly everytime.  I spent a few hours there between two days and walked away with 60 pelts (granted I traded my greyhopper hides for LQ).<br />
<br />
Personally, I wont go anywhere else but Marus Seru for padding.  And regular spiderling silks work for the rockhopper pelts-thats what I used.  Not real sure what killing for shadeling silk has to do with it-unless it drops with more frequency and easier access then other spiderling types.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cattywumpus</div><div class="date">02-02-2003, 07:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shadeling silk is much easier to come by than spiderling silk.  Go to Shadeweaver's Thicket (anon recommended since it is a true noob zone) and find the location called Skeleton Hill (it's near the northernmost tunnel entrance on the newbie side).  A couple of hours can net a backpack full of silk (and a stack of Swirling Shadows for the smith in you).</div></div><hr />

Use Halas pok stone. Kill spiderlings and the wealth of bears and wolves for everything..Even better go sit in bazaar for the pelts at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spihret</div><div class="date">02-03-2003, 07:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always go to MSeru - wander out by Roethe's camp.  If you aren't KOS to the Recuso you can hang out with them.  If you get too many Zelniak adds - run back to them and they will quickly remove them.  They also keep you safe while medding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saruton</div><div class="date">02-05-2003, 05:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everfrost, 2 hours hunting, 2 pelts, 4 silks<br />
Marus Seru, 1 hour farming, 2 stacks LQ Pelts.<br />
<br />
Maybe just luck but imho MSeru &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Everfrost</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahlig</div><div class="date">02-05-2003, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have always done my pelt farming in EK (as well as my spider, not spiderling, silk).  With the relatively recent change that removes the 4 mob melee limit, I kill about 20 spiders/lions per pull.  Each pull has resulted in a stack of silks and/or 6-10 Quality pelts (MQ and HQ).  As far as spiderling silks, I have recently begun visiting the home of the furry footed halflings.  Many spiderlings there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cendorly</div><div class="date">02-05-2003, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About a year ago when I was working on fine plate, I got my leather padding from Stonebrunt/Ferrott.  This was before Luclin was released, so at the time, those zones were my best options, better then Halas, I found.<br />
<br />
I'm curious now - will shadeling silk from Shadeweaver's Thicket work with cat pelts or does shadeling silk only work with rockhopper pelts?</div></div><hr />

old-world pelts + old-world thread<br />

<br />
I use LQ old world pelts with shadeling threads all the time.<br />
It doesnt work the other way round, however.</div></div><hr />

If you are also skilling tailoring up 70+ good place for greyhopper hides too. Depending on your level and class, just runn out to the middle of the zone, aggro half a dozen ae nuke rinse repeat. got 2 and a half stacks of Lq + one stack of grey hopper with my ranger that way in less than an hour. Mind you all green to me too...</div></div><hr />
