<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wombat</div><div class="date">02-17-2003, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can the person who was speaking to me before the server crash the other day about Cazic Thule and Brellium Armour please get in touch again, I have included details from my last post on Dwarven Cultural for information.<br />
<br />
Yes I can smith Cazic Thule Plate, Chain, Weapons and Sheild as well as do Dwarven and Acrylia armour and Black Acrylia Weapons. Some things you will need to provide ingredients for as I dont keep a stock and they may be hard to get in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Rad<br />
<br />
Because I play off peak mostly (Oz timezone) and dont have a bazaar mule I thought I would advertise here. <br />
<br />
Prices on application and dependent on how many ingrediants you can supply. I am just starting making these armours and this is my main so I am not a millionaire  The implication from this is that I have many fails and a limited inventory. This means I need notice to make items. <br />
<br />
However you will find I am cheaper than the normal price for the various peices. If you want it NOW I suggest you visit Zopharrs Trader, Crimson Dwarf in the Bazaar, he is also capable of doing large orders fast. <br />
<br />
So I am slower and on mostly off peak, but I am cheaper  <br />
<br />
I often advertise on the auction chat channel. <br />
<br />
I have currently have spent a week gathering the ingrediants for an order for Underfoot BP and Geaves. Most of this time has been spent farming and raising cash for ingrediants. <br />
<br />
Anyway, give me a tell in game or leave a message here please if you have enquiries or wish to place an order. I will not get into a price war on this board so please leave your &quot;in game&quot; name so I can send you a tell.</div></div><hr />

I hear froggies can wear it and I have no where near enough cash to consider Mith Marr BD stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wombat</div><div class="date">02-27-2003, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your message I have sent a reply with prices. If you check the smithing stats you will see that nothing beats old Dwarf Cultural for Str and Stam, both of which Froggies especially need  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wombat</div><div class="date">03-13-2003, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If anyone knows Moseley can you let him know I have the Brellium Plate Legs for him still. <br />
<br />
I was in a raid when he contacted me and had to log at short notice so couldnt get back to him afterwards.</div></div><hr />

Can someone direct me to a list of the different religious armors?  I am curious to see how the Cazic Thule Chain stacks up to the rest of them.  And against the Farwater or Livestone armors.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wombat</div><div class="date">04-01-2003, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Splodge I have your Vambraces if you want to pick them up  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wombat</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aarone are you still interested in that armour or have you made other arrangements?<br />
<br />
Gotto go, goanna's stuck in the drain pipe!  :shock:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raehn</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just curious to see if you make Mischievous Plate armor.  What would you charge for this?  Or if I gathered components for attempts, what would you charge?  <br />
<br />
Raehn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wombat</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure do make Mischeivous, will do combines or fully made. <br />
<br />
Just finished a full set for an epicified hobbit senior cleric who wanted some decent armour to stop being beaten into a pulp in PoP when something agroed her! Last I heard she was well pleased!  :D <br />
<br />
As far as prices are concerned give me a tell in game or send me a personal message via this board and we can discuss things. <br />
<br />
If you are one of those uncivilised northern hemisphere types  :D  be aware that I am an off peak player from south of New Guinea and so am on early in the mornings to lunch time USA time.  :) <br />
<br />
Gotto go, a crocs in the chook shed again!  :shock:</div></div><hr />
