<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Let me ask....for those that do not have time to level up AA's and rather just work on Tradeskills...........can't you get to skill 250 in the 7 main Tradeskills by using different alts?<br />
Can you still consider yourself part of the 1750 Club if you do it this way? You still put in all the time and effort to get all the skills to 250.<br />
Does anyone get around Taanan by using all of their alts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mileron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm sure people used to, and I imagine still do, but the point of being 1750 is that you attain it all on one toon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Serenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's all in your point of view.  When I started more then 4 years ago I chose tradeskills for each avatar based on role-playing.  At that time you couldn't go over 200 anyway, and once you could I saw no reason to change my mind.   I doubt I&quot;ll ever try to get ONE avatar to the 1750 club; I'm not really likely even to master every single skill on a different avatar though, I dont particularly like tailoring or smithing, and I don't play an enchanter.  But my baker is at 250, my brewer is 230ish, and my fletcher is at 244.  My pottery isn't over 200 yet though on anyone as I changed my mind on who would raise it .:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't know the official position on it. But before they added Tannan, I had 7 tradeskill mules basically. One for each tradeskill and all GM 250. Baker, Brewer, Tailor, Smith, Fletcher, JC, and Pottery. When they added Tannan I nearly had a coronary personally. That being said, I still got my main to 250 in all tradeskills, cause at my core, I am a dork.<br />

I did :-<br />
250 GM brewing for monk ( free weightless bag )<br />
250 GM brewing for necro ( cos monk was too dumb )<br />
250 GM baking for wizard<br />
250 GM tinkering for wizard ( same char as baker )<br />
250 GM pottery for cleric<br />
250 GM smithing for barbarian shaman<br />
250 GM fletching for SK Erudite<br />
250 GM JC for my sis chanter ( with JCM3 )<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you look through old threads, there are folks who consider themselves maxed at 240 + trophy/geerlok in each of the 7 primary tradeskills (effective skill is 252) ... and who think that anyone going all the way to 1750 in any/all skills is foolish.   <br />
<br />
This is a game, go as far as you want (and more importantly, as far as you are having FUN going) on as many or as few alts as YOU want.  Getting to 1750 is a personal goal that really only matters to the person aiming for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LexBardMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Man I'd have been pissed if I had 7 different toons with a 250 tradeskill and then saw the aid grimel quest..</div></div><hr />
