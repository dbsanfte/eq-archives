It seemed that many people were unable to open their skills window, myself included, but someone from that thread mentioned editing a line in the eqclient.ini.  I looked, but couldn't find anything that seemed related T_T.  Could someone who has performed this fix post what lines need to be edited?  Thanks! ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's actually the UI_Character_server.ini file you need to edit. Under the Skills window section it's likely your settings are at 0, which basically makes it a box that doesn't exist. Depending on your resolution,  it should look like this:<br />

XPos1024x768=440<br />
YPos1024x768=472<br />
Width=300<br />
Height=240</div></div><hr />
