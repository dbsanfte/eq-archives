Im sick of soltice robes and farming exelent hopper pelts sucks.<br />
<br />
Being a WE i cant make loy robes so im looking at trying cultural armor but I cant find were to get the sabertooth hides for it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">make sure to check the vendor in the windmill in loio, and the iksar merchant down near ww zoneline in OT... that iksar is forgotten about mostly, but i used to occasionally find pelts on her... might get lucky</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Myrron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Keep in mind you'll need a hefty supply of oak bark and either morning dew or blue diamonds depending on what you try if you go the cultural route.  I personally have found the oak bark to be more annoying than the hides to collect, or even buy in the bazaar.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>astianax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yup, oak bark's only found in warslik woods (which a fair number don't seem aware of) and kith. ww seemed much easier, at least my iksar gathered tons of it while levelling there once upon a time<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Excellent Saber hides aren’t worth the work, if you hunt them in LOiO its 1 to 2 drops per Day cycle (72mins) but lately they are slim to none. In OT they are as slow even if you quad, you may get 1 to 3 in a day cycle (72mins) then of course you had to head to WW or Kith to forage Oak Bark. <br />
<br />
I use to just buy them off players but the prices were getting far to high, 200pp to 350pp a hide and 50pp to 300pp for Oak Bark. I probably spent about 18k to 20k for 6 skill ups making Racial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">While I didn't use WE cultural for skill ups til the end (i.e., +240ish), I have obtained the majority of my exc sabers and oak bark via the bazaar. I check it every single day, several times. Sometimes you get lucky; I bought 5 stacks of oak bark tannin (premade! woo!) for like 20pp per tannin. I used to be able to get exc sabers from 5pp-100pp, but a few folks jacked the price to 400/500pp a pelt for a week or two and it's taking forever to come down again.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, I would go to the big field between the lake and the windwill in LOIO, pull everything that moves and AE. Rinse repeat for a while. Might get 1 or 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">oak bark is also ground spawn in butcherblock.<br />
<br />
if you are leveling up in the 23-30 range, warsliks is a great place for it, and you can forage while there (it is a highly underpopulated zone).</div></div><hr />
