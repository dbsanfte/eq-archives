<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>2Toes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First the Prob:<br />
Lev 24 Nec, Research skill at 24.  Attempted to combine the spell Hunrgy Earth, a lev 16 Nec spell, using Words of Materials and words of Spirits in my Book of Dark Bindings.  Two attempts, 2 msgs saying I lacked the knowledge to make this combine.<br />
Spent two hours  locating the ingredients for the Practice Rune (Azia),  trival of 21.<br />
Using ingredients, Bone Chips, Bat Wing and Lapis Lazul and trying to combine in<br />
my Book of Dark Bindings, I get msg saying I cannot do this combine in  &quot;this container&quot;. <br />
I followed the receipes listed here on our boards.<br />
Not only do I exceed the Research sklill for the Hungry Earth spell combine, but also for  the Practice Rune (Azia) and yet cannot make a combine.<br />
1.  Have trivals changed and we don't know yet, with the last patch.<br />
2.  Have Practice Runes been discontinued or limited as to who can do the combines, and we haven't been<br />
informed by SOE.<br />
OR<br />
3. What the heck is going onn???<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beriberi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are combining in the wrong container. The initial combines for the runes azia and beza are made in the Concordance of research book which you get via a quest. You then combine the azia and beza runes in your standard dresearch book (dark bindings for you I think). <br />
<br />
You will fail quite a bit on research combines until your skill exceeds the trivial a bit. Unfair, yes; we've all been ranting about it for some time. Your options are to buy spell in the bazaar, gather words and ask a higher skill level necro to combine, or keep plugging away.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

Thank you for clearing up my problem !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>2Toes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">* To make practice rune (azia) (Spell Research: Yield 1, trivial 21), Combine the following in a elemental grimoire, lexicon, book of dark bindings, or phantasmal tome<br />

          o bone chips<br />

I've now bought a Concordance of Research along with my Book of Dark Bindings.  Using the above ingredients<br />
I cannot get anything to combine im either Container. I am  Nec, Lev 24, Research skill level 24 ( spent my training points)<br />

Can someone provide any further guidance on this combine?  I've done<br />
everything I can think of and nothing works, trying to make this Practice Rune</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aleksandros</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In order to combine the materials for an Azia or Beza practice rune in the Concordance of Research, you must place all the items *plus* a Quill and Parchment in the Tome.  Voila, a practice rune is born.<br />
<br />
So, for the one you're attempting, insert:<br />
o lapis lazuli<br />
o bat wing<br />
o bone chips<br />
o Quill<br />
o Parchment<br />
<br />
Repeat until you are ready to order a new robe (you know, the one with the extra long sleeves that tie 'round back)...<br />
