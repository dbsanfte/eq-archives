<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tyfold</div><div class="date">05-23-2005, 05:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The most incredibly random subject, I know, but I've spent all weekend here and wanted to impart wisdom:<br />
<br />
---------------------------------<br />
Reasons you might want to farm South Ro:<br />
<br />
an ancient cyclops - Ring of the Ancients<br />
a sand giant - lambent stones, cash<br />
Sand Giant Husam - you are old school and want the Kilij plans<br />
a terrorantuling - Terrorantula silks for Erudite Cultural Tailoring<br />
a desert tarantula - Spider silks<br />
<br />
I was here primarily for the terrorantula silks.<br />
<br />
South Ro consists of two important spawn cycles. One is very simple and easy to get the hang of, the other not so much.<br />
<br />
Cycle 1: This one is very simple<br />
<br />
Creatures on this cycle:<br />
a terrorantuling<br />
a desert tarantula (not dune)<br />
a puma<br />
Terrorantula<br />
a sand mummy (not crypt or shrivelled)<br />
an ancient cyclops (I'm not 100% certain, though)<br />
<br />
How it works is this. Killing one stage of the cycle will instantly spawn the next. Each stage consists of 2, 4 or 6 of one of the non-named creatures, or one of the named. They spawn on exactly the same spot and start spreading out. The spawn point is different for different creatures though. It is easiest with track; just slap on normal mode (which puts them in order of appearance) and find the group of mobs on it. Go kill them all, then refresh and the next stage should be at the top.<br />
<br />
Doing this, I got 260+ terrorantula silks in a couple of hours, about 120 spider silks, a few MQ and HQ cat pelts, one ring of the ancients and countless gargantuan tarantula legs.<br />
<br />
Concerning the ancient cyclops, I am almost certain that he appears on this cycle, as he popped at exactly the right time (just after the death of the last puma), and no other creatures spawned to further the cycle. I killed the cyclops and the cycle continued. I haven't had him spawn again yet (he is very rare) so I haven't been able to verify it.<br />
<br />
Cycle 2: Can be annoying<br />
<br />
Creatures Unique to this cycle:<br />
a madman<br />
a zombie<br />
a giant rattlesnake<br />
a sand giant<br />
Sand Giant Husam<br />
<br />
Creatures opn this cycle but not unique:<br />
a sand scarab<br />
a ghoul<br />
a desert madman<br />
a crypt mummy<br />
<br />
This one is where track is incredibly useful. First, scour the zone for any of the unique mobs, and kill. Have track on normal. About five to ten seconds after a kill, the next mob spawns. If you cannot find any of the unique ones, just slaughter all of the non-unique ones you can find, and keep killing the most recent spawns, if you have track, until you get one of the unique mobs.<br />
After you have killed a unique mob, you know the cycle is moving, so if a unique mob doesn't spawn next, you know that the most recent of the non-unique mobs is probably the cycle.<br />
<br />
In about an hour and a half I had 3 or 4 sand giants and one Husam. The sand giants seem quite rare.<br />
<br />
NOTE: the undead at the tower are completely unrelated to these cycles.<br />
<br />
I hope this guide helps someone somewhere....those terrorantula silks are a good skillup path for erudites ~170 tailoring to 220, and all the silks and sand giants can probably fund the titanium thread.<br />
<br />

From the description, it sounds like it could be on Cycle 1 (due to the insta-respawn)</div></div><hr />
