<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahli</div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am looking to find easiest way to trivial acrylia studded (188). My dilemma is that I can have a lot of combine attempts with masks but lose money or make cloaks and have a quarter of the attempts but at least break even.<br />
<br />
But what I'd really like to know: has anyone noticed faster skill ups using more complicated items like cloaks rather then masks? Do items that require more studs give more chance of skill up?<br />
<br />
I would guess there maybe a similar situation with Acrylia reinforced armor, no?<br />
<br />
Also, do attempts at combines on an item with a much higher trivial then I have skill have lower chance of skill up? (50+ point difference) (my skill is 169 atm)<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

I would go with the reinforced and do studded on request. I believe that the reinforced probably has a better resale rate than the studded because of more really useable gear for the Monks and BLS. The reinforced wristbands still sell for at least break even prices on Zeb. Just food for thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Liwsa</div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you need the pp. If so do the items that you can sell to finance more supplies to do more combines.  If you are independantly wealthy then just use it for skillups and forget the costs.  As I went through the studded acrylia phaze(to 188 triv) I did some stuff to sell and mixed in masks for skill ups when I had extra materials.  I always made sure I had a few items that sold well avaiable for sale(hate to miss a sale cause you don't have one made).  I would make a few studded tunics and 5 or 6 cloaks(this is back when they would sell fairly well).  If I had any left over studs I would make a few masks to try to skill up.  When I got close to 188 I blew thruogh all supplies I laid my hands on to get to 188.  It takes much longer if pp is an issure.  Just do not lose faith and you will get there some day.  I am at 212 and I never thought 201 would come since I have been doing tailoring since I made the char some 18 months ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're exceedingly patient go ahead and make cloaks and tunics and make a small profit, but it will likely take a very long time to trivialize it.<br />
<br />
So far I havn't really noticed a different between items that have few components to items that have more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahli</div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 11:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm less concerned about profit margins.<br />
<br />
My question was if any given combine attempt has better chance of generating a skill up if its a more complicated item; mask versus cloak or tunic.<br />
<br />
Maybe its just luck but I seem to get 1 skill up every 4-10 cloaks, but it takes me a lot more masks.<br />
<br />
Has anymore else seen this happen?</div></div><hr />

This belief holds true over the same type of armor.  Acrylia Studded Masks Vs Acrylia Studded Cloak/Tunic.  The chance is the same IMO.  The only thing that will give you better chances is if you have more components to combine.  If you have many more Acrylia Studs than Hides, then choose what you wish to make for your skillups.  But if you have the same numbers, make Acrylia Studded Masks.<br />
<br />
The more attempts at skillups is what I believe will give you a better chance at a skillup.<br />

I can get studs in sizable quantities fairly easily, but gathering superb hides is giving me a headache due to their rarity (What's sad is that Flawless seems MORE common than Superb /boggle)<br />
<br />
I've pondered the idea of making cloaks instead in order to use up my growing stash of studs, but does it really increase your chances by having more components?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Liwsa</div><div class="date">01-24-2003, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">wow I wish flawless were more common for me. I get about 2 to 1 ratio superb to flawless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meirril</div><div class="date">01-24-2003, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh gods no. Having more stuff to combine dosen't improve your chances per combine of skilling up. Doing more combines gives you more chances to skill up, and there is nothing more frustrating than sitting down with a bunch of material and NOT gettig a skill up. Thus the common advice of &quot;get a whole stack or more for a long run&quot;.<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, best chance of a skill up occures somewhere between 50 below the trivial and 5 below the trivial. Before 50 below your chances of success are minimal, and there is good evidence to say that success and skill ups have a positive relationship (i.e. you'll skill up more often when your succeeding. Not to say you won't skill up outside of that range, just not as often), and also good evidence that the last 5 points or so are VERY hard to aquire from each trivial. I usualy find its more efficient to switch to the next hardest recipee. It certainly worked well with JC (I remembered the trivial part about half way through the recipes. When I stopped trying to hit the trivial and went up to the next hardest recipe I cut the number of combines for each recipe down by about 1/3rd.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You must expand your thinking... become one with the backpack.... fill the backpacks with stacks...<br />
<br />
Someone once asked with anyone knew what making 2600 ce is like.... the real question in tailoring is... who doesn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pockets FullOfGold</div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've found that Superb Hides and Flawless Hides drop at about the same rate, on my server (The Rathe).<br />
<br />
In My Opinion, while it doesn't seem to matter how many items you have to make combines, whether a couple or a bunch, having alot of components to make &quot;a skillup run&quot; seems the way to go.  At least everyone here seems to think the same thing because of the number of skillup runs people post here.  It just seems easier to go for items and do a skillup run compared to 1 combine one day, 2 combines another day, to see if you get any skillups.<br />
<br />
Also, don't just make Studded to try to trivial Acrylia Studded.  I found that doing the Acrylia Reinforced helps those skillups as well.  If you farm for your Hides, make the Reinforced since you get Flawless as well as Superbs.<br />
<br />

130+ Flawless Hides in the bank and counting (to make a large skillup run). Tailoring at 194.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Liwsa</div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can do not make any reinforced prior to 188 skill.  Since studded trivials out at 188 it will not do you any good to skillup to 188 on reinforced and then have extra superb hides left over that can be combined for no skill increases.  Try to do your studded up to 188 and then use your flawless to further your skilll.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is even more appropriate if doing sickles, but doing sickles AND solstice robes made me HATE cel essences<br />
<br />
I now buy them in the bazaar to cut out *some* of the clicking before I do my skilling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pockets FullOfGold</div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I can understand holding onto the Flawless until trivializing the Studdeds, I found that I was able to trade the Superb Hides for Flawless Hides or make some Studded Armor for guildies/friends after Studded went trivial, with the extra Superbs I had remaining.  Since I made Studded Armor for guildies/friends, I ran out of Studs rather quickly.  The leftover Paeala Tannin I have in the bank waiting for my next skillup run.<br />
<br />
It was alot easier to trivial Studded going both ways than trivializing Studded before going to Reinforced.<br />
