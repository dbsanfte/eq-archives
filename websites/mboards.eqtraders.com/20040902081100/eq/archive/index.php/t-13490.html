<br />
Thanks  <br />

soltice wont get you anywhere, but yes quests, solstice, sacred tun, gem studded chain, several other things would have gotten you there in about 4 more clicks.<br />
<br />
edit i beleive enough people talk about gem studded chain for the robe and using sacre tunare silks on it to think that you could have searched for them even if you didn't know the exact recipe.  xanthe, or nature would have probably worked too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Perhaps if you spelled SolStice correctly, you'd find it in the search.  ;)</div></div><hr />

Finding information on a subject is far easier if you ALREADY know the answer.  I believe I made it clear that I couldn't find the answer, MANY searches not withstanding.<br />

<br />
With ALL the robe recipes somehow I was supposed to automatically realize that these components had something to do with this robe.<br />
<br />
After the server crash so much history has been lost, a lot of &quot;common&quot; knowledge isn't available anymore when searching. <br />
<br />
I had always believed that these boards were a cut above the average board if only because most people didn't stoop to cheap shots.<br />
<br />
Thank you Isamin for the information without the cheap shots!</div></div><hr />

Nothing personal here Ock and please don't take this the wrong way. I have been on this board, and other one before we moved here, for a long time. I personally have seen message asking for solstice robe recipe at least a few times. I have also seen hundreds of messages asking &quot;how do you make this?&quot; posts. After a while, it gets kind of old and I think you caught some of these people in a bad mood. <br />
<br />
Personally, as a courtesy (afterall, Denmom and House Ogre pay for the bandwidth and storage on this site) I try all methods I can before asking a question on this board. Since you already knew the name of the robe, solstice robe, I am surprised that you did not find it in search function both here and the main site. Just typing in Solstice would have yielded you the right answer.<br />
<br />
Again, not trying to make you feel unwelcomed, just for your future search.<br />

Edit: spellings and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">sorry.  didn't mean to sound harsh.  think i read a post about solstice robes mentioning the chain a few days ago though so not hard to search even the forums.  i have also seen a few threads about the sacred silk and many threads about the robes mention them.  as i said though Xanthe, (it is his earring) nature, and cabbage (the quest and spell is protection of the cabbage after all) all worked for finding it if you couldn't spell solstice right.  you could have also gone cere, sol, moni, other parts of words and find it quickly.  i do this all the thime.  (oops i bake it slips sometimes.)  i just figured you would do so too.  only problem i've had so far are 3 letter words.  you can use an * to get around that though.  <br />
<br />
don't make me link related threads.  it wastes bandwidth.  look a few pages and you will find it.  i am only at 129 tailor.  i just read for ideas when i start to work on it.</div></div><hr />

Thank you Isamin for the information without the cheap shots!  T'was nothing. I suspect other people were just pre-coffee and such. Don't take offense on the one instance. Maybe it was a little harsh, but on the whole everyone here is so willing to help they practically ooze with it. <br />
<br />
It just so happens that I'd *just* been in that search pattern looking for the same information. And I suspect that I did what you did as well. I typo'd the name 4-5 times in the search and also before I realized that the problem was me and not the database loss of information. And for the life of me I couldn't remember any of the ingredients either. Since I already had the link in my URL history, was little to paste it in.<br />
<br />
You have become better at Tailoring! (163) <br />

Some day I'll be able to start on the robes. Someday. When I'm rich. And famous. And know a 250 jeweler. And... :)</div></div><hr />
