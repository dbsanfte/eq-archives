<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>masterchef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is anyone else experiencing any skill up probs? I've got my dex max'd at 255, I'm a lev 45 ranger, I've gone thru 3 stacks of combines at fletch skill of 178 without one skill up. Also, I know this is off topic, but I was having the same prob with getting Archery beyond 200, went thru 100's of arrows, no skill up. Went to try and buy a skill up and I received a msg that I was already max'd for my level. All the doc's I've read state the Archery is no restricted for rangers. I should be able to get to 240. Has anyone seen/heard about this being updated? Are there any other official sources of info or do I just send Sony an email?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aethia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well it's not usually to go through 3 stacks without a skillup where you are at.  I always tell friends who want to tradeskill, expect a run of AT LEAST 100, once.  You will have it.  If I turn out to be wrong, they are happy. :)   <br />
<br />
So, 60 attempts at arrows at 178 is just the typical RNG at work.  You have entered the hell levels of tradeskilling.<br />
<br />
I can't comment on the Archery, but another site indicated that the archery formula is 5 + (level * 5), which at lvl 45 would be 230.  I can't say anything more since I am not familar with the ranger class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DeegerStormcrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's not the answer you want to hear but yeah, this is nothing abnormal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nex Alacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">While Archery will go above 200, it won't do so untill you are level 51.  So those arrows you shot were wasted plat unless you were gettin exp :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>masterchef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks to all for the info. I don't mind the work as long as it's working.<br />
On Archery, I guess the Casters Realm site is wrong or needs updating.</div></div><hr />

I stopped going to Casters Realm ages ago.  So much of their information is misleading, or just flat out incorrect.  I prefer my spell info from Alla as well as item searches.  As for skill info and such, several good ranger sites, most notably EQRangers (www.eqrangers.com) &amp; Ranger's Glade (http://www.interealms.com/ranger/).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">About the only thing I go to castersrealm for, nowadays, is to find out where to buy spells from.  Even then they're not 100 percent accurate (hello cry of fire) but they do a better job at that than anyone else I've looked at.</div></div><hr />
