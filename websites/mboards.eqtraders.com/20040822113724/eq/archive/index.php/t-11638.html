<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Any question involving the modals &quot;can&quot; or &quot;will&quot; with &quot;Denmother-sama or anyone affiliated&quot; as the subject of the sentence will be answered with &quot;NO&quot;. As much as many of us have little 'tweaks' or 'improvements' added to the DB, it's out of our hands now. Just be patient and be glad for all that's there. <br />
<br />
Personally I can come up with about four that would save on bandwith and possibly a lot of it, but they're not asking. And that's what we have to respect. <br />
<br />
When they're ready to accept suggestions, oh, you'll know. ^_^!! Just be patient in the mean time. <br />
