<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shjekai</div><div class="date">03-02-2006, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought there used to be a section of this site for discussing pricing of tradeskill items. Sorry if this topic isn't allowed here, couldn't find another place for it. <br />
<br />
I have been working on human cultural(DoN) and during my farming of PoN for piles of gravel I end up with midnight stones and nightmare silks. I try to be fair about what I sell things for, esp tradeskill stuff but I don't want to give stuff away either. <br />
Is 2k for midnight stones about right? <br />
Is 500 for silks too little? <br />
<br />
If piles of gravel are so darn rare (I'm only seeing maybe 1 in 20 from gargs in PoN) what is a reasonable price for the armor?<br />
<br />
If the armor doesn't sell well I'm not going to bother making any more than what I need because gargs are a pain to hunt. <br />
<br />
Anyone able to share their experiences? Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For example, Armgaurds of Repentence sell for dirt cheap (at least on Xegony), so Master Plate Vambs aren't worth making for the most part.  Same with Boots of Slaughter.<br />
<br />
Then there's Magnetic... another price-killer for Master's Plate.  Bazu gear is generally a bit more expensive than Magnetic, so there might be a market for Master's Chain for Human Rangers (if there are such things. :D).</div></div><hr />

I had a couple of people sending my trader a tell asking about other slots too actually, so apparently there is some kind of market out there. I sold under what I paid to make them, just trying to get some cash back though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axemaster</div><div class="date">03-02-2006, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I make and sell expert-master and gm dwarven and halfling armor. i always try to have at least 2 full suits made of all types below GM.  With 3 augment slots per item, they sell well even when there are similar drops out there that are cheaper or similarly priced. the augment slots really make up for it, and, with CDD apparently dropping more common in PoR, I have noticed an increase in demand suddenly for it (above normal demands)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rasky</div><div class="date">03-02-2006, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On Quell the price for Midnight Stones varied from like 300p to 700p.  But just recently someone has been asking like 5K for Midnight Stones and has driven up prices (to anywhere from 1.5K to like 4.5K).  It doesn't look like there are any buyers at those prices though.<br />
<br />
The stones are really pretty rare even in bazaar on Quell.  (Hopefully the drop rate will be adjusted to something better than the abysmal rate for them these days - like 1 in 75 or so mobs).<br />
<br />
I'm a Dark Elf Smith at 281 in Skill with the +15% VT gloves, BM3 and Salvage 3.  I basically refuse to pay more than say 500p for a Midnight Stone.  Since there is no use for the skill level I'm already at (due to hitting the success cap) there is no need for me to try and skill up any higher.<br />
<br />
I've been trying to sell Dark Elf Master's Level plate items for ages (since DoN came out) and it basically rots.  But since someone has increased the bazaar price of midnight stones, I have subsequently increased my price the same (like 5 to 10X) for finished goods.  A big problem for Master's level stuff is the lack of available symbols due to the really bad CDD drop rate.  So the base armor itself sells very slowly since CDDs are so rare.  (On Quell finsihed master's level armor sells for about the same price as Expert level armor.)<br />
<br />
Anyhow...  If people feel like gauging the TS people for skill-up items then I feel they should pay the same inflated price when seeking finished goods.<br />

PS  Nightmare silks actually go for more on Quell since they have twice the market... DoN Master's Cultural Armor and Nightmare Bows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Benin</div><div class="date">03-13-2006, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Master culture smithing seemed like a good way to skill up when it first came out. I also saw a way to make a little plat with the master augs. <br />
the drop rate for CDD and midnight stones (and therefore the bazaar price) have made this skill up path unreasonable. I was happy to see that the mobs for the lvl 55 aura quest drop CDD. I have done the aura quest 3 times for various toons and help friends get their drops for it too. I have not seen any CDD drop. Has anyone else seen it drop? to skill up, I finally did the shadowscream quest for the hammer and anvil. To be honest, it was kinda fun. farming the no drop items in hollowshade isn't really that bad. The items in twilight are not bad either. I don't know why I waited so long to use this skill up path. Farming is a great way to kill time when you are waiting for a raid to be called.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tuis</div><div class="date">03-13-2006, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Master human leather vs plate - I sell the plate for a decent amount, maybe 5-10k for the major pieces.  As for leather, well, shissar scales are so easy to acquire by comparison I can dump it dirt cheap...though I do tend to destroy a lot of the stuff.<br />
<br />
As for GM stuff (minus silk, never had enough to make more than what I needed) I generally stick with 50k per scale/hide required - 150 for BP/leg, 100 for helm/boots...where it drops to 1 scale I break it down: 40k per bracer, 75k for sleeves, 50-75 for gloves depending on my mood.<br />
<br />
Hard though because some goofballs are trying to charge 45-60k per scale and hide.  Friggin ridiculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lixivia</div><div class="date">03-15-2006, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i've notice that there are more CCD for sale in the bazaar, but the price for it has actually gone UP since PoR came out, it used to sell for 6-8k, and now youre lucky if you see it for 6k. the prices on it are generally 8-10k, and one person has 5 for sale for 15k. so by the looks of it the fact that it drops more is nice, but now its costing me 2k more... and its hard to find even at that price.<br />
<br />
edited: just wanted to add that some people actually buy it for 9k+, it sells, so if you buy your silks (generally 1k a silk), some people are paying 11k a combine. i'm just not ready to fail one for that much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shjekai</div><div class="date">03-16-2006, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For about 4 weeks I was selling midnight stones at 2k a pop and they were leaving my trader as fast as I found them. Nightmare silks at 750 was the same. CDD at 6k (2k cheaper than others I saw) the same. Reptile teeth and piles of gravel both for 2k. <br />
This week, nothing will sell. Funny thing is, some people were buying my stuff and reselling it at a higher price. I guess they are stuck with some of my old crap :) <br />
I'd use the stuff to make armor but no one was buying human master's. Selling a bracer for 2k when it takes about 20 gargs in PoN to get one is not worth my time. Maybe Luclin is a weird server.<br />
<br />
Maybe tradeskillers are busy in PoR now.</div></div><hr />
