My SK has gotten it done, my g/f's druid AND enchanter are done. ANd now our cleric is at 177 plus tinkered device...(the dang troll did it 158!) and I'm starting up try #5. *sigh* <br />
<br />
Word for a wise...when tradeskilling. never do 4 8th shawls in one house...someone's bound to go insane from all the skill practice. Because after a long day of raising tailoring and failing again I look like this... :shock:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yokatsu</div><div class="date">12-08-2002, 04:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Skill of 156+ with +5% geerlock has a very high chance for success.  I would say 50/50 or better.  <br />
<br />
On three characters I did it for with 156 skill, one succeeded first time with thread and shawl.  <br />
<br />
The other failed first time on thread, succeeded second try with thread and first try with shawl.  <br />
<br />
Third character succeeded twice with thread, but failed on first try with shawl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Woodeckt</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ouch I am sorry to hear it I have a beastlord friend that has failed 5 times on that step. He is at 158. I made mine on the first try at 180 tailoring so all I can say is grab that kit and give it a few more kicks and you will get there. Good luck the Robe is well worth it as you know having gotten it on your alts. I also am not looking forward to watching my wife get hers. I am on nubmer 8 waiting to get some more cash banked to make my smithing run before I go grab the parts but she has not even worked tailoring and is only level 19 so I have some time. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaidian Blade</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My advice is this: <br />
<br />
1) Spend the extra time to get Tailoring to 158 (the &quot;Wu&quot; max)<br />
2) Grab yourself a Geerlok (+5%)<br />
3) MAX out your WIS or INT to 255 (or more) - even with the Geerlok equipped<br />
4) Get KEI<br />
5) Get Werewolf form or Shammy DEX buffs<br />
6) Cross your fingers and Pray on the combine<br />
<br />
Good luck and remember - the 8th Shawl is the goal.   Mmmmmm FT3....</div></div><hr />

With the exception of 6, the rest are a waste of time, sir.<br />
<br />
NO stats affect success.  NONE.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahlig</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got started on tailoring late.  2 of my friends had the sixth and seventh shawl before I even got my griffin eggs.  My tailoring skill was lacking as well, but I trudged through the shawls as best I could.  I got all my items and was collecting crystalline silks in CC to raise my tailoring skill before attempting.  I was tired and irritable, so I just tried it.  Success at skill 128.  On both combines.  :D <br />
<br />
I would just say to continue to try it.  Those ingredients are somewhat easy to collect.  Go to a low lag zone (depending on your server, I suggest Rivervale) to do the combine.</div></div><hr />
