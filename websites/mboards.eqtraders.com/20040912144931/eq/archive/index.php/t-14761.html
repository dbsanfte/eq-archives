<br />
this is for 200 220 and 250 btw Figure on an average of approximately 30 to 40 combinations per skill-up.  To go from 200 to 250 will take from 1,500 to 2,000 combinations. :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Healblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If memory serves me correctly, Khoren Stonefall, the first 1750 serverwide, did 1337 combines from 200 to 250 tailoring at 270 WIS.<br />
<br />
I could check, but that is an OLD thread which would be hard to find.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Don't ask why, but I seem to have his post saved on my computer, and I verify that those figures are correct.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>scaevola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm at like 222<br />
yes its about 30-40 combines per skill up <br />
200-220 can be another story if i was optimistic I'd go for 50 maybe.<br />
<br />
to go from 189(ribbons) to 222 I think<br />
<br />
it took roughly a character w/ Loy (extra bank space) w/ 10 slot containers in all slots - with every slot filled w/ a stack of scared tunare swatches to get me to 222 at least ..if not more. I went the solistice robe rout as I had friend who would imbue emeralds can I can JC the chains ..and enchant the silver<br />
<br />
Was with 355 int from 200 on and I think 305 from from my 190s on.<br />
<br />
Some people have better luck than others<br />
I heard of someone doing 28 velium bits combines (smithing) and going from like 190-203 but that was lucky..all depends on the ever unreliable RNG<br />
<br />
I'll see if i can find my log for it ...is there any sparer for tradeskill combines that can read log and translate success/failes &amp; tries? or does everyone do it by hand?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Trentazra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wonder what the odds of it taking exactly 1337 (leet) combines to get from 200 to 250 are, hehehe. <br />
<br />
This post has been inspiring btw, as I've been in a bit of a skill up slump keeping me right at 200.   (About 120 combines now, still at 200.  Yes I have all 6 levels of NTCM).  Now if I could just save up about 1300 combines worth of supplies, I should have no problem.... I hope =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Timper Tantrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yesterday I was at 224 I did one stack (20 combines) of Arctic Wyvren Masks and went from 224 to 229 ! ! ! yep thats 5 FIVE skillups! ! ! Needless to say i was thrilled.<br />
<br />
Later in the day I had another stack (20 combines) together and got exactly ZERO skill upps off that little run go figure :(<br />
<br />
Then a while later I did about 24 cultural robe combines and made it to 235.<br />
<br />
I am hoping I can make it to 240 later today so i can give the Aid Grimil tailoring part another shot, I figure at 240 plus a geerlok I should have a pretty good chance, I've already failed twice at 220 and 223 and losing those obsidianwood saps is painful to say the least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>crystilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Between 30-40 attempts per skillup here as well for tailoring above 200 skill.<br />
<br />
(Also 2 failures on Tailoring part of Grimel Quest here so far)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Too darn long.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought the same thing. I know I've been playing this too long, and sufferring the 1337 Sp34k as I saw it as &quot;leet combines&quot;, without even thinking about it. :boggled: <br />
<br />
Anyhow, at 206 tailoring right now, and I'd say I have been averaging 30 or so combines per skillup since 200. Have had some nice streaks (2 within 10 combines) and a run of 55 or so without one. This is with 290 wis, and geerlok not equipped, doing cultural robes.<br />
<br />
BTW, some of the cultural robes give pretty decent tribute values, for the cost of the materials (assuming they are the common ones).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>crystilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">ooh, thank you !!!  :)  :)  :) <br />
<br />
I've been wondering how the devil I was going to sell all these solstice robes.  Ran out of bank space and had to store them on alts when I had a really &quot;bad&quot; streak - that traders would love.<br />
<br />
Was just trying to skill up (so didn't have the geerlok in) but made over 40 robes in under 120 attempts.  Talk about OUCH to the bank balance with all those Gem studded collars hehe.<br />
<br />
I haven't used the tribute system yet so sounds like it's time!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Unfortunately, solstice robes have a very low tribute value.  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Reflan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I can confirm that. I still have dozens left after selling them for months, can't move em at 200 even.  Tribute value is very low.<br />
<br />
Kind of makes me feel better in a way, though I guess it sounds perverse, to see people talking about 30-40 combines per skill up or more.  I'm 1748 now(248 brewing) and max alchemy also, and for a very long time I saw people claiming very fast skill ups, except for a few who ran into terrible luck, such as having hundreds of combines for certain points.  (I was one of those, too.)<br />
<br />
Took me 43 combines per point past 188 in smithing, and about the same in all my other skills.<br />
<br />
Used to be just about the only thing you would hear on this board were people claiming 17-21 combines per skill-up, and a vast and settled majority agreeing.</div></div><hr />
