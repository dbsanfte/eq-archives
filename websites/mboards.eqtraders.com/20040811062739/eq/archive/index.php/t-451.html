<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>lonewylfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have a bunch of the arctic stuffs, usually just put it up in the bazaar at 5gp each (still doesn't sell, lol). My alt has a ton of cinni sticks on her.<br />
Drop me a tell as Avelyna or I'll try to drop you one</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Quendi_Selli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Is that all you need?  LOL<br />
<br />
Glad you mentioned it, I forage like crazy with two computers for hours and get lots of stuff I don't need.  I've been selling the fruit and veggies but eating the rest.  Sylvan berries is a good example, they are tasty but I never thought to sell them.  Arctic muscles are not tasty and I never would have thought to sell them to anyone but an otterman (if such a race was ever found.)<br />
<br />
Check the bazaar is my advice, I'll put stuff there for a few gold each when I get it and others will probably start to now that traders don't eat food anymore.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My Druid and a certain Mino Hero Have taken a shine to some friendly sparring. One of the side effects of this is that I currentl have well over a stack of the steamfont waters. I've been saving, rather than drinking, since I first saw your post.<br />
<br />
What do you do with them, and what are they worth to you? I am currently working several tradeskills, and could use swaps of several items<br />
<br />
Essence of Sunlight, Sea foam,saltwater seaweed for smithing temper.<br />
<br />
Leather Padding, or ingredients for said padding.<br />
<br />
HQ cat pelts, as my alt druid is 88 skill tailoring, and would like to make some quivers.<br />
<br />
Silk swatches, or spider silks.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the steamfont waters will continue to pile up, so let me know what they're worth, and we can work something out.</div></div><hr />
