<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tinkercobblepot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been following the storyline and it seems to me that they are trying to tell us that all the pc's are going to have to band together to get through the trails that are comming up when the new continent opens. In fact it seems to me that we are going to have to defend our hometowns against some new threat. Those who loose thier hometowns to whatever the enemy is are probably going to have to fall back to some other towns and defend them. Of course this is all guessing on my part but thats what the storyline is starting to soundlike to me.<br />

<br />
That's not going to happen for a LONG time to come.<br />
<br />
Besides, Trolls already lost their hometown, and except for the Teir`dal, no one is that worse off for it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Probably some aspect of them trying to lead up to EQ2.  The cataclysmic fall of the diety-toppling mortals most likely won't ever actually occur in EQ, but EQ's storyline will set it up as a reasonable progression &quot;some time in the future,&quot; hence making the EQ2 storyline a sensable progression rather than a jarring random event.<br />
<br />
But ya, EQ probably won't actually &quot;die&quot; for a long time, because its more likely than not going to continue to have a large subscriber base (even if disgruntled) for quite some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">eq2 is 500 years after the sleeper gets awakened.  it is also in an alternate future so that new eq expansions dont screw it up.  they dont talk to each other as much as ppl think it seems like.  not sure if that is really good though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Footsore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There is something in the story line (I can't remember the words now, and I'm not at home to check) that seemed to imply the new &quot;ship&quot; was to support a coming mass migration. I took that to imply Sony was preparing a story line to account for people leaving EQ for EQII.</div></div><hr />

eq2 is 500 years after the sleeper gets awakened.  it is also in an alternate future so that new eq expansions dont screw it up.  they dont talk to each other as much as ppl think it seems like.  not sure if that is really good though.  <br />
<br />
I'm curious where the Sleeper being part of the EQ2 story came from.  I've never seen it on any official posting or official document, but around the time of the RZ sleeper kill it was getting mentioned all the time.<br />
<br />
The &quot;alternate future&quot; aspect was one that I've never heard of before.  The impression I got was that they were explaining away any/all changes to EQ after the EQ2 world gets set in stone via the Cataclysm - any of the &quot;new&quot; stuff in EQ was simply destroyed, and that's why its not present in the EQ2 future.<br />
<br />

<br />
I've heard the new ship is being built for a journey to the last continent, although that's purely speculation.  Seems logical though, given the significance they seem to associate with it and the fact that the next expansion is more likely something sizable rather than LoY-part-2.<br />
<br />
(as for &quot;last continent&quot;, go check out the globe in Skyfire - there's one more HUGE continent that has not yet been &quot;discovered&quot; on any of the current maps/zones)</div></div><hr />
