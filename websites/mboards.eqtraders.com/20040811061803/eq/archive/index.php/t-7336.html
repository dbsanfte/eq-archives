<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ilona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am attempting to arrange an escort for General Bragmur in Iceclad (ie 8th shawl battle) for this evening beginning at 8pm GMT (9pm CET)<br />
<br />
If you are online and available, your help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Transport can be arranged from the Nexus.<br />
<br />
Please contact Gwenae (my druid) if you are able to help. I should be online from about 7pm GMT.<br />
<br />
Gwen has had the marching orders ready for ages, please help me get this out of the way :-) <br />
<br />
I think 8pm GMT is 12pm PST (ie noon).</div></div><hr />

After a long delay starting, the final line up was <br />
 <br />
Aonlaan, Darheel, Eavee, Fimbalkin, Larrk, Louella, Morisana, Mother, Numzaz, Tinmar, Torquil, Witt and myself. <br />

With buffs from Mother's pet cleric, there were luckily no problems at all, and Gwen now wears a Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl. <br />
