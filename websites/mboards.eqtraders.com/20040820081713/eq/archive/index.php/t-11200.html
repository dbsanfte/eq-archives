<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DoranurAleguzzler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I made some of these for my young wizard, as I tend to use magic and fire based nukes quite often. I have not, however, been able to find ANY info on whether or not these stack with other focus items that preserve mana in general, or if they were a complete waste of time and plat.<br />
<br />
Granted the money spent came from those people that donated for ports, I would have rather made an informed decision. Any assistance is greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, they do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DoranurAleguzzler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">. . . for the fast response.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Before I stock up, do these things sell?  <br />
<br />
lol I thought shadeweavers potions would be a good thing - I use em myself when I want to get back to PoK after binding myself somewhere else - but I am my only consumer.  They have been sitting on my mule for a month now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not well.<br />

I made four 10 charge Benefit Awareness IV potions a little over a month ago. Also made 2 singles. The last of the 10 charge sold last night (all purchased by the same person one at a time over the past month). I still have the 2 singles.<br />
<br />
I had priced them at 2450p for the 10 charge and 275p for the singles due to my 26.5% failure rate. I have 200 skill + 5% from Grandmasters Medicine Bag.<br />
<br />
Cost per combine is 159.55p. Cost per charge after factoring failures was 195.45p.<br />
<br />
I suspect the cost on these is why people dont buy them. <br />
<br />
I prefer to make potions where I sell at least a few a day.  With it taking over a month to sell these 4, I wont be making more than 1 at a time now, if I even bother to make them at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I tried selling a few of the focus IV potions with no luck at all, even setting the price at a loss to me.  Fortunately, I did not make many.  I did end up making a couple for a guildie, who paid for the components, but, that was about it.<br />
<br />
Wow, that's a bad success rate there, that, or I've been insanely lucky so far.  I am at 190 alchemy with grandmasters bag, and I have failed one out of the 30 I have made total.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Made another smaller batch last night. Failed 10%. Im tracking this. Maybe in about 3 years I will have made enough of these to find out what the real fail rate is. <br />
<br />
Kinda sad though that they give us a useful potion, and make them so freaking expensive that we cant give them away. I know there are at least 4400 players on my server since I am ranked below that in one LDoN dungeon. And to think that I can only find one customer for these out of all of them. :/<br />
<br />
My trader is up 24/7. I occassionally go run through some dungeons or fill in on a raid with him, but 99% of the time he is standing in the Bazaar. So its not like people cant find me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Raskii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How long do the Focus Effect potions last?<br />
<br />
Does anyone know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Your high end wizards are not real keen on paying for Mana Pres. potions. We're more aggro limited than mana limited in raids, and in exp group situations its not worth spending the money.<br />
<br />
If they were improved damage focus they'd be a hot item. Too bad they aren't.<br />
<br />
:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Duration on these is 3 hours. I suspect that means not dying in that time as well.<br />
<br />
My only client for the Benefit Awareness IV potions seems to be a cleric. I have yet to see anyone else buy one. But this one cleric buys one 10 charge one about every 2 weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think people should /feedback SOE to add a description of what all the potions do, to the right-click info, the way they did for spells and effects on items, since unless you tab out and come look it up on the web, the names of the potion effects don’t always tell you what they do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">To tell you the truth, I didn't even know there WERE potions that do that... I think there needs to be some sort of advertising campaign for these potions.<br />
<br />
Putting the effect of the potions on there should be primary.  As I've sometimes worried about buying some of the more crazy named potions out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>DoranurAleguzzler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not a real big seller. I've drummed up some business by giving away singles of the level 2 awareness potions to casters under 49. I myself use them on my 56 wizard, but I quadkite 90% of my play time it seems. <br />
<br />
If you want to drum up a little business, I would suggest making some 5-dose versions and a couple singles, for each type of potion. Limit yourself to the level 2 (44 and under spells). When you group, mention that you use mana preservation potions, that stack with all mana preservation focus items, and link the potion. Have them add your bazaar mule to their friend list after they have sampled a freebie, you'll score enough return customers to warrant having a couple in stock at any given time.<br />
<br />
By far, my best sellers have been the SOW potions and illusion potions, with gnome and dark elf my best sellers. Iksar meat is hard to come by, but I have a dedicated customer that buys all that I make. I give away ogre and troll illusion potions to friends, and use them myself, nothing more funny than to see a half naked troll quad kiting.</div></div><hr />
