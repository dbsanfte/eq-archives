<br />
I'm still in the &quot;I'm not over the 200 Skill but making my way there&quot; category  :) and slowly but surely I will have my first 200 or higher Tradeskill.  I'm hoping to reach 250 some day :)<br />
<br />
I like to farm all of my components and while this may take me a lot longer than others of you who go to the Bazaar and buy components or have people do the farming for you, hopefully it won't take me too long.<br />
<br />
Starting skill was 184 and I had a Wis of 213.  This was with a KEI and Misty Picnic Basket.  I have been working on Acrylia Studded and Acrylia Reinforced Armor's for my skillups.  I had 105 components to attempt to trivial Acrylia Studded and once Acrylia Studded I did, I had 108 Acrylia Reinforced component attempts.  When I did trivial Acrylia Studded, a Bard friend of mine stopped by and added her Wis song which gave me a Wis of 243 for combines.<br />
<br />
I used Mask patterns to make the combines but also had 6 Gorget patterns as I had a friend who wanted 1 made.  I found out that Gorget's have a better resale value to merchants so my next skillup run will be using these.<br />
<br />
Skillup run is as follows:<br />
<br />
184 - 185   5 Combines<br />
185 - 186   3 Combines<br />
186 - 187  11 Combines<br />
187 - 188   8 Combines<br />
188 - 189  28 Combines<br />
189 - 190  14 Combines<br />
190 - 191  19 Combines<br />
191 - 192  31 Combines<br />
192 - 193  15 Combines<br />
193 - 194   1 Combine<br />
<br />
Average number of combines per skillup this run - 13.5<br />
<br />
Ending Skill 194 (2 better than I was expecting due to information read here regarding what are considered hell levels, so I'm happy with the outcome.  Especially getting 2 skillups on my last 2 combines.)<br />
<br />
As far as knowing whether I got a skillup on a failure or a success, I did not keep track of whether I had a success or a failure but I do know that at least 3 of the skillups after 188 were on failed combine attempts.  The last 2 skillups were failed combines.<br />
<br />
Did I have a string of luck?  I hope so because I have a feeling that sometime in the future I'm probably going to run into at least one situation where I don't have a skillup for around 100 combines.<br />
