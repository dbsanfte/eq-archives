<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Furiosa Novastorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did post on the old boards quite a while back looking for a tailor capable of making this, and at the time i recall being told that you were the only one even close ( I think you were on 170ish skill at the time). You also told me that I would most likely need to collect my own components.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if you would be interested in attempting combines, and if so, at what skill level I could contact you for possible combine attempts, would I need to get black pearls preimbued and would I need to get celestial tempers brewed up before hand as well as have the terrorantula silk swatches ready?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Idana Phoenixfyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, here's the scoop... I have a geerlock and I am at 214 so that's an effective skill of like 224.  I'm getting close but I still fail a lot.  I will do combines whenever you want if you bring all the materials and I will combine for free.  The point is, you decided when you are ready to take the chance.  I don't know what the success rate is even at 250 but I am certainly willing to try.  Just remember that each temper takes a blue diamond and you will need to bring enough materials for several attempts right now.  I will leave it up to you but just so you know, I am working exclusively on skilling up tailoring right now so maybe I will be farther along by the time you get all the components together.  If you don't see me on, look for Honney.<br />

PS I can make the swatches if you have silks available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Furiosa Novastorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks again for the attempts and I am over the moon with my new bracer :)<br />
I'll be off getting some more parts for further attempts in the future and see if I can't rustle you up some more spider silks :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Idana Phoenixfyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am so glad you are happy with your bracer.  I have to tell you I had a very sick feeling in the pit of my stomach as I burned through 8 combines with no item!  LOL as soon as I get some more chains made I have about enough for another 50 robe combines and hopefully I'll get a skillup or two along the way and be in a better place the next time you need something combined.</div></div><hr />
