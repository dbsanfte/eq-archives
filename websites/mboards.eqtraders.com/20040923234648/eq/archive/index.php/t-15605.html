<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SinnfullyDelicious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to share some success/failure/skillup stats with any who may be interested .. <br />
I started tracking my stats when my skill reached 137, while I was working on the Mino brewing. <br />
I did this in Neriak Foreign Quarter, DE Enchanter with 255 Int and 236 Cha. Any purchases made were done on a &quot;Benevolenced&quot; mob (faction-increase spell).<br />
<br />
Each of the following &quot;batches&quot; consists of 100 combines :<br />
Batch 1 : skill 137-146 (10 skillups), 5 success<br />
Batch 2 : skill 147-158 (12 skillups), 19 success<br />
Batch 3 : skill 159-170 (12 skillups), 32 success<br />
Batch 4 : skill 171-179 (9 skillups), 44 success<br />
Batch 5 : skill 180-184 (5 skillups), 47 success<br />
Batch 6 : skill 185-190 (6 skillups), 58 success<br />
Batch 7 : skill 191-196 (6 skillups), 66 success<br />
Batch 8 : skill 197-198 (2 skillups), 68 success<br />
Batch 9 : skill 199-202 (4 skillups), 67 success<br />
Batch 10: skill 203 (1 skillup), 68 success<br />
Batch 11: skill 204-206 (3 skillups), 66 success<br />
Batch 12 : skill 207-210 (4 skillups), 70 success<br />
Batch 13 : skill 211-214 (4 skillups), 73 success<br />
<br />
It has taken me a total of 2.5 hours to get from 0 skill to 214, started in POK making fetid essence to 122.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't know if I've just had INSANE good luck ... but before I started brewing, I withdrew 400pp from the bank, so I would know exactly how much it cost to get to 250 ... I've still got 200pp left on me, and 36 points to go till grandmaster.<br />
Yes, I know that the worst is still to come ... but each of the above &quot;batches&quot; only costs about 5pp after sellbacks ... I can't see having to do 40 more runs!<br />
Anyway, just wanted to share my experience/cost/etc with ya all ...<br />
<br />
Keep on Corkin' !!<br />
