...I think I got it off EQTC but alas, I can't seem to find it again.  Would anyone be so kind as to help me locate this grid again?<br />

I'm 60 now, 16AA's...almost crit lll wohoo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>astianax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">one of my guildmates posted this link on our messageboard yesterday. hope it helps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Healblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, a little while back they changed the URL and had a note to bookmark the new one.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that part of the reason they moved is also the reason they didn't just link to the new page from the old one.<br />
<br />
Great tool nonetheless! (I'd link it, but I'm on a friend's computer)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mystrice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">WOW, yep that's the database that I was looking for.  Appreciate the help.  Why do you suppose they moved it to another site?  Was just looking and it looks like Rujarikian (sp) wasn't the best place to hunt as a monk.  I already have 347 points in it though...so I'm just going to keep going.  What I REALLY wanted was the vampire talon for my entwood mace.  But alas, must do some MMC adventures.  Back to ldon for this monk<br />

(Got a whole AA in about an hour in CoD last night /cheer)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Probably either because the backend/bandwidth/support is nicer for them at the new place, or because the old URL was too popular for its own good and so they moved it to try and get a more managible user load.<br />
<br />
At least those are the two most likely guesses imo.</div></div><hr />
