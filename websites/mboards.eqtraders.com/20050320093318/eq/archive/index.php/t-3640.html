I am having a LOT of fun playing my little necromancer, however, and I'm wondering how difficult it would be to take up tradeskills as an evil character, particularly a lower level character.  Any feedback?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just get him to Shadowhaven or PoK, and all the tradeskill supplies you need are there.... hehe<br />
<br />
Ask Cigar though, he is a Troll and might be able to be more specific.</div></div><hr />

Being evil isnt that much of a hindrance to tradeskilling, but sometimes you just have to go about things in a different way to all the goodie-goodies ;)</div></div><hr />

With the exception of pottery, you can do any tradeskill you like.  Or you could be a wimp and once you get gather shadows and just fix SH faction and do it there.  Or you could just do everything in pok where being evil doesn't matter.</div></div><hr />

ummm.... speaking as an enchanter, if you actually make it to level 24ish, it doesn't matter what race you start as, so long as you start Agnostic....<br />
<br />
we have these spell called &quot;illusions&quot;, and they make you look like other races...</div></div><hr />

Since we couldn't go to -any- other city at the release of Kunark, Verant was kind to us and gave us most of what we need there. No plate molds, however.<br />
<br />
Anything that's not there is pretty easily findable in the bazaar or SH.</div></div><hr />
