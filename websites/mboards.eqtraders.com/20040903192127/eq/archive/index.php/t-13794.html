<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lupobolt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OMG iam sickened , iam so &lt;bleep&gt; sickened its not forgin even fun in any way shape or form .<br />
<br />
 Joe Blow just stocked his gear, as in items needed for combines , among several toons . <br />
<br />
 Oh joy new forging UI comes out he hit 217 from 0 in 9 hours , do i feel cheap , do i feel used , do i feel like the 3am last call little lady with out a 20 on the night stand and cab fair .<br />
<br />
 &lt;bleep&gt; right i do , we all just got Pokered and not in the Card Game Sense. <br />
 <br />
 Ontop of that all of us who are 250 skilled in what ever trade we must do at least one combine Again , to have it show on recipe list , so that saved who time ??<br />
<br />
 So once again i have to go back and do  combines i havent done in 6 months to a year to get it on my  &lt;bleep&gt; Recipe list.<br />
<br />
 Yet all theise young New Bloods are going what are you talking about , your skill sucks i did this X and Y over the upcoming weekend , you must have been one kind of  &lt;bleep&gt; to do it old style and on top of that you did it for fun .  &lt;bleep&gt; your stupid<br />
<br />
 With in a week i am gonna be grimmel ear ringed ,with bizaar and the new UI , and you suckers took years ,  &lt;bleep&gt; you all suck !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Moved this to the PSR where it belongs.<br />

Also cleaned up title and language.  Your use of mild profanity was extreme and excessive.  Consider yourself warned. <br />

You have every right to be upset if you so choose.  You have the right to post about being upset.   But you must remain civil and keep within the posting rules of this site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Iannyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Personally, I'd rather put up with every toon on every server being instantly granted GM status than sit through another gramatically painful experience like this post....<br />
<br />
Most of the difficulty in raiding tradeskills lies in either farming the components to make the combines, or raising the funds to buy components to make the combines.  The new UI does not alleviate any of these.<br />
<br />
I can make 200 celestial essence, 60 BDoT's, 60 Mistletoe Tempers, have a guildmate (or use my cleric twink to make the CE's while she imbues the emeralds) do the Imbuing for me on 60 emeralds.  Sheet metal is bought in Shadowhaven, as are all the molds and all the appropriate gems.  CE's can be done in PoK easily.<br />
<br />
I can do the final combines in a few minutes.  All in all, I can, from 7k pp in hand, do 20 sickle combines in an hour or less.  10 minutes if I prep the stuff before hand while LFG.<br />
<br />
Baking?  200 MTP combines, start to finish in 1 hour.  Same with QAT's for brewing. <br />
<br />
100 pottery combines takes about the same time, lacquering gems, making CE's, enchanting clay....<br />
<br />
Fletching and JC?  Just sit in front of a vendor with a few kpp.<br />
<br />
Tailoring is easily the hardest.  The closest there is to store bought skillups is Solstice robes, and those require 6 spider silks each.  Farm farm farm.<br />
<br />
All the New UI does is minimize the number of clicks for subs.  All the farming still has to be done.<br />
<br />
Now I'm ranting in circles...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I find the UI to be very nice. The experiment button to add things to my recipe list is great! I'm not running around and adding all recipe's... what would be the point... Duh... Just add as needed. *shrug*<br />
<br />
I've already got a 250 baker and brewer, and a 209 blacksmith (up from 204 last night). Most of my trades on nearly all of my characters are 100+ already also. I've paid my dues, and will be using the new UI happily thank you very much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Plus this is a gross exadgeration...<br />
<br />
the only tradeskill where HUGE amounts of time are saved is brewing (with the need for 8 items in one combine to skillup)<br />
<br />
sure it saves times in other tradeskills...<br />
<br />
What it REALLY saves is my wrist.<br />
<br />
Thank you SOE for saving my wrists!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">baking won't be as unique either.  its ok i enjoy baking for reasons other than the prestigous baker gm title.  <br />
:eek:  you say.<br />
:rolleyes: yes i say.  i cook because i enjoy it.  that's what seperates casual and purpose tradeskillers.  not ag or level or farming or anything else.  i love my spoon because of the kind person to help me get it.  it lets me keep 255 int with a geerlock in main hand and i dont have to switch out gear for merchant mugs.  the free bag is nice.  that is not the reason i cook.  i do it for fun and because its my superhero calling.  ending starvation one guilde/friend/newbie/random passerby at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I decided to go ahead and try to 250 Baking, and wait until I can earn the AAs so I can 250 Brewing, also (I have no desire to be a 1750 - I *may* GM Smithing, too, but that's it).<br />
<br />
Last night in Shadow Haven, I made 36 HMPs (Would've been more, but I failed a few cream + fillet combines and 1 HMP combine). Didn't get any skill-ups, but if it wasn't for the new UI, I wouldn't have bothered. <br />
<br />
I have 10 picnic baskets (found them on a vendor a while back), and may try to do some MTP combines tonight when I log on, even though I know I likely won't have any successes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Noni DeeCups</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I got incredibly frustrated trying to do a simple combine like a firesilk swatch. I did the experiment and it still didn't add it to my list. I almost logged in tears I was so frustrated because I wanted it to work so bad. <br />

I hope I have more time to fiddle with it tonight however my guild is demanding in the &quot;if you are on, you will raid&quot; attitude :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">don't bother with pop combines yet.  they released it before they had all the combines they want in it.  pop and cultural and apparently enchanted jewelry haven't be tagged can learn yet.  <br />
<br />
sorry noni.  <br />
<br />
tanker said:<br />
1. Recipe's marked AutoLearn in the database will automatically show up when you have a skill &gt;= (trivial - 50) and you perform a search which the recipe matches.<br />
<br />
2. Searches can only return 100 recipes. If a recipe is not being found, and you know it's AutoLearn, then restrict your search by limiting the trivial's involved, or entering part of the name of the recipe (usually the name of the item created). Note that there's a text message displayed in chat when you hit 100 recipes on a search, telling you this.<br />
<br />
3. Recipe's marked CanLearn in the database will not show up in the recipe list until you perform one successful combine of that recipe in the old interface (experiment). After you have been notified that you've learned the recipe, you can then search for it in the new UI, and use it to perform combines. If you successfully perform a recipe combine in the old UI and don't get the &quot;you have learned&quot; message, then you either already have the recipe due to it being AutoLearn and within range of yoiur skill, or it is not marked CanLearn (for now, that may change later, of course, but then you'll have to &quot;learn&quot; it after it's changed).<br />
<br />
So, if you tried it in Experiment mode and were successful, but didn't learn it, then check again to see if you can search for it by name (it might be autolearn). if not, then you can't learn it right now.<br />
<br />
4. Marking said recipes AutoLearn and CanLearn is a work in progress. A lot of recipes can (and probably will) get marked as one or the other in the near future.<br />
<br />
5. All data about what recipes you &quot;know&quot; is stored on the server, as is the recipe data. You can't find it on your client side... it's not there.<br />
<br />
6. Some people want to switch the Right-click/Ctrl-right-click functionality of Tradeskill containers. Just click the &quot;Use CtrlRClick&quot; button on the new UI, and regular right-click will open the container in the old, bag-style; you'll have to Ctrl-right-click the bag to bring it up in the new UI.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was pretty sure that I posted pre-release that not all recipes would be flagged with the initial launch of the TS-Interface, but that a great many of them would be. <br />
<br />
That still holds true, what you currently have access to is merely the first evaluation of the tradeskill recipes. I'm currently in the process of making the second round of flaggings, which should make it to you guys with the next scheduled update. Nothing to be angry about yet, I've not forgotten you.   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">One thing I want to say<br />
<br />
How many people ranting here have actually used the UI?<br />
<br />
COME ON PEOPLE THINK BEFORE RANTING!<br />
<br />
OMG, 200+ triv recipes are not listen, SO LEARN IT. One more combine surely can't be so hard to do?<br />
<br />
Ok, one thing I noted which was odd. Searched for Tempers... Lizard Blood Temper was listed (Scale Temper + Tae Ew Blood). <br />
Scale Temper was NOT listed :confused: <br />
<br />
So I combined via experiment a Scale temper and learned it, then went on to make the Lizard Blood Temper, big deal :-/<br />
<br />
I was annoyed Cultral stuff was CannotLearn, meant I had to do 40 combines the old way. Am I going to rant and rave about it? I just hope they add it later but no big lose.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry, just getting annoyed at all the negative posts here, will go chill.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">In a raft of negative posts about the UI, I wanted to add my voice lifted in praise of this new tool.  I found that it was very nice in a lot of subtle and a few not-so-subtle ways.  As is my style, my list:<br />
<br />
Tradskill Container/Storage box: This is by far the nicest part of the new UI for me.  I had no space to work with, but I needed to make jumjum salad.  I bought the components, but the only place I had to store them was the mixing bowl itself, and since I needed to do four combines, there was no way to make it fit and still use the bowl.  In the old world, I'd have gone somewhere secluded, thrown the stuff on the ground, then picked it up as I had room, and then thrown down the results.  With the new UI, it didn't care that I had only one spot to put it.  When I auto-made it and auto-inventoried it, it took from and returned to the bowl itself.  No more ground-storing!<br />
<br />
Learning:  I've heard a lot of wailing about having to do combines that someone hasn't done in six months all over again just to get it in the list.  My question to them is, if you haven't used it in six months, why do you care if it's listed?  I did all of the subcombines for my picnics the old fashioned way, and I had to do 12 final combines the old way before I got a success (I'm only 200 baking), but once I got one success, it joined my list and I ran the rest of the two stacks in a fraction of the time it usually takes.  Next time, it'll be there.<br />
<br />
Speed: I did two stacks of picnics, a stack of Halas pies and 150 idols last night.  I estimate I saved over ten thousand clicks in total, and more than half an hour.  'Nuff said.<br />
<br />
Education:  Misty Thicket picnics trivial at 355?!?  Who'd have known that?  A minor point, but it's nice to know exactly.  Also, the difficulty list updates in real time.  I watched pottery recipes go from yellow to white to dark blue the moment I got skillups.  Again, minor, but it's a nice touch, and it makes parts estimating so much easier!<br />
<br />
All in all, I'm delighted with the new UI.  For cultural, I haven't lost anything, but for stuff that used to be drudgery, now it's much faster and easier.  Making my own picnics hasn't been worth it for a while, just because of all the clicking involved.  Now, I'm willing to do it again.  A skill run that would have blown my whole night now just flies by.  To all of the developers who busted their tails to get this in place, you have my undying gratitude.  For at least one beleaguered tradeskiller, you've hit the bullseye.<br />
<br />
Silverfish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Cendorly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I haven't had a chance yet to try out the new UI.  I logged in and looked at it, it looks cool, but that's about it.<br />
<br />
At first, when I heard about the new UI, I was angry, and felt used, and had similar emotions to the initial poster who started this thread.  Then I forgot about it for a few days, and when I thought about it again, I realized this.<br />
<br />
I started doing tradeskills waaaay back when for MY own enjoyment and benefit - at the time the prayer shawl and pitted iron ring quest were my driving factors.  After those were done, then tradeskills were to make stuff for me, my friends, my twinks, and reselling for some cash.  After that, it was to get to 250 in all tradeskills after that...well..I'm still working on that.<br />
<br />
I did all my tradeskills the old fashioned way - zillions of clicks, millions of hours farming, etc.  I don't care anymore if joe bloe can come in and in 2 hours get from 0 -250 in brewing.  Good for him.  Will he have the memories of deep and elightening chats with close friends that I had while doing Minotaur brews to help pass the boredom and time?<br />
<br />
Once he's ready to work on smithing, will he feel the pain and suffering known as tradeskills putting each component one at a time into the container and holding his breath as he hits combine hoping for a skillup knowing how long it took to get those components for ONE attempt?<br />
<br />
Will he be able to make a post like this one saying &quot;I remember the days when I had to do 1,598, 398, 129.93 subcombines to make Heraldic Armor?<br />
<br />
No.  But I will...<br />
<br />
When I am old and gray and EQ is a vague memory, I will forever have the memories of my tradeskill days.  I will be able to proudly stand up and say I got to 250 in all tradeskills the OLD FASHIONED WAY<br />
<br />
Yes, it's akin to your grandparents telling you how they walked 20 million miles in the snow to school...or freezing in the winter because they didn't have heat but rather had to huddle around a little wood powered stove.  But it's more then that.  It's the memories.  It's the character and the strength and the entertainment and the enjoyment and the fact that I did it.<br />
<br />
Congrats to all the future 250er's in JC, Brewing and all other skills because the time has been cut in half.  To those people, EQ is just a &quot;game&quot;, something to conquer, another stepping stone towards &quot;winning&quot; eq.  Maybe to some, the new UI lets them experience tradeskills, something they always wanted to do, but didn't have the time, perserverance, nor will to do it.  Now they can, and why not?  The new UI is like everything else in society, something comes along that makes it better, some embrace it, some detest it.  Some wonder how they lived without it.  Some wished they still lived without it.  <br />
<br />
To me, tradeskills are a huge part of my EQ experience and, my character (both in game and in real life) and have given to me more then I could have ever imagined through the countless hours solo farming while contemplating life, love and beyond...through the endless clicking while sharing each success/failure with friends, through many different ways.  I believe that if I used the new UI to level up my tradeskills, it would not be as much fun, rewarding nor memorable as the way I leveled up my tradeskills.<br />
<br />
Now before I sign off, let me add a disclaimer.  I am not a masocist.  Crazy? Possibly...Masocist, definitely not.  I am also not shunning the new UI.  I believe it is a HUGE boost to the game and to tradeskillers, and I know and believe many, many people will be happy with it.  Heck, this new UI actually revived me to thinking that maybe I WILL Do the prayer shawl again with my bard...maybe...<br />
<br />
All I am saying is that it's all about the attitude towards the new UI, and the new UI isn't necessarily the &quot;bad&quot; thing that some make it out to seem, nor do the tradeskillers that reach 250 using it are to be looked down upon.  They are using a tool that is given to them, and though they have it easier then those that came before them, those that came before them will have their experiences to share.  It's all in how you look at it...<br />

1st Time Poster...<br />
<br />
I wanted to congradulate Cendorly on getting to 1750 the OLD FASHION way it must have been very difficult concidering Silk and Pelts did not stack and you could only carry 80 max at any one time, then only store 80 in your bank also.  That is only 8 stacks for you youn'ins and you could have NOTHING else in ANY bag anywhere.  <br />
<br />
The things that did stack you had to use a slider bar to pick up the one at a time you needed.  None of this fancy Cntr and Shift clicking you get today.<br />
<br />
You had to farm your own stuff or sit in EC Tunnel for hours to buy anything since there was no Bazzar.<br />
<br />
Heck to get 250 in all 7 skills the OLD FASHION WAY ment having 7 charators each a Grand Master in it's own skill.  Back then the only option was to get each of those charators up to farm stuff on thier own,  or swap everything from your farmer to your baby tradeskiller via Dropping, Friend assist, or pileing it into a trade container. That is a much bigger pain than using a few aaxp to get just one charator to 1750.<br />
<br />
I just thougth I would stop and say you are a very dedicated person to your crafts to have done it this way and to not have been another 250er's in JC, Brewing and all other skills because the time has been cut in half. To those people, EQ is just a &quot;game&quot;, something to conquer, another stepping stone towards &quot;winning&quot; eq.  <br />
<br />
My hat is off to you.<br />
<br />
Wait... you didn't do it the NOT so OLD FASHION way did you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Thicket Tundrabog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I really like the new tradeskill interface.<br />
<br />
Last night I used it for 100 Kaladim Constitutional combines. With 8 items in the final combine, the tradeskill interface made things soooooo much easier. The pre-combines were also easier. Finally, I didn't have to organize the stuff in my containers to get ready for the combines.<br />
<br />
I am utterly amazed at the folks that complain about the interface. I'm not sure what planet you are on. BTW, I'm 11 points away from the 1750 club, and got there the 'old-fashioned way'. I only wish the interface was around sooner... Lol.<br />
<br />
Great work by everyone involved.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gillin Whisperfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just have to post my 2cp here...<br />
<br />
When I first heard of the new UI, my second thought was... Oh boy, here comes the end of looking for GM traders. Well, I still think that is the case. But then, for me, that's not a big deal!!<br />
<br />
I've never been in the forefront of the tradeskiller pack anyways, so I'm not missing anything this way. I feel kind of bad for the people who crawled their way up by their fingertips doing combines the old fashioned way. But at the same time, the people who really got there when thing were *really* hard have already been in excellent positions to make profit from their investment way back then. And bully for them that they did! :)<br />
<br />
After using the new UI to hit 200 Brewing, and having used it to do sub-combines on some stuff... I can only approve of it. For those skills, tailoring and smithing that are largely limited by gathering materials, this is a small perk for doing sub-combines. Celestial Essence? Velium Temper? I LOVE THE NEW UI!!!<br />
<br />
I'll admit my first thought was something having to do with Dark Ages, and my impression has not changed terribly much after using it... But I also think their implementation is enough different to satisfy me. I really like seeing all the items I need in terms of have and need when doing a learned recipe. My only idea for them would be to have those slots show the names of the items while holding down the Alt key.<br />
<br />
Overall, my experience with the new UI is a definitive thumbs up! Wrist is much happier too, good point Ngreth.<br />
<br />
Cheers and happy skilling!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fulminate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I've been tradeskilling since 2000, so I've seen a lot of changes in how things work.<br />
<br />
The new UI may make it easier to tradeskill, and thus encourage more people to get into it, but it, and some other recent changes, will make actual advancement in a tradeskill (other than brewing :) ) harder, too.<br />
<br />
First, there is the changes to vendors.  Vendor mining used to be quite the source for components, at least for me.  Not many people knew to do it, so goodies would sometimes stack up in great numbers.  Now vendors show their -entire- inventory, and someone will always buy the goodies out, if only to put them on their bazaar mule at many times what the vendor charges.   And when people continually buy out the vendor stock of a tradeskill item, eventually all the vendors slots will be filled with other garbage, and any new tradeskill items sold to him will be sent into the great digital void, and thus never get into the hands of actual tradeskillers.  The overall availability of components goes down.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second, if the new UI does, indeed, result in a great influx of new tradeskillers,  it will mean a greatly increased demand for tradeskill components.  This will drive up the price of said components (even beyond their currently dizzying hieghts!) for those who try to buy them in the bazaar.  Those who cant (or wont) pay the Bazaar prices will only have direct farming available as a source of components (since, as explained above, vendors effectively no longer carry tradeskill components).  This will result in putting far more people into the farming grounds,  resulting in an excess of farmers, and nobody farming very fast.<br />
<br />
<br />
Horribly expensive components in the Bazaar, with the other option being very slow/tedious farming, will result in many of those new Tradeskillers getting fed up with the whole process, and them quitting their persuit of it.  At least in tradeskills that require dropped components to advance significantly.<br />
<br />
Gonna be a lot of GM brewers running around soon.</div></div><hr />

What cultural stuff? Heraldic is learnable.<br />

<br />
In the old world, I'd have gone somewhere secluded, thrown the stuff on the ground, then picked it up as I had room, and then thrown down the results.  <br />
<br />
Well, kind of obsolete now, but did you know you could open up an oven, pottery wheel, or other fixed tradeskill container, and move your overflow to it, while you used the mixing bowl? A lot safer than dropping it on the ground.<br />

Just do it in an empty zone somewhere, so you don't keep someone else from using it.</div></div><hr />
