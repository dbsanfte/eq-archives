Hello All,<br />
<br />
After yesterday's patch, by default, you are now ALL invisible to EQIM, so, if you want your friends to be able to see you online, you need to type ;invis ingame so that you can make yourself visible/invisible. This command works as a toggle so that you can use the same command to invis/uninvis.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the confusion. Special thanks to &quot;TheNexus&quot; for bringing this to my attention.<br />

Seems to me it would have made more sense for it to default to visible and note the command to make yourself invisible in the patch message, as someone else suggested on the tech support boards.  But that note from the devs seems to say they're not going to do that. It's going to be more trouble than it's worth to chase everyone I know down and get them to use the command.  All I'll use the IM for now is channels.  :roll:  <br />

That is REALLY annoying if you do lots of transfers like I do *sigh*</div></div><hr />

Well your requests were taken into consideration and the development team has set it so you are visble by default again.<br />
A team is still working to update the Serverinfo.xml file with the new servers and corrected information, so that should be working soon.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your suggestions!<br />

Did they kick that in with the latest patch?  /hoping</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verdandi</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, it's working now. :)  I actually discovered it for myself when I logged on the IM, and then went over to the Tech Support forums to see if they'd made any official statement on it.  I wanted to be sure it wasn't just a trial thing or even unintentional hehe.<br />
<br />
I've been using it just for chat channels, but now it's good for tells again.  Yay!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verdandi</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They also said somewhere or other that they're still working on issues with some of the servers.  New one(s) need adding and Quellious has never worked, etc.  But they appear to have it on the list to get fixed.  And they can patch the IM any ole time, so the fix might come sooner than patches.</div></div><hr />
