So if you want a sheet you'll need to have 3 large bricks enchanted, them combine them and hammer them out.<br />

=(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragvar</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only works on large bricks.<br />
Three large bricks must be conbined to make a block, therefore one folded sheet will be three large bricks, and a three sheet recipe will be a total of nine large bricks.<br />
At level 54 the enchanter who enchants my brellium uses almost a full load of mana to enchant nine large bricks. That's with a Clarity II self buff.<br />
Working with any of the Cultural Recipes is an investment in time and plat.<br />
 :shock:</div></div><hr />

<br />
FYI... at 49 a full load of mana is only good for 6 bricks :(</div></div><hr />

STILL can't get 10 full bricks out of a bar of mana. **** that's a lot of enchanting!<br />
<br />
I usually grab her and do 60 bricks at a time.  :shock: sometimes more, if she's not in the mood to go hunting. She did almost 100 in one night for me one time. :shock:  :shock: <br />
<br />
I'm always SO eternally gratefull for her help, and she won't let me pay her! I know when I get to the level when I can make the Ubah Brell armor, she'll be wantin some though. :) That's cool with me!</div></div><hr />
