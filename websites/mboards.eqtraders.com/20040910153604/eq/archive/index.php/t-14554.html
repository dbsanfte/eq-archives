<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was curious if anyone tried fishing on the Plane of Storms?<br />
I heard that there is water in the Graveyard so it is safe to fish solo in there at lvl 55.<br />
Did any of you try this solo at around lvl 55.......do you ever get attacked?<br />
Are the fish you catch there worth anything?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Saraban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, the graveyard is a safe place to fish. No mobs wander there and people really cannot train mobs to the zone line in PoStorms.<br />
<br />
I've used this place to finally train fishing up to 200 since you can get plenty of Storm Salmon there. These fish are used in some nice baking recipes (http://www.eqtraders.com/search/reverse_recipe_search.php?item=5914&amp;menustr=035000000000) which took me to 215 in Baking...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Where is the entrance to Plane of Storms? If i am lvl 55....do I have to be flagged?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No, if you are level 55+ you do not need any flags to enter PoStorms.  The fishing pond is immediately behind you when you zone in.  <br />
<br />
The entrance to get in the zone is near the windmill.  Go up to the grass and look for a cave with an opening circled in rocks in the grassy hill.  Go through the tunnel, pass the bridge and get to the really big rock with the &quot;force field&quot; surrounding it.  Click that and you are in PoS.  If you have maps from maps.eq-toolbox.com, it is marked on your map.  <br />
<br />
I haven't fished in PoS for awhile, but I do remember there was an issue with land sharks while fishing there.  The best solution I found to this problem was to lev and stand right over the pond in the middle.  That eliminated any nearby land sharks.  <br />
<br />
Good luck fishing.  If you are planning to work on baking, you will find storm salmon very useful as you near 200.  If not, be sure to save them for friends or your bazaar mule.  No other unique fish are in the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sylphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In Storms I like to go out away from shore and stand on one of the rocks out there.  This avoids the land shark problem and also the scenery is very nice.</div></div><hr />

A long time ago someone trained the level 70 bee above the entrance to the zo cave. <br />
<br />
It was safe where it was to enter the cave, just scary to see it there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK, i'll rephrase that sentence :<br />
<br />
No mobs wander there and people really cannot train mobs to the zone line in PoStorms unless they are trying really hard  :D</div></div><hr />
