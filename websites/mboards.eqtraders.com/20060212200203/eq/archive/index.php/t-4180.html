The other day I am selling off some stuff and the vendor had Imbued black sapphires on him.  Is it possible that there is a bertox cleric on the server??  (If so I would kill for the name, cause I see there is none in imbuers for hire)  Or could it have been a random thing the vendors get after a patch.   The only thing that sucks is that I could only afford 1, and when I went back after I sold some stuff for the pp in the bazaar the rest were gone(((((((((((<br />
<br />
I have a bertox cleric up to 12 but lvling a cleric is very painful for me, I like to hit things.<br />
<br />
Any ideas</div></div><hr />

<br />
a customer of mine recently told me he got his imbued amber (Cazic Thule) made by a Barbarian Shaman...<br />
<br />
was very surprised, to say the less, then I went on cultural clicking and forgot about it...<br />
<br />
now, can Bar Shamans imbue Amber?<br />
<br />
or has the deity restriction on imbue spells been silently removed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verdandi</div><div class="date">02-27-2003, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mimoza, that might have been me hehe.  I imbued some amber for someone in PoK recently.  The diety restriction on imbue spells only checks when you scribe the spell, not when you cast it.  That check used to be broken, so anyone of the right class could still scribe them.  I got Amber and Jade as well as Ivory before they fixed it.  Because the check is only when you scribe and not when you cast, I can still use them. :)<br />
<br />
It's a shame Sapphire has always been bugged for shamans or I woulda nabbed that one too.  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
now I know what to tell people asking me to imbue Jade...<br />
<br />
&quot;it's much more fun having it done by a barbarian, trust me - I happen to know one who will do it for you :)&quot;<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />
