Which is weird, since the forums are still here.<br />

Just thought I would give you a heads up in case you hadn't noticed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Where do we go to match the price?<br />
<br />
Sure a few people have offered free hosting and bandwith.  Some if we buy the server (servers are out of our price range) some jsut flat out.<br />
<br />
We have done free hosting before... and well it just imposes horribly on the host.  with both parts, (site and boards) we easily do 250 gigs of data a month... that is a huge amount, and a LARGE amount of money for anyone that would give us &quot;free&quot; hosting.  So while they think they want to help, what we have experienced is that it will cause a problem in the future.<br />
<br />
Everywhere else I have looked will double our costs.<br />
<br />
Plus there is the days we will be down AGAIn during the move and the DNS propigation...  <br />
<br />
PLUS racknine still has a chance to get our data back... and if we leave, they have no incintive to get it to us without a lawsuit that is more than Niami and I can afford.<br />
<br />
The problem was an oversight when they re-implemented our accounts when they redid our server.  WE have 4 &quot;accounts&quot; of 50 gigs... they overlooked &quot;linking&quot; them to give us our full 200 gigs of traffic... so the first account reached its 50 Gig limit... and poof the error.  This has been rectified.</div></div><hr />
