I don't think they've ever come out and explicitly said that it was safe to use the keyrings since the big warning that they weren't working.  Has anyone been using them and had any problems at all?<br />
<br />
I'm a wee bit hesitant about letting go of my Bag 'O Keys until I'm sure I won't lose them!   :shock:</div></div><hr />

I REALLY need my bag space :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verdandi</div><div class="date">01-07-2003, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doh, some other replies that were here have been lost.  None of them indicated any problems yet, although the mood seems to still be very cautious hehe.<br />
<br />
For the record, I'd like to put in a reminder that keys will NOT be on your keyring unless you have used them once.  I know the folks who have posted here, this is just a Public Service Announcement that I probably should have put in my first post hehe.  Once you acquire a key you must use it once and see the message that it was added to your keyring before it will be there.<br />
<br />
Okay here's another question then, how do the Tower of Frozen Shadow keys work?  They're the biggest hog of my bag space.  I have all but the key to 7 and the master key.  When we were given the ambiguous patch message that implied that keys were working okay again and went and used my key to the second floor, it told me that my fifth floor key had been added.  I assume that means the key from fifth to sixth floor, the highest one.  Does that mean that having a higher floor key automatically gives you access to the lower floors now?  That'd be great, even if it does mean that I wasted a whole heck of a lot of time soloing for the lower level keys ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skeeno</div><div class="date">01-07-2003, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My Monk has keys up to the 5th floor. I have used them and subsequently deleted each one. I can now get thru each floor up to 5 without a problem.<br />
<br />
I got the third floor key before I got te first or second, but not knowing for sure how the keys worked I took the time to recamp fisrt and second. I did not get a message when using the first and second floor portals after I had already used the thrid floor one, so it is my belief that all you need is the highest level key you can get and you will not need to go back thru to get the previous floor's keys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yakk</div><div class="date">01-07-2003, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can view your keyring.<br />
<br />
Look at your keyring.  Use the key.  Look again at your key ring.  Notice the extra entry.<br />
<br />
Now, try using the door/portal without having your key on your pointer, just to convince yourself it works.<br />
<br />
So long as the key is on your keyring (it gets there when you use it), you don't need the physical key itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verdandi</div><div class="date">01-07-2003, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yakk, the thing is that when I check my keyring it only shows me as having the fifth floor key even though I have the lower ones and have used them (without getting the message).  That's when I realized that now you apparently don't need the lower level ones.  But with as big of a pain as they can be to get, I didn't want to assume :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You did need the lower level ones...but for some reason, the keyring only shows the highest lvl key you have. I don't know how it works if you're missing a mid-level.<br />
<br />
Man, I love ToFS. So relaxing. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curufea</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a bug some day in here...<br />
I had only the 3rd key, and clic on the wrong mirror of the first floor. The one that leeds to the top and not to the second floor ;)<br />
<br />
A message said that the key was added to my keyring, and to my big surprise I was able to climb up all floors without any key.<br />
So I suppose that once your key is in your keyring it is considered as the master key... :)<br />
Just try to use a stone without the key, you'll see if that's true ;p ;))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tassrin</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now I know that this won't be as interesting an addition to the discussion as some would like, but its relavent.<br />
<br />
Maybe I did it wrong, maybe I tried when the keys &quot;weren't working&quot; but I have never gotten a message, nor gotten a key added to my ring for the keys from Befallen. Is this correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verdandi</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some keys will go on the keyring and some won't.  For the ones that won't you will still need to hang on to the actual key.  Kinda stinks, but at some keys on a keyring is better than none!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cymbro</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know this thread's a bit old, but I did have an interesting tidbit.  In TOFS, I was hunting with a friend and had picked up the first and second keys.  He had more, so we hunted in the wedding hall for a while, several of the enraged popping over the course of the night.  My next trip in that key was added to my ring, and I can go through all of the mirrors to that point.  I never got the key from the servant's floor, or from Cara, but I get through both of those mirrors just fine.<br />

  I recently raided ToFS, and I LOVED it.   Next time you are going, can I tag along and maybe grab a few keys?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verdandi</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point.  I noticed they were all added to my ring after just using the first floor one, so I thought that might be how it worked.  For the sake of thoroughness, I can also add that I've now added both my shrine and tofs keys to my keyring and deleted the originals and am still using them with no problem.  Haven't gotten around to hitting Sebilis or Charasis yet to add those, but also haven't heard of any problems with em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Carmaris</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I deleted my HS, OS, and shrine keys--two are fairly easily replaced and for the number of times I've stepped into HS, I wouldn't bother to replace it if something happened to my keyring.  However, given that this is a computer game and bugs/errors do occur, I would never delete a key that showed a substantial amount of investment, i.e. ST or VP.  I'd simply bank it after first use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystic Lioness</div><div class="date">02-11-2003, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How do you view your keyring?  <br />
<br />
My cleric has the keys up to the wedding floor in TOFS and I have been saving them in the bank even though I got the message that they have been added to my keyring.  If I could view my keyring, I would feel more comfortable destroying them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
deleted OS and HS keys and it works fine still<br />
<br />
each key in ToFS gives access to all keys below it. so if you go with a group to the fifth floor and you get a key there then you have access all the way to the fifth floor. Tserrinas key gives access to all floors and the mirror on the left.<br />
<br />
havent been back to VP since the keyrings were introduced<br />
<br />
have VT on keyring but wrapped that sucker in bubble wrap and carefully stored it in breakproof storage (no way im EVER doing that quest again)<br />
<br />
im far from a computer programmer but i suspect they made keys to be like character flags so the computer just reads what flag you have. i know that the Key to the lower ruins of Xvanom (sp?) is indeed listed under /key, so why not the same for seb key :)</div></div><hr />
