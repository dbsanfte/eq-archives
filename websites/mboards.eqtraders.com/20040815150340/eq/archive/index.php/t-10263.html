<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rissenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, with a skill of 200 and a +5% device, what success rate could I expect on making Qeynos Afternoon Tea?<br />
<br />
<br />
Just heading into them now and would like to know if its worth it or not.<br />
<br />
Thanks..:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>andaerice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Success rate should be very high, almost not noticable that you don't exactly have the skill (210 effective vs. 226).  My cleric with the same 200+geerlok made these all the time.  In general it looked like this...<br />
<br />
Effective skill: 210<br />
203: Surefall Ranger's Trail Juice - No problem<br />
216: Grobb Liquidized Meat - about 5% failures, hardly noticable<br />
226: Qeynos Afternoon Tea - again, hardly noticable<br />
246: Innothule Triple Bile - will probably take 2-3 tries to make it<br />
248: Mino Brew &amp; Avalanche Ale - high failure rates<br />
250+: Champagnes - chance of success 1/10 or worse<br />
250+: Kaladim Constitutionals - almost no chance, fails 50% of the time at 250+geerlok<br />
<br />
I made nice profit on these buying the forages in bazaar for 10pp ea., so profit would be much higher if you go and forage them yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rissenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank you very much for the answer Andaerice. It was exactly what I was looking for.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">confirming what andaerice said for Qeynos Tea :) In fact when I first tried em at 168 skill I had solid 50% success on them, and they were such a nice item (profits and using em myself) that they are why I decided to take Brewing over 200 along with Baking. <br />
<br />
also, I started making Demi-Sec Champagnes at 194 skill and had ~50% success rate. By the time I got up to 230 skill i was at 95% success on them. So you should have good success at 200 + geerlok.<br />
<br />
and /agree... don't bother with kaladim constitutionals until you're much closer to 250 LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rissenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yep, 200+5% seems to be working excellent. 50 combines and only one failure so far. Thanks for the help.<br />
<br />
P.S: If anyone on Firiona Vie server has any Tea Leaves to sell, send me a tell (Rissenn)</div></div><hr />
