<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I did, but not EQ.  Today is the LAST day working my weekday job.  I will still work my other job, famous hot dog and baloney maker, which is a compressed 30 hour weekend shift.<br />
BUT, starting monday, my responsibilities and priorities get completely changed.  Now, I hope that this doesn't make some of you jealous, as it did with my co-workers, but I get to stay home and raise my own childern:sing: :hyper: :sing: :hyper: :sing: <br />
I know, that is a job in and of itself, but it means that someone else is not raising them for us.</div></div><hr />

Then you get to get up the next morning and do it all over with brand new rewards and a new kind of smile. <br />

I'm just glad for other people that choose to stay home with the kiddies-- so I don't have to.  Some of us make better parents than others.<br />

My husband still hasn't learned not to lay on his stomach on the floor.  Our girl (almost 4) has the world's sharpest knees which she uses to good effect...right on his kidneys *cringe*  We call it the &quot;Little People's Knee&quot;.  I dunno...*I* think it's funny =)  Of course, I'M smart enough to collapse in a chair :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Big congrats Rewde, I hadn't quite intended to stop working for so long..but after the last 4 years of being a stay-at-home mom I have to say it's the only job I've ever actually loved =)  And I truly dread the day I go into a less exciting career haha!</div></div><hr />

I look forward to the day when I'm married w/kids and will be able to raise them.. I will be the one to hear thier first word, see them take thier first step, show them all the ants and bugs and birds outside and see the wonder in thier eyes the first time they see all of this. No amount of money can replace that kind of joy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grimina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I miss you too Noish (gads, did I just say that?!?!) but I most assuredly do NOT miss EQ *giggle*  I haven't gotten to the point where I can stop surfing my fave messageboard though, so I can still keep up with all the trials and tribulations of my friends.  So, have hope...Grimmy is still &quot;listening&quot; =)<br />

<br />
I'd say something wittily ironic here, but being too tired and sick to do so, I'll just stick with gently pointing out that the original poster here is not a stay at home mom, but a stay at home dad.<br />
<br />
And yup, there's something to be said for getting to see the kid figure out any number of new and exciting things-- but it's also nice to come home after most of those new and exciting things have been cleaned off the carpet, walls, and ceiling, and leave again before the next day's discoveries start.<br />
<br />
It's a good thing it takes all kinds, because we got all kinds.<br />
