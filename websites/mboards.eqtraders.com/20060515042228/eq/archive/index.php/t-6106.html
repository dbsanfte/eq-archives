<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanna</div><div class="date">04-16-2003, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm skilling up several low tradeskills very slowly, keeping an eye out for trivials I can narrow. Consequently, I have an odd assortment of very incongruous items. <br />
<br />
And, especially since the Sullon marketplace board is all but unused, I doubt I'll be treading on anyone's toes if I just hijack this opening post for any sort of use I can think of. Mostly, it will be geared towards me getting rid of tradeskill stuff I make. <br />
<br />
Last note: My sig file can be counted on to be more accurate than this thread. Refer to it if desiring my current skill lvl in a skill. <br />
-- April 16, 2003, Wed.<br />
<br />
<br />
BAKING<br />
Skill: 195<br />
Currently making Halas 10, will switch to MTP as soon as I dare. <br />
Will make: Anything that's not trivial, free, if you bring me the combines. Want me to try for Hero sandwich, Justice Fruit Pies? Bring me the hard to get items, and I will attempt the combine for no charge. I will also make anything that is trivial for an appropriate fee. (This type of offer extends to all other tradeskills as well.) <br />
<br />
<br />
BREWING<br />
Skill: 127<br />
I am engaged in finding Loy cultural robe dye trivials. Bring me the item (sylvan berries, ashweed, etc) and I'll be happy to perform the combine. I will also make various tempers and tannings for little/no fee, if you bring the components. <br />
I have a mortar and pestle for combining stones to get Crushed Whatever. Save yourself the plat and bank slot and hail me. <br />
<br />
<br />
BLACKSMITHING<br />
Skill: 96<br />
I'm watching this one closely, as Iroke is a WE and can narrow some cultural trivials. <br />
Will Make: Banded armor for anywhere from 4p to 8p an item. Ornate chain for cost.<br />
<br />
<br />
FISHING<br />
Skill: 30<br />
I have Thunder Salmon sitting in my bank, for a reason that completely escapes me now.  And if you need #$%^ roots, hail me, I must kill the trees in Pok with all the #$%^ roots I get. <br />
<br />
<br />
FLETCHING<br />
Skill: 17<br />
-- In search of WECul trivs, I have 2 Blessed Mithril Arrowheads and 3 Imbued Emerald Shards. If you are a WoodElf with a smithing skill of 85-95, you may have the 3 shards IF you go get the mithril to test the trivial on making the Arrowheads. I'm hoping to sell my 2 Arrowheads for 15p together, to cover cost of Emerald. If you want them, we'll strike out a deal, b/c they're taking up bank space darnit. <br />
-- In search of smithing trivial, I have 25 (that's a stack and a piece) of Steel Shafts. Vendor price to you is 3p, I will sell them for 2p each (that's 50p for the lot). I did find the trivial on making these, but I can't bear to sell them back to the vendor. Please get them away from me. <br />
<br />
<br />
Jewelrycraft<br />
Skill: 4<br />
Sorry, this one is going to be a while....<br />
<br />
<br />
POTTERY<br />
Skill: 54<br />
My pottery knowledge doesn't go very far. Apparently there is a warrior quest that requires some kind of potted dish? I can do that, was hired once for that. At any rate, if you need something, I'll be happy to help if I can. <br />
<br />
<br />
TAILORING<br />
Skill: 48<br />
Will make: Patchwork if brought materials free. (If you need patchwork, you don't have money anyway.) Studded leather for cost of studs unless you bring them.  Will take a crack at Wu's if you can cover cost of mana vials. <br />
<br />
<br />
Other random things I have from time to time and wouldn't mind getting rid of: <br />
-- Spiderling silk, silk thread<br />
-- Basilisk eggs (looted)<br />
-- Plant Shoots (from JPF)<br />
-- Luclin foraged Mushrooms<br />
-- Bread Tin<br />
-- Frying Pan (JPF)<br />
<br />
This post will be heavily edited as the above information changes. <br />
If the moderators have a problem, I apologize in advance; I'm not trying to be evil (I worship Tunare!), just trying to help anyone, and get rid of stuff (Blessed Mithril Arrowheads in mind). <br />
<br />
If I can help you in any way, please do not hesitate to drop me a line, but please be patient if I respond with 'fighting' or an AFK message.<br />
See post below for my current Want List.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have this, please can we strike some kind of deal? <br />
<br />
-- Fine Steel. It's smithable to HQ Ore, and since that costs a load to buy from the vendor, I generally bide my time till I can get the FS as loot. My skill is rapidly reaching known trivials, please please please help if you can. <br />
<br />
-- Essence of Fire. Massively unknown trivials on the Firey Weapons. Again, please help if you can before my skill gets too high. I know this stuff is a rare drop, I'll try to compensate you however I can. <br />
<br />
<br />
Drop me a note in game if you wish. And thanks in advance !!!</div></div><hr />
