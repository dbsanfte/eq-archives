<br />
There are Rusty, Tarnished, and Forged versions of Fer'Esh, Shan'Tok, and Sheer Blade.<br />
<br />
So has anyone even bothered to try making Silvered? Firebrand? or anything else just like all the Pick, Axe, Broadsword, Long Sword, Scimitar, War Hammers etc do?<br />
<br />
This seems terribly obvious to do, and exist. So really, has anyone thought to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Velaraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, because molds for those weapons don't exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zuklaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Having an Iksar Shaman alt. yes they can, molds purchasable only in East Cabilis from Smithy Krikt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">because long sword and firebrand are wastes of time.  at best acrylia, tae ew, black acrylia might be worth something and they don't get made often.  nobody probably thought to try them before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zuklaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok, it got me curious.<br />
<br />
The normal combines can only be done by an Iksar in the Cabilis forge. (Verified by my Ogre main with good Cabilis faction)<br />
<br />
With my Iksar Shaman, all three did not combine with silver.<br />
<br />
Trivial updates, low end, started at 35.<br />
<br />
Forged Shan'Tok = Bloodwater + Folded Sheet Metal + Hilt Mold + Pommel Mold + Shan'Tok Blade Mold, skill up to 36, did not make.<br />
<br />
Forged Fer'Esh = Bloodwater + Folded Sheet Metal + Hilt Mold + Pommel Mold + Fer'Esh Blade Mold, skill up to 37, Made, not trivial.<br />
<br />
Forged Sheer Blade = Bloodwater + Folded Sheet Metal + Hilt Mold + Pommel Mold + Sheer Blade Mold, skill up to 38, did not make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">updated these lower end trivials</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tendoryl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Has anyone else tried making these, or other silvered weapons since the new tradeskill interface? Doesn't seem to be in the list, nor could I get it to work with &quot;experimentation&quot;.</div></div><hr />
