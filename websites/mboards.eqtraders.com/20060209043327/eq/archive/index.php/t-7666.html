One person had 190 skill and was apparently confused. The other tried to convince me having her trophy was good enough. The long and short of it is that I need to have some gem studded chains made and my 250+trophy guildie only had a 25% success rate last time. (Yuck)<br />
<br />
I can provide all the parts pre-imbued, smithed, etc, and I'm happy to come to a reasonable agreement about a combine fee. <br />
<br />
Please leave me a message here, or you can reach me on Tweedledea / Zillia, or leave a message on Delboy (bazaar mule.)</div></div><hr />
