Um... i don't think so... lemme check Alla quick...<br />
<br />
Oops...<br />

Yeah. It looks like you need to give the head and the (signet) earring to Katta for the Sigil Earring. So if you had the 4th earring (which can't be MQ'ed, because you need to put the 3rd earring and the seal from collecting the 4 shards into a jewelry box and hitting combine and then giving the combined box to Katta) and your pal had the looted head it would work.<br />
<br />
The question is... why would you need to? As far as I have heard the Lord High Inquisitor drops his head each kill. So if your guild has helped you get the Arx key and 4th earring I'd presume they'd let you loot the head the first time you opened the door.<br />
<br />
Good luck. I was working on the third earring when my guild disolved. Somehow I think it will be a LONG time before I'm able to get the Arx key. But the Sigil earring is sweet. (and I'd not turn down that nifty ring Seru drops either.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>crystilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the info.  Turns out though I had checked Alak's for the info before asking this question, I missed the one part of the quest discussion where someone said they did MQ it.<br />
<br />
I duo'd up to and including the 3rd earring with my mage hubby, and just pulled in some friends for the key mobs (need 1 more shard).  I keep loosing out on the /ran for the Head.  (They used to go by closest to completion but stopped when the majority of folks stopped working on the quest so it went to randoms the last 5 kills.)<br />
<br />
I have a friend who looted one a while ago who doesn't intend to finish the ear so she offered to MQ it with me if it was possible.<br />
<br />
~~<br />
Good luck yourself!  All 8 reports (4 for me, 4 for hubby) were duo'd with a 65 mage and it wasn't that hard believe it or not.  1 group (2 healers) can handle all of the shard mobs - we did 6 of the 7 we've killed so far with no slower having 2 healers, 1 mage, 1 other pet class (and random DPS) for the group.<br />
<br />
The shard mobs are easy to track; just plant a non kos alt in the rooms.</div></div><hr />
