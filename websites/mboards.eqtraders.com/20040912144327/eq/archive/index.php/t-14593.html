<br />
When I registered a few weeks ago at the Hilton, they told me that April 1 was blocked for check-ins until I said I was there for the Everquest Fan Faire and wanted to reserve a room at that rate.  Then she said, &quot;Oh, no problem.  We're not letting regular guests check in on April 1 to reserve the spots for the Everquest event attendees.&quot;  The Everquest room rates are cheaper as well.  So if you're calling to make a reservation, be certain to tell them you're there for the Everquest Fan Faire.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>salomeasillverfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I reserved right after they posted the code and was told so sad too bad. /shrug  Sal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you suspect the hotel may be holding out on you or don't know what they're talking about when you call, I'd recommend visiting the Fan Faire Msg Boards (http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/eq-fanfaire/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi).  The people responsible for organizing and running the Fan Faire (okay the person, Vannoth) is active there and should know if the hotel is causing problems.  He may be able to help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I gave them the Fan Faire code first and they said it was sold out for Thursday. THEN she went and checked the &quot;regular&quot; rooms to see if there was something outside the convention block available, and was told they were blocked for checkins on that day.  I'd say they're kinda sorta booked for Thursday.<br />
<br />
Very likely we'll just drive up there early on Friday in time to catch any of the Friday events, depending on the schedule, which should be posted &quot;real soon now&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>CaiserSoze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye, made my reservations the first day...Even though there was a block of rooms reserved for Fan Faire, somehow they were sold out for Thursday, but had rooms for Fri-Sat... Apparently a bunch of people are coming to town for Fan Faire, but are only staying Thursday night, they're leaving before it starts.... go figure... =) Had to book a room over at Caesar's Palace for Thursday night</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Maybe they have a bad &quot;practical joke&quot; problem of april fools reservations... ::shrug::</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>etitameh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">vannoth has said (in the forums mentioned above) that thursday is usually a lighter turnout, so he blocked fewer rooms</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>salomeasillverfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hilton is so sweet, they had a cancellation for april 1st and the room would only cost me 299 isn't that special. I cancelled my reservations at the hilton and went with the sahara for the whole stay. rooms are cheaper and its on the monorail. /shrug. I sarcastically thanked the hilton for their fine service  Sal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bunch of my guild is gathering in Vegas as well (some are going to FF, most just to hang out). Half of us are at Treasure Island, half at the Sahara.<br />
<br />
My three nights at the Sahara cost the same as one night at the Hilton - and I'm going to split that cost with a guildy-roommate. /boggle Hilton's prices<br />
<br />

Btw, wanted to add a super big kissandahug for DenMum and the House Ogre....just cuz I really appreciate this place and all the work you guys and your helpers do. =) /smoooooch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ooooh, is the druid cupcake going to be at the Fan Faire!?<br />
<br />
Maybe I can steal a real hug!<br />
<br />
/bounces around happily</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kredal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm a member of a small Star Trek group, and every year, we make a pilgramage to the Las Vegas Hilton, and the Star Trek Experience.  Unknowingly, we picked the same weekend as the Fan Faire this year... and so because of the Fan Faire, we'll be staying at another hotel down the strip.  Hopefully the ST Experience won't be too busy with all of the extra traffic around.  If it is, at least I'll be able to talk EQ with lots of people there!  (:<br />
<br />
And Denmom, I'm looking forward to finally meeting you too!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Kredal - ICQ's been flaky on this machine for a bit, and the phone number has been eaten ... drop me a PM, please?<br />
<br />
I'm trying to hook up with multiple folks, not all of whom will be part of the Fan Faire, and want to be sure I don't miss you.<br />
<br />
We'll be there Thurs-Sun, and won't have net access due to a dead laptop.  :O<br />
<br />
(Yep, I killed another one)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Nope.  That laptop was the spawn of Innoruuk, I think.  Was already rezzed once, though it took multiple attempts. <br />
<br />
Anywayyyy, off to Vegas we go!  {pooftas}</div></div><hr />
