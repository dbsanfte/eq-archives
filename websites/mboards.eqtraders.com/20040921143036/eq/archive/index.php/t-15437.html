What I'm thinking of is the sort of stuff that you learned the hard way (that still apply in the current way of doing tradeskills) that you'd like to pass on to others to save them time, money and much frustration.<br />
<br />
To start it off, here's one from a raiding cleric last year - I got reminded of it yesterday when someone else made the same error ...<br />
<br />
   For any recipe that requires a loaf of bread, you do NOT have to bake your own bread. The bread sold on vendors is exactly the same as what you can make, and can be used in all recipes that require bread.<br />
<br />
Can folks come up with some others that are famous/infamous for making you go &quot;d'oh!&quot;?</div></div><hr />

Destroying (collapsed) containers IS possible with items inside them. It only gives message asking u to destroy container (if u even have that on).  <br />
On a related note to this: <br />
<br />
Make sure, when you've finished using a collapsible container that you delete the (summoned) collapsible container, and not the collapsed container that you summon it with.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second tip: Nodrop items poof if a tradeskill container is closed with them inside. Be mindful of this when using the old (experiment) UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have a secret for avoiding the woeful destruction of collapsed containers.<br />
<br />
Step 1: Open the container, so you can see that it's empty (or only contains stuff you want to destroy).<br />
<br />
Step 2: pick up the container, which will force it to close.  That way, you know you picked up the right one (I've destroyed about half a dozen glaze mortars because I picked up the wrong bowl).<br />
<br />
Step 3: open another bag, and put it in the bag.  If it goes in, you just saved yourself a bunch of platinum.  If not, you can comfortably click destroy.<br />
<br />
Since I got into this habit, I've never had a problem losing a collapsed container.<br />

Second tip: Nodrop items poof if a tradeskill container is closed with them inside. Be mindful of this when using the old (experiment) UI.  <br />
<br />
I believe this was actually fixed a few months ago.  Now, if you leave a no-drop item in the tradeskill container, the CLOSE button greys out.   If you back away from the stationary container, any no-drop items in it will pop into your backpacks.  Droppable items remain in the container, though.<br />
<br />
As of this writing, there is a bug that causes you to crash if you back away from a container with a no-drop item in it.  It's scheduled to be fixed with the next big patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Make sure you are not logged into a toon (being on the char select screen is OK.)<br />
<br />
- Click &quot;Start&quot; then &quot;Run...&quot;<br />
<br />
- Enter &quot;command&quot; for Win 98/ME, &quot;cmd&quot; for 2K/XP.  Hit enter.<br />
<br />
- Go to your EQ directory (usually &quot;c:\program files\everquest&quot;) by typing 'cd &quot;\program files\everquest&quot; '.  Note that the double-quotes are necessary around the folder name.  Hit enter.<br />
<br />
- Get a list of all the files for the original toon.  For example, to get a list of all of Deeger's files I would type &quot;dir *deeger*&quot; and hit enter.<br />
<br />
- Copy each of the files and use the new toons name.  For example, I would type &quot;copy UI_Deeger_.ini UI_Mynewtoon_.ini&quot; and press enter.  (You could do &quot;copy *deeger* *Mynewtoon*&quot; but depending on your names it might not work.)<br />
<br />
When you are done the new toon will have the same setup as the original one.</div></div><hr />

Not that I'm trying to undercut you, but, um, for reasons that won't be discussed here, I avoid using the 'run' command whenever possible... /embarrased-grin!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When I make a new alt, I log in once, immediately sit down and camp out while complaining to the thin air about the default UI, then go into my EQ folder and find: <br />
<br />
UI_Tinkbang_marr.ini<br />
<br />
double click to open<br />
ctrl-A to highlight all<br />
ctrl-C to copy all<br />
close<br />
<br />
then I find:<br />
<br />
UI_NewAltsName_marr.ini<br />
<br />
double click to open<br />
ctrl-A to highlight all<br />
ctrl-V to paste<br />
ctrl-S to save<br />
close<br />
<br />
<br />
repeat if desired for the &quot;Tinkbang_marr.ini&quot; --&gt; &quot;NewAltsName_marr.ini&quot; set; this file controls hotkeys and friends list and other such options. <br />
---------------------------------<br />
<br />
Other things I thought of: <br />
<br />
Going into eqclient.ini and F3-search 'log' will take you to the line where you can toggle logging on. I could never find this option in game, but might have been just me. <br />
<br />
eqclient.ini, F3-search &quot;join&quot; will find you the autojoin list. <br />
server.channel:pwrd,server.channel:pwrd<br />
Very handy for when you have, um, 6 channels, then want to remove channel 1 without debunking the placement of your other channels, then want to replace it later with something actually useful. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------<br />
<br />
And to answer the question from the previous page:<br />
<br />
/hot - the command to make a hotkey.<br />
AI - what I personally call my button<br />
/autoinventory - one of the best commands. Evar. /hug. <br />
<br />
Makes a hotkey on the cursor that you can put in whichever key you wish. <br />

4.  Find some way of downloading, sorting and printing the related pages that works for you.  For me, this was generally, going to the quick trivial lists, sorting by trivial, and writing out the recipes.  Couple of things wrong with this:  a)  It's a *lot* of writing; b)  the quick trivial lists, remember, list only confirmed tirivials, so you will miss some items this way.<br />
<br />
But, hey, I have my notebook, and that means when I want to get at something in-game, and I dont' have access to my tradeskill container, I can look up the bloody recipe in my own book.  Or, if the tradeskill container won't give me the recipe, then I can still experiement with it.<br />
<br />
Oh, yeah, it's a lot of work, but it saves me a lot of in-game hassle.</div></div><hr />

I recommend NEVER under ANY curcumstances EVER to use ANY no-rent bag EVER.<br />

Ever.<br />

<br />
It was a bad idea to put them in game in the first place.<br />
<br />
If you cant afford a 25p tailored backpack or a 1.5p Deluxe toolbox, or a FREE Newbie armor quest container, you have bigger problems then not having room for stuff.  No Rent containers have one benefit you haven't addressed:<br />
Availability.  Player-spell and clickie-summoned bags are available anywhere.  When you're in the middle of hunting/exploring/whatever, No Rent containers provide your only accessable new storage space.  Sure, &quot;the middle of no where&quot; is progressively becoming less far away (PoK books, Wayfarer camps, etc), but there are still plenty of times when its impractical to get to an old-world newbie city, hunt pelts&amp;patterns, or find a rare breed of tinkering merchant.  Deep in dungeons, or melee in many places, come to mind as easy examples.<br />
<br />
I very rarely use no rent containers.  But they do serve a purpose, and I'm grateful for my ability to have and use them.</div></div><hr />

For foragers: Bind your forage hotbutton (or better yet make a social to forage and /autoinventory and then bind that) to a turn key, so that you max out your forage skill and are constantly gathering useful tradeskill items.  Nothing like ending a fight and foraging up some rare item for a little post-combat baking.  <br />
<br />
If you do this, learn to use the 'U' key to open doors/activate port stones.<br />

<br />
Your bazaar mule should have in slot 1 and 2 normal food and water.  This is to prevent eatting your player made goods.  Nothing like having a hobgoblin supply (750pp) go poof.  Do not mention this to your buyers.  I have gotten some repeat business because they accidently ate it.<br />
<br />
Calculate your platinum farming average.  (I use a conservative 1k/hour)  If farming a tradeskill items yields you 20 items in an hour, but sell in bazaar for 25pp a piece, it is more cost efficient to buy them instead of farm them yourself.  This also keeps the younger tradeskiller types employed.<br />
<br />
Charisma gear is your friend.  Get your charisma to at least 104.  The purchase could pay itself off with one night of tradeskilling.<br />
<br />
Be wary of matching prices in bazaar blindly. I pull down 2k on a good night buying from players and reselling to venders in bazaar because they got below the magic number.  (Example, buying a stack of diamonds at 150pp each - sell to vender for 190pp, and pulling in 800pp.)<br />
<br />
Look at vender sell back for optimal profit.  For example, large bowls... The finished product sells for 3sp 2cp, which is lower then the cost of the firing sheet. In this specific case, it is more cost efficient to destroy the item then it is to finish it.<br />
<br />
Keep one enchanted velium bit in the bank.  This will prevent you from having to click destroy.  It does not prevent skillups what so ever.<br />
<br />
Most skill up items are not worth reselling in bazaar (Acrylia Studded Masks for example).  The market is flooded with hundreds of them, since everyone else is making them as well.  Use them for tribute, or just sell them to a vender.<br />
<br />
The tribute master can raise your Int or Wis by 12 additional points.  This can help with tradeskilling significantly.<br />
<br />
Fishing grubs sell to venders for 3 cp each.  That can add up.  (and this coming from a 65 character)</div></div><hr />

Many people don't realize that Fuzzlecutter Formula 5000, is sold by an NPC merchant in Freeport, (the wig vendor in the newbie area).<br />

Coldain Velium Temper is now less than 6pp from the NPC merchant in Thurgadin.<br />
<br />
You get the benefits of the Magical food/drink only while equipped above all other food/drink. It will last until you eat it. By eating junk food/drink till you cannot eat or drink anymore, then Equipping, you will not eat any of the magic food/drink. Periodically eat/drink junk food/drink while the magic food/drink is equipped and you will never eat any of the magic food/drink AND you will get all the stat benefits from it. (It is surprising how many people do not know how to use thier magic food/drink).<br />
<br />
Buy or make a collapsed bearskin potion bag. Create a bag with it and use it for your normal hunting and walking around. Should you loot a nifty container, just destroy the &quot;Created&quot; bag. You can always make another for free and it is 10 slot. Also don't forget you can always destroy your &quot;permanent&quot; GM trophy bag. Other than Monks, I have a hard time justifying not carrying around a full load of bags/containers. Most of the people on this board have at least one trophy. So they have 1 Trophy bag, and most likely a Rallic pack, some lemming fur, Handmade backpacks and a few tradeskill containers on them. That does not add up to a crippling weight. <br />

I certainly agree they are something to be used with extreme caution, however, no one has mentioned the cases where you actually WANT to trash stuff.   <br />
<br />
If you're skilling up on something that's only going to sell to a vendor for 1 silver, doesnt stack, and you're making hundreds of them, replacing most of your normal bags with no rents means you can just destroy them when they are full, summon some more, and continue - instead of having to go sell all those things indivdually to a merchant (who may or may not be nearby), for a whopping total of like 2 p...  <br />
<br />
Also works well for .. well not sure what to call it these days as it's not quite merchant mining anymore, but - there are certain merchants I try to keep somewhat cleared out by buying up stuff on them and moving it to my designated dumping ground merchant... Of course, you don't want to destroy stuff from the Tranquility merchants, for example, as most you can sell back for very close to what it cost, and sometimes that's a couple hundred plat per item.  You're mainly just wanting them moved elsewhere...  But if you want to clear a newbie merchant or even a higher zone merchant who happens to have alot of junk on him at the time, you can just position your bags so that stuff goes into a nice freebie no rent bag and trash it.  You may lose like 5 plat in stuff *gasp*, but if you do this sort of thing extensively, its usually worth it.  I often make 4 or 5 trips back and forth to my dumping merchant in Neriak when I'm cleaning up PoT merchants.  Needless to say, if you can't port that's alot of running around, so being able to destory the basically worthless bits in one swell foop is kinda handy.  :) <br />
<br />
And, nawh, I'm not generally someone who goes around trashing stuff all the time.  Heck, I don't think I even started getting rid of silver and copper until level 35 or something, even when I could hardly move!  I'll never trash something worth more than say... 3 plat just to get it out of the way.  (Thus for me, the lower level words and runes are fair game, but not the higher level ones, for example).  Just decide what limit works for you.  <br />

Anyway, just my random thoughts on no rent bags from the other perspective.  :)  <br />

- Take care of the 200 cap level on tradeskill if you dont have Tanaan aa's yet and want to specialise on a specific tradeskill.<br />
<br />
- Always buy more components than the expected number of combine because you will always fail at last once (Grrr Halas meat pie).<br />
<br />
- Free the maximum room in your inventory before making lots of combine (Halas meat pie strike again) or going on component farmage.<br />
<br />
- Befriend foragers, trackers and enchanter if you are not these classes.</div></div><hr />

Creating a tradeskill mule who holds all of your supplies, except for the ones you're currently using for skill-ups, makes life much easier.<br />

When farming massive numbers of green/light-blue mobs at level 65, invite a level 46+ person along to sponge experience.  They can ding in an hour this way.  Just make it very clear that you will do horrible things to them if they loot any of the items you're looking for.  ;)</div></div><hr />

/target a<br />
/pause 5<br />
/loot<br />
<br />
Since the vast majority of mobs names start with a or an it will most likely target their corpses everytime provided you are in looting range. I have had a really hard time targeting corpses in guk ldons so this is just about the only effective way to do it and still keep up with the pace. <br />

It also works on player corpses that fall thru a wall or the floor to where you cannot see it.<br />

About the loot hotbutton, I recommend to add also /target a_  and another pause (mobs can be often called a_mob00 or an_mob00). The only problem with /target a  is when your name begin by A, you will be autotargeted :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>ancarett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">As posted above: /target a_ will solve the problem of targeting yourself (if you happen to be another &quot;A&quot; person like me.) The underscore equates to the underscore in the corpse name) I wish I'd learned this trick before I was level 50, mind you!<br />
<br />
I have a whole hotbank for looting and inventory control -- some stuff I will use the complete loot autoinventory key (if I have a stack started somewhere I like). Other things I use the hotkey to open up my inventory (have two backpack slots keyed for this -- one for stuff I will keep, another for stuff I will sell or just destroy, you could use this slot for where you keep no-rent bags, for instance) and stack the loot where I want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Kumulas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">I don't know if i should cry or jump for joy. I'm a lvl 65 wizard and when I farm for items where possible I will aggro as many mobs as I can handle and then PBAE them. <br />
<br />
This is usually between 6 (on the low side) and 25 or more mobs, depending on the lvl of the mobs I'm farming. The biggest down side of this was always looting the items i wanted and having to loot the trash items just to clear the corpse's. <br />

/hidecorpse looted ... OMG I wish I had known that sooner.... THANKS SO MUCH for that litttle bit of info.... life just got much easier</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">When sent to drag other people's corpse and unable to see it use /target [chars name]'s to target the corpse. This is especially useful when the person is in the zone, so targetting their partial name will just target them, the added 's will make sure only the corpse gets targetted. Used that myself recently on an underwater CR where the corpse was hidden in the geometry.</div></div><hr />

When I did this to my carved dragonbone spear and sword of the morning several years ago, GMs told me that I just had to deal with it =P</div></div><hr />
