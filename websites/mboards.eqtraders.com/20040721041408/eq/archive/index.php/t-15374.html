<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Damuri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the recent patch, there has been a noticable increase in lag.  I have it on very good authority that this lag is not a matter of more resource demanding graphix or bad programming but is a deliberate attempt to increase the market for potions of lag resistance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Can i have the recipie?  I think I could actually sell a few of those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Na - if they existed they would be too expensive and not last long enough to be worth the trouble like most of the rest of our potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm...potion of LAG resistance. I would imagine this would involve Wolf's Blood to increase speed, Mandrake Root for potency, and...what is the third ingredient! I just can't find it!<br />
<br />
Ah, just a guess, the third magical ingredient is SOE Customer Service! If I only had high enough foraging to find some!<br />

(I apologize if this is too directed towards the devs, I have nothing but love and respect for them =) )</div></div><hr />
