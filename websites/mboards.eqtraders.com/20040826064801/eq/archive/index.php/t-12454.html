<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cyradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have recently obtained JCM 2 and 3 now.  I've been GM in jc for abut a year and half now and recently been having a spat of failures like I cannot remember since that last bug with jc several months ago.  Is anyone else having problems?  I have suceeded in one valorian ring of gallantry and failed on about a dozen others, no blood earring of engagement either out of 4 tries.  I had better success at JCM1 than I do at 3 :confused:   I petitioned and bugreported incase others have done so, so the GMs may be aware of some issues but I am not certain.  Kinda sucks, I've lost about 75% of my bank on failed investments :mad:</div></div><hr />

I am on the E'ci Server.. <br />
I have been GM in JC for over a year now<br />
I have My Trophy and aa in JC mastery<br />
I also have the geerlok Jemcutter item (it doesn't seam to make a differance)<br />
<br />
Previous to the patch about 3 months ago I was running 97% success rate on the valor rings.<br />
<br />
Now I am running about 52% sucess rate, (doesn't makes sence that I would forget how to make an item, maybe it's old age)<br />

Anyways all of you that are having this issue please /bug it if they get enough requests they will look into it.<br />

Valor ring pricing has went from 4-5k a pop to 12k currentlya pop on E'ci</div></div><hr />

it's nice to have new expansions.. NICER to have them fix things already messed up (or to stop messing up what is working)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>AbitooXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I recently (month or two ago) had a rash of unexpected failures.  I chalked them up to bad RNG as I dont usually have the number of combines to gather good data.<br />
<br />
For example, I had done probably 20 to 30+ Bloodmetal Earrings and could remember only 1 failure (which was actually a friend botting me).  I failed 2 in a row.<br />
<br />
I failed a valorium ring, something I dont ever recall failing before.<br />
<br />
I was 1 for 4 on the PoA ring, which struck me as odd since with JCM3 I expected to do no worse than 2 for 4.<br />
<br />
I have 250 skill, trophy, JCM3 and have had those for quite a while,  GM and trophy for well over a year.<br />
<br />
Today I just made 2 of 2 PoA rings.</div></div><hr />

I had to recently level a gnome tinkerer in order to produce standard bow cams for my fletching. I get up to the point at which i can no longer advance my level, and get a shock. At that level I'm running 50% success rate. It took padding another 30 levels onto the skill in order to up it to 90-95% success rate. Its this type of thing that it seems the 250 combines are running into. If we are to assume the 'trivial'(for lack of a better term but do not take it literally) for say, a Valorium Ring of Gallantry is 250, then it stands to reason given the tinkerer example, that you'd have a 50% success rate. If there were no cap in a skill and you could hit say.. 280, that would rise to 90-95% success rate. Personally, it would hurt if in getting to 250 you only have a coin-flip shot of producing anything at that level, especially at the prices of JC'd components.<br />
<br />
Lothay, could you further elaborate on your comments and detail what a person with 250 skill and/or JCM1-3 should reasonably expect as a success rate over time per your experience?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have JC at 250.   I have my JC Trophy for the +5%. I have JCM level 1. <br />
<br />
I've made about 30 Valor rings total.  I've failed about 4.   <br />
<br />
26 / 30 = 86.67% success. <br />
<br />
My numbers here are imprecise since I can't find my notes (in the middle of a move). <br />
<br />
I've noticed no more or no fewer fails on PoP items than previously. <br />
<br />
As for Gem Studded Chains, I'm getting about a 70% success rate.  <br />
<br />
I don't see an issue.  Remember, the RNG is random and being so means that you will see random results.  Sometimes this will work in your favor, and sometimes it will not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gurck-Quellious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just adding my very small sample: 250 + trophy (no JCM here) I went 2/2 on steel rings and 3/3 on pneumatic rings about two months ago, and just this week have gone 0/2 on steel rings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Stewwy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I came here to post a rant about JCM3 and see I am not the only one having trouble.  20 combines since I got JCM3 and I am running below 50%.  If I could refund the AA's I would.  I am extremely angry about this because 18 AA's spent is NOT trivial.  This needs ot be FIXED!<br />

Seems ot me the peole with JCM1 are doing better than those of uswith JCM3.  This shouldn't suprise anyone.  We have seen similar issues with SOE before.  I want a refund!!!!</div></div><hr />

I only have JCM 1, but my sucess/fail rates on items is right at dead on for the expectations of skill + AA.  <br />
<br />
If i might ask Lothay - what zone do you do your combiens in - and what buffs do you get beforehand, if any?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I usually do my combines whereever is handy.  Usually near the merchants I from whom I just purchased materials.  Often this is PoK, Thurgadin or ShadowHaven. <br />
<br />
As for buffs, they don't matter on success-rate.  Stats don't affect the rate of sucess (see Stats &amp; Tradeskills (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=19)).  Stats only affect your chnace to gain a skill-increase.   Since my skill is at the maximum possible, there isn't any point in trying to get a further increase. :)  <br />
<br />
I have had the occasional bad run.  It happens.  But, over the course of time, things tend to hit the average, and I'm saying that my experience with all things Jewel Craft shows me that nothing is broken.   I'm seeing the number of successes I more or less expect.</div></div><hr />
