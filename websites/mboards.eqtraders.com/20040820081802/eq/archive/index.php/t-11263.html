<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Boonedog82</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was hoping you people give me a clue where to hunt Acrlic Ore and Bricks of Condensed Shadow and Flame.  After spending 13 hours in SD and only getting 12 Flames, then spending another 4 hours in DSP getting 4 Ore's.  I though I might get some expert help.  Any advice at all would be great.<br />

I am a lvl 53 Ranger with ok gear, no where near Uber.<br />

Thanks <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A search of the forums will give you plenty of information on where to farm acrylia and condensed substances.<br />
<br />
The general gist of it is if you are high enough go to Acrylia Caverns off Grimling Forest.  If not do the grimling mines in Tenebrous Mountains for acrylia.<br />
<br />
The best place to farm condensed substances is Shadeweaver's Thicket.  It's a newbie zone but very few players actually go into the tunnels for XP.  There a lots better places once you reach that level.  The Shak Dratha all drop condensed shadow pretty frequently.  Condensed Ice drops fairly well from the blue aliens in Twilight Sea and Condensed Fire drops in Scarlet Desert but is rare.  For skilling up you definately want to use the shadows.</div></div><hr />
