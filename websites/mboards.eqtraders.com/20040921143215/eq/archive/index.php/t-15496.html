<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did a goodle search for &quot;Draggar&quot; and got this as one of the hits:<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm a Rottweiler??<br />
<br />
What comes up with your name?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Google says: &quot;Did you mean: Sturgeon&quot;<br />
<br />
Aside from that...nothing special.  Links to old message board posts and lj entries.  A couple pages explaining the name origin.<br />
<br />
Meh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Teedyo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Toism<br />
<br />
Did you mean 'tourism'?<br />
<br />
First page hit:  Toism, common misspelling of Taoism; the path to enlightenment.  Neither is relevant but, I do use Enlightenment.  ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tip: Search for English results only. You can specify your search language in PreferencesThen the first two links are to sites in Scandinavian languages hehe.  The third one is a project named after Verdandi's namesake, who is explained somewhat in the fourth link.Norn - (Norse mythology) any of the three Fates or goddesses of destiny; identified with Anglo-Saxon Wyrd; similar to Greek Moirae and Roman ParcaeNot a very good explanation, mind you, as Verdandi is a particular one of the Norns, the Norn of the present.  The other two are Urd and Skuld.<br />
<br />
Then there are a bunch of links to all sorts of other things named after Verdandi, generally by a Scandinavian organization of some sort.  A scattering of links to references by other people using the handle Verdandi, and if you look far enough, a few to online posts and such by me.<br />
<br />
On a side note, our anime fans might find that Belldandy rings a bell more than Verdandi.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">heh, I hadn't searched for my name in a long time.  Before I used to get mostly design companies and a magic shop - now I get those, but EQTraders posts (and a few EzBoard posts) are in the top hits ;)<br />
<br />
While there are other Dunthor's in the results, it gives an odd sense of pleasure knowing that 3 out of the top 10 results are me :)  And a decent number more mes on each of the remaining pages, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A Search for Lothay turns up a surprising number of hits.  Most of them my posts or other internet contributions. <br />
<br />
And the last name of a beauty pagent contestant.  Odd... I thought I had invented the name from wholecloth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Arakni Spellweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Arakni - <br />
<br />
Did you mean Armani?<br />
<br />
The first several hits are for Quake - evidently I'm a wolverine-colored/styled skin?<br />
<br />
Ewww.  I'm a skin.<br />
<br />
Anyways - the rest are Thundercats fanfic, anime, video games, and a Polish webdesigner who lives in Canada.   Oh, and a handbook on civil disobedience - two entries above my &quot;viscous mana for sale&quot; post on the old boards. :)<br />
<br />
I, too, am surprised. <br />
<br />
1.  I thought it would ask me, Did you mean Arachne?<br />
2.  I based her name off Arachne, but invented the spelling myself.  Who knew there'd be so many Araknis?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kcalehc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Kcalehc results in nothing but me.  Nice to know ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>astianax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">mine, once i remembered to specify english only, was:<br />
<br />
did you mean astyanax?<br />
followed by a pair of allakhazam posts, a brief explaination of the name (the last son of troy when it fell...he was sacrificed by the greeks by being dropped off a cliff. funfun), and...the names of several fish, as well as a few other computer game bits and pieces. oh, and the ancient nintendo game of the same name, although that one's asty as opposed to asti<br />
<br />
otherwise, it's mostly greek language or greek related sites. hmm...and a butterfly name, as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am English slang...Lickity Split, no real special relation...or so I thought.<br />
<br />
Lickity Split in Google Yields<br />
<br />
Lickity Split -*Radical Cheerleading for the queer positive, leftist, ass-kickin', feminist, anti-hate generation!<br />
http://www.freewebs.com/lickitysplit/<br />
<br />
and some porn sites describing some unfortunate fellow...who knew I had this much going for me =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grimina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ack!  &quot;Did you mean criminal?&quot;<br />
<br />
Why yes...that's exactly what I meant *smack*<br />
<br />
Evidently I'm a Winter hardy bog plant as well.  Hmm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Inyidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Evidently I'm a Winter hardy bog plant as well.  Hmm...<br />
<br />
I've always suspected, but never wanted to mention it.  I thought you were trying to keep it quiet!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ack!  &quot;Did you mean criminal?&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
Maybe you're used in poisonmaking?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Keqen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Wahahaha what fun!  Googling Keqen:<br />
<br />
did you mean keygen?<br />
<br />
First page, all foreign language results, so after a bit of snooping, I found out that a lot of them were links to online Albanian translations of the Bible!  @@ so I did some more snooping with the Albanian/English online Bible, and found that 'Keqen' in Albanian means something like &quot;evil,&quot; &quot;disaster,&quot; &quot;harm,&quot; etc.!<br />
<br />
Wow, was I blown away! lol I guess Keqen was supposed to be a dark elf... @@</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grimina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Don't spread it around Inyidd...it's a secret!<br />
<br />
Besides...we don't want folks going crazy thinking of new recipes that use me and trying to shove me into an M&amp;P again *squeals and runs off*</div></div><hr />
