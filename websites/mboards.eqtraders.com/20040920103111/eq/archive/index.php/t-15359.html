<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solarax_Manastorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">just wondering. i am doing grimel and will soon be on the fletching part and i will need to make the tinkered bow cams.<br />
i already PLd a druid to 29 just so i could do imbue emerald for solstice robe skill ups so doing a gnome to 16 will be easy as my main is a wizzy and i have the use of a 65 chanter also<br />
<br />
im just wondering about how much money would i be likely to spend to get to 250 the quick way by vendoring the items <br />
<br />
i have a non guilded friend that can do the tinkering but im not sure the guild will let me because the items i need for grimmel will come from guild bank so basicaly i may need to do it my self as we have 0 gnomes in guild</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you are wanting a gnome for skill ups, you do know that the cams are vendor buyable already?  They are just a bit cheaper to home-tinker.  If you are wanting it for the elem cams, you can usually find them easily in the bazaar pre-made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solarax_Manastorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">grimmel cams are made from windmetal with a trivial over 250<br />
thats what hes for and eind metal cams are not availible on my server other than from 1 person that charges 20k each . thats a bit much cause 1 failure would mean 80k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would honestly beg with your guild to allow your gnomish friend to do the combines.<br />
<br />
Or, you could make a gnome alt for tinkering for your guild (which I did since we didn't have a tinkerer for cams either). I spent quite a bit going to the &quot;mostly purchasable&quot; route (buying velium from the bazaar for geerlok hammers was very expensive)...I can't really save how much...more than 75kpp, less than 150kpp?<br />
<br />
I had a high turn over of cash at that point (lotsa spending, lotsa earning), so it's difficult to judge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ah well, the solution to that is to say:<br />
<br />
&quot;Any GM Tinkers here from Antonius Bayle who wants a commission?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pity I'm on Stromm but you might find a few offers from gnomes on that server if you post here and on the server's own boards.<br />
<br />
The other option is to go to www.tinkering.org and use their GPS (Gnome Positioning Device) which will show you a list of the tinkers on your server who have registered there. BTW you won't find an entry for Kakg on Stromm there as my Tinkers name is Zmatil.<br />
<br />
However since your guild has no gnomes you really should think seriously about being the guild tinker. With a whole guild to raid PoI for your parts you are going to find it much easier and cheaper than a non-guild tinker will. And believe me they will be happy to do the raids for you since the guild tinker is a very popular chap or chapess with our ability to turn out valuable stuff for a fraction of the cost it would normally be in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

Acrylia, but the point still holds!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fyrmana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">f your loooking for the total cost to tinker all the way to 250 skill unless you do some serious amount of farming i'd say you up for somewhere in the region of 100-300k and thats a positive estimate. It could blow out to anywhere as far as 500k to skill up all the way to 250 if you purchase all your parts on some of the newer servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Id imagine a whole guild could PL a gnome to 16, drop 150 points of WIS gear on it, fetch tinkering skillup supplies and farm vendors and PoI to an extent you could get well past 200 in a day. Just get the whole guild involved in some way (lowbies could farm vendors, ubers farm PoI, chanter/bard keeps wis on etc), and make it a challenge to see how fast you can 250 a Tinkerer. =)<br />
<br />
Itd be kinda fun to see how long it takes.</div></div><hr />
