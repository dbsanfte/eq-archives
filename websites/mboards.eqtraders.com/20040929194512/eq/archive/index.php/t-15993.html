Tailoring 195, have 3 stacks of acrylia boning banked. Send my level 50 Beasty farmer to DSP to exp and collect hides for me on off hrs. 3 weeks later, 1/2 through 51 and I don't have a single flawless hide. Has anyone seen any drop lately or have i infact had the worst run of the RNG ever.<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lokase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Where in the caves is the BST pulling from? Just the two rockhoppers at the cave entrance?  It might be better for you to take your main in and clear the place.  In two hours of clearing I can come up with 7 or 8 Flawless.<br />

Good luck on your combines.<br />

Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rerashyaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You're not (terribly) unlucky... Those hoppers just have an abysmal drop rate on flawless.  My bard spent 50-54 (and 6 AAs) primarly at the hoppers, and I think I walked away with under 5 stacks of flawless.  And the RNG being what it is, those stacks didn't turn into ANY skillups.  :irked:  <br />
     On one hand, the caves aren't a terrible place to xp, up until a high level bard, druid and necro decide to have a speed-farming competition. On the other hand, the devs said something about adjusting drop rates on hoppers, so you could just wait till they get their tweaking.<br />

I would get about 6-7 on me at once and beat them down. I think I ended up with 2-3 stacks of flawless after a couple hours.</div></div><hr />
