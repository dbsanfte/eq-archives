<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vanayre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
I followed the recipie but I used Fish Oil made from eggs from the fish you get from North Karana.  Other then that I have all the parts listed, including the Wok.<br />
<br />
I got the DNC message.<br />
<br />
Does it only work with one kind of fish oil?  And do the different types stack together?<br />
<br />
I guess I should also add, I am at work so I cant head to PoD to check this out.<br />
<br />
Thanks fellow bakers.<br />
<br />
Vanayre</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Noni DeeCups</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nope, you need to get it from the diseased fish in PoD.<br />
<br />
Fishing Components: bottle, diseased fish, purified water<br />
In: tackle box, collapsible tackle box</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vanayre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok... that is what I feared.<br />
<br />
I wonder if I just wasted my time with these other fish oils or if someone can use them...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i have done it with fish oil from greengill salmon eggs.  did you get the recipe right?  i know it worked for me.  had to borrow the wok though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vanayre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah... I had bloody tormentor parts, fish oil, wok, vegetables and rice, 1 each.<br />
<br />
The fish oil was made from thunder salmon (I think thats the fish from NK thats like a brown yellow color)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I know I used fish oil NOT from diseased fish, but I made the eggs so long ago I do not remember which other flavor of fish I used :)<br />
<br />
Edited to add: You were using a Tanaan oven in PoK?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ooh good point.  i used my collapsed spit.  make sure its a pop container.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vanayre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nevermind.<br />
<br />
I know what I did wrong.<br />
<br />
Veggies and Jum Jum Salad have the same graphic and it was 2 am when I was trying the combines... Im going to go home and I bet I have 18 jum jum salad from my bank in my inventory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Could there be two different -fish oil- items? one produced from the diseased fish, and one from fish eggs?<br />
<br />
Do they stack together?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">lol dont know.  didn't have planar access or i wouldn't have made the fish eggs in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Noni DeeCups</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Bah, I swear, why must I do everything the hard way? :boggled:</div></div><hr />

Not true.  I have made bunches of tormentor stir fry using fish eggs from Thunder Salmon from the Karanas.  And a collapsible spit works just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Elinea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I used the fish eggs that are foraged in plane of water, as well as the diseased fish/purified water combo for tormentor stir fry, so I know at least those two work (did both of those last night). I never did try to get fish eggs from karana's though so I can't comment there :)<br />
<br />
p.s. Yes they do stack and yes collapsible spit also works fine :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Galain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Any collapsible container is considered a PoP container.  The only limitation you have is if a recipe calls for more slots than the collapsible has.</div></div><hr />
