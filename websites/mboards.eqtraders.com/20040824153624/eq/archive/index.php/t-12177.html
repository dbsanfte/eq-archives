<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nurdakin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok, i was wondering what is the lowest anybody has ever completed the GM trophy.  I heard a friend doing it at 200, not sure if it real or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dyllwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I &quot;think&quot; my brewer made his at around 240. I know my smith made his at 235.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wouldn't dare try.  Considering you have to blow a 1k (retail) corking device on it plus the ring, it would be expensive to fail.  Heck, you fail enough at 250 from what I heard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">bride the rng and you could get it at skill 0.  prolly have to make 100 attempts though and that would get pricey.  never heard of a required skill level to do it.  a smith has posted a trophy at 168.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Verick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I made mine at 227 on my 2nd attempt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, 240+5% (Geerlok) is the same skill as 250 plus bonus -- 252 effective is the cap.  Go for it when you hit 240, I'd say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It is possible to succeed with a skill of 200. The Trivial for the combine it &gt;250 but it can certailnly be tried. Chances are it will fail but there is a &quot;chance&quot; for success. I for example made my GM spoon at skill 212.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lejax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I got enough parts to make three artisan's seals, and succeeded on the second one.  Skill was 243 + geerlok.<br />
<br />
Not a whole lot of reason to try it anytime sooner, unless you don't mind the prospect of losing 2Kp+ every time you fail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eternyty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">friend told me he got his at either 217 or 218 whichever.  At 248 + 5% geerlock, I went for the trophy, failed 3 times, success on 4th attempt.  So it's not my Brewer's Trophy, it's my 20k trophy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My druid got his GM corker on the second try, at 200 skill + geerlok.<br />
<br />
Also got a skillup, ding 201 :)<br />
<br />
I was really only after the corker for him, for the CHA boost for charming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Banther</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My Necro made his JC trophy at 197 skill - had an artisan seal knocking around in the bank - really i just did the combine for no reason than to free a bank slot - hit combine and woot made the jewel glass - i never once in a million years thought he would actually make it though !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lanalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A friend of mine made her Baking spoon at 211.<br />
<br />
I made mine at 225.. probably going to try Brewing around 240 or so, since the Corking device is so expensive. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">meldrum in my guild went to 248 on mhb last night and made his trophy first time.  not sure if he equipped geerlock or not.  he also just wanted a +50 cha item for charm kiting as a bard.  had fletching at 202 already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Barli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I feel its better to spend your money first in getting to 250 and then doing your trophy later.  <br />
<br />
I 1st went to 250 and then it still took me 3 attempts to make my trophy.  Thats a lot of plat.<br />
<br />
Sure, you may get lucky and get your trophy at 220 but in many people's eye - you won't be a Grandmaster until you get to 250 (without geerlok).<br />
<br />
It's really just a choice - status of the trophy or status of having both.  Up to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>NeoCatET</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My mage got her GM brewing item at 213 on the first try with no geerlok</div></div><hr />
