<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Milkari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Smiths of Everquest, I am currently wondering a few things about Human Smithing. First What is the new cultural Human armor, Second How much do the individual pieces cost, and Third, Are there any GM  Human Smiths on Brell that could contact me about hits?:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Silound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First, what new armor? Blue Diamond cultral is newest to my knowledge, unless some was  implemented VERY recently. Those links are found under the human cultral section of the main page.<br />
<br />
Second, pieces depend on how you arrive at the temper components and ore costs and enchanting costs.<br />
<br />
Third, you'd have most luck asking for GM human smiths on your server's marketplace forum, or on your server MB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't know of any new armour myself, but the Heraldic armour is the main stuff.<br />
<br />
If you are bazaar buying, it depends on server I think. Look up the recipes and check your bazaar.<br />
<br />
But as a reference, on VS I could get the pieces for 2-3k for the Leggings or BP, can sell for 12-15k.<br />
At 227+geerlok skill I am under 50% success on Heraldic armour and sells slowly.</div></div><hr />
