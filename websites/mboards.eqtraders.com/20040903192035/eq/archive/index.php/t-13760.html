<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sowfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been trying it out having waited and waited for it.. only problem is i cant see any recipes above 188 skill.. I have set a min skill level of 189 and max of 500 and i get nothing.<br />
<br />
I'm at 191 skill and even tried doing the enchanted velium combine.. still nothing.. <br />
<br />
I can see fletching up to 215 and I'm only at 180 skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Collwyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ack, I hate being stuck at work....<br />
<br />
So in fletching you saw a recipe that trived 25 points higher than your current skill.<br />
<br />
Anyone see a recipe more than 25 points higher? (without more of a % mod than a geerlok/trophy)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Finae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">On the Cultural forge i cant see any recipes and i am 250 smither, i did a combine of enchanted mithril rings and it still dont show it, no idea if this broken or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Once you make an item not on the list a few times you &quot;learn&quot; it and it shows up. Not sure if it has to be withing a certain trivial range or not though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Once you make an item not on the list a few times you &quot;learn&quot; it and it shows up <br />
<br />
Okay .. A FEW TIMES ... will go back and try a few more times the GoD baking ones a that didn't show up after I made them once.  Thanks for the info :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Axemaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Made 100 Ethereal Tempers and I still havnt &quot;learned&quot; it. 223 Brewer....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bordaaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What about the trivials that are not on the list?<br />
<br />
I am at 209 now and not one of the LDoN armors was listed until I tried to make them then they were put into the list.<br />
<br />
I also made several enchanted velium bits which were never put into my list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Optimum1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have met with similar problems. The UI has failed to &quot;learn&quot; the hundred of ethereal curing agent, ethereal temper, black panther armor, earthen (heh, shouldnt that be Norrathian) temper. I made at least 15 pieces or armor and over 60 units each of everything else with no new recipes showing up in the UI bank. However I was pleased that Celestial Essence, Celestial Temper, Purified Water, Yew Leaf Tannin, BLue Diamond Powder and many many other recipes that I use ever single day were included. Im sure they'll fix this soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Abazagaroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As a 250 smith, the only recipe above 188 that shows by default is yttium sheets for seru bane weapons (335 trivial if I remember correctly). When I finally got around to finishing up the last brewing point (250 in two skills now! woot!) kaladim constitutionals had no problems being added once I made it once (not attempted, failures won't do it). Just hit &quot;experiment&quot; that brings up the old container UI, combine, and voila.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sowfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">at 186 brewing i learnt a 248 skill (mino hero brew), but i coulnt learn a smithing 222 skill with smithing at 191</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tingteng</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I thought about that too, but earthen can have to do with the ground or clay.<br />
<br />
Some of the little aliens in Tenebrous mountain have a death message that says something like &quot;The rocks of the earth will rise against you.&quot; I thought that was a misuse as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Go back to the general tradeskill page and read the first post, from one of the developers about the new UI.  I'd link it, but I'm too lazy to go back.  <br />
<br />
It seems that cultural forges were left out.  Be sure to bug this.<br />
<br />
Seeing some recipied and not others (until you make them) is exactly how the UI is supposed to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Do a text search for the item you are wanting.  Most times it will show up, if in reasonable range.  Then add it to your favorites.  Not all recipes are on the &quot;normal list&quot; but show up on text search.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sowfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The problem is I was in thurgadin, I searched on enchated velium bits, nothing, i looked at items =&gt; 189 skill, nothing, I then did 100 combines manually of enchanted velium bits and still it doesn't turn up in the ui.<br />
<br />
I then went to Freeport to work on my brewing, looked for mino hero brew it wasn't there, I did 1 combine (mino hero brew was &gt; 50 points more than my skill at the time), then it suddenly appeared in the list and i added it to my favourites.<br />
<br />
So why is something that is trivial at 222 not showing up in smithing when something trivial at 248 is showing up in brewing when my skills for these were 186 brewing and 191 smithing?<br />
<br />
This is inconsistant.. maybe its a bug, I dont know.<br />
<br />
<br />
OK, read the developer post and it makes a bit more sense now.. looks like its flagged as a recipe that is not learnable. Obviously they dont want people skilling up on it without getting RSI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">its a lore no drop quest combine.  why should they expect people to skill up on it?  :confused: i know the reasons people are but really its just a fluke that its this easy.  once they get shadow scream in you can farm that and use the ui on it if you want.  sickles are on the list already.  no drop, lore, quest combines really aren't supposed to be made more than one of.  they state that those recipes they are going to leave can't learn.  they may make an exception for this but i don't think so.  at least its in game and not nerfed though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">When you see &quot;problems&quot; with the new UI ... Please go back and RE-READ this post:<br />
