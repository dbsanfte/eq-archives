<br />
paying well in pp/trade for the following items:<br />
<br />
arctic wyvern hides <br />
tigeraptor hides<br />
cobalt cod<br />
coldain velium tempers!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zabu</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 08:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been hoarding, like any good tailor would.  Knowing I would need them some day, but since I can go quite a ways yet on robes, and since you need them now...<br />
<br />
Checking my bank account (don't you just LOVE magelo!) I find the following to be true:<br />
<br />
arctic wyvern hides 4 stacks and change (9 to be exact)<br />
<br />
tigeraptor hides 3 full stacks<br />
<br />
othmir fur 26<br />
<br />
swirling shadows currently out, but I think my baby chars might be willing to spend some time in Shadeweaver<br />
<br />
Add 9 drake hides to the tally (same ingredients as tigeraptor, iirc.)<br />
<br />
I've been systematically buying all tigeraptor, othmir and drake hides up to an arbitrary cutoff of 99p.  Of course, I'm not going more than 15p on the wyvern.<br />
<br />
As always, I'm sure we can work out something.  <br />
<br />
Besides, I would MUCH rather work on robes until they triv, given that I wouldn't have to farm velium, brew (fail at) coldain tempers, make (fail at) studs and boning, ...  (speaking of which, does this mean you are going to need more tempers?  I think my wrist is ready for another hundred or so  :roll:  )<br />
<br />
The only PITA becomes the foraged goods, as I'm sure you well can appreciate.  Why is it I can farm sylvan berries by the fistful, but I can't find a single mob dropping either plant shoots or plains roots?<br />
<br />
But, I digress...</div></div><hr />

<br />
One word: Woot!<br />
<br />
Or should that be: AA (I guess that is two words..)<br />
<br />
They like me in CS.  It should make things that much easier.  WL, on the other hand, I don't think anything breathing in there likes me.  Especially not near the Kael zone :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have about 15 stacks of CE on me now while I med between spectral champions  :roll: <br />
<br />
I don't know if I'm going to be ready for your run tonight, but I'll give it my best...</div></div><hr />

i have been debating if I want to actually sell velium studs in the future... being that I can farm the ore pretty quickly.. or just sell the ore... <br />

<br />
Sorry to say I didn't get nearly as far as promised.  A good grouping opportunity (/wave Avelyna) presented itself, and I couldn't very well pass it up.  On hindsite, I'm glad I didn't.  I misread my exp bar last night and what I thought was 6 blue bubbles turned out to be ELEVEN!<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
Sounds like the beginnings of a beautiful partnership.  You get the ore, I'll keep grinding out the tempers, and we will become filthy rich beyond all averice, while being able to market them to tradeskillers at a FAIR price for a change!</div></div><hr />

Three stacks made last night before I crashed (in front of the keyboard.)<br />
<br />
15 stacks of CE on Zabumule, components for another stack in my pack.  I should have your first 100 ready early this evening.  Then I think I may need to kill something...</div></div><hr />

Have LoY, haven't done any of the cleric or druid spells yet.  About the only place I have been is on the beach killing zombies and such.  One dropped a crate of supplies which when turned in to a lady at the zone in Erudin netted a nice earring:<br />

<br />
we got a charm, a cloak (each), another cloak and a ring.. off a couple named that spawned inside...  i got 1 part of the mage quest spell but unfortunately 1 cleric quest part rotted  :( <br />
<br />
but i digress.. this is a tradeskill thread!<br />

thanks zabu for the coldain tempers and avelyna on the imbue emeralds =)))</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've helped on the druid, mage and ranger spells as well as done the enchanter and cleric ones too.<br />
<br />
Pathing isn't great, but the zones are fun and there can be a few nice drops too if you're lucky.<br />
<br />
I still need two more luggald parts from Nadox for Dea.</div></div><hr />

Euell still gets plenty of blue exp and needs more CoV; ready to do some wolf and giant blasting on a moment's notice...  ;)  <br />
<br />
Zabu needs some more CoV, too, but I guess he needs to start spending some time in Kael.</div></div><hr />

So, are you going to claim a portion of these tempers, or am I moving them to my mule?<br />

<br />
EDIT: i reread your previous reply.. i see you have 9 stacks, that works!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zabu</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">EDIT: i reread your previous reply.. i see you have 9 stacks, that works!<br />
<br />
I'm in the temper business until you hit 250.  If 9 stacks (and change) doesn't do the trick, I'll make more!<br />
<br />
Once you hit 250, I'm going into semi-retirement.<br />
<br />
Of course.... I had a great scheme, err, plan, err, idea on the way in to work this morning.  I will bind myself on the shore in PoT.  Put on my EB necklace.  Swim out to sea using auto-run, making CE's the whole time.  Once I hit the edge of the zone, turn around and head back.  Repeat until I hit 200 swimming!  <br />
<br />
It has to work!  My last idea failed miserably.  EB necklace, jumped into the PoK fishing pond.  Auto-run into the wall and leave it enabled.  Head to the kitchen to tend to the dishes.  When I came back, I hadn't earned a point.  I swam three laps around the pool and got a skill point.  Back to the drawing board!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bartox</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what does binding on the shore do for you  if your just going to swim back?<br />

<br />
I had originally conceived that I would gate back to the shore and swim out again, but then realized as I typed it that I could swim back.<br />
<br />
I suppose the gate is just in case I get a cramp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zabu</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what does binding on the shore do for you  if your just going to swim back?<br />

<br />
Oooohhh!!  I know!  <br />
<br />
I need to bind at the brew barrel, in case your call for more tempers comes, I need to be able to snap to attention!!!<br />
<br />
Yeah, that's what I should have said!</div></div><hr />
