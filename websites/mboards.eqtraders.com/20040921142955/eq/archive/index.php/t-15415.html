<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dippen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just finished doing 93 arctic wyvern combines and went from 236 skill all the way up to 238!!  :steamed:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sulkano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heh, I hate tailoring everday. :p <br />
<br />
I've given up on trying for skill-ups and just make robes of misery as I get the parts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 238 you're best off making whatever you like and not worrying about it anymore. You're only 4 points from max skill (with a geerlok, anyway), so why worry?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">240 is max with geerlok. They only need 2 points ;) I wish I has a plat for every time I complained about bad tailoring skill ups. It does (INHALE) very strongly but oh the joy of 250 ;) <br />
<br />
Hang in there your sweet reward is but a hop skip and a jump away :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>crystilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Considering the average was 30-40 attempts per skillup for many folks, you weren't that out of line for it at 48:1.  <br />
<br />
But I know the feeling when the RNG rubs you the wrong way.  Good news is sometime it will have to swing back toward the fun side.<br />
<br />
Hang in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigtoxic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Go read my post...&quot; its my turn&quot; a few yopics down....this will make you feel rather happy out your skill ups you got  :)~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Taushar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sorry to threadjack but I actually ended up loving tailoring lately. I was at 237 for the longest time. I decided to just plunk in the pps and get it over with. I got my wisdom from 335 to 345, which I think is for some reason why I had great success with combines. I went from 237 to 250 in 9 stacks plus 6 combines for total of 186 combines. 186/13=14.3 combines per skill up. I was averaging about 19 per skill up at 335 wisdom. I don't know if it was those 10 wisdom that made the difference or just good luck with RNG but either case I am happy to make the 1750 club. <br />
