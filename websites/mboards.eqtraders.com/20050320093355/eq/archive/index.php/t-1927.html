Any guesses on what new and exciting ways they'll break bards this time?</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vizviz</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh my another super long patch, but tell me, has anyone have any insights as to why its is taking 10 hours to do a patch.  Up coming tradeskill changes??  new spells? anyone heard anything?<br />
<br />
I got caught by surprise by the smithing changes last year and missed a great opp to advance in smithing beyond my 160 level.  I kept saying aaaahhh I'll get to it one of these days, and now DOOOOOOH  it takes about 10 times as much plat  to get anywhere.  I just dont want to get stuck back again as they suddenly decide to change the trivials on stuff, instead of just adding new recipes.  Archery almost got me as did the pottery changes (harder to get skill ups now it seems)  yea at 202 and 190 so feeling good about those.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any insight as to the patch thursday please post.  If I've missed the patch post in another forum (search function slow on my pc), could you post a link.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilosh</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And smitten shall be the clerics who nuke when fighting undead, rather then heal.<br />
<br />
Smitten shall be the enchanter who lets his charming take precedence over crowd management in a group.<br />
<br />
Smitten shall be the wizards who pour their mana into a creature  in the first 10 seconds of a fight, before the tanks can gain aggro.<br />

<br />
Bah, too tired to continue.<br />

Ahh, the power of being able to say 'I want agro now!', and behold, you have agro.<br />
<br />
I love that about being a wizard.  If no healer in group, I just snare, nuke, jog in slow circles, and nuke again when it turns.<br />
<br />
Better than fear kiting because I tell it where to die, muhahaha.<br />
<br />
As for a 10 hour patch, maybe they've decided to lower trivials on all the skill-up items in the game, I gotta get cracking, hehe.</div></div><hr />
