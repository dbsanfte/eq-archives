<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>drool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've fished quite a bit, but never really for a specific goal.  My latest char wants a salt minnow.  I've read this can  be caught in FV or Cabilis.  I am KOS both places, but I've managed to sneak over to the waterline in FV (by DL caves) and fish my skill up to 50 from 1 without catching a salt minnow.  I did catch many sewer catfish which seem to be no drop also.<br />
<br />
Questions:<br />
<br />
1) Can fish caught change WITHIN a zone?<br />
<br />
2) Are there any fish you need a certain skill or higher to catch?<br />
<br />
3) Anyone seen a salt minnow from FV or anywhere else?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Fishing skill improves your chance of catching named fish. It seemed to me before 100 skill I only caught Fresh Fish and a lot of garbage. (Rusty knives, sandals and fish scales).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>drool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sklled up from 0 to 100, no salt minnows.. Then within 5 min I got one at skill 100.... I'd say 100 needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Menacy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">got alot of them in cabilis, destroyed them since they dont stack so takes up alot of room after awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Menacy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if kos you can probably fish safely at the zoneline btw east and west cabilis.</div></div><hr />
