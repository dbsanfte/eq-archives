<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>greenwood_d</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
I am about 150+ in the last 5 hours - finishing after 9 hour GoD update.<br />
<br />
Anyhoo - I caught tons of special fish in CB while buffing lowbies and toturing them with fishing /oocs - (that was fun)<br />
<br />
I switched to BBM and the amount of special fish dropped dramatically.<br />
<br />
I theorized that since the zones have tougher and tougher mobs - why not fish (?).  It seemed my skill ups went faster if i switched to a high level mob zone to fish.<br />
<br />
Can any swash this theory?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'll go with the current logic on this, which is that your wisdom/intelligence drives skillups, and nothing else.  Anecdotally, I didn't notice any speeding up of skill gains when I spent a large amount of time fishing in Old Sebilis, which is significantly higher in level than Rivervale and Butcherblock, which are my other two normal haunts.  So, for now I'll stand by the idea that where you fish doesn't affect the rate of skillups.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Speckocat Catnippurr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Doesn't CB have an exp modifier?  Could this effect skillups as well?  I'm guessing that it shouldn't but might it??<br />
<br />
Just a thought...I'm still pretty new to all this stuff, but it was a thought that came to me.<br />
<br />
If it works, I'm gonna go sit in PC with my spit and sewing kit. :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>greenwood_d</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey,<br />
<br />
Ty for the replies - i was suggesting the special fish in the zones had a skill trivial to them much like in other tradeskills - hence the closer you are the better success etc etc.<br />
<br />
I was mistaken in my original post in that it is still WIS and INT - i meant to ask about trivials for the fish my bad<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Solarax_Manastorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i will soon start fishing and i was wondering the same thing. a guildy told me that it takes about 10 hours to get to 200 in CS fishing for cobalt cod. <br />
but i also heard that diferent places yeild skill ups at diferent rates depending on how dificult the area is .<br />
<br />
can anyone clerify for sure. i was thinking of CS or PoS or PoWater</div></div><hr />

I understand better now.  Fishing in this regard is like foraging.  There's a fishing table with &quot;basic&quot; and &quot;rare&quot; stuff for each zone.  The higher your fishing skill, the more likely you'll get something rare from the table (and the more likely you'll get anything at all).  So, in answer to your question, the higher your skill, the more likely you'll get special stuff.  Some zones don't have any special stuff to catch, but in places that do, your skill will decide how often you get them.<br />
