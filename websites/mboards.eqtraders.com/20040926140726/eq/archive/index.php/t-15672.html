<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, probably THE most important thing when GoD smithing went live...<br />
<br />
the GRAPHICS!!!<br />
<br />
Ok, I make a Pale Platinum Mace... well it's the Luclin 1h mace graphic... not too bad... don't see many of them around...<br />
<br />
Make a Pale Platinum Long Spear... a Velium Spear graphic... huh? you'd think it would look decent considering the platinum and nihilite on it...<br />
<br />
oh well, maybe the stiletto will look cool... OMG... it's an old school, tiny dagger look.<br />
<br />
I don't know about the rest of you... but pimping out a decent looking item should have been at least taken into consideration when making these items...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought we added some nifty graphics for some of the higher end weapons, but I could be mistaken. I'll take a look at it a bit later this week.<br />

<br />
I rue the day I destroyed my original guild tunic for space reasons tho... twas before LoY when there just wasn't enough space in the bank (as opposed to now, when there just isn't enough space in the bank).</div></div><hr />

I finally went out and bought something that didn't look like a robe.<br />
<br />
Granted, it isn't as nice as my old robe, but I like ths look.<br />
<br />
Now I just tell everyone I cast Illusion Rogue.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I sympathize completely with the fashionistas.  I'm a Halfling.  Now, I don't know what we did to deserve it, but someone somewhere decided that plate-wearing Halfling women should have chicken legs, and not even a drop skirt to help with the shape like the high elf women get.  Ugh.  I bent over backward trying to find something to cover the essentials without looking awful, which meant finding something with chain or leather graphics, since those graphics at least are a skirt.  I can't tell you how many odd looks I'd get when I had to pass on rolls for amazing leg gear because I knew it'd be hideous to look at.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I did finally find something worth wearing.  Kylong shinguards come with a Halfling-sized skirt, so now I'm stylish and durable.  It started  as a rather peculiar shade of light purple, but isn't that what dye is for, after all?<br />

Silverfish, who no longer gets mistaken for a dwarven woman.</div></div><hr />
