<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For those that don't know, Denmom is allergic to practically everything.  This used to make meal-planning for lunches out or dinners with the lot of us kind of nutty. :)  And cooking for the holidays was insane. :) <br />
<br />
So, all the smoke/ash/extra chemical funk  in the San Diego area right now is NOT helping.  With everyone panicing nearby and many people homeless, it's not easy to just run down to the pharmacy for refills of her perscriptions.  So, she's sneezy and blurry-eyed. :( <br />
<br />
But I, for one, am grateful that she's suffering no more than that. <br />

Times like this I really feel useless and somehow by extention worthless... I can't do a thing to help, all I can do is sit way out here and say, &quot;Hope things get better...&quot;<br />

I sincerely hope that both you and Ngreth suffer no more than you already have. I wish you both the best.<br />
<br />
P.S. I hope the extra chocolate you can buy with my donation helps too! :D</div></div><hr />

I am hoping the cold weather thats coming will clear things up at least a little by Saturday. Im moving back to San Diego (national city) Saturday and brining along my 6 month old daughter.<br />
<br />
I saw on the news today that the CDF lost one of their own in all this mess too. I really hope they catch the people responsible for these things</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There are basicaly 3 (or 4 with a pair that merged) Fires.<br />
<br />
One of the fires, the person that started it fessed up and it was defenitely an acident.  It was a person in the wild (not sure if hunter or just hiker) that was lost, and starting to be dehidrated...  He started a signal fire to be found... and it got out of hand (he did not make a proper protected fire...)  At least that is what is found so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wanadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I know I speak for ALOT of eqaholics and non-eqaholics alike when I say that our prayers are with all those in California who have been effected, directly and indirectly, by the wildfires.  Having faught wildland fires before, I am very intimit with the dangers.  Also, having family both in Los Angles and around San Diego, this has effected me as well.<br />
<br />
Once again, our thoughts and prayers are with you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks to the support from the community, a check for $707.20 is going to be sent to the American Red Cross for the San Diego fire relief efforts.  While it may seem small in the grand scheme of things, it will make a solid impact on folks who have no clothes, food, and all of the things that we tend to take for granted until sudden loss takes it from us.</div></div><hr />
