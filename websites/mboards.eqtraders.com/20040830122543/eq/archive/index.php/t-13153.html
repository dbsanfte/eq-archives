<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Talbot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had 4 Hurricane Tempers that I was trying to sell and decided to try and put them up on my mule in The Bazaar.  For some reason it wouldn't let me add the Tempers to my list.  <br />
Has anyone else had this problem? I did type /bug, but haven't heard anything about this before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">take something off your list and try again.  the ldon tempers at least i have seen in bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had no problem adding them to my trader.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yes, one day i had some extra Metallic Liquid that I tried to add, it said i couldn't add them &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
2 days later a guildmate needed some and couldn't find in bazaar. <br />
<br />
Coincidence? i think not!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hm... i have since tried to add these metallic liquids several times over the past few weeks and once again, today i tried to add some and i got<br />
<br />
Unable to add item to bazaar list<br />
<br />
same message i always get.<br />
<br />
guess i'll /bug it again... anyone hear back on this one yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Libbie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That happens to me occasionally with some items.  Silicorrosive Grease is the worst.  Zoning fixes it for me though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cherryflavour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've had it happen on occasion too, ist' not a specific item that suffers this problem, it woudl seem. I oculdnt' get 3 etched signets, for research, to go on trader, I logged out and logged back in and they went on fine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In your Program Files\Everquest directory, you'll find a file named something like: BZR_Adelie_xegony.ini<br />
<br />
In it you'll find all the prices for all the items you've ever sold.  The longer this list, the longer it takes to add new items and the longer it takes for EQ to set you up as a Trader.<br />
<br />
I went in and deleted a huge amount of the old junk I'd sold and my set-up time is much faster now.<br />
<br />
P.S.  The items are listed by the price in copper pieces. :D</div></div><hr />
