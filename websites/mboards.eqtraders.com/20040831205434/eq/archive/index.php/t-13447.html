<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">from what Ive seen the tier 1 and tier 2 items (like shield of valor) run about 75% white the elemental items run about 50%.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It varies by server, otherwise add up the items and multiply by 2 or 3. If all else fails check bazaar.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>tsbaity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So you are going to buy ingedients in bazaar, find someone to combine them for you, and then resell them at a profit? Types like you are the reason I limit my combines to those I know will use them or charge a large combine fee.</div></div><hr />

Well, I was just wondering what the success rate on these items are.  I am thinking about gathering materials for these in the hope of finding a GM potter to pop some combines for me. <br />
<br />
<br />
I dont see where they said they were going to sell them, but what do I know....<br />
<br />
The idea of buying the items to have someone make them for you MAY not always be the best option. <br />
EXAMPLE: The ceramic shield of valor can be bough ton Veeshan for 14k if you are patient.<br />
Last night I had enough metallic liquid for 3 combines of which I had only 1 success. Given the price of metallic liquid of 4k I COULD have sold the 6 liquid for 24k instead of doing the combines. Even if I sell the shield for 20k (the high end price on Veeshan) I will STILL lose 4k. Thus its not always cheaper to pay for combines. It may be cheaper for you to buy the shield out right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tenlaienye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was wondering about saleability because, if it would earn the cash spent back, I would seriously look into taking pottery from 0-250.  Thank you to all of those who posted information for my knowledge, one last question, any ideas on how much it would cost for 0-250 pottery.<br />

<br />
You must be making the wrong items :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No, all non-elemental pottery sells dirt cheap, not worth it unless you get the drops.  I am not elemental and those components do not show their faces in bazaar.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, my point was that, if you are only going to skill up for riches, don't do it.  Pottery is tedious and very expensive over 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Korrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Most PoP drops are available on Xev in the bazaar.  The more rare ones may only show up every couple weeks and it may take a month or 2 or 3 to see one at a reasonable price if you cannot find the trader at the keyboard.<br />
<br />
The key is to have a list and check the bazaar as often as possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Skull of Decay 4k-7k (they were selling so fast, I couldn't keep up on oozes, so I kept upping price...seems like 5.7ish is about right)<br />
- War Sword 8k (might have went higher, but I had so many ingrediants)<br />
- Valor Shield 25-35k (**** metallic liquids! sells quick at 25, sells solid at 35, might could even get more if I sat on it)<br />
- Xegony idol - 300k (combined 5 made 5, sold 2, my guild raids PoA alot)<br />
- Rath idol -  225-275k (combined 2, sold 2, 225 and 275)<br />
- Water idol - 325k (first night I had it up, was thinking it was more like 400, but sitting on one atm at 320, 2 for 2 also)<br />
<br />
Only thing I can really remember failing on (335wis 295rest, 5% mod 250 skill) was valor and an occational sword (made no less than 100 though).<br />
<br />
Pottery is VERY profitable still, it was CRAZY profitable during solstice days (5k idols and 3k steins! ahaha thanks for leveling me up!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't know about you but I've made about 800k off pottery. Give or take a some plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>eldibar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've made profit from Poterry too. I only sell golden Idols of Tunare.<br />
<br />
On The Rathe you can still get 1000pp for an idol. The cost if you buy iron oxide in the bazaar is generally 300pp so it's good pocket money.<br />
<br />
As for PoP pottery....<br />
<br />
I'm only 58th and can't farm the components myself. Buying stuff in the bazaar is way too expensive, so i'm stuck on Golden Idols. They've paid me through to 232, and hoping to sell thme up to 240.<br />
<br />
You won't make a profit from buying components in the bazaar and combining. The combines are too difficult.</div></div><hr />
