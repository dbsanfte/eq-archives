<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torgamous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi folks.  Long time no see.  hehe... ^.^;;;  Anyways, I turned 25 today, so I decided to visit some old haunts.<br />
<br />
<br />
============<br />
<br />
WHEN I WAS A KID <br />
<br />
When I was a kid adults used to bore me to tears with their tedious diatribes about how hard things were when they were growing up; what with walking twenty-five miles to school every morning uphill both ways through year 'round blizzards carrying their younger siblings on their backs to their one-room schoolhouse where they maintained a straight-A average despite their full-time after-school job at the local textile mill where they worked for 35 cents an hour just to help keep their family from starving to death! <br />
<br />
And I remember promising myself that when I grew up there was no way in hell I was going to lay a bunch of crap like that on kids about how hard I had it and how easy they've got it! <br />
<br />
But.... <br />
<br />
Now that I've reached the ripe old age of twenty-five, I can't help but look around and notice the youth of today. <br />
<br />
You've got it so easy! I mean, compared to my childhood, you live in a darn Utopia! And I hate to say it but you kids today you don't know how good you've got it! I mean, when I was a kid we didn't have The Internet -- we wanted to know something, we had to go to the darned library and look it up ourselves! <br />
<br />
And there was no email! We had to actually write somebody a letter-with a pen! - and then you had to walk all the way across the street and put it in the mailbox and it would take like a week to get there! <br />
<br />
And there were no MP3s or Napsters! You wanted to steal music, you had to go to the darn record store and shoplift it yourself! Or we had to wait around all day to tape it off the radio and the DJ'd usually talk over the beginning and f@#* it all up! <br />
<br />
You want to hear about hardship? You couldn't just download porn! You had to bribe some homeless dude to buy you a copy of &quot;Hustler&quot; at the 7-11! <br />
<br />
Those were your options! <br />
<br />
We didn't have fancy s*#@ like Call Waiting! If you were on the phone and somebody else called they got a busy signal! And we didn't have fancy Caller ID Boxes either! When the phone rang, you had no idea who it was it could be your boss, your mom, a collections agent, your drug dealer, you didn't know!!! You just had to pick it up and take your chances, mister! <br />
<br />
And we didn't have any fancy Sony Playstation videogames with high-resolution 3-D graphics! We had the Atari 2600! With games like &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and &quot;Asteroids&quot; and the graphics sucked poop factory! Your guy was a little square! You had to use your imagination! And there were no multiple levels or screens; it was just one screen forever! And you could never win, the game just kept getting harder and faster until you died! <br />
Just like LIFE! <br />
<br />
When you went to the movie theater there no such thing as stadium seating! All the seats were the same height! A tall guy sat in front of you, you were screwed! <br />
<br />
And sure, we had cable television, but back then that was only like 20 channels and there was no onscreen menu! You had to use a little book called a TV Guide to find out what was on! And there was no Cartoon Network! You could only get cartoons on Saturday morning...D'ya hear what I'm saying!?! We had to wait ALL WEEK, you spoiled little bastards! <br />
<br />
That's exactly what I'm talking about! You kids today have got it too easy. You're spoiled, I swear to God! You guys wouldn't have lasted five minutes back in 1984! <br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
 :cheers:  :cheers:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Melinia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In my day there was no 256 bit graphics. The Atari was the thing to have, I think it Might have had 8 bit. Adventure was the best video rpg you could get. You were this iddy biddy dot going across the screen trying to find the key that was locked inside the castle that you were trying to get into. *doh*<br />
 Then Nintendo came with *gasp* 16 bit! (bringing you Zelda &amp; Final Fantasy!) Then... Then... Super Nintendo!... 32 BITS! WOW!... THen then... came Nintendo 64! wow.. gasp... wow... (grated i think I was 20 when this one came out). Then i think Playstation came along and blew away Nintendo.<br />
<br />
ps. I turned 28 this month aswell. Seeing Atari games for the pc listed as &quot;Classic&quot; makes me feel sooo.. well... old.</div></div><hr />

None of this guide you along with a mouse, and do everything by clicking nonesense.   If you were lucky you could use WASD to move, but you were probably typing in 'Go North'<br />

Man, I'm old. :o</div></div><hr />

Yes, there's nothing like downloading the file for running an Atari game in an emulator and realizing it's 4K.<br />
<br />
I think an empty word document is bigger than 4K...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tanliel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">mmm, Infocom and Zork ... that takes me back  :) <br />
<br />
Of course, Dungeons of Daggorath on the TSR-80 takes me even further back.  :D  all in 16k of RAM!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">And don't forget that if you played roleplaying games you were a devil-worshipping freak!<br />

<br />
<br />
Heh, ok True story.<br />
<br />
About 10 years ago I worked in a gaming store in Burnsville, MN called Phoenix Games. we had lots of students who would frequent the store and often stayed to play games all day. One day one of the students mothers came to pick up her son and saw all the games we had for sale. After a short exchange she accused me of leading a cult ment to steal the souls of her baby and other children. Being as absurd as she sounded I got snippy and vented at her saying &quot;yes these games are the path to the devil! I personally pacaked a demon in every book and box.&quot; Well she left after shoving her son out the door, (He was playing Magic the Gathering) and throwing his cards in the street.<br />
<br />
Well the other patrons/regulars and I had a great laugh over this until 75 mothers were out picketing the store the next morning. With all the &quot;Devil-worshiping&quot; going on they even brought a priest down to Exorcise the building  :eek:  They picketed a total of 2 days, during the second day all of the regulars played outside that day sitting with them and they got scared :)</div></div><hr />

Somebody get this freekin duck away from me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's dark.  You might get eaten by a Grue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Infocom was great! Nord and Bert is still one of the goofiest text games out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grimina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Okay old timers, help me out!  I used to have this game on the CoCo2 (I think it was coco2 cuz it used cartridges) that I absolutely LOVED (you know...back when your tv WAS your monitor *snort*).  It was called &quot;cave&quot; something or other.  Actually decent graphics considering the platform.  You basically just had to run around jumping over boulders that were rolling at you, and grabbing keys to open doors to go further into the &quot;dungeon&quot;  I seem to recall climbing vines as well.  Anyway I must have been about 10 when I was playing that game (so ~16-17 years ago) and I since I actually still HAVE my CoCo2 was hoping I could find the game somewhere out there...if only I knew the danged name *blush*  You know...reliving the &quot;good&quot; times and all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Torgamous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sounds like you have the Coleco (sp?), and the game sounds like Pitfall (Big thing in it's days.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Heartsong_Steelsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah, it sounds like Pitfall, which I know you could play on the Atari 2600 - weren't the colecovision games cartridges that worked on both, or something?<br />
<br />
<br />
re: satan-worshipping and roleplaying games.  I didn't actually play RPG's back when this was really true, but I've never had a bit of trouble from my parents... maybe it's the fact that my dad used to play D&amp;D and is a Baptist sunday school teacher.  Glad not everyone is close minded. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmm... how about - None of those battery powered cards for kids, we pedaled!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Cubwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Pitfall...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grimina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well almost had me questioning my sanity there for a minute LOL (it has after all been YEARS since I dug that thing out)  So I went and looked for an actual picture of a Coleco system, then checked for the Pitfall game.  Neither is it.  But I did find exactly what I have.  It's a Tandy TRS-80 Color Computer 2.  Used floppies and cartridges (cartridges went in the right hand side of it).  Still haven't found the game I'm looking for but did find a site that sells other old cartridges and a few emulators *cheer*<br />
<br />
Oh and back to the &quot;when I was a kid&quot; looking for that game made me remember the &quot;hardship&quot; of not having directories on your very first harddrive.  Not being able to play &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and &quot;Jeopardy&quot; because the startup files were both named &quot;Menu.exe&quot;.  Gave my neighbor (who had the very first harddrive on the block) hives until I figured that one out LOL</div></div><hr />

I think an empty word document is bigger than 4K...<br />
<br />
<br />

Empty MS Word Doc = 11k. (10,752 bytes)<br />

Quartic found a game the other day, a first person shooter, with Morrowind quality graphics and dynamic lighting, and five levels that I saw (IE, there are many more). The entire game was in one .exe with one .txt file, I forget if it was a readme or an options file. The .exe was 96kb. <br />

Thinking back, some things haven't changed much.  Avatar on the PLATO-IV system was multiplayer, groups oriented, had quest (must collect item X to level up), chests you could dispell/disarm/open, monsters you could charm, 1st person view point, more classes and races than EQ, and played on flat panel plasma displays.  Granted the displays could only show orange, or black, but they were plasma displays.  Circa 1978.</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing Sanna is referring to .kkrieger by .theprodukkt (http://theprodukkt.com/).  As Slashdot (http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/04/15/1239203&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=127&amp;tid=186&amp;tid=204) put it, &quot;Moderately beautiful, what's impressive is it can fit inside the UT2004 readme.&quot;  The game's system requirements are far too high for my machine - gives a new meaning to &quot;slideshow&quot;, when it moves at all - so I haven't seen much of it other than the screenshots on that site.  But it does look impressive :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
/grumbles about spoiled kids<br />
<br />
That died with the invention of the Atari2600.<br />
<br />
I remember playing in my sand-pile with my Tonka trucks.  My neighbor had a trucking company so evey year he would dump a truckload of sand in his backyard (they had a large one) for his kids.  Everyone wanted to go play there.<br />
<br />
Also, what about all the 'safety' issues?  <br />
<br />
We never wore seat belts!  In fact, we rolled down the BACK window on our station wagon and leaned out it.<br />
<br />
My dad smoked in the house, we had high-fat food.  No bike helmets, no roller-skate pads, even shaven down electrical cords running under the rug.<br />
<br />
We had a fraction of the safety standards that are in effect today!</div></div><hr />

Yes, that looks like the game. He was playing this weekend when I took my comp to his place to PL his wizzy some... 'cept then he got bored and I went to Veksar and got 50, and he got this game and played it. I'm miserable at remembering game names, esp first person shooters that base screen movement on the mouse; took me 48 hours to get used to EQ's movement before it stopped making me nauseous. : P <br />
<br />
It's a spiffy looking thing, very smooth and pretty. I recommend playing it if you like FPSs. <br />
<br />
'Course... Quartic's comp could 2bx flawlessly, no mouse lag even on <br />
Sullon, after the Dec 16th patch that totally slew my mouse on Sullon and wasn't much better on Tarew. (/hug new graphics engine that fixed so many problems for me!) But the point being, don't use him as a yardstick for system reqs or such. <br />

I laugh now when they package CD-ROM games with boxes of cereal, I noticed it recently on Cap'n Crunch.  <br />
<br />
Hehe, a bit more modern, but did anyone ever play that little dinky adventure game that came on the driver disk for the original Gravis Gamepad.  (i'll bet 90% of you own one of these gamepads, go back and see if you still have the driver 3.5&quot; disk and install it, the game is so buggy its funny!)</div></div><hr />
