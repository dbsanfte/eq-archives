<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jhavon</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not really sure where to send an &quot;official&quot; proposal regarding tradeskills, but I figured I'd post here to see if my idea made sense in any way, shape or form and go from there.<br />
<br />
Currently, every CLASS (not combination, not race) has a &quot;cultural&quot; option available to them from the upgraded May 8 cultural patch.  Except one, the Monk class.<br />
<br />
Looking at the Monk class, one can see that Humans have the option of Quellious or Agnostic.  One can also see that Iksar have the option of Cazic Thule.  (Yes, I'm aware that one of the PvP servers added Veeshan to that list for Humans.)  Currently, there exists one cultural race that can make armor for both the Quel and CT deities, and that's the Erudites.  Erudite cultural is also already human-wearable in all of the deity-restricted pieces (the imbued ones).  Monks, by definition, are a leather class.  Erudite cultural is tailored, one of the few races where this is so.<br />
<br />
Following this logical progression, one could easily make the leap from the current cultural options to adding a new set of tailored armor for Monks by Erudite Tailors.  While I understand that adding the Iksar option to this armor *is* a stretch, the logic is already firmly in place for the addition of Leather for the Quellios Monk.<br />
<br />
Please, feel free to comment on this thought/idea here.  My main is a Quellious Monk, so maybe I'm just trying to get cool duds for him, but I doubt I'd wear any of it, really.</div></div><hr />

They are rapidly running out of room. They have to kind of pick and choose what they are going to add from here on out. I think a more likely cultural option for monks would be a human tailored, and a seperate iksar tailored armor. Of course, they could make the iksar or human monk armor smithed out of some magical leather like metal. They have done things like the before. For example, the wood elf ranger cultural armor is Tailored, but I believe it is actually a chain model. The reason I think they wouldn't make Erudites make this armor is simply this, Erudites can't be monks, therefore, why would they endeavor to craft monk armor?</div></div><hr />
