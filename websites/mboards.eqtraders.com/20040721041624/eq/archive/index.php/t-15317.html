<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MFUTE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello folks, I have been lurking the boards for a long time and finaly I can give a little info back.<br />
<br />
Seems the Leatherfoot Backpack is trivial at 190 now.<br />
<br />
Here is the deal.<br />
Been working on tailoring on my halfling. At 188 +geerlok I tried making a Leatherfoot backpack for the heck of it, I made it first try. I think WOOT! Put this on my wife's toon, insta + Wife faction!<br />
Made a few Vale leather mask to get to 189. <br />
Decided to try again on a backpack, so I got the stuff for 2. <br />
First fail, Second made and skill up to 190.  <br />
<br />
A buddy brought me the stuff to make him one, hit combine, Woot hand him a new Leatherfoot Backpack. <br />
<br />
About 10 min later I thought to look to see if I got a skill up and I saw the trivial message!<br />
<br />
Being the type of person I am I said &quot;NO WAY!&quot;<br />
I logged out just in case I was bugged, went and spent WAY tooo much on stuff to make two more. (Hate buying stuff I get for free if I take the time.)<br />
<br />
Made both backpacks and got the trivial message on both at 190.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have a halfling tailor at that lvl?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Check and make sure you didn't make one of these instead:<br />
<br />
Leatherfoot Small Pouch, trivial at 190 (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1229&amp;menustr=035000000000) <br />
<br />
If not, /bug it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MFUTE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am sure it was the backpack.<br />
<br />
I will try to test it again when I get home tonight after the patch.<br />
There are usually some Tufts for sale in the Bazaar, so I should be able to try it tonight instead of foraging all evening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>scarbrowed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">After 3 successes, the recipe should be in your UI with trivial listed. You might check there, too. Of course you might have found a bug where the listed number and the actual don't match. I'm really curious about what happens when you try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maisie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Leatherfoot Haversacks are still 251 triv, but I rarely failed them and they sell very well. Perhaps you can skip up to those?<br />
<br />
I never really made the backpacks as people wanted havers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>MFUTE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Did not get trivial message tonight, made three out of three at 190 with out using geerlok. Also Made a Haversack without geerlok. Could not afford to pay for any more for items in the bazaar to try any more.<br />
<br />
Also you learn items after one succesful combine, not three. The Haversack is avalible to me now with one combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>scarbrowed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Does the backpack show up in the new UI? And what trivial is it listed with?<br />
<br />
And you bring up a point I've not seen discussed anywhere. Are recipes always learned on the first success? It looks that way in my limited experience, but it would be good to verify. (Except quest recipes, which we know are mostly never learned.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>MFUTE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">From memory I want to say it was 236 on the backpacks.<br />
I will have to look at the haversack again. <br />
It was a long raid night last night and I was trying to test this then log off so I didn't pay attention to it's trivial, just that it was learned.</div></div><hr />
