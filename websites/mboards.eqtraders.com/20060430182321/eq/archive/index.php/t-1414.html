I ask because, depending on your class, there's different components to make it.  Dark Elf uses neriak nectar I believe, Ogres use their swill, etc.  The reason I ask is because for me, as an Ogre smith, it might actually be easier to have the adamantite bricks enchanted and smithed into blocks right in neriak, then have the Block shipped to the beloved Ogre homeland for further smithing.  Can something be smithed in one cultural forge and used in another?</div></div><hr />

Both sheets are the same thing.</div></div><hr />

Only the high end stuff (like Oggok Adamantite) or final combines require a cultural forge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do all my large brick to block and block to folded sheet combines in the cultural forge.  Never tried any other forge for those combines.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now when I look, it's not there... not sure if it was a change to the recipe, or if I was just reading something wrong, but I could swear that I double-checked the recipe before posting here.</div></div><hr />
