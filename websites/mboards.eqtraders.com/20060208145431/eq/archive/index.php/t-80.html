<br />
Well, I am finally tired of trying to just luck across someone else doing this quest. I have met 4 other people supplying pieces, but all of them are Beastlords like me.<br />
<br />
I'm going to start a new channel to try to ease the suffering for those of us who ARE working on this quest. If you are looking for some of the pieces, or can provide some of the pieces for trade, please /join sonicwolfbane:quest so that we may be able to find each other.<br />
<br />
If another channel already exists, please reply to this post with that channel name.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taniel</div><div class="date">12-08-2002, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">An excellent idea. I am a 39th Shaman, and have at least four each of three of the ingredients for the Reactive Sealant. Now if the stinking grimlings would take a vacation and let the owlbears do some grazing, I could get the digested night palm.<br />
<br />
I also have my 52nd warrior working through the warrior section of it; she's a bit lacking in the fur department (wood elf) but don't hold that against her. The Khala Dun certainly don't seem to.</div></div><hr />

In that regard I am more than willing to help any of the other classes farm for components that are required to make the pieces.<br />
<br />
My tailoring skill is currently 165, and I have enough components to make at least 6 of the Beastlord pieces, but have had absolutely no luck on obtaining the shaman / bard / rogue / warrior pieces.<br />
<br />
Either way, give me a shout if you want some assistance or some company while farming Hollowshade =)</div></div><hr />

We've been diligently gathering the materials needed to complete these quests and I'm sure we would not mind doing some swapping about.  Currently we have the following classes gathering supplies:<br />
<br />
Beastlord<br />
Rogue<br />
Shaman<br />
Bard<br />
<br />
<br />
Hrmm well that's all of them now isn't it?  Anyhow, feel free to drop us a line while we're hunting the added company could be quite nice.  As well it would be nice to keep the zone in order for once, so we might have an easier time gathering materials.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuraan Rak`Shir</div><div class="date">05-10-2003, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm frequently in Hollowshade working the war around.  I've got a strong handle on how to spawn the various mobs, so if you're needing help, send a tell.  For the sake of those that are on when I'm not, here's a brief run-through.<br />
<br />
Assuming the zone is freshly reset, and all mobs are in their rightful places, this is the surest way to get the chosen race a headstart.<br />
<br />
 :idea: To spawn owlbears, kill the named grimlings/defenders in the south.<br />
 :idea: To spawn grimlings, kill the named wolves/defenders in the east.<br />
 :idea: To spawn wolves, kill the named owlbears/defenders in the north.<br />
<br />
Doing any of these will get your team a 1 camp headstart, and will put them only 1 camp away from taking over.<br />
<br />
From here, it's easiest to get the owlbears to win, as they are aggressive by nature, so it seems.  It's hardest to get the wolves to win; they get invaded a lot.<br />
<br />
 :arrow: The best way to get your chosen team to win is to have a 3-4 man squad, with at least one root capable caster.  Make sure that any invading parties from opposing teams are exterminated as quickly as possible.  To ensure that your team takes the camp they intend to attack, go ahead of them (they only walk) and wipe out the defenders that have spawned out front.<br />
<br />
 :arrow: Once you get your team to take over the entire zone, a named *boss* of that race will spawn in the fort near Shar Vahl.  Now, it's very hard to resist killing this named, because they frequently drop awesome loot.  Remember that if you get this named to spawn, you can farm your chosen team at your leisure.  Simply kill the named to reset the zone and start the process anew.<br />
<br />
I was soloing this war as a 49 Beastlord with ease.  Just don't get ahead of yourself and this is very easy.  Everything but the named in the fort will be green to 49, (exception: Scarflank, named sonic wolf in the south.  He's Lblue on occasion) the named being Dblue or so til about 52.<br />
<br />
There you have it.  The beginner's guide to the Hollowshade War.  I'm still looking for all pieces of the claws but the Toughened Sinew Lashings, so if you can help, please send a tell.  I'm on nightly after about 10pm CST or so.  Best of luck!<br />

EDIT:<br />
<br />
Upon reading back through this post, I realized that I left a few pieces of key information out.  Here's the other stuff I think you should know.<br />
<br />
 :arrow: The &quot;invaders&quot; I referred to are indifferent conning members of the race going on an attack.  These spawn shortly after the named leader of a cave/camp is killed and another race senses weakness.  These spawn and walk across the zone to the weakened camp.  Outside the weakened camp, defenders (3-5) will spawn.  These are perma-rooted and will summon.  If these are left alive, they will do battle with the invaders, and there is a 50/50 chance that they will survive and win.  Killing these defenders ensures that the invading party will take over the camp, spawning their race inside.<br />
<br />
Other tidbits:<br />
<br />
 :arrow: Grimlings are by far the toughest race to do frequent battle with.  They come in 3 flavors:  Wizard, Shaman, and Warrior.  All 3 varieties hit hard, and the 2 caster types cast hard.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.<br />
<br />
 :arrow: Sonic wolves are the next toughest.  They come in hard hitting Warrior packages most frequently.  In the south camp however, &quot;sonic stalkers&quot; spawn inside the tent with Scarflank.  These stalkers are Shaman types, and cast accordingly, including up to Healing for higher level members of their race.  All sonic wolves &quot;see&quot; invis, as they use &quot;sound waves&quot; to track and kill prey.<br />
<br />
 :arrow: Owlbears are cake.  They don't hit exceptionally hard, but do cast &quot;Screech&quot; which is a magic based short duration stun that does up to 65 DD.<br />
<br />
 :arrow: The camp in the south is easiest to hold, as all you have to do is go along the south zone wall and set up shop near the hut in the back.  Kill the named and the bodyguards (they spawn at the base of the steps).  <br />
<br />
 :arrow: The cave in the north is next easiest to hold, as all you have to kill is the named/PH's, as well as anything that aggros, which seems to be 1 in every 4 or 5 wolves once they're green to you.  Simply keep the back 2 rooms in the cave clear, and you shouldn't have any trouble getting another race to attack.  When they do, go out front and wipe the defenders.<br />
<br />
 :arrow: The cave in the east is a @$#%! to hold.  It has a very fast respawn time, and anything in the cave will aggro on you.  Keep this cave clear, and try to stay aware of what's going on behind you.  There is little to no room to maneuver in this cave, so kiting is not an option unless you pull them out of the cave.  One very successful method of holding this cave is to have a tank run in and aggro everything, drag it out and have an AE'er wipe the place clean.  The best AE class for this is a high level cleric, as your tank is going to take a beating doing this.</div></div><hr />
