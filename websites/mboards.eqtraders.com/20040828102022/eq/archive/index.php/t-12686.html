<br />
Either that you picked up off a merchant or found in a zone, or anything?<br />
<br />
I haven't been able to locate any confirmed sitings on this rune... are we sure its in game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes, it's in game.<br />
<br />
try veksars, or chardok b.. or any zone that drops 50+ research pieces that have appropriate level mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Niellya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From information at Graffe's, they (zephyr and scintillation) drop only from the high end Luclin mobs; the ones that drop GSS and EER.<br />
<br />
There have been one or two unsubstantiated results (people saying, &quot;Yeah, I sold a stack to a vendor the other day&quot;) of them dropping in level 65 LDoNs and elsewhere, but nothing solid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the wizard's debate this a lot at graffes.  a few have said high level ldons can drop them but not often at all.  mostly it seems to be what nie said.  some wondering if they are just extremely rare and wizards are hunting for the spell drop and find the rune.  hard to say for certain but several ppl have started threads that got locked saying yeah i vendored a stack the other day.  like throwing napalm on an oil dump in 120 degree weather.  anyways yes they exist and no if your a wizard you wont find them easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>adetia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thanks for the info, that is mostly what i suspected, but all i've ever been able to find are the people like you mentioned saying that they've gotten stacks and stacks lol, which obviously is bogus.</div></div><hr />

As reported from the devs last fan faire:<br />
<br />
Research drops for lvl 50-60 spells are not entirely zone-specific. Parts that drop off of a mob of a given level should drop off of mobs of that same level in some other zones. They were added primarily to LoY, new, and recently revamped zones and not to all zones across the board. <br />
<br />
My guildies use to bring me zephyr, rarely... but they didn't do SoL bosses to get them.   They liked veksars, and chard b at the time.<br />
<br />
There's 170 or so &quot;new&quot; research pieces.  Given the rarity which they drop in the first place, the variety of mob levels, the large expanses of zones, The small number of peopel that actually know what the pieces are used for, the small number of people that atually record where they get every drop, the small number of those that then post all that information on here, it is not suprising that specific zone information has been gathered past where it has.... especially if there isn't mob-specifc drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daylar Farshot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It used to drop im POM ver 1.0 along with the Yaeth 117 118 pages.  I have no idea if it drops in 2.0 or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yewset</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">118 definitely drops in PoM, I got mine there.<br />
A group of friends went every couple of weeks for awhile, and got a 118 almost every trip, off the wall guards.<br />
<br />
Don't think I have been in a zone where zephyr dropped, its not on the loot list for the log parser I have, anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tudamorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've done many hard LDoN and have never seen Zephyr.  Come to think of it, I've never seen it period.  I have seen Scintillation on LDoN normals, though rarely.<br />
<br />
By the way, when they say that the components aren't &quot;entirely&quot; zone-specific, they don't mean it's just random.  In LDoN, for example, there is a very clear pattern with each theme constantly having 2-3 of the same spell components (e.g., Guk hard will always have tons of Words of Divergence and Expertise).  For other components (e.g., Rune of Tempest, Words of Torment), it's spread out pretty evenly.  It's not just a level thing because the NPC levels are the same across the themes.<br />
<br />
Also, LDoN hard doesn't necessarily give you better components than normal, just different ones.  Ironically, most of the components I get from hard ones are for the (junk) high 50s spells.</div></div><hr />
