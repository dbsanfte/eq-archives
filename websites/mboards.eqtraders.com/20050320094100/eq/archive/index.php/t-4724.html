<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Traska</div><div class="date">03-11-2003, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey there, sorry to saddle all of you with my petty problems.  =P<br />
<br />
Got a problem with my DSL home network, and it's driving me bonkers.<br />
<br />
I have two desktops and two laptops on the network.  The router is a LinkSys, the desktop ethernet cards are RealTek, and the laptops are SMC. For some reason, when I'm in EQ the desktops (and ONLY the desktops) experience frequent, and often coincidal, drops from the server.  It's almost always out to character select, and almost always with no problem getting back in for another ten to fifteen minutes.<br />
<br />
This happens whether or not I have both computers using EQ (i.e., I could be using *just* the second in Bazaar mode, or just the first hunting, or any combination thereof).  The laptops, meanwhile, experience unbroken service throughout.<br />
<br />
Desktops and laptops are using ZoneAlarm, but it only once caused me any problem before I set up the network, and I took care of that.<br />
<br />
The best term I can use to describe these brief interrupts is a &quot;hiccup&quot;.  Anyone have ANY idea what could be causing it and how to fix it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The main system is a WinXP system, the other desktop and two laptops are Win98 systems.<br />
<br />
The RealTek drivers are fully up to date, that was one of the first things I checked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilosh</div><div class="date">03-11-2003, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What do the desktop computers have in common, that the Laptops do not?<br />
<br />
The only thing you have mentioned is that they are using the same brand of NIC.    I suggest you examine both systems, and see what programs you might have running on both desktops.<br />
<br />
Then call your router manufacturer, and tell them what's happening.   If the ports on your router are numbered, make sure you know which ports are affected.<br />
<br />
<br />
Try switching the network cables around, at the hub.  If the desktops are in port 1 and 3, try 1 and 4, or 2 and 4.    This will see if the problem is with the ports on the hub.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lastly, try sending me a  check for $50, and I will pray for you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Traska</div><div class="date">03-11-2003, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, to be honest, other than better specs (1 gig processor vs a 120 mhz on the laptop), the desktops are running EQ, and that's the similarity.<br />
<br />
I mean, they're using different hard drives (WD and Maxtor), they're using different motherboards (Soyo and Biostar), they're using different processors (relatively speaking, Celeron and Pentium... but the laptops have Pentiums, too), they're using different video cards (GeForce and Diamond), and different sound (soundblaster 128 in the main system, none in the mule).<br />
<br />
To be honest, the odd thing about this is that it *only* happens while playing EQ.  I don't notice random interrupts at any other time.<br />
<br />
I know I haven't given a lot to go on... and to be honest, I demand about as much service as I'm paying for.  =)  I was just seeing if anyone who hasn't been starung at this for a while had any fresh ideas.  I'll try switching the hub ports around... but it all seems to point back to EQ somehow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alternately, have you run a diagnostic to see that kind of packet times you are getting on the connection? Some NICs are known to be &quot;impatient&quot; and EQ sure is.<br />

<br />
That will probably fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Traska</div><div class="date">03-13-2003, 06:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, we haven't tested two systems long term, but...<br />
<br />
We have the network working to the point where I had two systems running concurrently for an hour.  Also, I had my bazaar mule in while I slept, and it was still in when I woke up  =)<br />
<br />
(Note to self:  Make more MTPs today)<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the advice.  It, um, didn't help directly, as stupid silly me had a  hub instead of a router.  &lt;Smacks self&gt;  But, I *did* have a second ethernet card, which enabled m to use software routing, so everything's hunky-dory now.<br />
<br />
But your advice *did* help, because it pushed me to go look up doing what you guys said to do.  If I hadn't seen that, I would never have known that I could even do software routing.  =)<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wrote EQ tech support and they suggested for me to update my video drivers (Creative Labs Anhillator 2).<br />
<br />
Believe it or not, that worked, the problem stopped immediatly.<br />
<br />
Interesting how something that may seem irrelevant (since I updated those drivers though CL's sirte before) could be a fix.<br />
<br />
They've also had issues in the past with Sound Blaster Live! sound cards..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just about the very first thing I do when things screw up repeatedly is check my drivers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draggar</div><div class="date">03-13-2003, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So did I, but they sent me some obsure (supposed) video driver, possibly an add on, that fixed it.<br />
<br />
I'm not even 100% sure it was a video driver, but they said it was, and I should try installing it to see if that helps, and it did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay, Netnotworking once again.<br />
<br />
So it turns out I'm an idiot and I have a hub instead of a router.  Okay, no problem, just get a router, right?  Right?<br />
<br />
So I buy a one port router... one line in, one line out.  I figure DSL modem to router to hub.  No problem, right?<br />
<br />
Well, I can't even get on the internet with the router in the loop.  Nothing we've been able to do has been able to get us online.  In fact, it's only because I took the router out of the loop that I'm on now.<br />
<br />
I'm *so* lost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teledriel</div><div class="date">03-18-2003, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now you have a router .. need to check the connection area. There will be a setup area throught he software for the router, &amp;lt;Mine is a LinkSys Router and use the IE web browser to call up the ROUTERS ip.&gt; But gettign back to the point. Make sure you are connecting correctly. My friends have to eneter there DSL Server login information IN the router also. &amp;lt;Don't quote me think it was the PPPoE connection type.&gt; But anyways hoping this points you int he right direction. Also with the router and it being the connector, you compuers will obtain a IP from the router ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malathos</div><div class="date">03-19-2003, 03:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most direct cable services (ADSL, Broadband) are tied to the physical address of the network card that was first registered when the connection was set up. The router will have a different hardware address (it's called a MAC address), BUT it should have the ability to mimic any hardware address so you won't have to tell your ISP that you have a different card/machine whatever.<br />
<br />
Also, like Teledriel says, you need to configure your router to have the right IP address. The install guide should tell you how to connect to it and configure it with a browser.<br />
<br />
If you use IPCONFIG / ALL from the dos command prompt, that will give you the IP address the machine has (probably allocated each time you power up, but only the last number should change). It'll also give you the physical address of the card in the machine - this will be the address that the router will have to mimic if your ISP ties the connection to the hardware (mines does).<br />
<br />
Routers are a lot more complex than hubs and it's not just a case of plugging it in, so I'm afraid you'll need to do some sort of configuration  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Traska</div><div class="date">03-19-2003, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, here's the situation as it stands now.<br />
<br />
I changed the IP address of my NIC card to match that of the router.<br />
<br />
I entered in the IP address and subnet mask of the WAN into the router's config.<br />
<br />
I input the login information for my DSL account into the router's config..<br />
<br />
The network works... I can transfer files to and from all the computers hooked up to it.  But I can't go online with it.  I can only go online if I take the network out of the loop and hook the DSL modem directly to my NIC card (as I'm doing now just so I can post!)<br />
<br />
I'm totally stumped.  ANd what's worse, Verizon won't lift a finger to help because I didn't buy my network equipment from them.  Um, hello, the network works, it's GETTING ONLINE I'm having a problem with.<br />

<br />
Here goes.<br />
<br />
External IP address of router is supplied from Verizon.  Either through DHCP or thru Static IP.  If DHCP, it should have given you the correct DNS server information.  If Static you had to enter it in the router's configuration and you would have been given this information from Verizon.<br />
<br />
Internal IP address of router and IP address of Network Card(s) should be on the same subnet.  Example, Router's internal IP 192.168.1.1, first computer nic IP 192.168.1.2, next 192.168.1.3, and so on.  If you use the IPs I gave you, the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 <br />
<br />
Make sure you have port forwarding turned on for all ports between 1024 and 7000 (I believe those are all that EQ uses).<br />
<br />
If all that is configured correctly, you SHOULD be able to connect.  If that doesn't work, I have a few more ideas. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Traska</div><div class="date">03-19-2003, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I have DHCP turned on, because I don't have a static IP.  This particular router has an IP address of 192.168.10.10, so I've set this computer's NIC to 192.168.10.1.  The subnet mask is indeed as you've stated.  As I said, I can get the network to read just fine... computer A can talk to B, B can talk to C, etc.  The whole mess just can't go online.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhisk</div><div class="date">03-19-2003, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, now from any computer on the network, ping both the internal IP and the external IP of the router.  The internal is 192.168.10.10, the external should show up on one of the configuration screens of the router.  Since I dont know what brand or model router you are using, I cant tell you where to look.  Let me know if you can PING BOTH of those IP addresses.  This will lead me onto the next step in troubleshooting your problem.<br />
<br />
Bear with me here, diagnosing network problems over the net is a pain.  That and the fact that I am recovering from a major car accident, my mind is not necessarily focusing down on the problem.  But if we work this thru, we can figure out the problem and get your running.  <br />

I figure I'm not using the LAN until I can get it online anyway, and it's a lot less hassle with just the one.<br />
<br />
Here's the deal.  I can ping the router just fine, I can ping the WAN, I can ping the NIC, but I can't ping the WAN address the router's config system gives me (I'm assuming that's the external IP you meant).<br />
<br />
If it helps, I'm using a Hawking Technologies model PN9225 router.<br />
<br />
I appreciate all the help, buy the way, really I do.  I hate asking people for help of this nature, but hell... I don't know where else to turn.  Verizon's tech support... well, you know.  And Hawking's tech support consists of E-mail, which would probably be ungodly slow... at least that's been my e-mail support experience thus far with other products.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhisk</div><div class="date">03-19-2003, 09:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK,<br />
<br />
I have seen the configuration screens for hundreds of routers and you hit one that I haven't.  Go figure.  OK, I know it is a one-port, simple bridge (that acts like a router).  If you can reach the internal IP, you should be able to reach the external (Wan address).  However, but since you can't, that actually makes me think that the internal firewall of the router is blocking everything (PING is a wussy protocol and is rarely ever stopped by much).  <br />
<br />
So, next step is to check any firewall settings internal to the router.  My suggestion would be completely turn off the router's firewalling, since you got Zonealarm on your PCs (BTW, I love Zonealarm, excellent choice). <br />
<br />
ACK, don't I wish I could see the setup screens.  I know I am missing something.  Reviewed what has been suggested so far.  Couple of things.  In router setup, yes to obtaining IP address automatically (DHCP from Verizon), no to enabling DHCP for your internal network.   You are assigning static IPs to your PCs.  ~~  <br />
<br />
Don't sweat asking for help.  For some reason EQ players tend to be as helpful as they can.  I am laid up right now, so helping you is keeping me from being too bored.  So, it is my pleasure to try to help.<br />

Feel free to email me, AIM me, or ICQ me if you want to try to speed up this figuring out.  I enabled all these connection methods here on this board.</div></div><hr />
