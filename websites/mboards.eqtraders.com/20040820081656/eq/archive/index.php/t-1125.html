<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zacatac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After a long road, the final battle was fought.  A quest I started back at level 42 is now completed.  My Epic and this shawl is probably the 2 hardest quests I've completed. ;)<br />

Thanks to everyone who helped, and all my friends who have shared this experience.  The final fight was fun, but the silly dwarf warpped back to his spawn point TWICE during the event.  Made for some real fun trying to drag him back repeatedly.  Thanks to Amaris (ench), Tohney (bard) and Arbo (monk) for the continuous watch over the General.  Tagging him and pulling him around to get him on the path and mem-blurs to get him going again. :)</div></div><hr />
