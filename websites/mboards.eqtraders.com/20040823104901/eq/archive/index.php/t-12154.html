First time posting here so not sure if this is the correct way to post a trivial level for an item.<br />
     I was making casserole dishes today and it trivialed out on me at 183 instead of the 199 that's listed on EQTC list.<br />
     Just wanted to let someone know :)<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>CasyRx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes positive, cause it kinda irritated me at the time since I had just gone to JP and bought a load fo casserole sketches...I didnt fire them anyway cause they didnt resell to vendor for anything worth while, just dropped them on the ground as i made them.<br />
Maybe was a bug, who knows.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Noni DeeCups</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I made them until 199. Then I made the planar steins. That was a few (5?) months ago. It was before the ceramic lining stacked. What a pain that was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>HoverCraaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was making Casserole Dishes just a couple weeks back, and had no problem (other than slow skill ups) in the 180's and low 190's. <br />
<br />
I'll test them tonight and reply, unless someone beats me to it. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Saw that today on a casserole dish combine, still not trivial.  What server are you on that you say has lower trivial?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>CasyRx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Stromm Server,  I dont know what the deal is with it, cause on Saryrn my chanter is a GM potter and she did casserole dishes till 199.  Must be some kind of bug I guess.  But moving on to ceramic bands nonetheless.<br />
Thanks for the replies guys :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd try dishes again.  Sometimes, the game seems to have these quirks on triv levels.  Or you may have done something wrong in the wheel.  Give it another try before quitting dishes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>HoverCraaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did try some last night and never recieved a trival message. I didn't recieve a skill up, but at least the sucessful combines did not yeild a &quot;you cannot advance&quot; message.<br />
<br />
/agree with others<br />
<br />
Keep pluggin at dishes, they are much cheaper than other items you'll encounter. But then again, if you have those PP trees in your back yard, spend away! :)<br />

&lt;edit&gt; I speel reel gud.... &lt;/edit&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm working pottery too atm, have been 183 for a good 60+ combines (darn you hell levels) and not trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Amanensia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hit 190 a few hours ago on casseroles on Xev, so no change I am pretty sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wandazula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I hit 199 on casserole dishes on Tuesday.   Am at 206 now .. wheee ... (unfired planar steins and opal steins)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Trepan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I went past 190 last night w/ casserole dishes on Stromm.<br />
<br />
There's been no change, except in my hate level for ceramic linings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ausversucht</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just be glad that they stack now, I can remember the pain when they didn't.</div></div><hr />

Just be glad that they stack now, I can remember the pain when they didn't. <br />
<br />
I wish they stacked UNFIRED too, hehe, would make my life a whole lot easier, but I'll take what I can get.<br />
<br />
Just hit 195 today on these, so they're definitely not trivial at 183.</div></div><hr />
