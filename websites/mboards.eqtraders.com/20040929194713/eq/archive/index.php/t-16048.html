<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It seems a little silly to be to announcing this publicly, but here goes. <br />
 <br />
As of the end of this week I will no longer be playing EverQuest.  It's been a long road.  I've played the game since April 3 of 1999, and headed one of the oldest guilds in EQ, Spiritwalkers on the Tunare server.  <br />
 <br />
I've played until I'm blue in the face.  I've played marathon sessions lasting 18+ hours.  I've tradeskilled, camped, ground, and quested until the very thought of ever playing again leaves me cold.   Why then did I stay so long? <br />
 <br />
The answer is simple.  I continued to play EverQuest for the people.  Those I met in-game and through communities like this one and EQInterface and the tunare.tradeskills channel made for such great friends (and sometimes rivials or foes) that I was compelled to stay. <br />
 <br />
I will be continuing my role here at EQ Traders Corner as a moderator.  My volunteer efforts to help Niami and Ngreth run this excellent resource will continue.  You just won't see me playing the game. <br />
 <br />
I've begun playing City of Heros (http://cityofheros.com), and I'll be on the Justice server there.  If you're looking for me, any member of the Super Group Heros Inc. will be able to point you to me. <br />
 <br />
I'll be logging in to EQ a few more times over the next few days to turn over guild leadership and to bestow gifts on friends and guildmates alike.  Feel free to stop by and /wave or /hug.  <br />
 <br />
Thank you all for a great 5 years.</div></div><hr />

There have been forces at work making it harder and harder to get the motivation to log in for me, as well.  Probably different reasons than yours, but they have the same effect.<br />
<br />
If I see you on Justice, I'll be sure to say Hi. :)</div></div><hr />

I've been wondering where you were - hadn't seen any of you, even Quon, for quite a while.  You'll certainly be missed, Loth - you've been a good friend.  EQ is more about the people than the game, as you point out, and you've been a sizeable part of the hold EQ still has on me.<br />
<br />
;tradeskills won't be the same without ya - no more floods of mt's to get us talking :p<br />
<br />
Best of luck in your new world :)<br />

You would bring up the one embarassing habit I have in EQ... well aside from the incessant complaining... MISTELLS.  I swear, I could send the wrong comment to the wrong channel faster than Captain Kirk can say &quot;Energize!&quot; <br />
 <br />
I'll miss some of the people from EQ, but I won't miss the $13.00 each month (multiplied by 2 accounts) and the hours of aggravation.  :) <br />
 <br />
I'll still be here. Private Messages still work. :)</div></div><hr />

I was often sending comments to the tunare.tradeskills channel like, &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;It depends on what level you are,&quot; after ten or more minutes of silence. And I think I was unoffically the channel-member &quot;Most Likely to Use the Phrase &lt;Expletive Deleted&gt;&quot;.  (No, really.  I would use &lt;Expletive Deleted&gt; in comments.)<br />
 <br />
Like I said, I'll miss a good number of people. :) And a number of good people.</div></div><hr />

If you ever get the inkling, stop by serverwide.eqtraders.<br />
<br />
You'll hear the best mischannel's ever from Nhin and Myself.   Mostly myself.<br />

<br />
And if you ever feel the urge to spend even more money per month...check out FFXI (*hides from Noish*)  And that goes for you too Inyidd! <br />
<br />
I WILL convert as many EQ friends to FFXI friends as I can.  I am a woman on a mission <br />
<br />
And may you have more willpower to actually STAY gone than I had, Lothay.  It's a tough world to leave..but the friends that you only knew &quot;in world&quot; are even tougher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Arakni Spellweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It is hard to leave, and stay gone!  I had the same problem for the same reason.<br />
<br />
If anyone wants to look for me or Cairn, we're on City of Heroes - Virtue server.  :D   <br />
<br />
(What's really sad is, I finally have the web space to create a sig file for this board - 6 months after I stop playing.  Sometimes I don't do things in the right order...)<br />
<br />
Enjoy your time off Lothay!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I know exactly what you mean - I stopped playing EQ for 4 months and thought I was done but came back to socialize and that is mostly what I do.  I feel like I am paying a lot of money for an IM service.<br />
<br />
I had a blast with the City of Heroes beta and have a feeling that if I make some good friendships in Paragon City that I will be splitting my time between virtual worlds.  (I felt very isolated in FFXI and bored in SWG and didn't last much over a month playing either of them.)<br />
<br />
Wishing you much fun in Paragon City and all the best in real life too.   So far I just have made Qord on Victory, but who knows...<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your contributions at EQTraders, Lothay (and glad you will be still about the water cooler).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or, just find the Natural Scrapper, &quot;Obvious Man&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I'm usually found on the Justice server, playing Halcyone.  There's not a whole lot of commands for finding non-friends yet, so just &quot;/tell Halcyone, You there?&quot; and it'll tell you if I'm online.</div></div><hr />
