<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Farnyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I originally had a long drawn out thing written, but I accidentally closed the window. So long story short. Im poor, my MB sucks(AGP slot blown), and I think my RAM chipset blew a chip(its down to 480 from 512). So Im trying to scrape together a new MB and switch to DDR RAM from online sites where they are cheaper. <br />
<br />
Ive got a P4 1.6 and a Radeon 9200 that im trying to carry over to the new MB. So im looking for help on a cheap, reliable MB that can support those 2 things plus the new ram im looking to buy, as well as description on how the heck RAM works. I dont mean the actual technical workings. I mean, I did a search and theres stuff like PC 44000 ram, PC3000...whats it all mean?!<br />
<br />
So any help is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Think there are a few websites dedicated to &quot;matching&quot; motherboards to what you want to do. Motherboard-dot-org or somesuch. (google search)<br />
<br />
Generally I'm pretty sure if you check out a website with a name similar to PriceLine (love to Watch those comercials, so cheesy) you can find Motherboards that meet your needs.<br />
<br />
(category search P4 motherboards in your clock range, then do a ctrl-f search for DDR)<br />
<br />
The PC numbers on RAM are data bus speeds. Back in the day PC100 and PC133 were screaming fast. Now PC-a-billion seems to be the trend. The websites of the vendors SHOULD have a tech spec sheet for the motherboards they are selling. If not run SCREAMING in the other direction and look for a different vendor. From the tech sheet you can tell what CPUs and RAMs and ports (AGPx2 vs. AGPx4) are supported.<br />
<br />
If you are a &quot;tech dummy&quot; perhaps it's not a REAL good idea to replace a motherboard yourself. Here's a couple of quick questions to answer...<br />
<br />
1) ESD is what?<br />
<br />
2) ESD is good / bad ?<br />
<br />
3) You should put the CD-DVD drive and hard drive on the same IDE cable right?<br />
<br />
4) The floppy drive cable is different from the IDE cable how? Which plug of the cable should go to the A: drive, the close one or the far one?<br />
<br />
If you do NOT know the answer to all four of those questions COLD, and think me an idiot for asking them... DO NOT replace your own motherboard.<br />

Hmm... this isn't painful enough, let's add some lemon juice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The site you were trying to think of is pricewatch.<br />
<br />
www.pricewatch.com<br />
<br />
as for what specifci motherboard to get... um... got me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I used to know all about this.  Then I went to meetings for 2 years, and my brain rotted :(<br />
<br />
I mention this because I did remeber enough to check pricewatch and went there and had no clue what anything meant any more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Farnyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually, what I was planning on doing was buying the stuff cheaply off the web, and then having either a friend who knows computers do it, or pay the darn fee at the store and having actual technicians do it. They said their cheapest MB was $60, but I can find one for $40 off pricewatch, not to mention the RAM and anything else I may want.<br />
<br />
But thanks for the tips on what to look for, they will help alot :D.<br />
<br />
Now....DDR means Dance Dance Revolution right... So I should find a PS2 compatible MB...and a game pad...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Double Data Rate :P  Which can get really annoying, because PC133 DDR and PC266 DDR can actually mean the exact same things, due to different vendor naming schemes &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Farnyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wait... so my computer wont be able to play Dance Dance?! :(  :( <br />
<br />
Hehe, Im just kidding, I knew that DDR was double data rate, I just wasnt sure what the numbers next to it meant.</div></div><hr />

My big friend, I deliberately spoke in circumlocutions to avoid making an ad for another website. (a no no)<br />
<br />
But since you very nicely posted the link... that's what I meant.<br />
<br />
(Motherboard dot org or whatever isn't a seller, pricewatch is, which is why I didn't mention the seller by name)<br />
<br />
Hmm... possible new sig ...<br />
