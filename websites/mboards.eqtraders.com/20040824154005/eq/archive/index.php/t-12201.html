<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wondering if anyone else noticed that you can buy Sealed Poison Vials off of the vendors now for a mere 1.32gold.  These use to cost 6pp each when I was doing my skill-ups in Poison Making.  Thus I worked on Pottery to make my own - but now it seems that SOE has taken away our incentive for making our own Sealed Poison Vials.   If they only cost ~0.132p each now then why bother with Pottery!<br />
<br />
Can anyone else confirm this?   I checked the Dark Elf vendors on the West side of the PoK this morning (11/19/03).   Selling a Sealed Poison Vial now only gives you 2sp to vendors!  Ack!<br />
<br />
I didn't check the prices on regular Poison Vials or Lined Poison Vials but did verify that all poison vials only sell back to vendors now for just 2 silver pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gareen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The revised lower selling prices are also in effect for the other poison vials.  <br />
<br />
It is no longer cheaper or worth it to make poison vials--just buy them.<br />
<br />
Anybody wanna buy several stacks of zombie skins?</div></div><hr />
