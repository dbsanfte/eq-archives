<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Feninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Did a search, can't seem to find anything on this.<br />
<br />
My sewing kit is showing a reciepe for &quot;Studded Skullcap (Grakkas)&quot;, trivial of 56.   not to be confused with the Studded Skullcap that is known.<br />
<br />
Reciepe shows as <br />
    4 * A thin loch of hair<br />
    Goblin scribblings<br />
<br />
<br />
Looking in Lucy, I see 3 entries for &quot;A thin loch of hair&quot;, with the following ID's<br />
<br />
    Strand 1 of Pony Tail   (item: 12891)<br />
    Strand 2 of Pony Tail   (item: 12892)<br />
    Strand 3 of Pony Tail   (item: 12893)<br />
<br />
  <br />
Guessing this is an old bugged drop.  Looks like we need 4 Lochs of hair, of which only 3 are dropping.   Item 12894 is not known to Lucy.<br />
<br />
Item 12895 is the Goblin Scribblings, and item 12896 is unknown (I assume thats the skullcap created).<br />
<br />
Of course, what happens with the skullcap is the next problem, assuming the loch's of hair get fixed.<br />
<br />
<br />
anyone got any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Heartsong_Steelsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You may want to also post about this here (http://pub8.ezboard.com/foldunsolvedquestsineverquestfrm1)<br />
<br />
It's a board dedicated to old, unsolved quests, and I seem to recall some relation to the thin loch of hair.  Still unsolved, but unfortunately I don't remember which discussion it is.<br />
<br />
If I'm right, I may bump this over to Quest forum, too.<br />
<br />
(edit) (Snicker) I tried to direct you to your own forums.  Too funny.  Ah well, now other people can look there. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dumpty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">HAHA, thats pretty funny, considering hes the SysOp of the board you linked to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Feninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">which is why Heartstrong edited his message.  He's well aware of my board.<br />
<br />
anyway, it's got to be a busted drop, so I've send in feedback for the item (hey, you never know.  After all, they fixed the Hermit in South Karana - for whatever reason).<br />
<br />
deal with what the cap is for if I ever see the 4th loch of hair</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got one of those thin lochs of hair (sorry, didn't ID it, thought it was just a crappy enc only belt and stuck it on my trader for 15pp) a while back in the pre-revamp droga (pretty sure it was droga, but it could've been nurga too, was back when I was hardcore chardok factioning right before the revamp).<br />
<br />
Also, you should be able to get the item link to the finished product out of the UI to at least see that part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>MrGraveLord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&quot;A Thin Lock of Hair&quot; drops from &quot;A Goblin Canyoneer&quot; . &quot;A Flaxen Lock of Hair&quot; drops from  Chief Rukgus. (I think). The scribblings come from the Goblin Stitcher.<br />
<br />
I've only seen these two hairs. And I spent months in Droga doing faction. If you spend enough time clearing the small little goblin cave in FM, you may yield more.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jhereg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">From my old notes, I haven't had a chance to work on Kunark quests in months though but here's my item notes (made ones like this of every possible quest item in kunark from Magelo+lucy+other sources).<br />
<br />
12884 Fine Steel Rapier (Gunthak pirate rapier) (off any pirate in FV)<br />
12885 Full Component Chest (Pain's Components) (Keeper Pain's component chest quest)<br />
12886 Barbed Scaled Whip (confirmed) (The Lash of Kozzdavada)<br />
12887 A Flaxen Hilt (A Flaxen Hilt) (given by Iksar Hermit in West Cabilis)<br />
12888 A Flaxen Lock of Hair (Lock Of Flaxen Cord) (confirmed)<br />
12889 Large Tassel Bookmark (Tassel of Flaxen Cord) (quest I solved in Kaesora)<br />
12890 A Yellow Whip (A Whip of Flaxen Cord) (drops in DL off named Drolvarg)<br />
12891 A thin loch of Hair (Strand 1 of Pony Tail) (drops from goblin canyoneer) (have)<br />
12892 A thin loch of Hair (Strand 2 of Pony Tail) <br />
12893 A thin loch of Hair (Strand 3 of Pony Tail) (have)<br />
12894 *A thin Loch of Hair (Strand 4 of Pony Tail)   (not needed???, doesn't drop???)<br />
12895 Goblin Scribblings (Pattern for Grakka's Tail) (drops from goblin stitcher)<br />
12896 A Ruby (The Blood of Sebilis) (iksar warrior quest)<br />
12897 Canyoneer Pike (same) (droga drop, level 5 proc, 10% slow)<br />
12898 A Sapphire (The Pools of Sebilis) (iksar warrior quest)<br />
12899 An Emerald (The Gardens of Sebilis) (iksar warrior quest)<br />
<br />
12894 has a star beside it since it was found with Data mining before they added the code preventing it if I remember right. It might have only been a guess though. The format was: Number, name, ID(same meant no special ID), Note.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Turlo Lomon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A Flaxed Lock of Hair, A Flaxen Hilt, A yellow Whip, and a Large Tassel Bookmark make a Barbed Scaled Whip.<br />
