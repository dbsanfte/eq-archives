However, I'm sure I'll be needing more in the near future so I'll add your name to the contact list. I'll be buying in lesser quantities as well, a stack at a time works for me, so don't let the 10 stacks scare anyone. )<br />

I looked for you the last couple of nights until I got busy, but didn't see you.  I should be on every night for the next few days, keep an eye out for me (Jianna and/or Lianna) and I'll meetcha and imbue for ya.</div></div><hr />

Worry? Not me.  I've got lots of mana for my level, Flowing Thought I, Mana Preserve II, Blessings of Piety, and a horse to help speed things up.  Besides, I can fish while I'm meding, so it's not really down time.  Let me know here or in game if you need an imbue again.</div></div><hr />
