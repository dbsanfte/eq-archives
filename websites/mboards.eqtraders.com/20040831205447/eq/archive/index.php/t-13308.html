<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rennol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone ever seen these drop?  I've seen a few gaseous condensates and collected enough wind metals and other materials for attempts at some various Plane of Air made items, but the fog fragments are holding me back.  <br />
<br />
Anyone have any clues as to what specifically drops these?  Or are they just insane uber rare?  <br />
<br />
Not to mention the fact that you need 3 of the **** things to make 4 powdered ones =P<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dawnlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Air is the elemental that I dislike the absolute most.  However I do have 1 lonely fog fragment rotting away in my bank because I can't seem to find 2 more.  It's been a long time, but I believe it  dropped from the elementals in front of one of the Avatar temples.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Alano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">These seem to drop alot in the xegony event, but the mobs up there dont seem to follow the same loot tables as other mobs in the zone.......(air aracnid silk off stormriders ect ect)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Elinea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I saw one looted yesterday during Xegony kill. I can't remember which mob it was off of though. Also, for as many Xegony kills as I've attended, that was the first fog fragment I've seen looted. They must be pretty rare =/</div></div><hr />
