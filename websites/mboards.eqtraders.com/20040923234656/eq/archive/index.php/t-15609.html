<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Benthair Dunthat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well after getting all my skills into the 190's, decided to &quot;top off&quot; the 5 less difficult ones this weekend. So,<br />
<br />
Baking - 200<br />
Brewing - 200<br />
Fletching - 200<br />
Jewel Craft - 200<br />
Pottery - 200<br />
Tailoring - 196<br />
Blacksmithing - 190<br />
<br />
Couple of things I found interesting about getting the last 5 to 10 skill ups in those 5 trades. First off, Brewing took about 4 times longer than the other 4 - I went the Minotaur Hero route, which can't be learned and requires 9 ingredients. Got a little taste of what you GM's must have gone through. Carpal tunnel deluxe. Secondly, pottery seemed to be the most expensive, making the Unfired Blue Ceramic Band. Ingredients include a pearl and an emerald along with some other items, yet finished product sells back to vendor for only 5pp. I originally thought that Jewel Craft would be the $$$, but making the gold fire emerald bracelet actually gave me about a 5pp profit each. Should note that I have a chanter so enchanting the gold bars was free for me.<br />
<br />
So now back to exp'ing, foraging and farming - try to get to 65 (60 now - Karana Druid) and get AA's up to speed. eventually get the Tanaan (?) ones so I can try for 1750.<br />
<br />
Anywho, thanks for all the info and support from thewse boards, kinda keeps ya' going when things get boring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gratz on getting almost all to 200.  A nice accomplishment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm absolutely positive that I have the Minotaur Hero Brew recipe saved in my favorites list for brewing recipes.<br />
<br />
Mayhap you missed the message notifying you of learning a new recipe.</div></div><hr />
