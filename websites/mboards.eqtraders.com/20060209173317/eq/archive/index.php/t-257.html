<br />
Well - its been a while since I was the first person to post to a pre-made Forum category somewhere :)<br />
<br />
I am working on Fletching - and would be interested in selling off items used for skill-ups.<br />
<br />
I am currently at 202 - so my capacity for arrows or bows should be obvious. :)<br />
<br />
I am working on skilling up further - but getting ahold of the Acrylia I need (*as opposed to the expensive bows*) is somewhat difficult. I would be interested in getting acrylia - but cashflow is an issue. However I may be interested in 'paying' someone to supply Acrylia until my skill reaches high enough for a Nightmarewood Bow - and supply them with my first successful attempt as payment. Details would have to be worked out of course, as to how much Acrylia would need to be supplied (* for both the trade to be equitable - and to get enough skill-ups *) but I am willing to negotiate :)<br />
<br />
Happy Tradeskilling!<br />

&quot;Okey-dokey - I think we can arrange an understanding - as long as I can fight - we will get along nicely - just heal me!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a few stacks I can't seem to get rid of, I have been using to skill-up blacksmithing.<br />
<br />
They are on me in bazaar for the moment.  Cost me 300pp to make what I have, but will negotiate to open up inventory if you need them.<br />
<br />
Sorry to derail, all my acrylia farming goes directly into my tailoring exploits, hehe.</div></div><hr />

Well - NP on the derailment - its not like this train has been going anywhere for a long time!<br />
<br />
I would have to say also that at the moment I'm not interested. This is for 2 reasons - first - space considerations - and secondly - Ive been buying EVERY piece of condensed (Shadow, fire, ice) from NPC merchants since about January. I have about 25-30 Stacks of the stuff. :) As you must know - that computes to a HUGE number of potential arrowheads. And since my Smithing is at 121 (or so) I can make my own arrowheads. I am just now about to start my first 'run' of arrows after my piddling around making a few here and there. I think I might have enough Acrylia for 20 attempts at the arrows :) In any case - Ill have to pass for the moment on the Arrowheads. <br />
<br />
Actually - you should seek out some fletchers to try and sell them in bulk - you might not get back what you spent - however - you might want to barter - and get some arrows in exchange instead of cash. You could either use them - or sell the arrows - which you might find sell better. :)<br />

&quot;The long, hard, callous-creating journey of the fletcher is one not unlike other trades. Stick with it and you will succeed.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username"></div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They actually sold sometime in the weee hours of the morning last night, to 2 different people for 3pp each.<br />
<br />
Considering I paid 3-6pp each and have a 60% or so success rate... I 'almost' came out even on the whole thing.  Made 2 arrowheads per success.<br />
<br />
Not too shabby going from 55-91 smithing for about free and 30 minutes worth of combines.<br />
<br />
If you don't mind losing some of those blocks, I'd be happy to combine them for you free of charge to trivial them at 116, and give you the arrowheads, sounds like you have more than you'll ever have acrylia for anyhow.<br />
<br />
I'll even supply the water ;).<br />
<br />
Failing that I can buy them from you for 60pp a stack up to 5 stacks which should trivial me, I just would have to resell them again that way. /shrug<br />
<br />
We might be able to work something out, if interested see me in game.<br />
