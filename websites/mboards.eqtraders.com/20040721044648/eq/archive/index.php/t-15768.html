<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, a few months ago, I hit 250 baking.  Woohoo!<br />
Then, I hit all TSs at or above 150.  Yay!<br />
<br />
Now I've hit another (pseudo) milestone.<br />
<br />
My make poison just hit 192.  Why is that important?  I have a geerlok, so with that, my poison making skill is 201.<br />
<br />
While advanced poisons are a real PITA (like a lot of high level TSs are) this is quite fun.  There's nothing like quaffing down my bite of shissar poison and procing an extra 75DD (plus a 115proc from my backstabber, and soon to have a 40DD aug for my offhand) With an unbuffed dex of about 190-200, I'm procing like you'd never believe.<br />
<br />
And the best part? Posion making is trainable with my guildmaster (don't hate me, please??).  Along with the occasional skillup while adventuring (I don't pre-make poisons, but I do have 3 backpacks and a fletching kit full of ingredients), I'm alsways making them on the go and I am extra happy to see a skillup.<br />
<br />
I just can't wait to get my GM's vial.  Summon coffin bottles, make 10 dose poisons.   :love:  :angel:</div></div><hr />
