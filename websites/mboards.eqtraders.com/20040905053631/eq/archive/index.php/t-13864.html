<br />
Anyone know where you can get the thread?  I know you can get the shell easy in natimbi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">D'oh!  I should write stuff down.  I think I saw the threads on a &quot;general supplies&quot; merchant near the rear of the ship last night.  In any case, the threads are sold by some merchant(s) on the ship.  Use the Find command to locate them.  The map is also very detailed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you can get the tread from the tailoring merchants on the boat. they are in a building on the west side of the ship.</div></div><hr />

you can get the tread from the tailoring merchants on the boat. they are in a building on the west side of the ship. Yes, in a small cabin on the deck.<br />
<br />
A side note... some of the general merchants have an nice instant-click invisibility potion for sale for about 3 plats -- good alternative to cloudy potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">3pp insta click invis?  good replacement of cloudy potions.  what does it cost to make one?  i imagine at least 3pp for anything alchemy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lelyia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">thanks!  it was almost 5 am and I said screw looking for them as I couldn't find them listed anywhere in the abysmal sea page.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KletianTellah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I know you can get the shell easy in natimbi<br />
I've had no end of trouble getting the shell.  Mobs hit way too hard for greens and all I see are damaged and iridescent shells (they don't work ended up with npc eating threads + jc kit when I tried damaged version)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Same here ... Can't solo the turtles and haven't been able to catch an regular shells on the vendors.<br />
<br />
Would you be so kind as to provide the exact name of the shell?  and are they no-drop?<br />
<br />
Thanks :)   Did all 7 of the boat tradeskill quests (never clicked combine so many times in two days in my EQ life!) and the only piece I am missing to move on seems to be that silly shell.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Velaraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">cloudy potions work instantly too. the only difference in these ones is the price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Erikanudan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The Turepta cragwalkers in Natimbi can (very rarely) drop the Turepta Shell (no drop).  They can also drop a Damaged Turepta Shell (no drop) which does NOT work for the quest.<br />
<br />
Reinforced Jewelry Kit is a 6 slot container ... don't have the stats on it offhand, but managed to quest mine yesterday.<br />
<br />
BTW, the Reinforced Kit IS tradeable, even though required a No Drop item to quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Belanar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Anyone found a use for the damaged shells? I have about 30 of them so far...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>cannyar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">just curious, what's this jeweler kit have that my collapsable one doesn't? i can't find the item searching allahkazam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It has the ability to use GoD gems ... cannot use them in other kits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I could be wrong (and usually am), but I thought you could use the regular kits for the nihilite, but needed to use the reinforced one to make any of the subcombines for the new GoD smithing recipes - anything that uses a crucible.  At least that was the impression I got from the jeweler NPC's in Abysmal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You could be right to a degree :)  In order to 'refine' or whatever the raw nihilite, you need the new kit.  If you let the NPCs refine it for you, you very well may be able to use old the kits to combine it with enchanted bars to make jewelry.  <br />
<br />
I did get the Shell and then the new Jewelry Kit today.  But still can't bring myself to do any tradeskilling to test it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Amaruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Afraid your correction is incorrect as well..<br />
<br />
You can refine the Raw Pale Nitiline and do standard Bar of metal and Nitiline in a standard JC kit, I had no trouble using my collapsing kit, but when I tried to do a combine using the gnomish heat source and the crucible I got a DNC error. So you need the new Kit to do the combines for the weapons and armor(?).<br />
<br />
I don't have a reinforced kit and I have proccessed all of the resources exept the Clay, still have not found any of that on a vendor or in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>waldora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Are they going to introduce a collapsible GoD kit?  JC'ers were the only ones who got a new Tradeskill container.  However, if you read the lore in basic JCing, our kit contains all the molds we need...until now.   I'm hoping a collapsible one is on the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>alchemyshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">OK more specific information for those of you that are inetrested:<br />
<br />
Name of tailoring vender that sells Shimmering Steel Threads:<br />
Garald Samer (loc 48, 131, 115)<br />
<br />
Nave of Jewel Crafter vendor that gives quest:<br />
~Rilwind Sitnai (loc neg 162, 214, 100)<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
Make sure when you do turn in, it is a &quot;Jeweler's Kit&quot; and none other.  Can not use &quot;Planer jeweler's kit&quot; or NPC will keep your stuff and nog give you the new bag.<br />
<br />
Text:<br />
Rilwind Sitnai says 'Greetings.  We are busy here, and I have little time for pleasantries.  I can sell you supplies, if you have need.  I can even help you fix up that old Jeweler's [Kit] of yours.  Or perhaps you are here to [assist] me with my work?'<br />
<br />
You say, 'kit'<br />
<br />
Rilwind Sitnai says 'Ah, well, we've been working on improving our ability to work with liquid precious metals.  To do that, we've had to improve our kits.  We've made them a bit larger, and added some reinforcements to help them resist the heat.  I can make one for you, just find a turepta shell and two shimmering steel threads and hand them to me along with your Jeweler's Kit and I'll make you a new one.'<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps yal!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>SilverfurMangycoat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The NO DROP shell can be MQ'd. Did it Saturday night. Had another player turn in shell first, then I turned in the two threads and the jewelry kit and I got back the Reinforced Jewelry Kit.<br />

I also tried giving Rilwind Sitnai a summoned jc kit along with the threads and shell.  She gave it back, I bought a regular kit off her, handed it to her and she gave me the Reinforced Jeweler's Kit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Um, OK, I guess it is nice to know we can MQ it, but it is easy enough for the person with the shell to get the kit and then give it away. I did it for two of of my jeweler friends, and I have an extra to play with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>maartena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">This is what I found so far....<br />
<br />
- Raw Pale Nihilite can be refined to Pale Nihilite in a Planar Jewelry Kit with no problems at all.<br />
<br />
- Pale Nihilite can be combined with Gold, Platninum and Velium in a Planar Jewelry Kit with no problems at all.<br />
<br />
I have been selling tons of earrings and pendants with Nihilite without having the Reinforced Jewelry Kit. I did the Kit quest last night, bought the threads, and /ooc'd in Natimbi if I could loot a Turepta Shell if it dropped. I actually got invited in a group and it dropped soon after. Did the quest a few hours later (and a ton of exp richer) and got my kit.<br />
<br />
The question I have now though: I have not tried any of the PLANAR combines yet as they are very expensive and high trivial. I am lvl 44 so I can't get to the planes yet until two more levels. But will the POP combines still WORK in the GOD Kit? It would be kind of annoying having to carry around 2 kits for the rest of my JC career ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The planar kit you're talking about is the one that's store bought in pok?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>maartena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yes. <br />
<br />
And Yes again because it wants 10 chars minimum ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Mind posting that to database updates submissions.  I believe the containers for some of those recipes are off if you say you've combined it in those and I want to actually remember to check it, since I can't tonight as it's bedtime. :)</div></div><hr />
