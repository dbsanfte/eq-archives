<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Damudge Deeler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">EDIT: I found it on Lucy then to Alla. <br />
<br />
Anyway, woo hoo, I am happy to have 250 in something.<br />
<br />
Forgot to add: I did not know that you could only go past 200 in one skill without doing aa. I spent almost 4 hours with no skill up at all in fletching at 200. When I finally said something in guild, they told me about the AA. I wasted all that money and time. Oh well, enjoy the laugh on me.<br />
<br />
I looked for the answer to this, and cannot find it. I am sure it is here somewhere though. <br />
<br />
I hit 250, and in on my first combine made the pick. <br />
<br />
I see that it summons a no rent bag, but I could have sworn that I read somewhere that you could turn it into a non-no rent bag. Is this true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, you can get a permanent bag by going to the center bazaar area, where the smithing gnome is, and heading up the stairs. (This is known as &quot;the bar,&quot; there is a little gnome sipping Bacardi out on the veranda upstairs.  Hand him your bag, and you will get a very nice, 100% WR Bag, that is LORE and identical to the bags you get for every trophy, so you only can get one. Good luck, and grats on your skill and trophy =)</div></div><hr />
