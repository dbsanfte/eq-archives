<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, is it just me, or did they slip in the foraging nerf in this last set of patches?  <br />
<br />
What are you talking about?  There was no nerf...<br />
<br />
What I refer to is this:  I have my foraging tied to my movement keys, left arrow for foraging, right for autoinventory.  Make 2 simple turns, and the product is in one of my bags.  Last night, I was running around various zones, and 3 out of 4 times when I made a left turn, well before the forage button refreshed, I would get the message &quot;you must wait longer before foraging&quot;, or something similar to that, and then I would have to wait an additional amount of time before the button would refresh again.<br />
<br />
I have had this happen occasionally, perhaps once a week, or less, in the past, but no where near as frequently as it was happening last night.<br />
<br />
Anyone else experiencing this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Teedyo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think that it's happening more frequently due to increased lag; probably from the anniversary mobs.  I've also noticed that sometimes I have to mash the auto-attack key 2, 3, sometimes  4 times before I actually start swinging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>lonewylfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, think it's a lag thing, as I usually see it most whenever I'm lagging badly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Can't say I am experiencing any lag with my new system... 2.2 processor, 1 gig ram, new vid card with 256 mem.. everything is running very smoothly with clip plane at 25%, even in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Happens to me occaionally especially after a client crash or a LD. I find shutting eq down all the way and reloading fixes it. If not a reboot does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Theres 2 different, seperate things that people can refer to when they say 'lag'.<br />
<br />
1. Video drag, 'chug' or low FPS (frames per second)<br />
<br />
Cause: Not enough memory. Crummy video card. Too many applications running. Grimling forest or Wakening lands.<br />
<br />
Fix: More memory. Computer upgrades. Burn down trees.<br />
<br />
2. Connection lag, high 'ping' times.<br />
<br />
Cause: ISP overloaded, poor phone line/cable line.<br />
<br />
Fix: Well, there really isnt any. Whine at your ICP/Cable company, and they will fix it... when Tunare joins a biker gang.<br />
<br />
'You must wait longer before foraging' is from #2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">DSL.  348k to 1.5m connection.  Most times hitting around 1.2m on the connection cycle.  But, then again, they did just introduce the DSL into my neighborhood.  And, last night, I had no problems whatsoever.  Oh well.  Whatever the reason, I am sure it will come and go from time to time.  No biggie.</div></div><hr />
