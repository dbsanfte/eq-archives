I believe that the intention was that they would the same, but the lack of in game data from folks makes this impossible to figure out. There are several threads on the general board about refining and the complete lack of success (so far) in achieving 3 materials for a refine. Since you can guarantee 2 from the NPC, the only reason to do it yourself is if you can get to 3 consistantly in a short amount of time.<br />
<br />
I know personally that I have refined more than 40 each of several of the type 1 drops and still seeing an average of 1.5 roughly for the refining. <br />
<br />
IMO, if you don't take the guaranteed 2 from the vendor for the type 2 drops, you are nuts.<br />
