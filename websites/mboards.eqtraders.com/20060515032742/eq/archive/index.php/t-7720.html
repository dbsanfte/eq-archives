PSS. Please forgive my flooding of the current Fine Plate market on Luclin server, at what I perceive to be low pricing, just trying to recoup some of my investment back so I can keep progressing in skills.<br />

Slow and steady wins the race... Solstice Robes used to sell for 1800pp consistently, now they are below cost.<br />
<br />
Acrylia Studded went from just enough above cost to cover losses (when doing the multiple stud combines like tunics, pants, boots, etc.) to below cost. This just happened recently.<br />
<br />
The problem with dumping stuff to sell it quickly is that you kill the market pretty much forever.<br />
<br />
That said, Fine Steel probably has a limited market anyway. As you move into the higher end culteral stuff, resist the temptation to dump it, or if you do, don't do it in trader mode instead /auction it in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />
