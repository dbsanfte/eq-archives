<br />
Would like to introduce myself since this is the first time I have really posted here.<br />
<br />
My tradeskill char is Shakar, an Erudite Wiz on Povar.  He isn't 240+ yet but will be within a couple of weeks I hope.  My unmodified skill is at 212 right now and as soon as my wrist recovers from my previous run I have enough for another 100+ attempts at more Solstice robes.  I have alts that take care of the emeralds and chains so silks are my main slow down right now, but maxing out my skill is my priority.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I will let you all know when I hit 240 if you haven't found someone to do the combines yet.  Take care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilosh</div><div class="date">04-09-2003, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very cool, I look forward to hearing more from you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sitahn</div><div class="date">04-14-2003, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, hit 240 yesterday.  Made the trophie today with only two tries and got one skill up from that to put me at 241. :)  Popped a couple of ice silk caps off so that I could actually make something besides Solstice Robes (have over 160 of them in the bank now, /blah) and called it a day.<br />
<br />
So you guys can get with me or my other chars (Azumen, Sitahn, Shakar, Noggil) and I can do the combines for you if you still need them.  Just let me know. :)<br />

I have a **** stupid question.  If I manage to bring you everything for a Robe of Tempest, what would the charge be to combine it?<br />
<br />
<br />
-Lilosh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sitahn</div><div class="date">04-15-2003, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't charge anything for a couple of combines.  I see no reason too for something that doesn't cost me anything as long as its for personal use and not for reselling in the bazaar.  Had that happen to me once and kinda torqued me off.<br />
<br />
Donations are cool but never required.  EQ to me is about the people and accomplishments more than money, although money is nice, hehe.  Now I haven't sold many robes yet but I started this journey past 158 tailoring with 275k in the bank.  I have a little over 100k now and never would have been able to do this without having a large sum of pp to spend but I digress.  :oops: <br />
<br />
Anyway, I am on with one of the chars mentioned earlier a little each night usually plus I will look for you when I get on.  See ya soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilosh</div><div class="date">04-15-2003, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well that's the thing, see....<br />
<br />
I'm not a wizard. Or a Necro.<br />
<br />
And while it would be nifty to use the Robe of Tempest, on my 20ish enchanter, it wouldn't be efficient.<br />
<br />
I was looking to sell it in the bazaar, and that is why I am asking what you would consider fair.   I don't want to have you combine for me, and then feel decieved.  If you no longer want to do the combine, I suppose I understand.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sitahn</div><div class="date">04-15-2003, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't mind you reselling.  I have done that myself on some items.  The time I spoke of above though I did the combine free of charge (was a fleeting quiver) for the person ( and he didn't even donate), then 5 minutes later I see him selling it in the bazaar for 4k. /bad<br />
<br />
I am not greedy or anything.  Whats the standard other 250 tailors charge for combines?  I am sure we can work something out.  Will get with you in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thicket Tundrabog</div><div class="date">04-16-2003, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the combine is for a sale, I charge 500pp to 1k for a successful combine. No charge for a failure. Price depends on the value of the item.<br />
I don't do combines if the finished product competes against items I regularly sell in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
I don't charge guildies or friends. I seldom charge people who will use the tailored item themselves.<br />
<br />
The people that frequent EQTraders are knowledgeable and considerate. Nevertheless please make sure that you have ALL the components for a combine. For me, about half the time some key component is forgotten because the person didn't do their homework.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilosh</div><div class="date">04-16-2003, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I have good refrences!!!<br />
<br />
Sullee did a BD combine for me, and I asked ahead of time if he had the Vale Sewing Kit, and a Embroidery Needle.  (If he turned out not to, I have both)<br />
<br />
Munwin did a BD combine for me as well, and the same thing happened.  I made sure he had the kit and needle ahead of time.   Only difference was he told me (Well ahead of time) not to bother spending a few hours foraging for an acorn, he could spare one. <br />
<br />
And Similie did a Human Robe combine for me, and , even though I forgot he needed the Antonican Needle, I was able to give him all of the items to create one, and he now has a brand new tool. <br />
<br />
<br />
But in general, I always bring 100% of the items required, unless I speak to the person ahead of time and am told I do not need to.<br />
<br />
<br />
A considerate favor asker,<br />

<br />
Congrats on 241...that is so huge...I'll look you up in game...I'd all but given up on that robe :)  Looking forward to seeing what it looks like :)<br />
<br />
Edit: I too have a reseach skill of 190...and am happy to do combines free of charge.</div></div><hr />
