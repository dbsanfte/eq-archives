I am no expert at this but it seems that the &quot;hell level&quot; is not really a area where skill ups slow down but rather where the new system takes over. The new system takes two checks to see if your skill up was successful. It looks like that as you progress from 190 up, your chance of skill up seems like it gets better but the reality is that since most of the skill items past 190 is way higher than 250, the first skill check gets easier to meet as you get closer to the trivial. The second skill check doesn't change at all from 190 to 250.<br />
<br />
I don't know exactly why they made it so tradeskills have different skill up formula after 190.  I suspect that if they left it linearly past 190, the skill up after 190 would be way too easy, specially with higher stats people have now days. It is a delicate balance though, if you made it too easy to skill up after 190, then there would be too many GMs running around. I think it works fine as it is. <br />

Tried emailing SOE personnel or posting on the SOE boards? Sure devs come by here now and then but you cant always expect them to reply to everyone personal message.  Might get a reply that way.</div></div><hr />
