He used EQ as the subject of research in college and had put out some questionnaires that were advertised on a wide range of EQ sites, starting a year or two ago.  He now has a website of his own: http://www.nickyee.com/hub/home.html where you can find a bunch of stuff including the results of those studies and some similar research and complete the latest questionnaire, that has now extended to include games other than EQ.  A lot of it has to do with the demographics and social lives of players...very interesting stuff!<br />

(I'm posting this here because he has a note on there asking for people to help spread the word.  My only connection to his site is that I love answering his surveys :))</div></div><hr />
