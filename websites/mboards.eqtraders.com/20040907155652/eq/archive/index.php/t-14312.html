I am going to give a nice breakdown here of the rough cost to make them, presuming that you are farming, foraging, and buying premade woven mandrake root, and jum-jum spiced beer.<br />

So, you don't like how low the price can actually go before you stop making a profit?  You don't like how easy it is for someone else to make them and become your competition?   TOUGH!<br />
<br />
This game was made for everbody who plays it to enjoy.  Tradeskills were designed with the intent that everybody could do them.  People who did not do them before are now doing them, and are enjoying the game, just the same as you and I.  So what if they have an easier time getting to the point where they can do it.  You also have the same capabilities as they do, and can do the same things.  As the development team at SOE would say &quot;It's working as intended&quot;.<br />
<br />
I don't see any problems with this.  It just means I have to hone another ability that is not something set in stone with a point value in the game, and that is my own ability to market something so that people will want to come and buy the product from me instead of my competition.<br />
<br />
And, like a lot of people will tell you, if you are not getting enjoyment from doing it anymore, then don't do it.  Pretty simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, you are right, there is a lot of complaining going on, but to look at it from their perspective, even though the new UI simplifies things, MTPs are still complex, due to so many subcombines and different yields and such.  So 5 gold per picnic or 50pp per stack profit may not be worth the time invested, for these individuals.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think  anything less than 5pp per picnic is too low, when you consider all factors<br />
<br />
-value of the item (boosts to the stats + part of the Xanthe/Solstice earring quest)<br />
-complexity to make (yes, even with the new UI)<br />
-skill level required <br />
-time investment (farming, etc)<br />
<br />
As for the higher prices ….well,some people are willing to pay for convenience /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">do you have any idea how rare it is to find pre-woven mandrake on my server?  i have found it 2 tiems now and rejoiced.  do it for making everything yourself which is a bit more resonable most of the time.  <br />
<br />
i get your point.  i wouldn't mind selling them for 10pp instead of 20pp.  i'm trying not to go lower than that so i don't tank the market.  if people see someone selling for 5pp the next time they'll complain to someone else selling at 6pp they are charging to much.  i was charging 10pp and someone complained it wasn't 9 once.  it does happen.  <br />
<br />
you also forget that lower skill people need a little more to sell to pay for skillups.  baking is one of the few skills that pays its own way really well.<br />
<br />
i much dislike the people in the bazaar selling picnic baskets for 20pp.  i think they are just trying to confuse people like the banded molds for 80k so you think its ornate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Originally posted by eniamn <br />
do you have any idea how rare it is to find pre-woven mandrake on my server?  i have found it 2 tiems now and rejoiced.  do it for making everything yourself which is a bit more resonable most of the time.    <br />
<br />
I have to agree.  Mandrake is about 2.5PP each, so that's 5PP per woven, which yields 10 picnics.<br />
<br />
That's 5 gold per combine, 1.25 gold per picnic (assuming 100% success).<br />
<br />
Same with Jumjum beer, but luckily most of the ingredients for that are inexpensive, maybe 3-4 gold total, so you're looking at 3-4 silver per combine, which is about .75-1 silver per picnic.<br />
<br />
1.88 gold + 1.25 gold + 1 silver (rounding up) = 3.23 gold each picnic .<br />
<br />
3.23 gold (or .323pp) X 400 attempts = 129.2PP, double that (since it seems that you assumed 50% success rate, which is about what I get) is 258.4PP (or 6.46 gold per combine).<br />
<br />
Now take into consideration TIME.  The time it takes to port into PoK, gather the ingredients, which are in 2-3 locations, then port over to Rivervals, buy the ingredients, which are in 4-5 different locations, make the steel boning, make the woven mandrake, make the beer, make the cake and slices, make all the other subcombines.<br />
<br />
Also, &quot;free&quot; veggies, in this magnitude, unless you've bene collecting them for a long time, do not exist, expect to pay 1-5PP each for them in the bazaar, which will add 1 to 5 gold per combine, which is .25 -1.255 gold per combine more (adding onto the total of another 80-400PP to the grand total (So now our total is up to 338.4-658.4PP for the 800 attempts (or 8.46gold - 1.646pp per picnic).<br />
<br />
You can easily see how the costs can quickly add up with not having some of the subcombines or foraged items readily available.  Yes, I've seen them, and I was beside myself with that, but it's a rare opprotunity.<br />
<br />
I'd say for the stats, 5-10PP each is a fair deal, it's &quot;free&quot; stats, which don't take up any slots, and a stack of picnics will last you a VERY long time.  The most I've ever charged was 15PP each, and that was only when everyone else was charging 25-75PP each for them (which IMOHO is a completel rip off like most items in my bazaar).  Markey heated up, and I brought mine down from 5-10PP each.  I sold my last 500 at 6PP each and do not intend on selling any more unless the market cools down a bit.  Any that I make will be for myself and / or my guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, you want to figure in your &quot;time&quot;, it's going to take you all of an hour to make 200 attempts, between 2 zones, bazaar and SH.<br />
Say your time is worth 500pp an hour, which is really not that bad.  You sell them for 5p each, you are still making 1kpp profit.<br />
<br />
you also forget that lower skill people need a little more to sell to pay for skillups. baking is one of the few skills that pays its own way really well.<br />
<br />
It is a skill up route to begin with, which would be considered research and development.  You are not supposed to be making money during this time, look at tailoring(acrylia studded masks selling for 10pp, which cost 125p-175p if you buy all the components in the bazaar).  At a skill of about 230, they will start making a profit and recouping their losses.<br />
<br />
Currently, the market on Povar is supporting between 9p-15p per picnic.  I have personally sold mine as low as 6pp each, while I was skilling up.<br />
<br />
Yes, it is a complex item involving many sub-combines(HMPs take 3 times as many subcombines for the same amount of total combine).  It used to take me 2.5 hrs to make 200 combines originally, now, it takes about an hour or less.  Time is not the factor in this that it once used to be, you can do twice the amount of combines in almost 1/3 of the time.<br />
<br />
So, the next time you see someone selling them for 2pp each, buy them out and re-sell them for 5pp.  They made the profit that they thought it was worth to them, you spent 800pp(400 picnics), you made 1200pp and the only time you spent was while your time while in trader mode.</div></div><hr />

Nice analysis Rewde.  Hope the wife is doing well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just a quick note.  You can buy Jumjum stalks in the Lost Turnip, but you'll need to do a bit of faction work.<br />
<br />
To get to the Lost Turnip, zone into Shadow Haven from the Nexus.  When you arrive, you're on a cross-shaped walk in a pool.  Turn south, and travel down the tunnel you see, passing under the walkway.  A short way down that tunnel, you'll see the door on the right side.  There's even an oven in case the one by the half-elven baking merchant is occupied.<br />
<br />
To get your faction up to buy, do the &quot;register for trading&quot; quest given by Trade Commisioner Henry.  With a bit of luck, a first level character can make the trip through Echo Caverns (just hope you don't encounter a needlite, and you'll be golden).  Once you have the Amulet of the Haven, put it on, and Alorob will be happy to do business with you.  This is great news for those KOS in Rivervale.<br />

Happy baking!<br />

Set your trader up to sell while you are sleeping or at work.  You don't have to sell during your playing time.  IF you choose to do so, that is your perogative, and should not factor into cost of a finished produt.  For that matter, no time spent in the bazaar trying to sell your wares should factor into the price of an object.<br />

As for out of game costs, hey, if someone has a second account to run their trader bot 24/7, that is their choice, it is not a prerequisite for playing this game.<br />

I've actually found that my prime play times (6-10PM CST) are really lousy times to sell.  I keep my bazaar trader up and have found that during the day (5AM-6PM CST) is a great time to sell, and nights (10PM-5AM CST) are ok, but not great - the times correspond to when I go to sleep (10PM) and head out ofthe house for the day (5AM), YMMV and all that.</div></div><hr />

Like I said before, I will make them until it isn't worth my time anymore.  And prices are NOT 9-10 pp each on most servers (which is what I used to sell them for consistently versus the 20-50 pp each they were always for sale at from others) I would be willing to bet.  It's at 5 pp low regularly now on my server.  /shrug  I still don't know why people decide to undercut personally.  Others will match your price, and then everyone is making less money on things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to take exception to this. As selling time is a constraint on the resources of the person doing the selling, it is perfectly acceptable to factor it in to the price. I suspect that the way that this will happen for most people is that it will drive the price down rather than up, since they will want to get rid of the merchandise and get on to doing all that supposedly &quot;fun&quot; stuff that I'm told exists outside of merchant mining and trade skilling.<br />
<br />
Also, for those who have the patience to auction or the DSL to leave their trader on 24/7, then they have every right to charge more, since they are choosing to trade their time for a larger return on investment.<br />
<br />
The wonderful thing about a free market is that if it turns out that they value their time above what the market is willing to support then a) they won't sell their goods at the price they would like to and b) this will probably lead them to remove themselves from the market.<br />

however you were figuring, though, it still looks a lot more profitable than I thought, without doing my own math. I did my first run in the new UI after reading this thread, in fact!<br />
<br />
and to kiatek who doesn't understand undercutters, it should be easy to understand for you, since you charging 9-10 p each when others were charging 20-50 each, is undercutting =)<br />

i firmly believe in a free market, just wishing i had more room in my inventory to buy up all the stuff folks dump for so far below cost...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope.  Here is the figuring:<br />
<br />
(xcombines*yield)*success rate<br />
<br />
so:<br />
<br />
(200*4)*50% =400<br />
 <br />
the most success I personally have seen was 54% for a total yield of 432 picnics out of a run of 200 combines.</div></div><hr />
