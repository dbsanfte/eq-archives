<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xabu Temrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I have been looking at upgrading my armor to Clockwork Observer gear for the added AC and clickable skills. Currently I have a few pieces of Underfoot Platemail Armor, and the rest is so so.<br />
<br />
The question I am trying to decide is whether to try and skill up to make the armor myself, or contact a high level tinker on Cazic Thule, to build it for me. My current Tinkering skill is a 145, so with trivials over 250 I know it will be some time before I could build my skill that high. Of course with my relatively low account balance I am probably going to be saving for a fair bit of time to just buy it ourtright. I can use my rogue, Doover, to try and farm the Porous Mineral Blocks, but often find myself slaughtering all of Neth to do it which doesn't make the midbies too happy. I've kept Xabu there sometimes to cleric buff the midbies in exchange for pieces they loot, but it is very slow going.<br />
<br />
All input, for and against, is greatly appreciated. Also, for you CT tinkers, what is our going rate on Clockwork Observer armor?<br />
<br />
(Editted to correct the trivial level of Clockwork Observer armor and correct name of resource from Neth)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless (and this is the only unless), you really, really enjoy tinkering and know that the road ahead goes uphill real fast (i.e., skill ups slow down immensely and the cost per combine is huge).<br />
<br />
But it sounds like you have limited funds to be begin with...<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm sorry for sounding so down on this, but I have 1750 in all tradeskills and have been working on tinkering on my enchanter (239 baby!). I would put tinkering at #2 for difficulty, right under tailoring.<br />
<br />
That is, extremely difficult, time intensive, click intensive, plat intensive. Fun stuff. /nod<br />
<br />
(I never want to see PoI again).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As long as tinkering gives Chenier a reason to keep posting Ms. Bromser here, I have to say I am ambivalent about her tinkering skill ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dannbu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Clockwork observer armor isnt bad but a pain to farm the drops in WL. I made a set for my SK. It is just a time consuming set to complete</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kritta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Like stated, tinker only if you want to tinker - not just to make one set of armor. :)<br />
<br />
Personally on E'Ci I sell the tunics for 12k and all other pieces for 5k each. They are a PIA to farm and the time it takes to skill up and such would be a complete waste of time and energy if you only wanted the product and not the ability.<br />
<br />
Either way, good luck =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If they are xp mobs, go farm the components yourself. Im sure you could find a 250 GM tinkerer who will do combines for you at a reduced rate, or offer you credit for certain parts (can you say Haze Panther Eyes?) so they wont have to go farm the stuff themselves.<br />
You also get other nice sellable items there, skins for tailoring, foraged yew leaves etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xabu Temrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the input everyone. I think I'm going to look into collecting what ingredients I can and having one of CT's fine GM tinkers make it for me. I do enjoy tinkering, but also enjoy spelunking with my family and friends, and since I am already levels behind them I can only imagine I would fall that much farther behind if I paused to work as dilligently on tinkering as those of you who have worked so hard to obtain GM status.<br />
<br />
I know, in the end, I could improve my monetary status by building this skill up and tinkering religiously, but at this point in my adventuring career I honestly don't see myself doing it. With that in mind, I will begin to see what ingredients I can obtain and try and connect with someone on CT. The only GM tinker I already know on CT is Ykina, but I'm not sure if she is still around these days as I have just returned to game after a few months away.</div></div><hr />

1750 x 7 = 12,250 ... ?!?<br />
<br />
Do we have a new club here? &lt; evil grin &gt;<br />
<br />
I miss my devilish smiley :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ixiola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yup, I'm around.  My alts are Ykina, Ixiola, Anayarie, Xenkina, Karella, Ixiie, and Korinya.  But usually I'm on as Ykina...1 blue to ding and ability to cast Virtue.  Woohoo!</div></div><hr />
