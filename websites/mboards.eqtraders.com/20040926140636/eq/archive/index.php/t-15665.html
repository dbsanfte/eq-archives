<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MissV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've never done it myself but decided to start doing it. Now, I've heard that vendors no longer have anything not displayed in their inventory. Is this true?<br />
<br />
I have also heard that vendors displaying a blue diamond would never have more than one due to a bug. I know this to be wrong for I have bought 2 at a time from a vendor very recently. So is there a bug that causes this to happen with anything?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Liwsa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Vendors now only sell what they have showing.  If all of their free slots are filled with items then anything else sold to them poofs and is gone forever.  <br />
<br />
No you can still buy more then one blue diamond.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>papyscott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I see this as good news for vendor mining.  You can buy them out of something cheap and sell them something you are interested in.<br />
<br />
As long as no one else comes along and buys what you planted on the vendor, the vendor will now start collecting the item you are looking for.<br />
<br />
This has worked great trying to get components for LoY robes. :D <br />
<br />
I call it vendor 'fishing' or vendor 'seeding' or 'planting'<br />

Heh I posted about this on my servers soapbox complaining about people buying seed items off of high traffice vendors Got a very mixed reception.<br />
<br />
Partly it is due to the fact that most people don't seem to know that when a merchant is full now anything you sell to them goes poof.<br />
<br />
I have had to repeat that part multiple times in the thread.<br />

<br />
If someone is selling BDs to a vendor, full or not, they obviously dont care if they go poof or not. <br />
<br />
If they were worried about them being used, they would sell them in the bazaar for more money then a vendor would give them and theyd be in the hands of a tradeskiller who needs them.<br />
<br />
They just want the fast plat.</div></div><hr />

Aye, though not many appropriate ways to handle a group split when gems are involved.  Speed is usually the essence there.  Sometimes I've seen it offered to the group as a /ran, sometimes I've seen it offered if anyone wants to buy at vendor purchase price, but most times they get sold like cash along with everything else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ahh but thats not the argument they were making. They wanted to know why I simply didn't vendor mine to uncover the hidden BD's that the merchant had in his under the counter stock. I. E. the hidden inventory slots.<br />
<br />
Which of course are not there any longer and have not been there for some time. There were several people pointing this out in the thread and I had to repeatedly post that no there are no longer any hidden inventory slots and that what you see on a merchant is all that is available.<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally my complaint was not about people selling BD's to merchants but people buying the seed BD I or others had left there.<br />
<br />
Hopefull the rotating stock Idea will fix some of this problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Merts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just in case some weren't aware, vendors used to have only about 20 slots, anything else sold to them would still be on the vendor but not be shown. <br />
<br />
To get to the hidden items you could buy out one of the slots, exit the vendor, and re-click on him and the next item would now show up.<br />
<br />
Then there was a patch that simply increased his space to show everything he was holding, they added about 70 iirc.<br />
<br />
Now, anything sold past his visible inventory simply poofs.<br />
<br />
Also, seeding just doesn't seem to work as well as it used to, there are much more people doing tradeskills today, a lot of that is due to the aid gimmel quest.  Anytime i try seeding, the next day it is gone usually, i have just quit trying to seed merchants as it usually just means i lost my seed.<br />
<br />
It worked more when you couldn't see all the merchants inventory slots, because only &quot;you&quot; knew which merchant had the seed, and anyone else wanting to try it just had to gamble and buy a ton of junk just to even see if theres anything there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>menssia01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have to say that is all I do apart from tradeskilling... I gave up over a year ago exping and doing the grind thing..<br />
Even after the 10 slots that were hidden became visable, I have still managed to make a far wack of pp. (from a parser  I have had about 2million pp pass thru my characters..and that is only since the bazar went live)<br />
What someone else see's as junk eg.. BD's ...Other people need, sooooo I just become the middle person without blowing the price sky high..<br />
<br />
I clear merchant mainly 2 times a day (depending on if its a frequecntly used one..sometimes upto 5)..Cost me anywhere from 1k to 3 k to clear, but easily make up for it with big &quot;finds&quot;.<br />
<br />
My character is not flagged for ANY planes.. not even PoJ but has managed to make a fair few planer items which in pays for tradeskilling/clothing my partners char..(apart from HG he has never had to farm for pp ..lol).<br />
<br />
So to answer, if you have the time and learn what is good/bad/sells for pp and what is needed in the market then go for it.. Take an extra 30sec when selling to a merchant..you just never know what you might find...<br />
<br />
Happy digging!!! :) <br />

<br />
Well, while I don't seed either if I find what appears to be someone elses seed I will replace it after i've cleaned out the vendor.<br />
<br />
That said, if someone seeds a BD or other such bazaar valuable item then they are just asking for someone to come up behind them and snaffle it.</div></div><hr />

It would be nice if those junky cash loots would simply poof on sale, preventing the slots from being blocked in the first place.  Having it refresh periodically would be a good second choice, but it seems like that would take more effort/alteration than checking the item at the point of original transfer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Liwsa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My thoughts on vendors were always that new items should load from the top and push the old items down.  Instead of the item going on the bottom and filling in an empty slot if any are open or poofing, that the new item would take the first slot available for player sold items and &quot;push&quot; all other items down 1 slot or pushing the oldest thing sitting on the vendor off if the vendor was full.  This way you would not lose the &quot;good&quot; stuff as it would be on top for folks to buy but have the useless crap no one buys drop off and poof.</div></div><hr />
