<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kemie Dreamshadow</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 07:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm broke.  Well, nearly so - 7k on my trader at the moment doesn't amount to much when I am lucky of late to take in 500pp a night while spending more than that on my vendor diving for planar drops. (It's literally melting away.  :cry: )<br />
<br />
So, thinking about enchanters and KEI, I'm willing to make anyone reading this an offer - with 250 skill in pottery plus trophy, I will attempt to combine any planar pottered item for you for a fee of 100pp on success. This is for those of you who contact me with all necessary ingredients (including the imbued stone or gem) in hand.  There is of course no guarantee of success on one attempt even at my skill level, but no success, no fee.<br />
<br />
I just want to make some of these nifty things.  ;) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kemie Dreamshadow</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe someone paid me 500pp the other day to combine an Artisan's Seal... then had me stay grouped to watch as he attempted a Grandmaster's Poison Vial.  He failed. I felt SOOOOOOO bad! I didn't give him his money back, but I did tell him I'd be more than happy to do his next combine on one for free. ;)<br />
<br />
Sigh... typing this, I keep thinking about something I saw on market last night - a person offering Grallok Crystals for 3k and a White Diamond of Justice for 5k and describing this as &quot;all you need for Ceramic Gavel of Justice for just 8k.&quot;<br />
<br />
After seeing this repeatedly for over an hour, I finally sent the person a tell, commenting that seemed rather harsh, especially as it was not a no-fail combine, and NOT all the ingredients necessary.<br />
<br />
Suffice it to say I received in reply some very rude remarks - the person felt that since the gavel sells for 20k (or so he said) anyone should be more than happy to only spend 8k to get it.<br />
<br />
Hmmm... trivial over 250... one attempt, 8k plus... two attempts (certainly more likely) 16k plus... three attempts (not unheard of) 24k plus...<br />
<br />
People are insane. I'm attempting to bribe an enchanter I met the other night into going halves with me on Ceramic Skulls of Disease if he can come up with the diamonds. I have six glazes set aside but at level 52 can't come up with the bubonian blood to contribute towards the imbue, so I'm rather helpless there.  I have built up the most of that glaze, by vendor mining, but also have one justice glaze, two innovative glaze, one tempest glaze, and one war glaze so far.  I'm also sitting on three war wraith bloods and four stormrider bloods, just waiting til I can accumulate enough glazes for at least a 50-50 shot at making one of the planar pottered items.<br />
<br />
So if any of you non-potters have collected any of the items needed for these glazes, or can come up with the imbued gems needed, I'm more than willing to go halves on any successes or profits with you as well.  But I sure can't afford at this point in my low finances to pay 5k straight across for your assistance.  :( <br />
