<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Farnyr</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 03:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First id like to state, that yes, im selling leather padding for an attempt at a profit. Im not a smith(im a tailor by trade), but I am poor. So in an attempt to make some money, I rounded up about 66 leather paddings in a few weeks, and Id like to sell them in the bazaar. While I would like to make millions of plat off these 66 paddings, I know it wont happen. Instead, I would like to request the information from you smiths, on how much you pay for your leather padding. I know it differs per server, but im just looking for a round number to go by. Thanks for any input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torm Of Quellious</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 05:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been paying anywhere from 20-40pp per padding. Depends on my mood of the day. Check the bazaar on your server so you can get a general impression on the price. <br />
<br />
Just don't push it too much, It's easier to twink a ranger and level him to 20 with that 2K you're asking for paddings than it is to ask 50pp each.<br />
<br />
If you happen to be on Quellious send me a message and we can work something out :) You can never have too many paddings</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iwar_VZ</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 05:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can usually get quality pelts in bazaar for under 5pp a piece, I've even bought 5 stacks of low quality rockhopper hides at 1pp a piece once. As paddings trivial as low as 31 tailoring skill it makes it hard to charge a lot of plat for them imo. I guess though I could buy paddings at 20pp rate if I'm desperate, I seldom am though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArrakeenNaedShoj</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 06:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have never payed more than 5pp per padding in my life and won't. They are just too easy for me to get myself cheaper than that, between farming merchant mining, p/ling alts and freinds alts, and the bazaar I can usually grab them without any strain on my wallet/time so It isn't worth it to me to pay more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xorshaik</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 07:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like it is going to depend on your server... Your best bet likely would be to see where prices stand in the bazaar. For me, I see it alot at 20pp on Druzzil Ro, but I won't buy for that much, and usually I can buy as much as I need going for 15 pp, but not more than 19, and if that isn't going to work out I can get enough of the various pelts and spiderling silks to make my own paddings at or under 15pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abazagaroth</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 07:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I pay 15-25pp each. But I only smith high end cultural now, and that is a pittances against the rest of the component cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrron</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before the bazaar came out, 10pp per padding was considered fair on my server.  Now that the bazaar is here, I see them regularly being sold for 20pp minimum.  Too bad I'm working my way through fine plate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wyrmbane_</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would do searches in the bazaar for <br />
Underfoot<br />
brellium<br />
Mithril<br />
heraldic<br />
<br />
Etc.  namely, the Blue Diamond cultural.  once you find out who is selling it, you know who the smith, or the smith's bazaar mule is.   <br />
<br />
Send a tell to them.  Hi, I have 66 leather paddings.   I am trying to equip myself with better items.    I know the going rate for these is &quot;20pp&quot; (insert whatever your server price is....i nearly fell over when I saw that on mine), but wanted to see if we could do a mutually beneficial Arrangement.    All 66 for say 800pp? <br />
<br />
Sell the batch at a resonable price to the smith that will use them, and depending on the smith, you might get a bonus.    To help someone out in there low teens / 20's I would prolly go 1k for that if I needed them.    <br />
<br />
Just another approach if you don't want to set up a merchant in the bazaar.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sywyn</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have worked my tailoring up to a level where I don't need to buy finnished padding, I'm successful 9 times out of ten myself on the combines.  I finde that I would rather hunt the pelts myself or go to newbie zones and trade banded armor for pelts (works pretty well).  If pushed to do so I might pay 7pp each, but I wouldn't be thrilled about it.  Prices on my server  (FV) seem to go from 10-20pp each, but I admit I don't actually look often so it could be higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kuronekosama</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say check your server's bazaar for leather padding and see what the going rate is.  Some guy on Xegony is always selling it for 40pp.  If you even did half that price that's still a lot of profit.  Though being a smith myself I learned early on the importance of knowing a bit of each tradeskill, so I personally buy the pelts in the bazaar at like 2-5pp ea and combine the things myself heh.  The best places for padding components I've found are feerrot for spiderling silks. EK, Marus Seru, and Stonebrunt Mtns for pelts.  In EK the lions there drop MQ and HQ pelts with a decent degree of frequency are are fairly weak.  In Marus Seru the greyhoppers drop LQ pelts and Greyhopper hides, which for a poor tailor is a good thing since Greyhopper armor is banded without the weght or class restrictions.  In stonebrunt you'll find no ruined pelts, but it's not easy to farm sub 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">B_Delacroix</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have seen no leather padding in the bazaar on Karana.  What I have done, is buy up a stack or two of low or medium quality skins (5p each I've seen).  I have seen no silk threads, so again I buy a stack or two of spiderling silk (some cheap price).<br />
<br />
That lets me make a stack of two of padding for 100-200 plat.<br />
<br />
That being the case, I probably wouldn't buy padding at 20p each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fallwell</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The price for padding on Zeb ranges between 15-25plat.  Since I'm doing alot of skilling up, buying my padding can be a huge expenditure, so I mostly farm it myself.  I have bought it on several occasions for around 10plat each, however, but that is very rare.  If I was doing small batches of BD or acrylia, I would probably pay more.  <br />
<br />
Best of Luck)<br />

<br />
Any more expensive than that and I can go farm in Halas for 15 minutes and come up with close to a stack on my own.<br />
<br />
But I seem to be in the minority, and i don't make any of the BD cultural.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BrindalayShadowlace</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally wouldn't buy paddings at all either.  Though i did get desperate at a point and bought a few hundred spiderling silks for 4-5pp each.  As for paddings i'd start with the cheapest qualities and move up from the bottom of the list.<br />
<br />
The common price on lanys seems to be about 20pp per padding but even the way i do it i didn't pay more than 10.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KyrosKrane</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 01:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It occurs to me that there are multiple classes of &quot;wealthy&quot; people on EQ.  For the sake of argument, I'll arbitrarily divide them into three groups by level:<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Poor newbie&lt;/b&gt; -- characters who are under level 20 or so and rarely have cash to flaunt.  Most spare cash goes to buy equipment upgrades.  Hence, they'll farm rather than buy most components.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Mid-range character&lt;/b&gt; -- characters about levels 20-45.  They have enough cash to make a serious stab at tradeskills while still maintaining their equipment.  These guys will buy some cheaper components, or maybe the odd hard-to-farm piece.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Ultra-rich uber-char&lt;/b&gt; -- maybe levels 45-65.  These are people for whom anything under 1K is chump change, because they can earn that much in less than an hour.  They often have bundles of cash in the bank, with little other than tradeskills to spend it on.  They will happily pay bazaar rates for components to save themselves the tedium of killing weenies like spiderlings and cats for hours on end.<br />
<br />
(As I said, the levels associated are arbitrary.  You may agree or disagree, but the point is the three levels of wealth.)<br />
<br />
So, to someone in the &quot;Poor newbie&quot; class, paying 20-40pp for a padding is absurd.  He can farm the components and gain exp doing it!  For a mid-range character like me, buying cheaper components is a decent deal, since farming without exp is frankly boring.  (e.g., I won't buy padding at the bazaar, but I will buy low-priced pelts and silks and make my own.)<br />
<br />
For the uber-chars, however, money is no longer an issue.  Paying 40pp per padding is nothing.  5 stacks would end up costing 4000pp, which is not too much for them to blow on practice.  Heck, they can sell one of their spare, no-longer-needed weapons for 10-20K!  Hence, the focus shifts more on convenience and time-saving, rather than cost-efficiency.<br />
<br />
It is to this extravagant market that the padding vendors (disclosure: this includes me) caters.  I am very happy to find my paddings selling briskly at 35pp each, and my bone chips for 20pp per stack, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kradlum</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never have any problem selling them at 20pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaysha Soulsinger</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 04:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently at lvl 58 I have a total of 20k in my Bank. To blow like 1k for a bunch of paddings it out of the question for me. I buy pelts at no more than 5pp, Paddings at no more than 10pp and Spiderling Silks at no more than 2-3pp each.<br />
<br />
Since I own Planes of Power, reaching the harvest sites is almost trivial. For Spiderling Silks I hit Feerrott and hunt the Spiderlings there. Even while I don't have tracking it doesn't take me long to make quite some silks. A few hours hunting should net me a few stacks of threads at the very least. Same thing counts for Stonebrunt. With the Paineel Book just around the corner, Stonebrunt is easy to get to and pelts drop there aplenty. Doesn't take longer than a few hours of hunting there to get a few stacks of Pelts as well.<br />
<br />
I usually do these hunt/farm sessions when I have a few dead hours, where finding a group and exping just isn't worth it because it will be so short.<br />
<br />
Dunno, but buying Paddings at 20-40pp each? Maybe when I have like 200k in the Bank, but not at the moment ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kradlum</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 06:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just an observation... At level 58 aren't you better off buying the padding ready made? I would have thought you could make more money just general hunting/xping in the time it takes to spend hunting for a few hours in Feerrot for silks, and a few hours in Stonebrunt for pelts.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried Stonebrunt, but I grew up in the Feerrot. I find better supplies for leather padding to be found in Marus Seru for pelts and Shadeweavers for Shadeling silks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">B_Delacroix</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Level does not equal money.<br />
<br />
I am level 61 and have 251 platinum to my name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xorshaik</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I took the statement a little differently and it makes sense as such.. At level 58 or whatever... There are mobs one could be killing to bring in the pp to pay for player made padding as fast or faster than the rate at which one could get pelts and silks to drop to make them on their own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xaanru</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My main is level 52, I have 80kpp in the bank.<br />
<br />
I refuse to pay over 10pp per padding, and usually won't pay that. <br />
<br />
I have bought as many as 80 rockhopper hides, for 1pp each. I have bought stacks of silk thread for 40pp<br />
<br />
When I cannot find these, I go hunt feerott for silks (can farm over 100 per hour with my 37 druid).<br />
<br />
Then I merchant mine for pelts, first in the newby zones, then the other animal type zones (NK gypsies, for example). <br />
<br />
In 4 hours, I can have 100-150 paddings. At 40pp per padding, that is 4-6kpp. Sorry, but I just won't pay that.  The risk/reward for farming those is just out of line. What I do is every newbie I buff, or beggar that hits me up for cash, I ask if they want to know a &quot;secret&quot; way to make big plat. Then I tell them about the paddings. Since I started doing this, the number of suppliers has tripled, and prices have dropped from 40pp to 25pp per padding. Even better, the componentsfor paddings are coming down to where I can USUALLY make my own from bazaar materials for 10pp or less each )<br />
<br />
Supply and demand, baby. If someone tries to extort high prices for paddings in the bazaar, sic an army of newbies desperate for cash on them  lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaysha Soulsinger</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two things about being 58 and hunting for my own paddings:<br />
<br />
- As I said, I have 20kpp to the bank (in the mean time less than 19kpp), which I spend on skilling up, mainly smithing. The loss I make on that is already high and being a Cleric, my options to solo mobs that yield good cash are limited at best. Gornit? Almost perma-camped. Rathe Mts? Same deal. Like the poster above me, I prefer to spend just a little time to gather them myself than to pay exorbitant prices.<br />
<br />
- Secondly, I usually do this in lost hours. I.e. like when I log on about an hour before heading for dinner again, or after logging in from dinner waiting until the guild goes to do something. I do this instead of just sitting around doing nothing while twiddling my thumbs. Sometimes the time you have is also not efficient to go LFG, find a group only to have to leave very short time later again.<br />
<br />
Although, things like fishing in OoT do require a lot of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BrindalayShadowlace</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh,  the generalization about types of char's couldn't be much farther off.  I personally ( a 58 SK ) have never seen more than 13k in my bank at once.  So i farmed for almost everything i could to get my smithing up to 188. <br />
<br />
Now that i've made my first 'sale' ,  a full visible set of enchanted adamantite armor with extra combines going to myself , i'm finally rounding up a bit of plat and of course now that i'm attempting shadowscream i don't even need it.   :roll:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chudd</div><div class="date">12-19-2002, 06:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">on xev people want 20-50pp each for padding, but when i make it i sell for 10pp each, cheaper if i know the person is just using it to skill up on fine plate. if they are making BD armor then i try for 15pp or so. i buy the spiderling silks for 10pp a stack and LQ pelts for 1pp and MQ pelts for 2pp in EC, nice money maker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kingbobb</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pay for padding?  I don't.  My girlfriend tailors, so we get gobs of hopper hides while hunting the caves in DSP, then it's a quick trip to Shadeweavers for shadeling silks (and swirling shadows for my smithing).  After about 2 hours, I&quot;ve got enough padding to last for weeks.<br />
<br />
I do wish you luck and profit, but 20pp per padding is way too much for me to shop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aarial</div><div class="date">12-21-2002, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I usually buy my leather padding in large large quantities.. Yesterday was leather padding day for me. I bought up everything I found that could make it. I was running low on furs. I payed somehwere between 5 to 7 plat for the furs. Bought 10 stacks or so. Then I found a ton of spiderling silk for sale to. 4 to 5 plat per.. Sooo I ended up with 200 leather padding I put together myself. Average cost was probably 300 plat a stack or so. Yeah I can farm it myself an have done so in the past. But it takes me hours to do it an I would sooner just pay the money now a days to get what I want faster. It took me 30 mins to combine it all down. Now I have a bag on my mule that will last me a bit ;)<br />
<br />
So I would say 10 to 15 per.. Considering what it usually takes to make em. However I pay 200 plat per or 300 plat per stack. Usually 100 plat per for spiderling silk, ect.<br />
<br />
Depends how bad I want it normally.</div></div><hr />
