I have roughly 5k to spend atm, and don't mind farming a few items myself.  Thanks for any and all information that you may post :)<br />
oh, edit here<br />
Figured i might want to mention I really only want enough skill to confidently combine my shawls once i go for questing them.</div></div><hr />

Otherwise Wyvern would be the next best for pharming. Solstice Robes if you dont mind spending 5k on emeralds and the gem chain.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailayla</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I have all my tradeskills at 180+ depending on the skill.  except for tailoring.  I do want to get it up there with the rest, or realtively close.  I won't spend alot of time farming, so odds are I'll buy most of the components.  I'm transferring servers soon, so I can play with RL friends. So spending money isn't a big deal.  I do want to get my shawl tradeskills so everthing is Trivial as my goal.  One day I will go for 1750, but doubt it will be soon.  MGB &gt; 1750 imo.  Think I should bother with it? or spend my money on other skills?</div></div><hr />

I noticed it's part of the 8th prayer shawl and trivials at 176. Maybe that would be another way of raising the skill unless the fur is just a PITA to find.  :?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pelts drop from about 1 in 6 hounds.  They also sell very high in Bazaar due to their use in the 8th shawl.</div></div><hr />

Acrylia is becomming rare on many servers, POTC robes may be easiest if you are amiable to any Tunare Druids/Clerics (although doing the recipe many times is likely to make you go KOS).<br />
<br />
I'm still of the oppinion you shouldn't bother with it, but one nice thing about doing tailoring first is that when you get done the rest look pathetic in comparison.   Even smithing.  &quot;All I have to do is farm greens that are most common in a zone that's broken?  Please, peice of cake&quot;</div></div><hr />

A little farming in Crystal caverns for velium(or fight in Velks to get it) and you can skill up on those.  <br />
<br />
Cobalt drake hides + drake oil(brewed water + foraged drake egg(western waste, skyshrine, or ToV)) + pattern + velium boning(number depends on pattern used)<br />
<br />
Otter caps =  2 Othmir fur + silver thread(vendors in Thurgadin) + pattern + vial of clear mana<br />
<br />
Wyvern hide + cod oil(fish cobalt cod from lake in Cobalt Scar brew cod fish + water in brew barrel) + pattern + velium stud(number depends on pattern used)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dvinn</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd try to get as many superb rockhopper hides as you can get.  Hunt, buy, beg, or borrow them until you get many, many stacks.  Then go farm some acrylia and start making studs.  I've gotten lots more skillups on rockhopper than on Velious tailoring.  I wouldn't ever recommend Velious tailoring until 210.  I'd say my skillup rate on Velious is about 1/80, while Acrylia is more like 1/15.</div></div><hr />
