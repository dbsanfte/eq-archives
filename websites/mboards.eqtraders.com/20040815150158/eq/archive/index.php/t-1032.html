<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mellen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My tradeskills include: <br />
250 Baking (Mellen)<br />
250 Smithing (a high elf toon)<br />
250 Brewing (on a non pop enabled toon - Mellen has 228 skill atm)<br />
228 Pottery (on a currently non pop enabled toon) <br />
200 Fishing (Mellen) <br />
<br />
Am usually on as Mellen so can send tells him most often (make sure you get the vowels right =p )<br />
<br />
<br />
Baking - I currently make Misty thicket picnics to sell at 10p ea.  for bulk orders (200+) I'll sell them at 7.5p ea. but don't expect to get them right away.<br />
<br />
If you need a recipe combined for a quest feel free to ask me if you see me lurking around in a city zone for but be sure to bring all the components (pie tins, pots etc.  included - I keep those on a mule sometimes).  If it can fit in a spit or a bowl bring one of those pls.  If it has to be done in a PoK overn pls only ask if you catch me in PoK (if you see me loitering in other city zones I'm most likely headed that way though so feel free to ask I guess).   Cash or ingrediant donations are nice but not really needed : )<br />
<br />
Brewing - I am atm making Grobb liquised meats to sell at 10p ea. and would most likely be able to sell them at 7.5p ea. for bulk orders (200+) but again if you want that many don't expect to get them right away.<br />
<br />
If you have a quest combine to be done, same conditions as mentioned with baking, but my 250 brewer atm is not pop enabled yet so if you want a combine that requires a Tanaan brew barrel I'd have to try it with mellen who's sitting at 228 brewing (+ geerlok).<br />
<br />
Smithing - Atm I am not really making any of the cultural stuff to sell as it is way to much of a pain in the arse to make ... if you want either imbued plate bracers or belt those two I think I'd be willing to make as commisioned work at a fair price... other than that if you want a particular piece then you'll have to gather everything for the combine and have it all ready to bring to me for combining.  Haven't figured out my prices yet but it'll most likely be on a per success basis.  Will maybe just copy Lalla's or someone elses  =p<br />
<br />
I do make sickles to sell, (so unless you're a guildie or close friend don't ask me to just do the combine pls =p ) price for ea. atm is 2500p ... I could probably go as low as 2k per if you're buying in bulk.  Bulk would be like 10+ and preferably only be done for suiting up guilds.  If you're buying them to sell as packages don't be too surprised if I raise the min amount you have to buy or the price.<br />
<br />
Pottery - Atm main things that I try to keep in stock are the Tunare idols and Stiens for the potc quest... pottery stuff (well pre-pop pottered stuff) isn't as much of a pain in the arse to collect so I'm much more flexible when it comes to making commisioned items and less willing to do combines that are brought to me (unless it's a quest other than potc).  If you want something in particular let me know and I should be able to make it for you for a good deal... as always though, don't expect it right away though =p<br />
<br />
<br />
Think that about it, will try to keep this updated as my skills, prices, attitude changes : )<br />
<br />
*** INFO FOR GAFFA TO EDIT IN ***  Got my pottery toon up to 228 after talking to you making some stiens =p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Llywellen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Llywellen - High elf - Smithing of 250<br />
<br />
I do single or bulk sales of mistletoe cutting sickles, and do high elf cultural armor as well :p<br />
<br />
Bulk sickles: 10 piece minimum purchase for bulk prices.<br />
<br />
High elf cultural: I don't do old cultural anymore, with the exception of pieces for friends and guild members. I do most of my work by order. You can place an order with myself, or my bazaar mule Holdernome.<br />
<br />
I will try to do small orders the same night (1 or 2 small pieces or medium pieces, or 1 large pice, such as a BP or legs), but I WILL NOT attempt to do a large order in any less than 3 days (2 or more large pieces with several small pieces thrown in, any order with more than 5 items is a large order). Large orders may take as long as a week or longer.<br />
<br />
I do not give discounts by number of piece ordered, but I might if I had a good run of sucesses with orders of 3 pieces or greater. I do give discounts to those that bring ingredients, and will do combines for an agreeable price for those who supply all materials.<br />
<br />
I am not interested in doing Acrylia armor.<br />
<br />
I do work nights, so I play late, but I do try to be available for the bulk of Saturdays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Reflan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Blarg is, raw skill, 250 baking, 241 brewing, 250 pottery, 243 smithing(new), 200 JC.  Those skills do not count use of a geerlok, but are my real raw skills.  I of course have geerloks, too, so add 5% for my effective level versus the real one.<br />
<br />
Will do bulk and guild orders appropriate to my level of skill at reasonable prices.<br />
<br />
Can do ogre/troll cultural plate armor(darkscale), including blackened(inny), fulvous(cazic), and crimson(rallos zek).  Can also do the cultural shaman armor.  And Tae Ew and all the regular stuff.<br />
<br />
NOTE: Am looking for various types of vials of mana, imbued gems, etc., for my own tradeskill work.  Can imbue emeralds with my 54 druid and jade with my rallos zek ogre in exchange, and am willing to do so at cost of gems only in exchange for your help with my own needed tradeskill items.  This is not a request for a sale or purchase of any kind.  If any tradeskiller would like to simply consider an exchange of tradeskill items between us at the raw cost of the items alone that might benefit both parties in working up their tradeskills or creating their items, please feel free to contact me in-game.<br />
<br />
Edit  05/29/2003:  Baking 250, pottery now maxed at 250.   Brewing raised to 241(can max skill with geerlok).  Smithing(ogre) now at 215 unadjusted skill.  Jewelry stuck at 200 for a while.<br />
<br />
EDIT 6/13/2003 SMITHING is now 243 raw skill(max skill when geerlok used) some further edits above to include new skills<br />
<br />
EDIT 7/18/ 2003 SMITHING is 250 _raw_ skill now; Blarg's skill has been posted at 215 for quite a while now.<br />
<br />
EDIT 2/28/2004 Wow long time since I checked here.  Raw skill is 250 for everything plus now I'm 200 alchemy.  (Can't do tinkering or research.)</div></div><hr />
