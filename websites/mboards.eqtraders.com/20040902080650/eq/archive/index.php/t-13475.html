<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ancalagon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">EQ Traders Corner is possibly the most comprehensive site dedicated to Everquest online.  Even with the problems you have been having, EQTC is a killer information source for all of us.  So please, sit back, have an ice cold Mountain Dew and re-lax,  It will all get back to where you are happy again.  Until then, do not let it all get to you.  We are all still coming here to get our information.  And some of us have even used the Paypal button to the top right of the screen.  EVERYONE ELSE PROMISES TO DO SO IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE, right?   :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mystrice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">$5 here, I'm sure if everyone donated then that would make Niami a very happy rich person=) site is worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if i were being sarcasticly dry and perhaps slightly jaded, i would say, &quot;if everyone donated $5, that would just about cover eqtc's bandwidth for that month.&quot;<br />
<br />
But I don't actually know much about the cost of bandwidth. I can assume that if I knew the number, I would cringe, a lot. I can only think that if they (Denmother-sama and Ngreth Sir) got into /really/ dire straits about anything regarding the site, that they would let us know. I would much rather donate money than deal with... ugh... /ads/. <br />
<br />
<br />
Denmother-sama knows full well how many /hugs she would get if most of us saw her IRL.  She knows she's loved, she knows she's appreciated... but sometimes, the stress still just gets to you. <br />
<br />
/hugs for everything. A lesser woman would have left a long time ago. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mystrice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are around 10,500 people registered to this site.  If everyone donated $5 to Niami then that would more than enough pay for this site.  Relieve stress, what not.  <br />
