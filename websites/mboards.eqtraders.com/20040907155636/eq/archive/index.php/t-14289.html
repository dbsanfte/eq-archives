<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">*Heavy Sigh* One day after a patch and the PoK merchants are filling up with seemingly endless quantities of saltwater tuna, saltwater crab, and cragbeat meat.<br />
<br />
I would like to see SOE adopt a FIFO (First In, First Out) inventory system.  When a merchant's inventory becomes full, the oldest item should disappear when something new is sold to the merchant.</div></div><hr />

It's bad enough that they took the 'under the counter' slots out, but now the vendors are getting all clogged up with useless items.  Take the newbie zones for example... rat fur.... sooooo much rat fur... but no spiderling silks... I know folks still sell them to the vendors..... I know it...... i think it....<br />

I hope it <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grozza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think it is a case of more people knowing the value of tradeskill items and not selling them to the newbie vendors. Since everything is marked as usable in tradeskills, they save them, look them up in the bazaar and realize they can get mega plat for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Anaxo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am loving the new saltwater crab and tuna myself, mix mix mix! If these sell well in the Bazaar (haven't checked yet), then whoochoo! It's like free money! :D</div></div><hr />

They don't seem to sell on Trib -- too many people fishing and selling to vendors I think.   I broke a ton down to the 1lb meats.  I could sell them for 3pp each, but no higher.  Since I can still sell CEs at 7pp each as fast as I can make them, and they are considerably less time consuming to make then the meats, I shan't be bothering with the tuna or crab again anytime soon.<br />

YMMV though, the Tribunal has always had an odd economy.</div></div><hr />

Come to Kane Bayle.  :D :p ;) <br />

I've loved the patches recently, I've been able to pick up MANY quality pelts and silks from my &quot;usual&quot; hot spots, and a guildie has been able to get some nice gems.<br />
<br />
But yes, the diving is sorely missed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sulkano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As far as th spiderlng silk thing goes..make a newbie iksar and park them near merchants in FoB with some cash...I get spiderling silks almost everyday from there. :)</div></div><hr />
