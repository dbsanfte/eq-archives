<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have just bought GoD, to be installed on tuesday.<br />
<br />
I am about to go on a big Baking drive to really push it up (currently 196)<br />
<br />
I have been looking at the GoD stuff and it seems like there is a whole load of recipies.  I was just wondering how they all staked up, is it a realistic skill path?<br />
<br />
Tuna seemed to have a nice spread of trivials if it cam be fished, how do the rest of the components fare?<br />
<br />
If anyone has done a good bit of GoD baking i would appriciate hearing your views.<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jarak_akn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did 0 to 200 baking and 0 141 brewing (and ~50 to 130 fishing) By fishing for ~2 hrs I had enough crab and tuna to do all my baking. The fact that the fish sell for ~5gp a lb means that they can finance all the other required ingredients. Total cost to me somewhere between a 10pp loss and a 200pp gain (I have not done full stats yet). Note I used the newbie quests to get Bake and Brew to 54.<br />
<br />
If you use only these sauces :<br />
Barbecue Sauce	<br />
cup of sugar, Ground Pepper, red wine, vinegar<br />
<br />
Beer Braising Sauce<br />
cup of sugar, Ground Pepper, red wine, short beer, vinegar<br />
<br />
Beer-based Batter<br />
cup of flour, cup of sugar, Ground Pepper, red wine, short beer, vinegar<br />
<br />
And these recipies :<br />
Meat          Spit/Oven XXXX Sauce(Brew), YYYY Meat<br />
<br />
Sandwich   Spit/Oven  Loaf of Bread  XXXX YYYY Meat<br />
<br />
Soup          Spit/Oven Jug of Sauces, Water Flask XXXX YYYY Meat *Player made Pot*<br />
<br />
Steaks       Spit/Oven Jug of Sauces, Spices XXXX YYYY Meat<br />
<br />
Rolls           Spit/Oven Bat Wing  XXXX YYYY Meat<br />
<br />
Then all the ingredients can be bought on board (Bar the player made pot) <br />
<br />
This method is probably not much use to you as you are already 196, but it is a very convient way to get to 200 (I think the top rolls triv is 207 ?)<br />
<br />
On a side note if you don't want to bother with the fishing then there are loads of tuna / crabs on the vendors on the boat as people are cashingin on fishing. This will naturally cost you quite a bit.<br />
<br />
On a second side note to regularly make the sauces needed you are going to want ~140 in brewing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fundin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I made about two stacks of Buttered Crab Souffle, but then I ran out of snake eggs. Got one skillup (192 to 193). Wanted to make this specific item, as in RL it would be such a yummy thing (and very hard to make).<br />
<br />
Think I will go with the recipes where I can sell some of my fish/crab to buy all the ingredients rather than ones that require foraged/dropped items.<br />
<br />
The one thing which disappoints me a little is as yet, there are no reciipes to make uber-stat items, just decent stat items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>chernabog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Forgive my ignorance, but I haven't been pay attention to GoD at all.  Are you saying you can fish ingredients in GoD that bake up to 250 triv, like Beer Battered Tuna?  That would be awesome &amp; may be worth the cost of the expansion alone.  Also, if you don't have the GoD expansion, but can get the Tuna &amp; Ground Pepper, can I still make the recipes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jarak_akn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not quite to 250.<br />
<br />
But from store bought and fished crabs and tuna you can get to 207 with Beer-battered Tuns/crab Rolls.<br />
<br />
After that you need at least some forraged / hunted / bazzared goods. <br />
<br />
The only ones you need are snake eggs, Vegatables and some clumps of Dough. (Souffle, Pie and Cake)<br />
<br />
I would not say that this is the fastest method since for each combine over 50 triv you need to :<br />
<br />
1)Split the Crab / tuna into 1lb pieces<br />
2)Convert the 1lb pieces into Meat<br />
3)Make a sauce (Brewing top trivial ~96)<br />
4)Sauce the meat (Top trivial ~96)<br />
5)And then make the food.<br />
<br />
So you have to do at least 3 combines before you get to the &quot;skill up attempt&quot;<br />
<br />
1) and 2) can just about be done while fishing (but you have to work at it)<br />
3) Can be done before hand<br />
4) Well you may be able to do it while fishing, but I think that you would need 2 bowls to do it (One to break the fish(1) and one to do (2) and (3)<br />
<br />
It is however a quite cheap way to reach 200 skill. Looking back I think that I made a slight profit out of it. (Compaired to the 1 to 2K I would have made if I just sold all the fish)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My one complaint is that the souffle and pie recipes only work with snake eggs. I'm hoping that this is either a mistake that will be corrected, or that the devs will see fit to change this.<br />
<br />
I'd rather not have to go farm greens in newbie zones, due to the fact that everyone is cleaning out the vendors' supplies of them. I have a few griffon eggs (foraged by one of my alts) that I wish I could use, but can't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Maddoc-the-Wayfarer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think it's a pretty traditional thing to be able to use all the different types of eggs when baking. The fact that these don't, is an oversight.<br />
<br />
I'll look into making these work, but it might add an extra step in the combine to be able to make them.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If using different eggs, will we also get different yields, ala clump of dough??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>chernabog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks Jarak, there may be subcombines for these new recipes, but not as many as the HMP's I've been working on.  Since eggs &amp; veggies are so common, I kind of think of them as &quot;store bought&quot;.  But I was wondering how far the rarer ingredients would take you, like crab &amp; tuna.  So, if you had the eggs &amp; veggies, you could get to 250 by just fishing the rest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nanndas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The fishing is the esay part. Getting the eggs as a poster previously mentioned is a pain. <br />
<br />
I took my Druid to fish and inside of an hour he had 350lbs of tuna/crab. I kept a few over 8 lbs and sold the rest. The stacks of meat goes up fast when you split it. <br />
<br />
I hope that we can break down eggs to their equivalent as when we make dough. The extra step would be worth it.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">By the way, I believe that the Beer Braised Tuna/Crab Steaks triv at 217...  And those are all store bought/fished.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Saleani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I like the new baking. Made beer battered hynid and cragbeast steaks till 222 on one of my chars, and to 200 on another. I have probably 3 RL months supply remaining of cragbeast steaks around. +7 wis food for wisdom casters is a nice thing (yeah it has other stats, I know). Many of my guildies got a stack or 4 of them.<br />
<br />
It looks like a reasonably smooth set of recipes that can take you from low skill to the 200s. If you can get foraged veggies and snake eggs in large quantities, you can fish your way to 250.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a strategy suggestion, whenever I am fishing or running around a GoD zone I carry a Mixing Bowl with me and do these 2 steps as I go. <br />
<br />
It's much easier, and it wastes a lot less time, especially when fishing. It also keeps you encumbrance down and saves slots in inventory, as there are so many **** kinds of fish and meat, and some of them are so heavy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Woot, can't wait to see if other types of eggs are added in. Another idea would be to maybe make the final yield higher if different eggs are used? A souffle made with a dragon egg is going to be a LOT bigger than a souffle made with an aviak egg after all ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zaephod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm hoping for the conversion recipies as i think they would be easier than the different yield recipies :) (based on what we have now seen in the Tradeskill UI different yields based on different ingredients requires a like number of recipies) Comversion recipies would add recipies but wouln't exponentially gorw the number of recipies :) (which is why i think the multi pound meats get broken down to 1pound versions rather than multi yield recipies using the multi pound versions) ;)<br />
<br />
Not to mention skilling ::grins:: More combines at the higher skill is better for skilling than higher yield recipies ;)</div></div><hr />

Thanks Jarak, there may be subcombines for these new recipes, but not as many as the HMP's I've been working on.  Since eggs &amp; veggies are so common, I kind of think of them as &quot;store bought&quot;.  <br />
<br />
It seems to me that the things which are really commonly foraged, such as roots, veggies, berries and fruit, and the things which could have high-level tradeskills scampering around newbie land whacking things dead with a single over-powered blow, should be available on a npc vendor, if for no other reason then 1) not every tradeskiller can forage, and many are forced to create alts specifically to forage for them, and 2) why not leave the newbie mobs for the newbies?  Other potential items these special npcs would carry could be LQ pelts and spider and spiderling silks.<br />
<br />
What about a quest that would enable you to do business with a specific vendor who carries only these sorts of items...you would have to do a turn-in to prove you were at least a moderately serious tradeskiller (say 150?) to get access, and the npc wouldn't speak to anyone else.<br />
<br />
Of course, as someone who has not one but two characters to GM tailoring in and one to GM smithing in, maybe I am just looking for an way to pull the rug out from under the highway robbers who charge 5-10pp for a spider or spiderling silk in the bazaar and 25pp for a leather padding...<br />
<br />
I know tradeskilling is supposed to be a time sink, but there's time sinks and then there's time sinks.  There have been a number of occasions when I have gotten so bored farming that I have lost all interest in playing, so I would imagine too much of a time sink can have the reverse effect SOE wants it to.<br />
<br />
And before anyone posts telling me what an absurd idea this is, and what, do I want everything handed to me on a silver platter?  Yes, as a matter of fact I do.  I'm an American, dang it, and I demand instant gratification!  LOL...I know it will never happen...this is just a flight of fancy.</div></div><hr />

Right next to the vendor with enchanted metals and mana vials, since not every tradeskiler is a chanter, right?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nanndas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Making beer-battered tuna/crab rolls or cragbeast/hynid steaks takes a lot of combines. There is nothing that gives multiples. Everything required is a one to one combine. MTP's and HMP's have a lot of multiple yields on sub-combines and finished product. To do 100 of the new receipes requires the following:<br />
<br />
Average 20 fish per 100 (5 lbs each) and combine them to 1 lb pieces.<br />
100 combines to turn it into meat<br />
100 combines to make the beer batter<br />
100 combines to make the beer-battered tuna/crab/cragbeast/hynid meat<br />
100 combines to make the final product. <br />
So around 420 combines per 100 final combines.<br />
<br />
Last night I did 400 tuna/crab rolls (meat was ready from night before as I prep it while I fish) and approx. 300 cragbeast/hynid steaks. That works out to over 3000 combines counting failures. I skilled up from 195 - 200 on rolls and 201-213 on the steaks. <br />
