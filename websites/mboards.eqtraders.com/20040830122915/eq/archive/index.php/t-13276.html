<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moomasta5000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hate to sound like dumb newbie or something but i keep reading and seeing things about Tokens?:boggled: :confused: <br />
<br />
Something new that has something to do with turning in weight reduction bags or something. Accually i have absolutely no clue. Does it have something to do with the casino thing that oppened in shadowhaven but then was shut down. Bah NM. Can anyone help tell me what thats all about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Heartsong_Steelsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, there is an npc in the bazaar who allows you to swap bags for tokens and vice versa so people can sell weight reducing bags in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moomasta5000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">HMMMM <br />
who is this guy and how does it work?<br />
Does the Token have the type of bad u want on it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Barbarian woman named Caerlyna (spelling?). She is OUTSIDE on the south side of the large trader building in bazaar.<br />
<br />
Lets say you hand her a Leatherfoot Haversack. She will hand you a Leatherfoot Haversack Token. This token CAN be sold in the trader bags while in trader mode. <br />
<br />
To get the bag back simply hand her the token. Make sure the bag is empty or she will return in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>couyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i am really glad of this, since this new way of selling wr bags, i`ve sold maybe 200-300 wr bags in the bazaar without having to spam in pok for hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You still have to spam, because hardly anyone understands how tokens work, and you have to explain it to anyone who happens to search in bazaar for something they don't expect to be available... hah :)<br />
<br />
I sold a fleeting wuiver token in 5 minutes flat. But selling haversack tokens is like getting blood out of a stone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaasper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I make haversacks in runs of 5 to 8 at a time and have never had the tokens on my mule for more than 4 hrs...<br />
<br />
It has made me a happy, fat, rich, hobbit. Oh and my tailoring is nearing 240 (the real max skill).<br />
<br />
The only people I have to explane how the tokens work to is my fellow guildies. I will never have to /auction ever again and life is good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>couyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i got tired of typing it out everytime someone asks so i made a hot button on who where and what about them. for all of those who dont read the news about what they just downloaded.<br />
<br />
one thing i have noticed about them is there is no info on the tokens about the bag itself. some of the sites like allakhazams and eqcasters dont have much about them unless you pay for a membership. <br />
<br />
maybe if someone is bored, has alittle time and knowledge of these bags since i`m still pretty much still new the game (compared to the years of others). would make a posting with the information on as many weight reducing bags as you can find.</div></div><hr />
