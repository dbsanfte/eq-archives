<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MatikaFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have taken the &quot;Trade supplies for Alchemy&quot; list and reorganized it by the supply name rather than by the zone.<br />
<br />
The supplies have been alphabetized and their vendor, ground spawn, drop, and/or forage location(s) have been listed under each supply.<br />
<br />
If anyone is interested in this list respond to this post and let me know. It is far too large to post here but I will be more than happy to email it to anyone who would like a copy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>myoung1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">please email me the list, does it show things like what vendors handle dropped and foraged items?<br />

<br />
The items that are both dropped/forgaged and always able to be purchased by a merchant are marked as such. To my knowledge the items that are only dropped or foraged can only be purchased off a merchant if a player has previously so that item to the merchant. In other words you are as likely to get a dropped/ foraged item off one NPC as you are off of any other NPC   :)<br />
<br />
The classes that can forage are ranger and druid. All iksar also get forage as a racial ability. Iksar cannot ever improve the skill, though. I believe they start with it at a 50.<br />
<br />
Hope this is helpful for you  :)</div></div><hr />
