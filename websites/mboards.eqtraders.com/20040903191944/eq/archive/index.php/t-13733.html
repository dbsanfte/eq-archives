Well, okay.. the NDA has been lifted, so here goes: The twist to alchemy is... Throwable potions! Sadly, I haven't had as much time for beta playing as I had hoped, so I only have the recipies for the 4 base potions, but the effects you can do are: Fire DD, Cold DD, Stun (!), Snare (!!). Stun and snare I'm definitely excited about. You can see all of the effects here: http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spelllis...text=concoction<br />
<br />
Sadly, snare is only 5 ticks (although to me right now, all 3 levels of snare appear to be the same, so maybe higher ones will get a longer duration before it goes live), and the top level stun only goes up to lvl61 mobs, but hey, this is on-demand snare and stun for shamans, or any class for that matter.<br />
<br />
The DD potions do not appear to be worth much to me, but may be useful situationally. The level 1 potions anyway cost about 5pp to make and do 20dmg. Can't really think of where I'd use that just yet. <br />
<br />
Here are the recipies for the 4 level I potions. You can get this from the book you get from the alchemy people there, but this is a little cleaner to just start making them from:<br />
<br />
Concoction of Flame I: Vial, Cork, Yellow Rheum, Cicino, Acaana, Flamewort<br />
Concoction of Ice I: Vial, Cork, Yellow Rheum, Cicino, Suranie, Seathorn<br />
Ensnaring Concoction I: Vial, Cork, Yellow Rheum, Angurth, Kaktu, Bitterwood<br />
Stunning Concoction I: Vial, Cork, Yellow Rheum, Angurth, Kaktu, Arroweed<br />
<br />
Trivial on all is 82<br />
Costs are: Cork: 1cp, Vial: 2g0s9c, all other ingredients: 1p0g4s9c each<br />
<br />
So you're looking at 4p4g0s6c per dose for these level one potions, which seems reasonable enough.<br />
<br />
I think I'd say my main complaint about them at this juncture is that they do not stack. :\ Hopefully with some complaining, that'll get fixed, though. <br />

I did a fair bit of work on the alchemy, when they first put it in, the recipes didnt even work ;p All the ingredients are available right there on the female vendor, with the vial on her as well(unsure about the corks, since I bought those from a tinkering vendor to begin with). <br />
<br />
I'm not sure what the purpose is, but the vendors had me make dye for them, with the ingredients they provided. Was somewhere around 300? combines maybe, could be slightly less since I wasn't really paying attention to see if the other colors had as many as the first. Trivials on first color was low, 48?, next was like 56, ending up at 82. Failures didnt really matter since you could always get more. Hand them in to the chick and it invis flagged you counting how many you turned in til you hit some magic number and she jumped you up to the next color.<br />
<br />
Ended up giving you the secret to filtering taolosian sludge and highland sludge samples, but I have no idea what the importance of that was, since it didn't combine with anything I tried it with.<br />
<br />
Each of the potion types has one ingredient that you change to increase the power of it. Conveniently, after you find out which one it is, its colored red in the new tradeskill itnerface. I liked that quite a bit.<br />
<br />
Concoction of Flame, you replace Cicino with various herbs to make the ever increasing power (ie II, III, IV). Belan does II, Berterine does III, Dinfuin does IV.<br />
<br />
Thats about where I stopped since I got sidetracked onto other things, but none of them are very complicated, plus the tradeskill ui makes it easy once the recipe is added.</div></div><hr />
