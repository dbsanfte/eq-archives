<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galadon</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There seems to be little or no demand for these on Vazaelle currently. I've sold one in a week, for about 16k- a price that hardly makes it worth trying!<br />
<br />
I know Vaz historically has been the 'Depressed' server, with prices lower than almost any other- and it looks like this will continue. Add to that the recent influx of 250 Tailors (we now have 8, as of yesterday), and the one who constantly insists on undercutting others (causing price wars inevitably), and things are a bargain!<br />
<br />
So, the purpose of this post is this:<br />
<br />
1. What does a Mastodon Fur Cloak go for on your server?<br />
2. Are they in demand?<br />
3. What do the furs go for on your server?<br />
4. Are there 'price wars' on your server, or do the Tailors generally settle on an average price?<br />
<br />
I'm curious as to the number of GM tailors on each server, but perhaps I'll save that poll for another post.  :) <br />

I have 251 plat to my name.<br />

I have never seen one in the bazaar. (Karana server)<br />

I have often had to do things myself if I really wanted it done.<br />

So, I'll probably be hunting for furs and making lots of tries at making one myself.</div></div><hr />

This is one of those questions I don't like answering because I don't like encouraging others to make products I do.<br />
<br />
That said:<br />
<br />
1. What does a Mastodon Fur Cloak go for on your server?<br />
Sold first for 20k, sold second for 45k, someone has one on the market for 60k.<br />
<br />
2. Are they in demand?<br />
Sold both of mine overnight the first night I had it, would sell alot more more quickly if they were easier to make, the furs were easier to get, and I charged less.<br />
<br />
I charge 6k per success, fails are free.  I've made four for others.  I started out charging less, but I'm raising my price to see what the market will bear.<br />
<br />
3. What do the furs go for on your server?<br />
1 to 2k<br />
<br />
4. Are there 'price wars' on your server, or do the Tailors generally settle on an average price?<br />
No, other than the 60k guy (he may eventually get it, but I wouldn't hold my breath) I'm the only one I've seen make them for sale.  It could just be they sell too fast for me to have noticed them, but I check fairly regularly.</div></div><hr />

One is asking 10k, the other 15k.  There are 2 people offering furs, one for 800pp, the other 950.<br />
<br />
Why even bother with it?  Luclin pretty much killed faction as an issue, and PoP has gone even further (is it even possible to lose faction with PoK?).  I had banked 8 furs before the quest came out, I'm not even sure I will bother to make them.<br />
<br />
There are fierce price wars on Luclin Server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sold 1, made 5 for people so far (and a few freebies for guildies and friends). <br />
<br />
Fur prices in bazaar been between 2K and 3500pp (so 9K-15K a try, with 50-60% success rate at 250 skill), so i would say 25K are a fair price untill the farmers lower their prices.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I make cloaks and sell for 32k.  They sell out by morning.<br />
<br />
I have seen others at 39k and they do not sell fast (several days it seems).<br />
<br />
I used to charge 5k or 6k per success, I am switching to 10k on success.  They are about 50 percent success rate, but this does mean that it is possible to bring 4 combines and walk away with no cloak (Bad RNG days.)<br />
<br />
I will lower the price when/if the farmers lower the furs, but will likely stay at around 10 times the price of a fur.<br />

Guess I owe her a few more OMG THANK YOU's with what you guys are charging.. wow.  A much less popular individual on our server with 250 tailoring charges a full set of materials per combine, meaning you have to bring 2 sets of furs/vials/thread if you want 1 cloak. <br />
<br />
Furs go for about 2.5-3k on my server, and I've only seen one cloak for sale and it went for 15k.  30k+ to be a wood elf is a little much, even for ME.. and I've wanted to be a wood elf cleric since like.. forever 8)</div></div><hr />

Lets' just say that I now keep one on my trade mule for 20k, and they only sell slow.  Fur prices have now seemed to stabilize at 800-1000pp per.<br />

Combines I do for 5k per success, NC for failure, or client brings me enough components for three combines, which we then combine til he gets a cloak or we run out of components.  Leftovers, if any, are mine.<br />

Hate to break it to you but you posting here had probably little to no effect on the price of your server. The people who REALLY wanted it .. bought it. They now have it. The people who want it but wont pay 40k are waiting till the price comes down. People who werent &quot;in-the-know&quot; about this item, or didnt have the material are now getting it. Some sellers are saying &quot;To make this was worth only 25k of my time and not 45k&quot;<br />
You posting or not posting information that was and is public to all on a message board holds very little influence over the prices of your server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wiggume</div><div class="date">12-26-2002, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">no competition on my server. I have only seen another person selling these in bazaar a couple times and its like 1 cloak they are selling. I usually have 4-10 in trader mode.<br />
<br />
Even as the only trader most of the time, I still just sell about 1 every 2 days. I charge 18k. Ill probably be lowering that price soon becuase the farmers in the game are working faster than I am. Fur prices on some farmers are now down to 1200p.<br />
<br />
I dont think the cost of the cloak is really the problem with demand. I think its that people dont want to spend the time on the faction, and a lack of knowledge of the quest or even the reward. When the price of the cloaks drops to 10k I dont think that will increase demand a whole lot. 10k or 18k to help get an illusion item is still plat spent on a toy (like a horse).</div></div><hr />

Indeed.  The complaint was on additional SELLERS not the lack of buyers.</div></div><hr />
