<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Danidianya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail fellow fletchers,<br />
<br />
About a year ago, the eq codebase was split, and one fork was ported to the MacOSX platform. This summer, SOE released Everquest for the Mac, and the first (and so far, only) mac server was dubbed Al'Kabor. <br />
<br />
So here's the deal... in August I started a lvl 1 helf-elf Ranger in Qeynos hills along with a couple of hundred other peeps. After months of diligent grinding, I am a lvl 57 (soon 58!) outrider of Norrath--highest level ranger on the server. And I'm into fletching. Since this is a new server, and since there were no character transfers allowed, and since the server population is mostly made up of peeps that have never played EQ on the PC, and since the total server population is not very high--though beginning to rise more rapidly, and since access to higher planes is kinda broken (we forked just after PoP was released--mostly broken at the time, need to do trials to gain flags and even then they dont work) there is basically no economy to support high end trade skills. Meaning nobody has 80,000K to drop on GMing fletching. My guild (Temerity--our goal is the high endgame) only has a fraction of that amount reserved for raid coffins (nobody, let alone a necro, has their epic yet--highest lvl on the server now is 61 and we're all pathetically equiped compared to peeps on mature servers--heh, I just swapped out my ivy-etched bracer I got at lvl 28 for a silver chiten wristband yesterday in Velks). You can't buy acrylia, you can't buy condensed shadow/fire/ice. It's simply not for sale. I have about 12k saved up, and I have bought nothing significant--basically because there is nothing significant to buy (if I--or my guild--can't get it, it can't be gotten). <br />
<br />
My only option for fletching skillups over 202 has been arrows. (We don't have Karana fletching, and Im a tunare half-elf anyway). So I farm acrylia everyday for 2 hours. Im up to 218 now and have enough in my bag for maybe 2-3 more points (just waiting for Boon of the Garou--only 3 enchanters on the server can cast it, and my fully self-equiped Dex is only 160--so that I can do the combines).<br />
<br />
I see lots of posts about skill advancement with bow combines. I'd like to get some feedback from fellow fletchers that have gone the hard route of acylia arrow advancement. In particular, has anyone ever farmed their way the entire route to 250--I mean never buying a single brick of acrylia or shadow... ever?<br />
<br />
There are many great things about being on such a server--my guild took down the first dragon a couple of weeks ago (Kelorak'Dar), Vindi remaines unvanquished... every day is a new first--but skill development is a pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aavar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the arrow route seems to take longer, ie needs more combines, that's why the bow route is usually taken, doesn't take as long but costs tons more pp.<br />
<br />
I commend you on your perserverence.<br />
Keep at it.<br />
You will get to your goal.<br />
<br />
Also Don't forget the Shaman dexterity buffs as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Magrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did bows to 235, before the sell-back nerf, and acrylia arrows to 250.  In my experience, skill-ups came at the same rate.  Bows are just more convenient since all the needed supplies can be purchased from NPC vendors.  Even if you're buying all your arrow supplies in the bazaar rather than farming, you'll still find that materials availability is a problem, even more so on a new server, I would expect.  Best spot I found for acrylia farming was Acrylia Caverns, the second best was the caves outside AC in Grimling Forest (and you'll get windstones, too!)  Solo farming, the latter would probably be better, but don't pass up the opportunity to group in AC if it comes up, there are good vendor-sellables and some nice drops in there, and acrylia galore.<br />
<br />
Infusion of Spirit + Dexterity = +105 to dexterity, fairly long-lasting, and can be cast by a 49 shaman if you can find one who has IoS (It's a beastlord ethereal parchment turn-in, IIRC, so probably kind of rare for a shammy on your new server.)<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Danidianya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh. Only one ethereal parchment has been found on the server. It went to a Druid.<br />
<br />
Only one 49+ shammy exists on the server. (There is also only 1 50+ rogue!). So the shammy buffs are not available. There have been only two attempts to breech the entry of Acrylia Caverns to date, and both were unsucessful. I solo farm the TM caves, and rather than risk losing my precious acrylia to my poor smithing skills I buy off decent smith time with the windstones you mentioned to smith shafts from bricks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">just post to your guild that everyone who brings you 20 combines worth of stuff gets one free combine if they bring materials once you gm.  guilds are powerful for helping tradeskillers out.  also the bows you will then be able to make will help the whole guild.  and for maybe 200pp you should be able to get smithing to a good level for arrowheads and acrylia shafts.  also the kelorek dar did you do the quest with the sea dragon meat?  get an 18 wis, 20 sta totem from the othmirs for the quest.  is a **** nice item for a new server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Danidianya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just a quick update. I farmed the acrylia all by myself; I farmed the condensed shadow. Did not buy a brick or chunk. Made my trophy today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">grats.  you 250 with trophy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Danidianya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Au natural skill was 241 when I made the trophy attempt. I had a geerlok, so I decided to try the trophy. Worked on the second attempt. I have enough acrylia and shadow for probably 3-4 more skill ups. No more farming for me! Now my skill ups will have to come fromo bow combines for the guild or circumstantial drops.<br />
<br />
Time to work on tailoring... or maybe brewing.<br />
<br />
I was surprised to see that the troophy yields no stats when equiped in the ammo slot. Do you fletching vets carry your trophy at all times, or keep it in the bank?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i keep 2 mugs of cha +25 for merchanting on me all the time.  when i get a trophy it will replace them and give me back a slot.  some prolly bank it like gearlocks.  i also keep a stack of water and my file on me too though.  amazing how often i need one or the other.</div></div><hr />
