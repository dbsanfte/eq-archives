<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tillan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would like arrange a guild event around fishing that is suitable for most lvl of players i.e running or boating from 1 zone to another to catch certain types of fish. Or fishing related quest. I dont want any 1 class ie druids  to be advantaged.<br />
<br />
any ideas?:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>menssia01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just a thought on this topic.<br />
Making sure all toons are lvl 1 (option to put newbie points in to fishing) and give them 15mins Fishing time in each zone you choose.<br />
Put them in teams of 3 or so ( Makes fishing alot nicer if you are in group and have someone to chat to.)<br />
<br />
Try and pick zones that have something unique about them. i.e OOT has seaweed, CS has Cod.<br />
<br />
Give people bonus points if they catch a specific zone item, and say 1 point per fresh fish...Try and stick to things stackable as level 1's are limited to 1 backpack..in other words those rusty daggers and shoes get tossed back in.<br />
<br />
Might take a bit to research where and what fish..Do a test run and fish a few areas as well as a safe place for a lvl 1 toon.<br />
<br />
Don't forget FV has different size fish too. The bigger the fish the more points they get =D..<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You could split it up into 2 separate contests, porting classes and non-porting, and no level/fishing level restiction. Announce it in plenty of time to let anybody get Fishing up that wants to. Give the porters 30 minutes, only restriction is no Fishing modifiers, and give them one point for each &quot;rare&quot; catch; the rest is worth nothing. They can go anywhere they want, but porting cost some time.<br />
<br />
The non-porting classes would require some thought on the starting point. Start in a non-rare zone, but have as many as possible rare zones nearby with the same 30 minute limit.<br />
<br />
With this method, you won't eliminate many at first, but you could play it like a tournament, winners advance to the next round, same rules.<br />
<br />
I'm sleepy and this is off the top of my head, my apologies for that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>tillan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for all your ideas. They have been a great help and i have a workable plan now i think. <br />
<br />
How about i split the guild into 3-4 groups, each one with a porter in each.<br />
<br />
Each group are give a Tackle box filled with some 'unmade' fishing hooks and   catch-a-lot bate..food etc<br />
<br />
The last group to return with a rare fish in each round are out and as 'punishment' have to farm stuff to make fishing flys with the hooks in the starting zone (Butcherblock Docks or Rivervale)<br />
<br />
The winning group then have a play off in a zone with the fishing flys made by the lossers and see how many rare fish they can catch in say 15 Minutes or untill the fishing flys run out.<br />
<br />
I would like then to may be finishing off on a fishing related guild quest or LDON fishing groups. Not sure about this end bit and might need more ideas for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep and improvements or idea coming.<br />
<br />
Anyone that wants to join in on the Terris-Thurle server most welcome. I will post the time on the Guild Website <br />
<br />

<br />
thx again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gnormy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">have sets of bones available for the winners so they can do the Brells Fishing Pole quest in PoK - any level character can complete this quest and giving them the bones would let the winner twink a character of his choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kcalehc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Another way to do it would simply to have them bring back several different fish.  Ie fish the 'special' fish from each of a number of zones.  The only problem is someone might cheat on this and buy some in the bazaar....  and of course they would have to not know what is supposed to happen before they begin to rule out pre-fishing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>tillan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well thankyou all for your suggestions.<br />
<br />
I have set the date for the Knights of Honour Guild Fishing Event. It will be on Sunday 2nd May and will commence at 7.45pm UK time, (2.45 pm ET). The Event will start at Butcherblock Docks. <br />
<br />
I will be using several of your ideas, and I  have also obtained the bones to finish off with the Fishermans Companion Quest as suggested. :) <br />
<br />
If any of you are on or have an ALT on Terris-Thule server please feel free to join us, you will be most welcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks again <br />
