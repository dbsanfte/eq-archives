<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ctav01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, is &quot;Becoming A Master Potter on 30pp Or Less&quot; still the simplest/cheapest way to skillup to 122 or is there a better route?  What about after 122?  This Coldain Shawl thing is making me play a lot of catchup.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have personally verified it for my guild leader.  Crow's Special Brew is sold in the Abysmal Sea, and it works in the creation of regular, lined and sealed poison vials.  I made one of each to be certain, and the recipes work fine substituting the brew for a pelt or skin.  It makes doing poison vials to 188 a breeze.<br />
<br />
For your skillup path, then, assuming you have access to the Queen of Thorns or someone who can go there for you, is to do claywater mixture to 26, then regular poison vials to 148, then lined to 168, then sealed to 188.  After that, if you want to go to 200 or higher, go with casserole dishes to 199.  If you're going to do casserole dishes, then instead of going to poison vials after 26, make ceramic linings until they trivial, and fire them.  The fired linings stack and you'll need lots of them for the 188-199 run.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh, I didn't realize it was Crow's Special Brew.  You can also get a limited amount in North Qeynos at Crow's Pub.  Crow's Special Brew is used in some quests.  I wonder if it's the same stuff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ZealSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm going to finish out casserole dishes and then level my enchanter twink to 16 or so (I plan to use pyrrhotite samples in katta, that gives visible aaxp to my 56 paladin so giving a few backpacks to my chanter will probably work well). maybe after that is done I will use the chanter to enchant other items in bazaar.  I got a lvl 5 bard safely to katta, now to see if I can do it with an enchanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samoht</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Crow only has one stack of Crow's Special Brew on him.  Will wait for server reset to check again.  I doubt anyone bought before I did tho.  Since I dont have GoD, this is probably best way other than vendor mine for pelts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samoht</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just confirmed it twice last two days.<br />
Crow will have only one stack with server reset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Luitchenstein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Can anyone verify who and where the NPC in Abysmal Sea is that sells Crow's Special Brew?<br />
<br />
I can't seem to track it down anywhere.  Any idea how much it sells for?  I am hoping this will save me the time of farming the bazaar and elsewhere for those zombie skins.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">1 silver and a few copper, basically a trivial amount. And it's on the pottery vendor closer to the doorway. Gotta say my little rogue is tickled pink about it :) cheapie vials and skillups.</div></div><hr />

This was wonderful!  I bound by the pottery merchant and stoned to kaladim (for water and the wheel, it was easier then hunting for it on the ship ;p).  When I camped last night Velma was at 193.  :D   Btw, it is no longer worth firing and selling back the poison vials -- all 3 types (not counting advanced, which I didn't make) sold back for 4sp each, 1cp less then the cost to fire them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lumenku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hmm, I have tried lots of peeps on that ship and I can't find the Crows Brew. .<br />
<br />
... ok I found him<br />
<br />
Malkidiv U'Ycionuz (pottery supplies vendor - use map) <br />
<br />
And you can buy lined vial sketches, and clay in the same room. There is also a poterry wheel next to him. Water can be bought off the general supplier (use map) just up the corridor and hang a right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Laiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just a note on the Crows Brew - some of the recipes are bugged.<br />
<br />
 It appears that they have Mist Wolf Pelt and Crows Special Brew swapped on many, including some of the poison vial recipes. It works just fine as long as you choose the mist wolf recipe.</div></div><hr />

 I dont have GoD, and the link to the post is MIA.. I am currently at 201 ( over 200 combines to go from 199 to 201 btw). Whats in the post that I dont know already. <br />
<br />
I have made a lvl 8 ench and gotten his JC to 141 and am making opal encrusted steins. I am also foraging like mad in EK for plains pebbles ( and tea leaves since I am a GM brewer =) )<br />
<br />
what should I be doing different, for ease and cheapest way to 250ish?<br />
<br />
thanks!</div></div><hr />

Correct link from above</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Milry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yes, this is sold on the Queen of Thorns by Hiloan O'Yviania and Malkidiv U'Ycionuz(just as the EQTraders recipe/source pages said...and what a godsend that reference material is!!) And it does replace hides,pelts,and skins for various poison vials. It identifies as Mist Wolf Pelt in the new UI, but its graphic is a jug(rather like Honey Mead). It sure makes skilling up a ton easier than it used to be pre-GoD. As far as my experience has been, the Queen of Thorns is THE place to be for tradeskillers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zaephod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It identifies as Mist Wolf Pelt in the new UI, but its graphic is a jug(rather like Honey Mead). Sounds like an Item ID Bug of some sort...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Lilirith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I just did 600 combines on the idol of karana...many days foraging.. many days begging for clear mana..and lots of pp.<br />
<br />
was 222 ( cost me about 15k to get from zero to 222)...ended up 235.<br />
<br />
does it get better, or did I just have a really bad run?</div></div><hr />
