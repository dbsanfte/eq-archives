<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was curious what is the minmum skill level in Fishing needed to be successful when making a Blessed Fishing Rod.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At 200 skill i almost NEVER failed. (I think i failed 1 out of 30-35 combines).<br />
<br />
Seeming as how easy it is to get to 200 skill, id wait till then.</div></div><hr />

I agree. Get your Claws of Veeshan faction to Dubious and head to Cobalt Scar (for example) and catch Cobalt Cod to make some good cash and get your skilling up.<br />
<br />
There's no point risking expensive components at a lower level when it's so easy to get up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>scarbrowed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, some of us are less patient than others. I bought my way to about 170 to 190 from my druid trainer, and rarely if ever failed them after that. I forget what it cost, but it was less than the sale of one rod.</div></div><hr />
