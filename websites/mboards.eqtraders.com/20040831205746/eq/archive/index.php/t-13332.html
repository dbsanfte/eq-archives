I just found out that you currently can not buy this anymore?!<br />
<br />
What a PITA to make this stuff!<br />
<br />
No more sales of armor for me....<br />
<br />
Is this a goof up from a patch or what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The &quot;goof up&quot; was that CVTs were being sold by the vendor for free.  The fix for the goof was to remove the CVTs from the vendor.<br />
<br />
They don't seem to be coming back.  It could be one of the standard &quot;quick fix&quot; that never gets &quot;properly fixed&quot;, or it could be that that was the intention from the start and they goofed on the removal the first time.  Or something else entirely.  But I wouldn't recommend trying to &quot;wait it out&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought it was odd at first, because I remembered the big stink about them not being buyable any longer.<br />
<br />
However, the temper was in the TOP left corner of the merchant window, ahead of everything else.<br />
<br />
The merchant is in the building behind the bank, next to the clay seller in the farthest room away from the bank....<br />
<br />
It may of been a fluke, but I definately remember seeing it and thinking about it.</div></div><hr />

i found over 68 on a trader in thurg last night.  sold to me for 5pp and change each or 118pp and change a stack.  i ran out of money at 68.  was in the bank off the guy selling smithing molds.  it was pretty far down on his inventory so doesn't look to be stock item.  the bazaar had them at 7pp.  anyone know when this happened?  anyone think of a good reason to dump over 68 tempers on a vendor instead of in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

Now personally I have several accounts and one is a druid that could do what you suggested. Even so you now have to make 4 stacks of CE's to every stack of Coldain heater so untill the new UI comes out it is a ROYAL pain in the a$$.<br />
<br />
Personally I loved the ability to decied that I was just too tired or my wrist was just bugging me too much to do the combines and go and buy the temper. <br />
<br />
Sorry this turned into a Rant... Good Luck and Good Smithing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kelandra Kindheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I noticed a bunch of CVT on vendors in the bank area in Thurgadin so I bought one for something over 5pp and then checked and the vendor would buy it back for around 4pp.<br />
<br />
When the big CVT fiasco happened you couldn't sell CVT to vendors so at some point vendors have started buying it. I assume the ones found on vendors were sold by the folks who filled up mules with it and are now going for quick profits instead of bothering to sell it in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mivio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">For sale in the bazaar all day long on my bazaar mule.<br />
<br />

<br />
And Please dont flame me, I am at market price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Its fixed on Test Server and I imagine it will be fixed on Live Servers on the Feb 10th Patch. <br />
<br />
:sing: :hyper: <br />
<br />
Well, my toolbox full of brown algae has now gone to waste, but hey it didn't cost too much. At least I didn't do the 100's of combines to turn it into CVT.<br />
<br />
The most disturbing thing I saw on this was a vendor in bazaar with 990 CVT's. Now either A) he was made enough to do 6000 combines (1 Heater, 4 CE and the final CVT) or B) he macro'ed/ bought for 0pp them all. <br />
<br />
B) is sort of person I am going to laugh at if/when it gets patched. <br />
<br />
I will feel sorry for A), but then I doubt there are many. <br />
<br />
But lastly, why do they want people to stop making items and instead buy the product ready made? I looked up how to make Fish wine, but even having caught the fresh fish, it was still cheaper to buy the wine than make it. At 5pp each, CVT is going to be cheaper to buy than make so why bother?<br />
<br />
Edit: :confused: <br />
The post my reply was to has been removed/deleted, so please ignore me if there is no evidence to say the CVT's will once again be vendor bought after Feb 10th's patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing I can think of is that whoever it was finished his smithing combines and was looking to free up inventory space to work on the next trade.  Though if he put them up for, say 10pp each, they would have sold very quickly on most servers.  10 is about the average price on Drinal BTW.  I bought 800 for 10 each, and another 70 for 5 each (I couldn't resist when I saw the 5pp price.)  There is routinely a trader that has over 1000 up for sale.  I doubt he did that many combines.</div></div><hr />

Heck even at 25pp per it was easier to vendor buy them than make them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bregalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Since CVT was made unavailable via vendor, I was still able to buy CVT in bulk on bazaar for 15-20 a pop.  My guess is someone was macroing this stuff.  Given its ~10pp cost to make, selling in bulk at 20pp one can make a tidy profit.<br />
<br />
I am at 216 now, and EVBs are going to triv in 6 more skillups.  But I figure I'll still be needing CVTs for cultural, so havng them back on vendors at 6pp is grand.  Though, I bet that macro-users with large stock of CVT are finding this less than grand.</div></div><hr />
