I am, of course, talking about Brodders Revenge.<br />

The Basilisk egg is the foraged kind from Rathe Mtns, not the looted one from lavastorm.<br />

<br />
Me: /sigh<br />
<br />
Seriously, though.  Try handing in Brodder's Revenge to the drunks near Lewena.  There's a guy on the balcony with her and another passed out in a back room in the bar near the bazaar zone line.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">WOW Congrats Splunge! No wonder I had no success whatsoever, I was trying to do subcombines, looking for hot sauce, tryin all kinds of things that totally have no bearing on the recipe. Specially since about the only thing we ever agreed on was the &quot;egg&quot; was an &quot;aviak egg&quot; LOL :)<br />
<br />
Something tells me someone took pity on us poor freaks for working on this, and pushed it live in the last patch without telling anyone.<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
Off to make some and hand it out to everyone in Shadow Haven...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Dont congratulate me.. i didnt do anything on my own. The recepie was handed to me on a silver platter.. in the form of the new tradeskill UI.<br />
<br />
Yes, Brodders Revenge was actually there in the incomplete database.<br />
I just happened to be the first person to realize it when it showed upon Test last night, and went into a frenzied panic running around getting the parts, hoping to be the first to get that.... bipedial carbon based pointy eared life form... the drink she wanted. /glare<br />
<br />
<br />
There were a few other combines that i dug up that arent in any database (here, allakhazams, lucy) cause they havent been found in game yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, it goes to show the new UI will kill any unfound combines. Good or bad? Well considering this recipe was so different from what we thought it was (I should say you, as I had no idea :-p) it means this has finally been solved. At the rate it was going it would have taken a miracle to accidently find it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Which means more quests can be solved, less redundent items floating about. Sure, we lose the pleasure of working something out, but gain the pleasure of getting something new :D <br />
<br />
So, any decent drinks on that there UI? Ubi customer here and don't think I can easily get into the test server (if at all).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Originally posted by Stugein <br />
Whatever the above recipe results in is a &quot;Test Server Only&quot; recipe for the time being, it seems.  <br />
<br />
&quot;The Basilisk egg is the foraged kind from Rathe Mtns, not the looted one from lavastorm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shows me.  I was using the looted variety I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lixivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">has anyone tried selling this in bazaar mode? i dont know if i am just bugged, but it says its up for sale but when i search under alcohol, or even just type the name, it will not work<br />
<br />
edit: i must of been bugged, i can now sell it on my trader, and it is listed as an alcoholic drink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Minda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I just made a batch of these. They are not flagged as tradeskill useable or even as a type of drink. I did accidently drink one, though, so it IS some type of drink. Got no message indicating it was even an alcoholic drink, but my AT is 200. <br />
<br />
I also got two skillups while combining...163 and 164 and then nothing after that saying it was trivial, so it must be over 164. <br />
<br />
Tried giving to all NPCs in Lewena's vicinity, but no one wanted it. Also tried the drunk gnome on the bed downstairs near the bazaar zone. He didn't want it either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kandrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Any other recipes that look new?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Velaraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">SHE DIDNT WANT IT! WHAAAAA!!! <br />
Of course not, Lewena isn't sick and in need of a hangover cure.  The halfling in the bar near bazaar zone is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">velaraa, minda (2 posts up from yours) already gave brodder's revenge to the sick gnome near the bazaar and said he didn't want it. <br />
<br />
time to keep looking /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">This is meant to be a hangover cure, anyone drunk it whilst drunk?<br />
<br />
Maybe it removes the effect of alcohol...<br />
<br />
AGHHHHH Brodder, what have you created!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Naeadiene Needsamap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">So Splunge are there any other brewing recipes that jumped out at you?  If Lewena wants a &quot;new ale&quot; perhaps the recipe is on the new UI?  Not knowing the name makes it tougher to look for, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kenamena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Tried giving it to everyone in the various bars in Thurgadin - no one wanted it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hum ... There's a passed-out Coldain in plate armor just outside one of the Thurg bars -- it looks like someone tossed him out the window.  He might be worth a shot, if you didn't try already.</div></div><hr />

Hum ... There's a passed-out Coldain in plate armor just outside one of the Thurg bars -- it looks like someone tossed him out the window.  He might be worth a shot, if you didn't try already.  <br />
<br />
Could you narrow that down a bit? ONE of the bars? Could take all day to check them all...<br />
<br />
<br />
Ill see what I can do tomorrow. I have all day off to play and see what I can come up with. Perhaps there is one more combine that needs to me done to Brodders Revenge. Or maybe there is a variation with 1 or 2 different items?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I believe it's either #4 or #18 on the EQAtlas map (http://www.eqatlas.com/velious/thurgadinmap.html).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Im pretty sure its the one near the mines. It also has the brew barrel (how convient!) I always jumped thru the broken window when I used the barrel. #18 has the dorf that runs out when the others chase him so I really think its #4 near the mines. Ill check it tomorrow... I hope he's thirsty...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kenamena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Yes I tried the drunked dorf out side the bar in Thurg no interest. Also went around SH give it to NPC and no one wanted it - though Bilkel Biddinight took it and said thank you, but then anything you give him he says thank you for. So I have to make another one now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Just out of curiosity, which icon does the drink have?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kenamena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Its a cask icon - no tradeskill flag.</div></div><hr />
