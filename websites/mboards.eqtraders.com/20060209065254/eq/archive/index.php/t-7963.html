  I'm a wood elf druid named Willain.  I'd like to set up a working relationship with a priest of Karana to exchange imbuing services.  I'll give you a stack of plains pebbles and imbued emeralds, you'll give me a stack of imbued pebbles and ordinary emeralds.  No cash either way.  The supply of pebbles in the bazaar is too erratic, and I'd like to be able to have a more consistent supply.  If interested, either reply or send me a tell in-game.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

I've just about decided to try Solstice robes again in my bid for tailoring grandmastery, and it would be nice to have a steadier supply of imbued emeralds.  I haven't reached a point where I need the imbued plains pebbles for my tailoring, yet, so this would be ideal for me.<br />
<br />
Look me up online any time.  <br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />
