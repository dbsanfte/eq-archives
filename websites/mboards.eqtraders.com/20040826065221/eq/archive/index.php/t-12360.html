<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Atlasius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">is it just the RNG or does pottery have a terrible skill up rate i got 12 points out of 80 combines and that's the first 12 points.  I read somwhere that the skill up is worse than tailoring but im skilling up more with tailoring an it's at 130 and get a point every 5-7 combines on the good runs :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>QuteCleric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A while back they made pottery skill ups harder to get(it was doable to get pottery from 0 to 180ish in an hour or two) sometimes it feels like they went overboard(especially if you skilled pottery up during those prenerf days :P)  Hang in there!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kelador Stormwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Last night I set up shop to do 200 combines on the Unfired Idol (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=4936&amp;menustr=080090900000) after persuading enchanter and shaman friends to imbue / enchant the required components... starting skill level was 223.<br />
<br />
From the first 100 combines I got 2 skill points, which I thought was pretty poor.<br />
<br />
From the second 100 combines I got single solitary skill point :(<br />
<br />
Cost for those 3 skill points - approximately 4Kpp.  Wisdom is maxxed (for a ranger) at 305...  either they went overboard on nerfing the pottery skill up rate or the RNG hates me ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Emerest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hehe Altasius, I'd dearly LOVE to get 12 skillups in 80 Pottery tries.  My last 150 combines (a combination of steins and idols) have netted a paltry 2 skillups (225 and 226).  And I don't like to even think about the cash outflow -- too depressing.<br />
<br />
The RNG hates me, too.  And I'm not too fond of it, either. :p <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>QuteCleric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The other day with a wisdom of 290 (as a cleric, but haven't gotten all the aa's yet :( ) I setup what I call my night of 500 combines.  I tortured my enchanter friends to enchant 500 blocks of clay, creat 500 vials of clear mana and paid some unfortunate level 50 shaman to imbue 500 ambers for me(he took almost 2 hours, :P good times).... Anyway, in those 500 combines I got 15 skill ups.  That's about 33 combines per skillup and seems to be about the average... I had started at 218 skill and got to 233.<br />
<br />
About a week later I did another 200 combines and got 7 skill ups... this is about 28-29 combines per skill up.  Based on these results I'd say that pottery isn't any worse than any of the other skills, just not much better... You can see my post in the baking section on geometric probability distributions if you want more information on the probability of # of combines :P but, in short, it's all a lot of luck and just have to hang in there...<br />

Got annoyed and decided to go back to fletching 1 skill up in 134 tries slightly better but not much.<br />
I gmed smithing a while ago and should have remembered what the RNG is like, I don't know why I put myself through this :)</div></div><hr />

Are you saying to go from 0 &gt; 12 it took 80 combines ?<br />
<br />
If so whats your prime stat at ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kelador Stormwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well the first few points its usually easier / quicker to put a few unused training points from levelling into the skill to kickstart you... I never tried starting a skill without putting in a couple of points (at least).  <br />
<br />
When I did 'early' pottery (up to 122 to make the vial of velium vapors) it seemed very quick - in fact it didn't really stall until I hit 188 ...after that every point has been a hellish experience, culminating in 1 skill point from 100 Crucible of Escape combines last week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I did 200 combines of unfired casseroles for 3 skillups... each combine required 200 ceramic linings... :(</div></div><hr />

I have 200-250 in all my tradeskills including 250 in tailoring and have never had a run that bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sadonumspa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My High Elf Paladin with Wisdom of 305 has achieved<br />
Baking (250)<br />
Brewing (250)<br />
Fletching (250)<br />
Jewelcraft (250)<br />
Pottery(230)<br />
Smithing (220)<br />
Tailoring (237)<br />
<br />
I can tell you that of the 7 tradeskills that I have done that 6 of the 7 tradeskills resulted in Skills ups of roughly 20 attempts per skill up or less.<br />
<br />
The ONLY Tradeskill that I DREAD getting to 250 is Pottery. I have gone Numerous times attempting 100 pottery combines and gotten 1 or No skill ups.<br />
<br />
I have found in my experience tradeskilling and you see my skill levels above ( I also have a wood-elf druid at 200 in all 7 tradeskills as well to give you some idea how much experience I have in tradeskilling) that Pottery Skill ups average (for me and my personal RNG) approximately 35-40 attempts per skill up.<br />
<br />
It's Bad enough that pottery REQUIRES the help of an enchanter or 2 or 3 or 4 to get above 216, but to also require double the amount of attempts per skill up is a bit much, but get used to it.. That's the way it is.. =(<br />
<br />
SO my advice is.. give up now before you start... j/k.. Stick it out and you'll get there..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Currently running the Old-world idol gauntlet....<br />
<br />
I have a chanter bot for clay and a friendly Iksar shaman in my guild who is happy to imbue amber by the sackload.  (I throw plat at him to keep him happy till the next bagfull)<br />
<br />
Ok so as we are talking skillups.....<br />
<br />
200 attempts at 222 skill. (270 wis)<br />
<br />
8 skillups...  i didnt think that was too bad.<br />
thats 1point per 25 attempts.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>ValanthaStormweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">So I finally decided that maybe my guild leader's fiance wasn't so crazy and that maybe there was something to doing all these trade-skills...so, I start doing a few myself.  I work on baking for a little while, then fletching, then brewing, then bake a little more.  Finally I decide I'm going to try pottery.  And frankly, I do it hard core for a few days.  Took 2 days and 500pp to get from 0 to 199.  Not bad I'd say.  So i decide I'm gonna take this one all the way......the big 250......so I start saving plat....and saving.....and saving...(I'm only lvl 59, I'm a druid so I can farm pretty well, but still.....) finally get around 30k in the bank, and I'm thinking....oooooo, I'll hit 250 now....... NOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTT! ! !   Now, I'm reasonable, or I try to be, I have my pottery geerlok, and i have 255 wisdom...but the Pottery Wheel hates me......and I'm begining to hate it, and this is why:<br />
<br />
 The pottery devil has struck you down with WRATH.....You have taken 27,000 pottery wheel damage....<br />
<br />
<br />
I wanted to cry.  I started at 199.   I bought tainted planar essence off of vendors in PoTranquility (approximately 6pp 4gp or some such each) and Tannan clay (approximately 10pp 8gp each) plus the other stuff needed for the combines to make unfired planar stiens.  I purchased enough to do 75 stacks of combines.  That's 1500 combines.  Even just counting the clay and the tainted planar essence thats about 18pp per combine.  At 1500 combines thats 27k.<br />
<br />
Do you know how many skill ups I got for 1500 combines? 9.  I recieved NINE skill-ups for 1500 combines......THAT'S INSANE....my pottery seems to be stuck at 208......I'm terrified to sink any more money into it....<br />
<br />
Has this happened to anyone else or is it just me?  If it's just me I really will cry.....Is there any hope for my skill?  HELPPPPPPP!!!!</div></div><hr />

My heart goes out to you, but 27k is not that much to sink into a skill.....<br />

181 to 222 i varied between opal steins and planar steins.<br />

On a different subject i did go 345ish combines of misty thicket picknicks one time with  1 skill up and finished off 400 combines with only 2.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Mumboh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I just restarted on a new server. My &quot;old&quot; character GM'd pottery in the early days of the PotC craze. I remember well how easy it was to skill up at the lower levels. After 180 or so, pottery slowed down and seemed to be roughly the same as smithing (at least in the 180-200 range). I never put AA into getting a 2nd skill over 200, so I can't speak to that.<br />
<br />
My new toon (level 24 at the moment) is working on getting all tradeskills up as far as I can get them without a lot of cash (new server, no twinking, I have no cash).<br />
<br />
When I started on Smithing I got 18 skillups in 19 attempts to go from 0-18.<br />
<br />
When I started on Tailoring I got 13 skillups in about 25 attempts to go from 15 to 28.<br />
<br />
When I started on Pottery I got 2 skillups in 60 attempts to go from 0 to 2. :steamed:  I went back to my guildmaster and bought my way to 21. I proceeded to work my pottery to 67 from 21, getting about 2 skillups per 20 attempts and very sore wrists.<br />
<br />
I've done this before. I expect skillups to get harder as the skill climbs. I just can't see any reason why pottery should be so much harder at low levels.</div></div><hr />

You mean you got 1 skillup per less than 3 attempts and you are mad?<br />
<br />
I kept looking for a sarcasm intended flag in the message but couldn't find one...I hope you are really not expecting a better success rate than that. <br />
<br />
I'd say by the mid 20's, I'm usually looking for 1 per 5 - 7 attempts (All my alts have all 7 skills at least at 25). I'd be happy with doing 90 combines to get to 32 for all my characters.<br />
<br />
If you aren't willing to fail over 200 times getting from skill 1 to 2, then perhaps tradeskills are not for you...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Wreinie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">oops I meant 90 stacks.  It was not a very good rate for success to say the least :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Wreinie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I wanted to get back in here and state today I had the best of luck with my pottery skills.  Well, I dont know if it is luck or if there is something wrong, but my skill up rate for my pottery seemed unusually high today.  Compared with the other day it was like stepping back in time BEFORE the nerf to the tradeskills.  Needless to say I took advantage of it and got my pottery now at 186, hehe, I got 100 skillups today.  The only other thing I can think is that maybe with the new UI it just maybe seemed faster since my hands did not bother me as much, and went easier.  I did not log my tradeskill session nor do I really know how long I went at it, hehe, my buddies were yakking to me, soooo hehe, I would stop for a bit to yak back and forth and of course tease my friends in the guild.  Again I dont know if it has been changed back to the old way or if it is just the UI making it soo much easier and hence faster to do the combines so i put out more, hehe, but I did have to come back and do a follow up to my post here.  <br />

Take care all :)</div></div><hr />
