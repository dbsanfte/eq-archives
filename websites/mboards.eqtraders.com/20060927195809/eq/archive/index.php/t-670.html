I don't have a screen shot handy, but the while similiar, the Rallic and the Haversack are not the same graphic.   I don't know what the satchel looks like.<br />
<br />
If no one else can, I can screen shot them over lunch. ( in five hours )</div></div><hr />

The Haversack is the same graphic as the Grandmaster Sachel.  They both look similar to the EE bag, but there are some differences.  Unfortunately, I don't have the ability to host any graphics, so I can't give you a screenshot, but it is on Allakhzam:<br />

They have provided for me quite well in the 2 years or so that I've had them.<br />
<br />
Making these looks to be a bit of a chore.  Having to have someone forage the tuft of dire wolf fur for me, or get lucky and find them lying about on the ground after someone's decided to drop them, and then hoping your combine works with the numbers you've gotten so you don't have to ask them to forage for you again would be a bit embarassing.  Guess some skills are better suited for those that can enchant, track and forage :)<br />

Instead of paying 5250 pp for a tinkerers bag, you need 3 BD's and a night's worth of foraged tufts -- and less than 350 pp worth of components.  My guild still does regular raids on the AOW so it's easy to get a couple stacks on a raid -- just ask folks to save them.  And BD's drop pretty commonly in POP -- if we spend a night getting experience can often get enough BD's for everyone in the group to get one or two BD's.  Or spend a night in POG. ;)<br />
<br />
Plus the bags are 0.4 pounds lighter than tinkerer bags, so monks don't mind getting them at all!  They're more than happy to give me a few BD's and some foraged tufts for the bags (remember, Iksar monks can forage these just fine).<br />
<br />
Of course, this is on Test -- where folks tend to help each other out more.  If you have to buy your tufts from guildmates and friends, I can see where that could be a problem.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  As noted below, it takes a bit more than 350 pp for components -- forgot plat threads are actually just over 200 pp, not 100.   So total cost is closer to 650 pp per attempt, plus 3 BD's and the foraged tufts.</div></div><hr />

Here here!  Dump the useless bags and salvage the database space to make something we really want!  Make it a 3 BD 1 Woven combine if you want.</div></div><hr />
