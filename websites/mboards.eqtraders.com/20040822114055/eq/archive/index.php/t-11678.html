<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Of the three stickied threads at the top of this page.. two of them should help you:<br />
<br />
this one: Spell Research FAQ<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
this one: 50-60 Spell Research Drop List by Zone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>firm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I looked before I posted.<br />
<br />
Unlike you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, if it's not in the sticky posts, then it is not known to this community.  In the future, I'd suggest saying that you've checked the FAQ first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">While I have never actually seen a Toharon's Page 21 Left side, I have seen several other research pages, runes and componants. What I would suggest you do is go to some of the higher end zones to search for it. For the most part it seems to be that the Mobs in say a 35-45 zone will drop research items for spells that are levels 34 and 40. It seems to be the same for the higher end research items, Looking at the enchanter spells that could be made with that page I would say the Mobs most likely to drop it are going to be either in the Old world planes (Hate, fear or Sky), PoP zones (Teir 2) or possibly LoY Crypt of Naddox or Hates Fury.<br />
<br />
As an aside I would like to let you in on a tip here Firm, I almost did not post here based on the implied tone I got from your reply to Moraganth, in future it would be best not to add comments like Unlike you or do what Tinile stated and let us know that you looked the FAQ. You may notice that your post might get several views but no responces based on comments like that. <br />

Ohhh and BTW yeah I have a Researcher 57 Chanter named Thoula Research of 194</div></div><hr />
