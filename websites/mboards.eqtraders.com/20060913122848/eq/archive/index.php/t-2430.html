<br />
My total cost was 263k, but this was more than offset by 420k in revenue from tailored products. I also have 156k of unsold inventory.<br />
<br />
The most I was ever in the hole was 60k plat at level 204. After that I earned more plat than I spent.<br />
<br />
My largest costs were 70k for velium bits/bricks/blocks, 77k for temper and 75k for blue diamonds.<br />
<br />
I farmed/foraged most of my own stuff. I vendor mined. I had regular suppliers for a number of things. I made my own tempers (once recipe was implemented). I sometimes bought in Bazaar - especially Blue Diamonds.<br />
<br />
My average skill up rate was 24 combines per skillup.<br />
<br />
Arctic Wyvern averaged 35 combines per skillup.<br />
Wood Elf Cultural averaged 14 combines per skillup.<br />
This is based on 1800 combines so it's statistically significant.<br />
<br />
Other Velious combines (Black Panther, Tigeraptor, Haze Panther, Cobalt Drake) averaged 20 combines per skillup. This is based on 300 combines.<br />
<br />
Now I'm waiting for a new high end tailoring recipe so I can make lots of plat.  ;) <br />

Was glad to finally see you make it after several months of arduous farming - now you can let your poor wrists have a break  :D <br />
