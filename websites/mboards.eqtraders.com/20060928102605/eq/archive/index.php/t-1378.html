<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fritti Tailchaser</div><div class="date">12-22-2002, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm curious if anyone knows if Dream Weave (and the other Planes of Power tailoring) is skill level restricted. I've found that many of the new recipes won't even let you attempt them if you're not above a certain level (at least Pottey and Jewelcraft have turned out that way, but Baking. Well, I guess any fool can use an oven!) and I'd rather not waste my time collecting components to find out that I need to have 220+ to even try to make it.<br />
