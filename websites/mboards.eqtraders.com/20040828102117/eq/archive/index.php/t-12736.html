<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cmcsess</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have 191 in baking and decided to skill up on Candied Cockroaches until 202.  I don't have exact numbers but I have probably gone through about 20 stacks of cockroaches, and while the rate of success was pretty high, I did not receive one skillup.  I know at higher levels the skill ups become harder to  come by, but is this normal?  <br />
<br />
I figured I should have had at least a couple after this many combines, and they were done over three days, not all at once since I've been going back and forth to the bazaar every day and buying out the supply of reasonably priced roaches (I'm a Pally and have to buy the cockroaches, so these non-skillups have been pretty costly).  I've read that a couple of recipies in JC are bugged and are not good for skilling up, and was starting to think this may be the case with these.  But I wanted to check here since this is my first skill that I have gotten into the 190's, so for all I know this is just a normal hell that folks have to go through at this level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">20 stacks of roaches means 5 stacks of combines and about 100 chances at skillup right?  i've gotten the over 130 mark and another guy posted a rant on 763 combines without skillup i beleive.  i just did mtp and meat pies.  from 192 has prolly taken me 1500 combines at least to get to 238.  memory is fuzzy.  too many mtps all blending together.  success rate blows at 192 on mtps though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tudamorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The RNG is sometimes your enemy.  The RNG is sometimes your friend.  In your case, right now, it's the former.  I don't understand why you're doing cockroaches, though, since they are semi-rare and it takes 4 cockroaches for 1 combine, as opposed to Ohaba Truffles (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1665&amp;menustr=035000000000) which use common mushrooms and only take 1 mushroom per combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>cmcsess</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why not make Truffles? Because I'm a Newb :) <br />
I originally brought my Tradeskills up for the Shawl quest and have just started trying to skill up to GM status.  I have been having Packet Loss/ISP troubles for going on two weeks now also, making me pretty much useless for any group and unable to fight a monster without a strong chance of getting myself killed, so I've been working exclusively on tradeskills when logged on until that issue gets straightened out.  Going to definately try the Truffles now since they should cost about a third of Cockroaches.</div></div><hr />

Don't feel too bad.  I think it took me over 250 combines to get from 191 to 192.  <br />
<br />
Getting over 200 was PAINFUL!  But worth it.  Now I'm at 225 and when I get a skill up I'm happy and suprised.  I make picnics and Halas pies for guildies any extras I sell in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cmcsess</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, I logged on yesterday and realized I still had two and a half stacks of cockroaches so I combined those and guess what? <br />
<br />
Ding 192!<br />
<br />
I mainly logged on to make a round of vendor diving after the patch and did the combines more to make some room in inventory.  I found some Mushrooms in my vendor searches and next time I log on I'll look around in the bazaar for more and try those, I think they'll be alot cheaper :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aneya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I used Candied Cockroaches to get from 191 to 201. I combined approximately 600-800 Cockroaches at 265 wis. It cost me approximately 1 pp per cockroach in bazaar so it was not that expensive. There was a vendor silling them 160 at a time so I had a steady supply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">did a run of 200 mtps.  costs about 200pp.  yeild 4 so 5 successes and you make a stack of picnics.  then sell that stack for 200pp or 10pp per and viola, free skillups.  hehe can you tell i have been poor a long time.  anyway grats on 192.  it was a pain for me from 192 to 193.  good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>cannyar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">free skillups yeah.. but what do you pay your doctor in carpal tunnel fees? ugh. i pay mine a lot.. :boggled:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">do 200 combines normally.  zerged about 800 or 1000 over three days.  got sick of baking for a bit and wrist recovered.</div></div><hr />
