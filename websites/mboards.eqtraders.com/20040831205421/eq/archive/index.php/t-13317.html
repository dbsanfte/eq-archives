<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was curious if you combine to make tackle, does this give you increases to your fishing skill? If you combine to make fish bones....ie-Whittled Fish Bones......does this combining bring your Fishing Skill up?<br />
Does your Fishing Skill have to be at a certain level in  order to do combines?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">no level restriction i know of.  yes if you use a tackle box and it isn't trivial you can raise your skill.  <br />
<br />
not sure on the fletching part.  do you make them in a tacklebox? thats fishing.  i thought there was a step in a fletching kit which is fletching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So making Fishing Bones with a Fillet Knife and making Tackle would both increase my Fishing Skill?<br />
You mentioned Fletching...is that required with any of our Fishing items?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thought you used the hq fish bones in fishbone darts.  that is fletching i beleive.<br />
<br />
edit looked it up.  yep.  the combine to get the hq fishbones in a tacklebox raises fishing if not trivial.  the combine to make the dart is fletching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arghargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would think that any non-trivial combine done in a tackle box, whether its prepared fish, lures, or whatever, could yield a skill-up.  I did a bunch of skill ups making fish eggs (thunder salom + skinning knife in tackle box).  In addition to the skill up chance from just fishing, each caught fish was an extra chance to skill up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My recommendation is to not do lures for skill-ups. They're used up just like lures and you can put the silk thread to better use. (I.E. making Leather Padding to sell if you don't mind raising Tailoring a bit, or selling the spiderling silk in the Bazaar to people who do make the padding)<br />
<br />
You're better off buying some Animated Bait from a Gnome or some Catch-A-Lot Bait from Fishing supply vendors, if you want the skill bonuses while actually fishing.</div></div><hr />
