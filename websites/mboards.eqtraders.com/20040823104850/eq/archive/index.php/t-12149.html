I've heard a lot of talk about how alchemy is broken, and I even felt that way myself for a while. After getting into it and doing some on the LoY stuff my opinion changed dramatically. Though expensive to make essence and gate potions worked great as skill up paths for me since they sell so well. I've done all other tradeskills, excluding research and tinkering, and this is the only one that lets you make a good profit on the items you skill up on. Hang in there and alchemy will really pay off in the long run.<br />

Oh and on FV most trophies are droppable, I made mine after I hit 200 on the first try. Sold 2 hours later for 35k. :D</div></div><hr />
