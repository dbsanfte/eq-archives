<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Holden Caulfield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How about increased tribute value points for tradeskill-created items that were popular skill-up routes?  Then you'd have SOMETHING to show for those 500 opal-encrusted steins you made on the road to 250, and the items wouldn't be absolutely worthless on the market?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beriberi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I love the idea but they won't do this. If it trivializes the tribute process or makes it easier than it was intended to be, Sony won't go along with it.<br />
<br />
This is like a big Snickers bar; no matter how you cut it, it comes up peanuts. A high skill value in a tradeskill is it's own reward, there is no way to have your cake and eat it too.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts.<br />

HAhha yeah and that about it cause there is sure no other rewards hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cantatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think tradeskill items should be higher than normal items on average.  The whole point of the tribute system is to make it so items get sucked out of the game.  It only makes sense that the items that are more proliferous in the game be the ones worth more tribute as they need to be sucked out the most.<br />
<br />
Raising the tribute on certain items might also increase the value of them.  If you're hard strapped for needing tribute points, you'd want to buy the items that gave the most.  Eventually, these items would become rarer and their price would rise somewhat.<br />

Sort of off-topic, but I like your name.  That's one of my favorite books.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's what I thiought was the plan when geerlok hammers were 1,400 tribute points, but they reduced it to 72, so I think thay already rejected this plan.</div></div><hr />
