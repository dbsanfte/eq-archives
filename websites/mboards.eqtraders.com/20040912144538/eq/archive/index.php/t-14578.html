<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>YurienStonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok loaded question, please hold all the peanut jokes to the end of the thread &lt;g&gt; are there any viable skillup recipes with GoD that can be farmed easily, either from mobs or merchants that isn't as time consuming as hoppers and/or ribbons? or in lieu of that are there any recipes that havne't been updated that are worth doing in palce of the acrylia armor that cna be sold to recover prices? i'm a lvl 56 bst and have a 25dru i can use too if needed. i REFUSE to do acrylia armor and shadowscream armor. too much farming and waste of time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">acrylia and shadowscream are for smithing anyway, you can do artic wyvern, solstice robes, and a couple other things for tailoring post 170.  It has been awhile since I have done skillups though so I am not sure what else was good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Almandris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He probably ment Acrylia reinforced/studded and Shaded Hide armor (mindworm hides).  Don't know for sure.<br />
<br />
I have been looking for something along these lines to come out of GoD also, but have not seen it.  From what people tell me the farming isn't easy for most of the stuff.   But you will probably always have a bottleneck of some sort.... acrylia, hopper hides, etc.<br />
<br />
I know the new backpacks don't look that great so if nothing else is found it will be like lemming fur backpacks.... they are ok, but really not worth it.<br />
<br />
Overall conclusion so far is no good skillup options right now, but have to wait for the high end stuff to trickle in to see if there is some better items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">GoD didn’t relieve the hardships of tailoring; they simply added more things you can make. The items that were added can be put on the list of already time consuming hunting/gathering recipes.</div></div><hr />
