<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tilean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why (other than the obvious dificulty in foraging) are tea leaves so expensive now. I used to see them for 5p to 25p now they are in the bazaar for 50p to 90p? Granted they always seem to be there on the same people. Is there a new use for them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ravensteel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am not sure why some people try to charge outrageous prices on these. However it seems that the people who have the highest prices never seen to sell. /snicker I wonder why. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I usually price watch, and ever so offen some nice person will have a bunch for half or even less of what the current market prices is, it does not seem to happen offen -  but it does happen. <br />
<br />
But I would never buy from somebody who overprices their goods, (especaily for something that all you have to do is click a button) sooner or latter if they want to sell stuff badly enuff, they will come down</div></div><hr />
