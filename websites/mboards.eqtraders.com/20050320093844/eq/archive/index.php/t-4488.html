<br />
Does anyone have a list of all the different title changes that occur after lvl 51? Some of them are obvious (Sorceror=Wizard), but there are some that I have no idea what class they are.<br />
<br />
If anyone can list these, I would greatly appreciate it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't want to contradict you Unidin, <br />
but I'm in the same situation that Marteeny.<br />
<br />
Don't know title, can't seem to remember them.<br />
When I ask  plp what are their class, they rebuff<br />
 me with ''Look at my name'', but if I'm sending<br />
them a tell, its BECAUSE I saw their name, <br />
and can't figure out theirs class.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, since when I usually do that its cause I<br />
would like a little help from a class specific person,<br />
I can tell with theirs answers that I don't need to bother...<br />
<br />
A list would help me to bother less plp and get less rebuff :(  :) !<br />
I hope I can remember your suggestion...<br />
<br />
Would your trick of who all work with anon or roleplay, btw?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Carmaris</div><div class="date">03-07-2003, 02:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, it wouldn't work with /role or /anon...but that's why he included &quot;all&quot; in the command...it'll search the server for all non-role/anon players of the specific class/level.  You're bound to get at least one return that way :)<br />
<br />
To get the other class titles, just replace &quot;51&quot; with 55, 60, &amp; 65.<br />
<br />
For the record, though, I know the titles for paladins are: Cavalier (51 - 54), Knight (55 - 59), Crusader (60 - 64), and Lord Protector (65).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EnfinitiStarr8</div><div class="date">03-07-2003, 05:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the list for Ranger's are 1-50=Ranger, 51-54=Pathfinder, 55-59=Outrider and 60-64=Warder and 65=Forest Stalker. Not counting the last two I'm a truck or an SUV for most of my levels. Hope it helps.</div></div><hr />

I think we use Knight also and eventually &quot;Dread Lord&quot; at 65.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a nicely formatted chart at EQ Races (http://www.planeteq.com/eqraces/promotion.htm).  Due to issues with creating a chart on the boards here, here is a de-tabled version, edited to correct an error in the 65 druid title.  It looks much better on their site:<br />
<br />
Bard: Minstrel, Troubadour, Virtuoso, Maestro <br />
Beastlord: Primalist, Animist, Savage Lord, Feral Lord <br />
Cleric: Vicar, Templar, High Priest, Archon <br />
Druid: Wanderer, Preserver, Hierophant, Storm Warden<br />
Enchanter: Illusionist, Beguiler, Phantasmist, Coercer <br />
Magician: Elementalist, Conjurer, Arch Mage, Arch Convoker <br />
Monk: Disciple, Master, Grandmaster, Transcendent <br />
Necromancer: Heretic, Defiler, Warlock, Arch Lich <br />
Paladin: Cavalier, Knight, Crusader, Lord Protector <br />
Ranger: Wanderer, Outrider, Warder, Forest Stalker <br />
Rogue: Rake, Black Guard, Assassin, Deceiver <br />
Shadow Knight: Reaver, Revenant, Grave Lord, Dread Lord <br />
Shaman: Mystic, Luminary, Oracle, Prophet <br />
Warrior: Champion, Myrmidon, Warlord, Overlord <br />
Wizard: Channeler, Evoker, Sorcerer, Arcanist<br />
<br />
Edited to correct the 65 druid title from the listing on the cited site.</div></div><hr />

It was, but Verant, way back in the day, fixed that in a patch, due to PC pressure.<br />

The one Kyros posted seems to be right. On a side note, does anyone know what the 3rd AA title for beastlords is?</div></div><hr />

Funny you should say that.. I was in a grind group in PoD with a lvl 61 Ranger who attempted to offtank an add since we had a shaman isntead of an enchanter..  Had to back off which caused my pet (The lvl 58 version, who is lvl 45 himself) to take over.. and, sadly, he handled the job better than the PC warder =P</div></div><hr />

At least it's better than the proposed 65 titles of &quot;really grave lord&quot; and &quot;no, I'm serious lord&quot;.</div></div><hr />
