<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So why is it some things just don't make sense by name?  If you're in Halas, and you have a hankering to make some Halas meat pies, you can make them by going out of the city to Everfrost, and then shop for the rest in the city, if you care to do it the hard core way.  Grobb Liquidized Meat uses stuff found, sensibly, near Grobb, only needing to go as far as the Feerott, which is not a big deal since it's close enough.  Yes, I know there's no Grobb any more, but even so, if it was Gukta Liquidized meat it'd still make sense.  And the corking device?  Well, that's what mail order is for, and you only need the one.<br />
<br />
Now tell me, what do you do if you're a dwarf and you want to mix up a bit of Kaladim Constitutional?  You've got to leave the entire CONTINENT to find yarrow to pull it off.  Couldn't those masterful brewers come up with a more local substitute?<br />
<br />
And how exactly did Qeynos Afternoon Tea get so popular in Qeynos, which is across two continents from one cranky old coot who happens to have a lock on King's Thorn?  Sure, there's a ready supply not far away in the Abysmal Sea, but the tea has been popular for far longer than that boat's been floating.  And on top of that, a trip to the moon just to make it?  Come one now.<br />
<br />
And lastly, would it really BE so hard to convince an alchemy merchant to set up shop in Rivervale, so us poor Halflings can make Misty Thicket picnics somewhere in the vicinity of the Misty Thicket?  It's not a lot to ask, but then I can't even buy a firing sheet in town, so maybe it is.<br />

Funny you should mention this. I usually take all my supplies to rivervale to make them :)</div></div><hr />

I gather all my supplies in PoK, and head to Rivervale to do my combines. It's quiet there; I enjoy the atmosphere.</div></div><hr />

We poor erudites are more annoyed with the mana vial cost on our original cultural, actually.<br />
