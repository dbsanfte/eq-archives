<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sanctu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I have a bunch of fish now from Cobalt Scar and The Hole.  I plan on fishing more here and there and getting a bunch of fish for trade skill purposes and selling those that friends don't need.<br />
<br />
My question: since I have a heafty brewing (not grand master by far, but enough to make stuff out of fish), should I make Cod Oil and Paneel Essence and the like or should I just sell the fish?  When do people look for?  What sells better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aethia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">my experience on Inny and Stromm is that I haven't seen anyone sell the fish, just the Cod Oil.  The essence I would suspect would sell, but not the fish.  Most people looking for the oil/essence would most likely try to get their own.  At least the Cod Oil you have a chance of selling it if there is someone selling the hides to go along with it.<br />
<br />
Just my two cents worth - convert the fish and sell the product.<br />
<br />
Best of Luck</div></div><hr />
