It's a PITA to get...any and all advice would be greatly appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balthozzar</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 02:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, as a wizard, I used to quad chromas. But the recent adjustment to their spell casting range (same as ours basically), means that tactic is pretty near impossible to pull off as one or another will stop to cast every second or two, ruining your bunching. Fear kiting is basically the only efficient way to hunt these now, unless you don't mind not being buffed while you fight them, and have a healer in the group to deal with the DoT.  :x   As for sand giants, they are just too uncommon, IMO, to make it worth hunting them specifically for the sunlight. I only see a sand giant up maybe 1 in 10 times I run through sro and oasis.</div></div><hr />

I have to go from memory, but I don't recall the DOT being a real problem with fungi and iksar regen.. These like damage shields right? So a 2hb setup would be preferred then eh? (which is good, I use 2hb primal and switching to 1h combos after the proc is a little less convenient)<br />
<br />
Also seems like it oughta work out as shard farmers prefer not dealing with chromos~</div></div><hr />

The chromodracs make excellent pets against anything but another chromodrac (the dispell breaks charm early).  A 50+ bard should also be able to solo a single chromodrac with chant kiting, or possibly fear kiting.<br />
<br />
Teaming up with a necro is also a good possibility - you can fear kite them very effectively.<br />

I could always fear kite using the cleric to fear as well, but I've always hated doing that, it's quite a nuisance :)</div></div><hr />

A thought, as I come from an RP guild, we don't have any necromancers per se.  Doubtful, but would a druid's animal fear work on the Chromadracs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaina</div><div class="date">12-21-2002, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">FYI, clerics can fear, too.</div></div><hr />

If so, Chromadracs are not undead.  Also, answered my own post.  I took some friends into the Skyfire mountains.  The dracs are fearable, but not by druids.  We ended up having me pull, druid snares on inc, then bard plays fear song and we chased them down.  Very easy takedowns.</div></div><hr />

Go to Wakening lands and kill Fairie dragons. They are lower level then chromos. They are just like the chromos as far as abilities, but are easier. Plus, the Fairie dragons are static spawns, so you know they will be there. Downside is negative tunare faction.<br />
