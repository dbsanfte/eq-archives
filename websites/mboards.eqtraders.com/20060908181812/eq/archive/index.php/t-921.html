If 250 I can I understand making the newer BD armor, but the older SteelSilk just isn't a skillup option. Every vial of pure mana costs 132ppx4=528pp just in gems. Thats alot of cash for one vial, or am I just the biggest idiot and forgot something? I'm at 191 tailoring currently and I'm getting burnt on on farming greenies for acrylia or velium and then not seeing any skillups after blowing through 3K for every stack of hides I buy of flawless rockhopper hides.</div></div><hr />

With the imbued armor being so easy to make in comparison to the unimbued there's never really been a reason to.</div></div><hr />

Believe it or not, there was a thread on the old  board a while back in which people kept suggesting the old Erudite cultural as a viable method for skilling up.  I think they just kept inaccurately comparing it to the Wood Elf and Halfling cultural tailoring, which for quite a while, was the single most sane method to get 200+ tailoring skill (i.e. in the days between the release of Luclin and when Crystalline Silk was introduced).  I had to keep shooting down the idea of skilling up on Erudite Cultural, but from some of the posts, I still think one or two people may have remained blithely ignorant.<br />
So, yes, some people do think its a good way to skill up, but I don't think those people have the slightest idea of what's involved in making it.</div></div><hr />

I have done several pieces now and even have put some on my vendor.  It would be really nice if they'd sell.  What would you guys recommend pricing for a BP/robe?<br />

I tried making a few of the nicer pieces and placed them on my mule in the baz but with the high cost of BDs on my server (at the time 2kpp)  I wasnt making enough to cover failures.  These days I, even with the lowered cost of BDs thanks to PoP drop rates, I only make items that folks ask for and because of my rediculous failure rate I require people to proovide all the ingredients.  I charge 1kpp per silk used to create item.  So far I have had quite a few customers and haven't had any complaints.<br />

At present, I'm attempting cultural to kit my cleric - nothing more. The main reason I started tailoring was because I wanted to kit my alt in this spiffy gear, as I wasn't expecting the guild to fund her upgrades. I'm using wyvern/drake/acrylia for skill ups. Basically, whatever I can get my hands on.<br />
<br />
I very, VERY rarely see any kind of erudite made cultural up for sale. If... no.. WHEN I get to the skill level in which it makes sense for me to try to sell it, I will probably attempt Rigid Steelweave, because it opens up to the human market better than the deity restricted items.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahlig</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted a similar rant a few months ago about the lack of equitable skillup path when compared to the other Cultural Tailors.  Then along come ribbons and robes for Erudites (as we ll as many other races).  Yeah, I take all the credit for that.   :D <br />
<br />
As far as Erudite Tailors go, I am *going* to be one.  Currently, my skill is a paultry 189, but will be breaking the 200 mark in the next week or so.  Pricing is really dependent on what you feel like charging to make the sale.  As cultural is somewhat &quot;older&quot; armor, it may not be worth as much as it once would have been.  Since dying is available, I am not sure even the unique look will draw much attention.</div></div><hr />
