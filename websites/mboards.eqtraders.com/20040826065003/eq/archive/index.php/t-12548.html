<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>hyelaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">right, i posted a question about that a few months back.  it was taken off but when the site went down, the older version went back up.  hopefully they will get the database fixed so they don't have to re-do all the work that they have already done.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">True this item's source was wrong. I did fix it.... then the Disk Drive wiped us back to the time prior to my fix.<br />
<br />
Currently I am holding off on updating sources, hoping for some useful data recovery and I want to minimize what work I might have to do.  But the longer I don't hear about the recovery, the less hope I have in it.<br />
<br />
If you see problems like this, post it in the Database Update Submissions Forum please.</div></div><hr />
