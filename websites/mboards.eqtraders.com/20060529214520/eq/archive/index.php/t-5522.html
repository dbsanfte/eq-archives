<br />
What Skill level would be a good idea to try the GM tool ?<br />
<br />
And does any1 know where the min. 5 procent change of suc6 stops and goes up ?  I believe it is somewhere &amp;lt; 210 and 220 that you had at least a 5 procent suc6 on combine ..  and if you skill is higher, you get a better chance.. <br />
<br />
Does someone have an idea how this works ?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tibis</div><div class="date">04-08-2003, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I wouldn't attempt it until skill was equal to 252 (ie 240 + geerlock).  I did mine at 250, without a skill mod (no geerlock then).<br />
<br />
People report first time success on lower skill levels, same as other GM items, others have 5 - 8 failures at max skill.  Your milage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">04-08-2003, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Given that poison is level capped and you can't stack the advanced stuff without making a seal, it can be worth doing it early if you have the cash but not the levels.<br />
<br />
At 250 skill you will have a 50% chance of making your trophy, roughly, and a good rule of thumb is that each skill point under that will lower your success by 1%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dunnwindy</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was pretty broke when I tried mine, so I was able to do it just one attempt at a time, and didn't even consider trying it until I was at 250 skill.  The first attempt I failed, the second I succeeded.<br />
<br />
The GMAS is a useful tool, but bear in mind that to stack the poisons you need 5 or 10...and even with 250 skill and the GMAS' 5% modifier I fail a lot on my attemps.  To get a 10 dose Bite of the Shissar I usually have to combine at least 15+ to end up with 10 for the 10 dose bottle.<br />
<br />
Basically what I'm getting at here...the higher your skill, the better off you will be in the long run.</div></div><hr />

I concur with this, and it's a constant source of frustration when you have to buy all your pieces.  Don't blow the money and time on GMAV/GMAS unless you plan to spend a couple hours per week restocking and recombining.<br />

<br />
I bought level 1 ... mostly because I wanted Marauder title (Escape, Ambidexterity and Physical Enhancement left me one point short) and it was the AA that was the most useful in my opinion.  I doubt I'll be buying levels 2 and 3 for quite a while though, too many other things to buy.</div></div><hr />

Success on my 2nd GM poison vial at skill of 230 with the 2% geerlock from JP, and got the GMA seal at 235 skill.<br />
Oh and I was level 56 at the time too :)<br />

<br />
Anyways, I just got my Vial yesterday.  225 skill with 5% geerlok, so effective skill of about 236.  Was my fifth try.  I had tried each level since 50.  I would level, skill up those 5 points and try a vial.  Finally got one.  I wil have the seal tomorrow, I mad all my poisons tonight but the servers went down for patch.  :(</div></div><hr />
