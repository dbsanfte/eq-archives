<br />
Anyway, last night, when faced with too much boredom and too little sense,  I whipped up a stack of Mistletoe temper and Blessed Dust and proceeded to try two sickles... failed both, and failed making a kilt previously, but managed to get a skillup to 212.<br />
<br />
Has anything been added to the 212-250ish range that I missed?  Lately I've been collecting cash by doing seafuries, but that's been too slow and I really need more stamina gear at my level... need a way to earn cash to upgrade the hardware... or at least try to find a semi-regular hunting group...<br />
<br />
Anyone need a 212 smith for any subcombines or anything?  I also have my 176 baking skill and 155ish pottery, as well as my brewing (173) if anyone needs subcombines made but is lazy. :)</div></div><hr />

You can probably scroll to about page 65 or so...  :D</div></div><hr />

Mighty, I almost never play Stumbles anymore.  I'm pretty sure she's got a Bracelet of Fortitude on.<br />
<br />
Want to borrow it?  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hate the thought of borrowing stuff. I worry enough about losing my own gear... much less something belonging to someone else that's worth 9k plat. :)<br />
<br />
I just wish I has something equivalent to trade... tried making more sickles... now I'm zero for six. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
You won't let me buy stuff for you, you won't let me loan stuff to you...<br />
<br />
Bleh.   :P <br />
<br />
I am so tempted to just sell all the stuff Stumbles has so I can make a serious offer on a Narandi's Crown...</div></div><hr />
