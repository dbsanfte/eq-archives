<br />
While it's true that I didn't loose anything that I previously had...you forget that I previously had $29.95 in my wallet.  I specificly bought GoD for the Tradeskill UI upgrade.  Upon, trying four different recipies, I find that non of them are listed nor are they learnable.  <br />
<br />
Heck, why should I complain about that...after all 4 (that I've tried) out of how many thousands...what's the problem with that.<br />
<br />
So I suggest the next time you go to a resterant and order a meal, don't send it back when your steak is raw...because the potato and veggies are done...they got it almost right!<br />
<br />
Why is it acceptable for vendors such as Sony to take in our money, then give us a product that isn't done?  Why couldn't they wait 1 month more till they could include all recipies or make all recipes learnable?  Could it be that they are much more concerned with bottom line then they are a quality product?<br />
<br />
Don't forget that this is a product, you wouldn't accept a half cooked meal, why accept a half complete program.  Give me my money back, and let me know when it's finished...yeah right!<br />
<br />
Of course, that's only my opinion, I could be wrong!<br />
<br />
:-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>JMorgana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hate to break this to you AFTER you've already bought GoD, but GoD and the new tradeskill UI have nothing to do with each other other than timing of release.<br />
<br />
While I can't comment on GoD features working or not working as intended, I can say for a fact that the tradeskill UI and GoD are not related.  Seems to be a pretty common misconception from what I've heard though.</div></div><hr />

I refer to them together because they had the same deadlines.  If anything the fact that the UI was put out at the same time as the expansion only serves to underscore the fact that it was a priority.  That's a wonderful thing.<br />
<br />
I'll edit the announcement to make that a little clearer.</div></div><hr />

there are zones in LoY?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Lets say Sony had 2 options<br />
<br />
1. release the UI 75% complete now and finish it in a month<br />
2. release it 100% complete in a month and hold it til then<br />
<br />
Im am SO happy they did option number one. Id rather have part of it now and the rest later than wait for it all at once. Yeah Im miffed I had to do a lot of cultural by hand but how did that differ from how I did it 2 weeks ago?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Every time I see this statement, It makes me really angry.  :-(<br />
<br />
<br />
LoY had some really awesome zones, and people , for the most part, are so pre-occupied with only seeing what they want to see in an expansion that they totally ignore the rest.<br />
<br />
Everyone saw that there were only 5 zones, and said &quot;Wow, only 5?  I guess I'm not going THERE!&quot;.   Nevermind the fact that there was some REALLY good content in those zones.<br />
<br />
It would be like saying  &quot;I bought LDoN for Magus Transport and New Smithing Recipes.   There were zones?&quot;.    (Although yes, you can use both of those without purchase, they were a part of the expansion.)<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to be a jerk, but it seems like hundreds of people all have the same Joke writer, and knock an expansion that I really liked.<br />

It's already been said, but I think it bears repeating, since too many people just completely missed the fact that the new tradeskill UI had NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with The Gates of Discord expansion, other than the date of release.<br />
<br />
Repeat – You did not have to buy GoD to get the Tradeskill UI.<br />
<br />
As for releasing it before it was ‘complete’….well, actually, the new UI itself was complete, however, due to the sheer volume of tradeskill recipes and components in the game (not to mention all the new recipes and components released with GoD) not all of them have been flagged - yet.  However, the devs have told us that they are working on adding the necessary Autolearn and Canlearn flags, so lets all  - please – be patient, and thankful for the recipes we do have.  As Verdandi has stated, the OLD method of combining still works, so you haven’t lost anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gotta agree with you there, Lilosh.  And the rest of your post...but didn't want to use too much space.<br />
<br />
I've only been on EQ about a year and only tradeskilling a few months, but this kind of thing drives me nuts somehow.<br />
<br />
LoY is has awesome zones with some really cool quest spells for levels 45+.  First thing I did when my cleric got to a high enough level was went and quested Temperance.  Same with Bonds of the Wild for my beastlord.<br />
<br />
But it is annoying that in SOEs own announcement and such it is not 100% clear what features (other than zones and races/classes) are useable with and without purchase of the new expansion.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp.  I know I'm a newbie, but just had to vent a bit myself.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Noni DeeCups</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have no doubt the zones are fun however when the expansion came out I was already 65 and the exp there was not that great. That's not a slam, it just wasn't for my main. I do love the spell Pureblood!<br />
<br />
When I tried to go there with my 47 cleric it was just too much of a pain to get there however I did get her the temp spell - another awesome &quot;must have&quot; spell! <br />
<br />
Trade skills? All of my trade skills were already maxed so the only item I think I have ever made from that expansion is the dyes. <br />
<br />
I will buy all expanions, no matter what, for all of our accounts. I just love new stuff :D Sorry if my opinion bothers anyone however if it doesn't bother me that all I got out of that expansion was: LoY = bank space, maps and dye Then you shouldn't let it bother you. Maybe some day, with an alt, I will spend more time there. Who knows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That wasn't the part that bothered me, I think....  If Chenier was being facetious, okay fine.  Not acknowledging that there's good stuff in the zones even if it's not for them.<br />
<br />
Basically the punchline of Lilosh's post:<br />

<br />
No one's opinion  bothers me....well, I don't know how to better put what bothers me.  Lilosh did it best &amp; I'm just the &quot;me too&quot; newb.....maybe because LoY was the first new expansion after I started and I love my froggie toon and am not sure where else I would have soloed some of my toons between 45-58 when I couldn't find a group...You took the time to acknowledge those at least, Noni.  Thanks.<br />
<br />
But we're all entitled to those individual opinions...so I'm sorry if I bothered anyone with mine, too.<br />

<br />
&quot;A restaunt chain opens, they promise to be faster than the other chains...  and they are... but they do noty have the full menu of the rest of the chain.  But they promise to work on it! &quot;<br />
<br />
This is a more reasonable comparison... they only had one batch of bad letus (the &quot;broken&quot; tinkering container...)</div></div><hr />

Well, I wasn't being facetious. I think it's great if someone likes those zones...just seems to me that everytime I'm out there, there's no one in any of them (been out there several times, looking for iksar blood and for the pure blood spell quest).<br />
<br />
I just think it's a shame that we had to have a whole new expansion for more empty zones (to add the already long list of empty zones around Norrath). That and I'm extremely lazy - it's a long run to Crypt and I *hate* long runs.<br />
<br />
But, you are right, I did lift that joke off someone else. <br />
<br />
Extended bank space, maps and dyes are something I use every single day, to which I'm more than happy to pay an expansion dollar amount for (/insert argument here that those should have just been added to a regular patch).<br />
<br />
I dunno, I certainly don't mean to offend anyone - if LoY zones make/made you happy, then woohoo!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Speckocat Catnippurr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Like I said...I don't know why it bothered me...just did.  Can't speak for Lilosh...but I dunno.<br />
<br />
On my usual server Gunthak and Dulak in particular are almost always crawling with players.  Perhaps if I found them empty, I wouldn't wanna go there either.<br />
<br />
You're right, bank &amp; maps in particular should have been typical upgrade to game (like tradeskill UI) not part of expansion and they're things I use every day, too.  (not dye very much...but a little).  My main is a beastlord &amp; I HATE the long run, too, since I have to run both ways. :D<br />
<br />
Truly sorry that I was bothered....don't know what got into me...<br />
<br />
As I said before, tho, LoY was 1st expansion released after I started &amp; something that really excited me...must have liked it more than even I though. LOL.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well,<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't care much for LoY either. <br />
<br />
To me, its bank space, maps, drogmors, and the supply location for ribbons so I can continue my cultural tailoring.<br />
<br />
Done a few quests there, got Temperance, helped a few people with their quests. <br />
<br />
Went on a few raids there. didn't care for the pathing, or the raid scripts. There are some nice items that drop there, for certain, but not enough to entice most people I know to go there.<br />
<br />
Hard to get to, hard to get anyone else to come to. PAIN in the REAR if you have to CR. <br />
<br />
I'd rather hit veksar, or sebilis, PoP, LDON, anmost anyplace else. <br />
<br />
Think of it this way though, if LoY wasn't so unpopular, you'd have crowds tro contend with, like in BoT and PoV.</div></div><hr />
