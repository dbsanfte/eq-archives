<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RiffRaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a quick point about the new bow staves. (Sedgewood)<br />
<br />
Everyone seems to have taken the in game notes at face value.<br />
<br />
All bows made to date and discussed on these boards are being made with cams etc.<br />
<br />
No one seems to consider the good old fashioned Hemp String Bow. Considering that the staff material drops for free why not try this. <br />
<br />
I did and found that the result is not trivial at 180. I forgot to get the stats though. <br />
<br />
So for those looking for a bridge, what is the trivial on the bow staff itself?<br />
<br />
I haven't been able to find another group going into Miragul's so I dont have any more material to test with. My skill is now 191 from Class 1 Steel Point Arrows, but as soon as I can I will attempt to determine the trivial for the staff.<br />
<br />
I post this hoping that someone with greater access to materials will solve this puzzle for me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ceinwein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The trivial for the Sedge Bows will be 212 for all bows up to those utilizing 2 cams, which will all be 235.<br />
<br />
Remember that the bow uses the highest component trivial. In actuality there is no trivial for the &quot;bow&quot; itself. Just one of the components that make the bow.<br />
<br />
Since the Sedge bowstaff is confirmed trivial at 212, all the bow combinations that utilize it will have a trivial of at least that much.<br />
<br />
Since 2 cams are confirmed trivial at 235, all the bow combinations that utilize them will have a trivial of that.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
as a lvl 206 fletcher i dont skill up from using hemp againt this sedgewood branch<br />
<br />
<br />
i spent nealry 2 hours earlier in the zone and foraged up 12 of them so i will no doubt be trying 1 and 2 cam combos soon too<br />
<br />
the damage is 22 and the range 150 and the delay was sixty something but i forget the exact figure<br />
<br />
i do know its over 60 but below the darkwood / hemp bow delay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rollieh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">as i said before im lvl 206, i cant skill from the standard or 1 cam versions but can from the 2 cam version....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
the base hemp sedgewood bow is 22/62/150<br />
<br />
all sedgewood bows have a range of 150 regardless of cams being fitted unlike darkwood<br />
<br />
<br />
a silk 2 cam planning tool sedgewood bow is 17/39/150<br />
<br />
<br />
those are the fastest/weakest and slowest/strongest<br />
sedgewood combinations possible</div></div><hr />

Thank you.<br />
<br />
P.S. All the basic Sedgewood Bows (27 of them) and their basic recipes have been entered. No one has yet responded to requests to attempt re-stringing the bows.</div></div><hr />

18 combines  brought me from 207 to 208 on the double cams... rough shaped and carved 2 cam were all not trivial at 208  if that helps anyone.<br />

<br />
if you notice i made the best / most expensive combine and the lowest cheapest combine which were both 150, you trying to tell me that if i make a lesser combine it will provide more / less range...... i think not<br />
<br />
at this stage i have also made 1 camed and also used the whitling blade on several sege combines, they all yeild 150 im telling ya<br />
<br />
<br />
It isn't that 'logically' it should be any different. I am just stating that when people enter data, mistakes can happen. And can be missed. I know I have made mistakes entering data here... and go back and correct it when found.<br />
<br />
I would just prefer to have each item made, and the stats verified. It could be that when the Sony Employee entering the information about the bow into the game database made a mistake that was NOT caught. So that some combination of bow has a range of 155... or 15... and if we get the ACTUAL stats, we can point out the boo-boo to Sony and get them to fix it.</div></div><hr />

ALL Sedgewood Recurve Bows are Trivial &lt;202<br />
<br />
Rough Sedgewood 1-cam Bow (Hemp) is Trivial &lt;202<br />
Carved Sedgewood 1-cam Bow (Hemp) is Trivial &lt;202<br />
Shaped Sedgewood 1-cam Bow (Hemp) is Trivial &lt;202 <br />
<br />
Rough Sedgewood Compound Bow (Hemp) is Trivial &gt;206<br />
<br />
Obviously, the earlier reported data that Sedgewood Bowstaves were trivial &lt;202 is incorrect.<br />
<br />
I'm going to be really interested if the Compound bows do end up trivial at 215 as reported. That would mess with the &quot;formula&quot;. I'll let you know as soon as I get some more staves together.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I was selling my products back to the merchant. Like an idiot, I did not record stats on the bows. :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>FentFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The thing to watch on the Shaped Sedgewood bows is that some of the recipes eat the Planing Tool.  I found this out the hard way, and ended up sitting at a Fletching merchant buying the Planing Tool for each combine.  I already had a Scarecrow illusion to help max my Dex (255), so I didn't want to have to run around re-buying components and letting the illusion expire.  Good news is that I got 3 skill-ups across 2 stacks of combines.</div></div><hr />

Is there a specific place then?  I have been there many times and have yet to forage this item.  I've gotten several other things, but not this.</div></div><hr />

fletching nerf?  <br />
I forget when it was, but at one point during PoP several trade skills were made easier, however like 2 were made harder. One of them was fletching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Oualawouzou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ay Kizic, the other one made harder was pottery.<br />
<br />
As for a &quot;specific&quot; EF dungeon, the only one I remember clearly is &quot;The Forgotten Wastes&quot;.  I've done vere few EF LDoN, so I can't recall if I foraged sedge in other ones...  But if my experience in the BB ones holds true, it doesn't matter what instanced zone you get, the forage table is roughly the same.</div></div><hr />
