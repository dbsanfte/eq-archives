I remember reading about new &quot;mini&quot; Terrorantula's being added which drop silks.  Now, I've been mercilessly slaughtering the inhabitants of South Ro, and haven't seen any of these supposed new mobs.  Any insight please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jhavon</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Terrorantulungs are on the Terrorantula cycle in S Ro...you need a tracker to do the cycles, as there's about 5 spawn points, and if the **** dogs pop on the cycle it's a PITA to get them all.<br />
<br />
Check back on the old boards in teh Erudite Cultural threads for info on the cycle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jobrill</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 01:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All I can tell you is the one time I tried it I pretty much went to NRO and killed everything with 8 legs I could see. Saw 2 or 3 of the Terrantulings in about a halfhour period.<br />
<br />
Ended up actually seeing the Terrorantula for the first time. It killed me when I tried to solo it, but some warrior camping the AC who tried to help me out killed it and let me have the Silks that dropped when I ran back from Freeport, So I ended up with 8 swatches for the night. Of course, now I just need to work on the Tradeskills to tailor em. Not sure if I should make the low-level Erudite Cultural, or skip it and skill up on other stuff and use it for Steelweave.<br />
<br />
Not that that really helped, but I felt like saying something  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dregor Thule</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I finally got them to spawn.  After Terrorantula spawned, 3 Terrorantulings spawned soon after, 2 at once and then another just after I killed the first 2.  Saw another of them awhile after that.  So, semi-rare spawn I'd say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jannelle Silverthorne</div><div class="date">12-08-2002, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A tracker isn't strictly needed but helps a lot. The spawn cycle mentioned contains the following mobs with a 30-45 second respawn after the last of a spawn dies.<br />
<br />
a puma  (multiple spawns, typically 3-5)<br />
a sand mummy  (multiple spawns, typically 3-5)<br />
a dune tarantula  (multiple spawns, typically 3-5)<br />
a desert tarantula  (multiple spawns, typically 3-5)<br />
a terrorantuling  (1-3 spawn, haven't seen more than 3)<br />
Terrorantula  (single spawn)<br />
<br />
The trackers way to do this cycle efficiently is to set tracking to &quot;normal&quot; so new spawns are at the top. Then find which mob off the cycle is up and kill every instance of that mob, be it puma's or sand mummies or spiders. Once the last one is dead, another spawn group will pop in 30-45 seconds. Kill all of those, rinse, repeat until terrorantulings or the Terrorantula spawns.<br />
<br />
Note: Sand Giants and the Ancient Cyclops are not on this spawn cycle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can typically get Terror's to spawn by killing spiders, puma's and scarabs.<br />
<br />
Killing all of these for an hour will typically spawn either the big one or the little critters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jhavon</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DUNE spiders aren't on the cycle, and the &quot;A sand mummy&quot; you listed is actually a single spawn named &quot;sand mummy&quot; (no &quot;a&quot;)<br />
<br />
edit -- oh, other than the baby Terrors, all those spawns are in even multiples of 2 (2, 4, 6, *rarely* 8 ) other than the sand mummy</div></div><hr />
