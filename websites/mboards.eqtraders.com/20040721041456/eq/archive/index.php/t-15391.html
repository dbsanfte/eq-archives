Look for the ingredients in MTP to get pricier - haven't checked if the same change applies to the brownies in LFay.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The Steamfont brownies have dropped a variety of things besides brownie parts since the newbie armor quests were added to Ak'Anon.   Brownie parts were never a guaranteed drop from them but they are pretty common.  I forgot if the GFay ones were changed as well to have more in the loot table.  Nillipuss will always drop a brownie part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Torso is new, never saw it before on any brownie.  And the parts do not appear to ever drop in Steamfont now.<br />
<br />
I also don't think that the Iron Oxide ground spawn exists - appears to have been replaced with a mossy drake scale - but that may just be a consequence of regular farming.<br />

Brownie Torsos have in deed been around for a while.  I remember seeing them last year when I would farm for brownie parts in Steamfont.  I used to get a lot of brownie legs too.  The other half of your statement may be true though about the parts being nerfed.  I haven't been there lately to know.:boggled:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lithien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Was there a couple of days ago. Killed 3 brownies and got 3 brownie parts. Luckier than usual, but they still drop... you probably just got a bad run.<br />
<br />
And the iron oxide spawns do exist. That is why I was there. Respawn time is 22.5 hours , so they are just hard to catch. Try do a search in the Pottery forum and you can find loc's and explanations on how to find them.</div></div><hr />

It never ceases to amaze me how people will jump to conclusions on so little data.<br />
<br />
Brownies in Steamfont have had a number of items on their drop tables ever since they introduced teh newbie quests:  A Brownie Leg, A Brownie Brain, A Brownie Torso (no drop), Brownie Parts, An Arrow, misc pieces of rawhide…<br />
<br />
As for Iron Oxide, with all the resent patches, I've not been able to find thegroundspawns, however rather than assume the groundspawns were nerfed or bugged, I think someone must be camped there and logging in right after the patches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aleksandros</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Some good news for young Rangers everywhere with some patience.  The arrows that drop from these brownies seem to be the same ones for the Ranger Ivy Etched Armor quest.  Requires 6 different ones, and they normally drop from the Brownie Outcast in Lesser Faydark, each one Lore and No Drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nillipuss will always drop a brownie part. <br />
<br />
Actually, that isn't true anymore; I've killed him twice recently with no Brownie Parts.</div></div><hr />

Brownies in Steamfont have had a number of items on their drop tables ever since they introduced teh newbie quests:  A Brownie Leg, A Brownie Brain, A Brownie Torso (no drop), Brownie Parts, An Arrow, misc pieces of rawhide… I was in Steamfont 2 days ago gathering supplies and I can confirm what you said. I spent there ~2 hours and I've seen all of the drops you listed including 2 pieces of rawhide. Brownie parts was still by far the most frequent drop with A Brownie Torso being the distant second.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yup, you're right.  I found the Iron Oxide ground spawns, and I've now gotten Brownie Parts from the Mountain Brownies again.  I did have a truly wierd string of identical drops of torsos alone; must have been fun with random numbers.<br />
<br />
One other question:  Is there some different loot code that sets in when mobs drop too fast?  A sort of &quot;mass slaughter&quot; penalty?  Because I have noticed a greater tendency to get no loot when I use AE spells to take down placeholders for mobs that I need something from...<br />
<br />
cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/cries not Nillipuss too.  :(  He was my best source until the mountain brownies moved into Steamfont, and it is just plain pleasurable killing him after he steals the jum jum from Reebo's farm.  I am sure Reebo would give him some if Nillipuss would just ask nicely.  And sigh, I killed him after the bad news and got only a brownie brain - he didn't even steal any jum jum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aamdor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Iron Oxides drop from mobs in The Hole (now Ruins of Old Paineel).  A 3 hour session recently resulted in quite a few O/I and Drops of Mercury also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Iron Oxide still drops as a ground spawn in Steamfont (Iron Oxide = Rust)<br />
<br />
It normally drops on or around the large cog lying on the ground just north of the mino caves. I've seen it spawn in the centre hole, on top of the cog and down the side in the teeth. There is a single spawn in that area and the respawn rate is about the same as the mossy drake scales which also spawn two each, in the two steam plumes in the same area. (This I took from the fact that they popped at the same time for three consecutive spawns)<br />
<br />
However - I have noticed that after a while the iron oxide appears to stop spawning. This I suspect is because it has spawned in a location where I can't get at it, probably inside the cog's mesh. From then on and until the server resets I can't find any in that area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Stonegrabbers in ML drop iron oxide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Corker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">ML??  I am unsure what zone you mean.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">To repeat something that's been said over and over (and over and over) for several years.  Loot for a mob is established when the mob spawns.<br />
<br />
How fast you kill, what you kill it with, what level you are, etc. have absolutely, positively no bearing on what the mob will drop.<br />
<br />
The only thing that really can change what the mob will drop after it spawns is a pickpocket.    :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The brownie guards, brownie and brownie scouts in LFay all have the above &quot;brownie bits&quot; (brains, torso, etc. etc.) in their loot table. Brownie outcasts do not (only drop parts and one of the arrows).<br />
<br />
Btw, if you are worried about faction, you can just kill brownie outcasts as they are not on brownie faction. They are a rare spawn from killing pixie's (and ALL pixie's MUST die) at the pixie tower in LFay. Pixie tricksters and pranksters are on pixie faction - pixie jongleurs are not. As a goodie, don't kill the jongleurs (I think they are tied to some Tunarean-related faction, but not sure).<br />
<br />
Oh, and if you're killing the brownie guards and the dudes inside (3 regular brownies and 1 farmer), be sure to kill the itty baby spiderlings in the brownie fort. They have insane drop rate for spiderling silks and they respawn super fast.</div></div><hr />
