<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jermz</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A very unusual thing happened on my server this past weeked. On Server A thre are three guilds that have killed the Drachnid Queen and are Jagged Pine enabled, 1) Guild 1(they are finished farming there) 2) Guild 2(we have farmed it for just under 2 months now) 3) Guild 3 (they have just started doing some exploration raids there)<br />
<br />
This past weekend as we were awarding Drachnid Queen loot on Saturday noght , Guild 3 who was in the zone mass TLed out and accidently crashed the zone. While we lost the Queen loot for that night we did have another full spawn for the next day.<br />
<br />
We started at 9 am and were past Froststone by 2 or so when Guild 3 zoned in. We got to Terror Carver around 4 pm or so. During this time Guild 3had not killed a mob in the zone. Though one of their rogues did sneak past us and was sitting in the Queens room.<br />
<br />
As we engaged Terror Carver the rogue summond and rezzed a magician corpse in the Queen room away from the warders and as our fight continued they began cothing to the Queens room.<br />
<br />
When terror carver was at 15% somehow a dozen adds started pouring into the room (this had never happened in many fights with this mob before). I am not implying this was an intentional act, in Crystal Caverns anything is possible. Still as we camping to CR Guild 3 had completed cothing and were ready to try the Drachnid Queen. <br />
<br />
We petitioned waited for a couple hours and left since if we killed the Terror carver all that would do is despawn the last warders, not to mention we died 3 times trying to kill her, and then had to leave due to respawns. As a result the other guild had about half a dozen wipes on Queen due to the adds in the 6-8 hours until a GM finally responded to the petitions.<br />
<br />
As a wise GM once said &quot;always /report the times you kill boss mobs&quot;<br />
<br />
This was indeed a perfect case where that sage advice fit. After the GM arrived and looked at all the petitions and reports he DTed the Drachnid Queen. With or without these reports the situation was pretty easy to see. One can even go to Guild 3' home page at removed and look at their list of Crystal Cavern achievements to see whether or not a proper clearing to Queen slaying happened or not.<br />
<br />
This should not turn into an internal server political debate so my question to those familiar with Crystal Caverns is the following:<br />
<br />
- Is it appropriate for guild B to coth past Guild A after guild A has killed all of the mobs that make killing Drachnid Queen without adds possibe?<br />
<br />
and some semi related questions<br />
<br />
- If guild A logs at the Terror Carver before Queen for the night (planning to finish the next day) is it appropriate for another guild to drag a mage corpse and coth to that spot after?<br />
<br />
- Ignoring extra baggage is just the act of killing Queen with the other spawns up legal ie: on sever up coth up kill Queen and leave (my gut feeling is that it is not a rules violation though it may not be the most respected thing to do).<br />
<br />
Feedback and comments would be appreciated. <br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

Changing the names and posting it here doesn't do any good and frankly it probably  makes no sense at all unless you know your actually talking about VT and Aten Ha ra and not silly mobs in jagged pine or crystal caverns or where ever since you can't even seem to keep it straight.<br />
<br />
I'd recommend the mods lock this one sided poorly disguised flame fest before it picks up here too.</div></div><hr />
