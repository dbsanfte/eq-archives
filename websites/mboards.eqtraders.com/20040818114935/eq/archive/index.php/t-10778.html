<br />
so.... thanks.  :)  And for what it's worth, the new site is great!  I love it, the search engine is wonderful.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">{crawls into Morniel's packs, where there's always been a nice nest awaiting her}  Miss you, sweetie, but still not missing the rest of the baggage that comes with logging in to the game.  May be back ... some day.<br />
