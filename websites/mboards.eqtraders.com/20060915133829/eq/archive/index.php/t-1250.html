<br />
I seem to have a quandry in the making.  At least I think so.<br />
<br />
As most of you probably know, I am working on Acrylia Studded and Acrylia Reinforced Armor to work my tailoring up, but Acrylia Reinforced trivials at 242.  Yesterday I did a little bit of searching through EQTraders database to see what I could work on post 242 to try to get to that level we all wish to attain (250).  What I found is that unless I get some help from someone else, it will be impossible for me to go further.  I had some help in the past when I did Wu's to 158 when I had an enchanter friend make Viscious Mana's for me, but looking at some of the other items to be tailored, most will require multiple casts/combines to make components for items that trivial over 242.<br />
<br />
I was never much of a tailor until recently.  I usually did it off and on while leveling up.  When I got tired of killing for exp I'd work on Tailoring or Brewing.  A few months ago a friend of mine asked if I could work my tailoring up to help with a combine for them in making something.  At the time I was at 115 (trivial for Quivers) and decided to give it a go.  I've gotten hooked on building up my skill so I can help other people.  Now that I've come so far I want to continue and reach 250.<br />
<br />
Maybe Verant wanted to make getting to 250 harder than doing it alone, but I try to farm everything and wish to make everything without having to put a burden on other peoples characters.  There does not appear to be anything that I can make (as a Thief), that will not require foraging/enchanting that will get me past 242.  This makes it a disadvantage for those of us who can not do these things.<br />
<br />
Can anyone provide me with some ideas as to what I can look in to that will not require alot of different combines/enchants to make something and still increase my skill?  I'm not too concerned with how rare an item may be (although I've never been to WW so those Mastadon Fur's seem well out of my abilities) just so long as I won't have to ask someone to spend 3 or 4 hours enchanting/foraging for me.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm too concerned and maybe it's easy to get enchanted platinum or imbued chainmail made etc..., who knows... I just don't like having to bother people to do work I'd rather do myself.  No I do not have 2 accounts.  And no I do not have but this one high level character.<br />
<br />
If you wish to send a private note to me in regards to this, please do not hesitate to do so.<br />
<br />
Any assistance would be appreciated,<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Artic Wyvern Hide - Drops off wyverns in Cobalt scar, can usually buy the for around 15pp from the othmir vendors as people often dump them there, or you can go out and hunt em yourself. <br />
<br />
Cod Oil - Cobalt Cod + Water brewed. The cod is fished from Cobalt scar, good thing to do if you are recovering from soloing.<br />
<br />
Velium Studs - Required 4 velium tempers for 3 studs. The velium tempers cost around 9pp if you brew them, 26pp if you buy them from vendor in Thurgaddin.<br />
<br />
Pattern - duh<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delandril</div><div class="date">12-19-2002, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just realized that if you don't have smithing, the studds will be hard for ye to get a hold of, in which case....I suggest you raise smithing to around 180ish for makin your own boning/studs. Otherwise, I think ye may be out of luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pockets FullOfGold</div><div class="date">12-19-2002, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info Delandril.  This looks like a good way to go after trivialing Acrylia Reinforced Armor.  My brewing is approx 145 (don't remember the number right off) and my smithing is currently 77.  Making the Studs doesn't look to be a problem since their trivial is 51.  I can hunt down the Velium bricks like I do Acrylia. :)  It will just require me to work on the Celestial Tempers for the Coldain Velium Temper if I want to make them myself or I can just buy them in Thurgadin and fishing up some Cobalt Cod which shouldn't be too much of a problem with a Fishing skill of 100 :)<br />
<br />
Again, thanks for the info!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fikkwin Rumplenutz</div><div class="date">12-19-2002, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started out and decided as a Halfling Druid (Karana) I would need to make lots of Heady Kiolas and tannins and crap like that, so I raised my brewing up to 166.  I also realized that I would need a Vale sewing kit, needles and other crap like that, so I worked Smithing up to 166 also.  Now I found as I near 200 I need to make lots and lots of Blessed Dust of TUnare, so I raised my Pottery, currently 122.  Well, somewhare along the line I decided that having stat foods would help also so I raised my baking to 192.  <br />
<br />
I guess that the moral of the story is if you want to be a tailor raise everything. :roll:</div></div><hr />
