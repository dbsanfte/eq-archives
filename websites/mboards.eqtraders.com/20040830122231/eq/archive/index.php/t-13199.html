<br />
Don't know about other servers, but Vazaelle had the vendor giving away the temper for free about 7 weeks ago. GM came and despawned him - he stayed away until the December patch. When he came back, they'd taken the temper out of his inventory.<br />
<br />
Not sure if he'll ever sell it again, but plenty of people now selling in the Bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeh, but rofl not a chance I'm gonna spend 100pp per temper, that all the people in baz sell for, I am aware of the bug with the vendor an they took it away, suppose when the new ui comes out I'll be able to make these tempers really easily but was hoping to max off my tailoring before then,... kind of annoying, but I've failed grimel tunic 17 times so far, at 240+, so thought I'd try to max it off. But I dont really want to spend 2k per stack from those people in baz... Aina~</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">on the other hand making CVT only costs about 9-10PP to make perhaps they had a supply left over and just wanted to be rid of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i doubt that.  they would destroy it or sell at at least 20pp.  nobody would have &quot;extra&quot; to sell at cost.  they either wouldn't care about the pp or they would need every cp much less pp they could get.</div></div><hr />

last weekend, i put all the items in loom with 223 tailoring +geerlok... closed my eyes, hit combine<br />

taking a small peek, i see the robe on my cursor.....<br />
<br />
fletching and baking maxed.. guild provided all fletching items and already had a stack of Party Platters....<br />
<br />
finished my earring the next morning and Aug'd it with a 20hp/mana from Guk<br />
<br />
one thing i have been hearing is alot of people with 240+ skill have been failing it alot more that people with a skill of 220-225 so i figuired i would give it a shot before doing more skill up.. at 235 so far....<br />
<br />
Gratz me :) (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=74094)<br />
<br />
i have noticed skill ups were the worse between 191-220, 221-235 (where i am now) have not been nearly as brutal<br />

almost in the 1750 club :)</div></div><hr />

Holy cripes, I'm feeling uber in my guild atm cause I have, *2*, count em, TWO platters.  And those 2 platters cost me about 6k plat...</div></div><hr />

<br />
CVT sells for 8-10pp each on Drinal.<br />
<br />
At 100pp each, why not make your own.  They cost about 10pp to make.  When the new tradeskill UI goes live, I can see them coming down, because they will be easier to make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well on Vazaelle people try to sell them for 100pp each and lowest I've ever seen is 90pp per. Course when the new UI goes live any trivial combine that is sold in baz will sell for much less, doesn't even take thinking to figure out that one.. I was asking on here if anyone knew how to resupply the npc, as per what gm told me, guess there isn't a way :boggled: oh well +/</div></div><hr />

Why do you say this about some new UI?<br />
<br />
I fail to understand your post, and am just seeking clarification why you think the cost of temper will suddenly decrease?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />

 <br />
<br />
There is a new UI that will be on live servers soon, eta unknown.  It is currently on test servers.  There is a huge thread in the general section of these boards on it.  It will make clicking combines easier, hence easier to make CVTs, hence lower price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>drtyaty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, that sucks imo.  Sounds like it will certainly make mastering any tradeskill that much easier.<br />

What a bunch of crap.</div></div><hr />

But I've still got a few tradeskills left to GM, so it will help out somewhat.  I'm just not looking forward to all the competition that there's going to be for all the forges.  They seriously need to increase the number of forges in PoK and elsewhere.  Or make them multi-user capable.  Because 4 forges just isn't cutting it.  Neither is 2 brew barrels...2 ovens...2 pottery wheels...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Lixivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">i can see why people dont want to make them, considering they are a royal pain in the ass. after the first 10000 CE i've has to make for other tradeskills, there is no way was going to make 80 just to get ONE stack of tempers. i dont care if they only cost 10pp to make.<br />
<br />
i will not buy CE's, and i will make them when i have to, but man 80 for 1 stack is too much, considering how many i used for tailoring. i'm glad i was able to buy them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Saleani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The alleged resupply quest that folks were doing was to trigger the 10th ring war and deliberatly lose it (or provoke a zone crash). That avenue has been fixed, so you cannot do that anymore. The vendor will now repop with no tempers. <br />

I would use /bug and /feedback about this and other tradeskill recipes that got smacked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">On Brell CVT's are now going in bazaar anywhere from 25 pp (very low) to 100 pp each!<br />
As if it didn't take enough time to do our trades we now either pay these crazy prices Or make them ourselves (add another 2 - 3 hours a week to our combines-or more)<br />
<br />
I for one refuse to pay that much, no way at all lol.  Just make my own..../em grumbles at the extra time that is going to take.<br />

Definately will /feedback this one.<br />

<br />
I found coldain velium tempers for sale on a merchant today for 5 plat and change each.<br />
<br />
They were a small ways down on his list, so I'm not sure if they were sold to him recently or not, but he had more than 20 stacks on him.  The servers reset this morning and there was a message about tradeskilled item price exploits being fixed.  So maybe the stuff is back.<br />
<br />
They used to cost 25 plat or more each, so I suspect that the exploit in question was brewing them for 10-15 plat each and selling em to a merchant for 20.  Ugh.  What a lot of carpal-tunnel syndrome for 5 plat.<br />
<br />
I didn't have time to poke around Thurgadin yet, but I suspect I'll be in Crystal Caverns all night tonight :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">no the exploit in question was he gave them away for nothing.  then people sol them in the bazaar because he also paid nothing for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Found tempers for 5-6 pp on two merchants in Thurg. Are they back on vendors? No-one is selling them in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Probably just someone sold his tempers to the vendor.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Marinoni Oakenshield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I found them in PoTranquility, by the bank, the lone vendor there (white robe, his name escapes me, by the soulbinder). They were 7th down in his inventory, below his usual stuff. They were selling for 5 plat 9 gold 5 silver 2 copper each. I bought them all. I resold them for 25 plat each and made a huge profit. He had 50 stacks.<br />
<br />
I can't see someone dumping them there, but you never know. They were there right after a patch. This was on Brell.</div></div><hr />

I'm thinking he means he sold them in the bazaar for 25pp.<br />

At least that's how I read it.</div></div><hr />

The price change is live, but Nimren in Thurgadin still is not selling them, as of January 26th on Zeb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Dawnlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I also found a ton of these on a vendor for the 5pp price.  Was in Thurgadin off the 2 baking vendors in the bank.  Both were about 3rd-5th down their lists beneath other player sold things.  I bought 500 and stuffed them onto a mule for later use before I gave up on trying to guess how many they had, both vendors still had them afterwards.  <br />
<br />
Dunno what's going on unless people who exploited and bought them at 0pp (I know of a few people on Fennin who filled 4-5 mules of nothing during this =/) are hearing the rumors about them going live again and selling them back.  Or they needed to delete that mule to make a new character.  /shrug  I just wish I'd been able to buy them for 5pp each when i went through 3000+ for smithing and tailoring instead of the 10-20pp I paid in bazaar :boggled:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>kekenewah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I found a PoK NPC selling CVTs for 5p and some change today.  They where located down in her inventory pretty far like someone had sold them to her.  I have bought 85 stacks so far and she is still selling them.  I logged onto another server (Druzzil Ro) and checked the same NPC.  She was not selling them.  Now how/ why would an NPC have that much inventory for CVTs that must have been sold to her by a player.  Only one player on Drinal is selling CVTs in bazaar atm, at 15pp each (he has 860 some CVT total for sale).  Something screwy is going on.  Is Yantis dumping CVTs he put on mules when they where available for free in THurgadin? I don't know but if someone does know I would like to hear what the answer is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">CVT are back on Nimren in Thurgadin with this patch, selling for 6 pp or less, depending on CHA. Haven't checked the POK vender.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>drtyaty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Confirming that CVT are back at the original vendor selling for 6pp or less; guess those bazaar people can sell for less than that or keep them on their mules; ha ha.
