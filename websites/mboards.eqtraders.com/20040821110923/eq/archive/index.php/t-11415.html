<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nihixul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have looked at the recent posts of skillup data for people with high WIS/INT, but didn't see any for DEX. The reason I am asking is that I once made my ENC do JC up to 240 with high INT (about 240-252 depending upon buff, etc).  I have also done many other tradeskills, and as a mathematician, I am very aware of what the RNG can do. However, today I decided to take my main (Urnihixul, ROG), and get him to 200 (from what was his current 149). My dex is 250-ish, unbuffed, so away I went.... and I went.... and I went. I felt it was going a bit slow, so I rechecked the site to make sure JC skillups really do look at DEX, too, and alas there it was. *whew* <br />
<br />
I figure the RNG is having its way with me, but I had plenty of time, so I didn't really care. Now, however, it has gotten a bit ridiculous. I am at 180, and over the past 20 or more skillups I have averaged somewhere between 40-50 combines per. I have had several stretches of 60, 80, even 100 combines without a skillup. The ONLY &quot;good run&quot; I had was a stack in which I had 4 skill ups, 3 quite close. I haven't even hit the hell levels (or at least the ones I am used to) yet!<br />
<br />
Being JC, and considering the current stretch is gold/cheap gems, I am not losing much money. It is just REALLY getting annoying. If it's just me, that's fine. Tomorrow's another day, but doing 1400 combines or so is a rather large data sample. Believe me, I wouldn't have posted this were it just a small bad run.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, my questions are: <br />
<br />
Has anyone here recently done a skillup run with high DEX? (or can point me to a post detailing such)<br />
<br />
Although I remember my ENC's run went rather smoothly, is this average rate expected? Do hell levels in JC tend to run earlier than... well... just about anything else I have done? :P<br />
<br />
Anyhow, thanks for the help. I really didn't want to post &quot;yet another RNG rant&quot;, but I just can't quite make sense of this. I am really thinking about digging up my wis gear from my various alts and switching to that. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mizoto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">AFAIK, and others can confirm for me as well, JC takes the best of WIS or INT for skillups.  I recall DEX being helpful in Tailoring, but I think that was proven wrong too.<br />
<br />
Mizoto</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nihixul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">According to the FAQ (and various other sources, including the character creation page), WIS/INT helps for all, but DEX helps in JC, Fletching, (and poison making), and STR helps in Smithing. <br />
<br />
Anyhow, last night I trudged on to 187. It got a little better, quite reasonable. If it continues, I am willing to believe I just had a long, long slow streak. I will keep ya posted. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ChaseFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't have any stats, but I did skill up to 200 JC using DEX, and did reasonably well. I think except when you're going the long stretches (when you switch from one metal to the next), you should average 30 combines/skillup.<br />
<br />
C</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nihixul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok. That works for me. :)<br />
<br />
I have recently used the auxiliary stat STR in doing smithing, and that worked quite well, so I just needed a little assurance. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lushissx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am a bard and did JC to 250 a couple months ago. I had my dex at 280 most of the time and had the same issue as you. About 5000 combines and numerous failures(about8-10%) I was extremely frustrated and have serious doubts that dex is checked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm pretty sure the myth of dex and jc was stated that it had no effect on skill ups a few months ago.  I'm guessing they never updated the FAQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Tinile - Stats and Tradeskills (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=31) is correct. :) <br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>adamrussell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yea, I dont know about the dex thing either.  Im currently at 194 and it is taking 100's of combines for each point.  This is with 262 dex.<br />
<br />
After too many combines per skillup I decided to measure it.<br />
current skill         combines to skillup<br />
194                      16  <br />
195                      110<br />
196                      68<br />
197                      117<br />
<br />
This is a L62 bard with base 175 dex and an extra 87 dex provided with katta's song of sword dancing for a total 262 dex.  I realize this is only 4 points but there were several points before that not recorded but certainly in the 100's per skillup.  Is it possible they changed it so dex doesnt work, or that the bard dex buff does not help?  I chose this tradeskill because its easier for a bard to get high dex than wis/int (I just want the trophy), but at this rate it seems like I cant make it because my combines/skillup are going too high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nihixul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Originally posted by Lothay <br />
Tinile - Stats and Tradeskills (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=31) is correct. :) <br />
<br />
Thank you.  <br />
<br />
how so? i am quite convinced at this point (having gone through it with HIGH dex and LOW wis/int (&lt;100)), that dex plays no part in JC skill-ups. the character creation screen confirms this:<br />
<br />
&quot;If your dexterity is higher than your intelligence or wisdom, it determines how quickly you gain skill in Fletching and Make  Poison.&quot;<br />
<br />
The page you link includes JC in that, which I don't think is correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Feh - <br />
<br />
Trust me to link an old page.   <br />
<br />
Feh - Trust me not to check the FAQ forum before linking.... Espeically when I'm the one responsible for maintaining it... <br />
<br />
<br />
So I just fixed it.  Please ignore the link above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ChaseFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You might want to add that information to the FAQ for this specific forum as well.<br />
<br />
And in light of the recent pricing changes detailed in a nearby thread, change the answer to the FAQ about whether or not enchanting jewelry has an effect on the sell-back price.</div></div><hr />
