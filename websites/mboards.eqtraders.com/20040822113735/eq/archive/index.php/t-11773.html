There was a good post on this , but I cant seem to find it... and on my browser doesnt show page 2+ on pottery.<br />

Any input please ??<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Quikpick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I made unfire planar steins up to 216 because I had access to lots of Tainted Planar Essence. From there, I made unfired opal encrusted steins to 222. From that point, I did combines of either unfire crucibles of esacpe or unfired idols. The crucibles are the way to go if you are cost conscious, however it will take a really long time to farm the heavy clay if you plan on using them to skillup to 236 from the low 200s. People like doing the white ceramic bands to 231 but the unfired idols are cheaper if you can find a CT or EM imbuer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did mostly unfired planar steins as well up to 216.  Followed that with mostly unfired opal encrusted steins to 222.  Followed that with a mixture of fired star ruby encrusted steins and Tunare Idols both for the Solstice Earring quest.  The loss on the star ruby steins is not huge for the successful ones, but, success rate is low.  I actually have made a decent profit off the Tunare Idols, and have been doing so since the mid 180s.  Would do more of them, but, each individual one is a bit pricey to make, and a pain, as you need both imbued emeralds, and vials of distilled mana.  So far, this has taken me to 230, I plan on continuing this route to 242, then star ruby steins to finish it up to 250.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Malodium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did 400 star ruby stein combines last night to get me from 226 to 245.<br />
I had three stacks left when I hit 245, and not one skill up in the last three stacks *cry*<br />
Anyway, you lose a lot of plat with these even at high levels.<br />
I was only succeeding on 50% of the combines at 245, if that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">bleh...pottery sucketh...<br />
<br />
I did opal steins, some star ruby steins, but i'm sticking with unfired idols of tunares since they are cheaper per combine than star ruby steins and I don't have to mess with trying to resell them for barely what they cost...<br />
<br />
<br />
five freakin' more points to go...=P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Liwsa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did:<br />
opal steins to 222.<br />
white bands to 231.<br />
green bands to 242.<br />
star ruby steins to 250.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>furnok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you are not worried about doing skill ups and destroying the goods when you are finished, then I suggest you make Idols of Bristlebane from 200+.<br />
<br />
Trivial = 250.<br />
Cost per Attempt = ~25 pp, if you have your own cleric and enchanter.<br />
<br />
Requires:<br />
Imbued Peridot (Bristlebane)<br />
Vial of Clear Mana (Poison Vial and Emerald)<br />
Large Block of Magic Clay<br />
Sculpting Tools<br />
Idol Sketch<br />
<br />
Peridots cost my cleric 10.5 pp.  Emeralds are 13.5 pp.  Magic Clay is 0.15 pp.  Poison Vial is 0.15 pp (until they fix the merchant price).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Korrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bristlebane Idol?<br />
<br />
Don't all idols require &quot;Distilled Mana&quot; (cost over 200pp) not &quot;Clear Mana&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There are 2 types of idols, the Golden Idols, which take distilled mana and the old world idols which take clear.  The clear mana idols are the ones folks skill up on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Golden Idols of Tunare (yes, the distilled mana ones) sell in the bazaar at a profit, even if you have to purchase the ingredients in the bazaar, including the mana vials.  At a success rate of about 50%, I was breaking even on them, making money when I had a friendly enchanter summon the mana vials.  You do need a fairly large amount of cash on hand for the initial outlay if you are going to skill up with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sehra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Idols of CT and Rallos trivial at 248. Do BB idols go to 250? All of the non-golden I've tried are 248 :(<br />
<br />
40 star ruby steins into 248 so far *grumble*<br />
<br />
EDIT: Made 250 thanks to some people on the channel. Jade and Amber trivial &lt;= 248, but TOPAZ trivials &gt;= 250 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tudamorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The first time I went to 250 I used opal steins to 222 then star ruby steins -- of course star ruby steins were new and sold for 1K+ back then, and you could make a profit while skilling up.<br />
<br />
Now (recently) I did opal steins to 222 then unfired idols (using imbued emerald -- not golden idols) to 250.  Had some slow going during the 220s and 230s with many points taking 40-100 combines, but I attributed that to the pottery nerf some time ago and/or bad luck.<br />
<br />
The idols are definitely the way to go today, since the star ruby steins sell for crap, vendor or bazaar.  Each stack of idols cost me 552 platinum, whereas just lacquering a stack of star rubies would cost over 1.4K per stack on average.  If you are able to imbue a gem cheaper than emerald, you are even better off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I eventually sold all my star ruby encrusted steins in the bazaar for 100 to 120pp each.  With something approaching a 50% success rate, that returned about 1.1k per stack of attempts.  Net cost was thus reduced significantly.  To help pay for that I made as many Golden Idols of Tunare as I could scrounge up ingredients for, as they sold at a profit quite regularly, even when success rate was 50%.</div></div><hr />
