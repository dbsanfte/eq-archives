Drop rates in ME on gorangas suck, drop rates off grimlings in GF suck, acrylia caverns seems good but man..it's very very difficult for a wizard to solo there, even at 62.<br />
<br />
Suggestions appreciated.</div></div><hr />

It is a tough zone for myself as well (Level 58 Thief).  What I have found to be a good source of Acrylia is the Grimling Caves in Tenebrous Mountains.  There are 2 caves but I am specifically referring to the one where a NPC mob called &quot;Grimling Laborer&quot; spawns.  While not great at dropping Acrylia, the Laborer will drop Acrylia on average about 1 out of 2 or 3 times.  Mostly 1 brick and 1 piece of Acrylia, but I've seen different drop rates.  As well in both caves in TM, the Grimling Orefinders can drop Acrylia.  There are 14 mobs inside the caves and they are aggie all but are easy to kill since they turn green at about level 50, with the exception of the Grimling Foreman who is still light blue to me at 58.  The caves are on a 12 minute repop timer, so you do not have to wait very long to go and kill all of them all over again.  If the Caves are camped, search out Grol Baku Soldiers or the Grol Baku Warlord.  These can also drop Acrylia.<br />
<br />
The one thing I really like about camping the Laborer cave is the fact that you can make a large amount of PP inside the cave.  Both caves are good for PP though.  I have made as much as 1200 PP in a 5 to 6 hour period.  I can average about 600 to 700 PP in about 4 hours.  The runes they drop range from 9 CP to 9 PP.  The weapons sell like FS and the Rocks/Gems they drop sell from 2 PP to 114 PP.  Just about everything stacks so it's easy to make alot of PP.  This is with a Cha of 111.  Most of you probably don't care too much about what drops except for the items you are looking for but I loot everything and will sell it.  Even the 9 CP Runes add up.  The only thing I don't keep are the Grimling Bloods, I just destroy them.<br />

I had four backpacks full of acrylia bricks in an hour.  After a while, the grol bakus will start to run out, so you can farm grimlings for a while until they repop.  Once your backpacks are full, convert the ore into tailoring supplies in Katta and by the time you're done, the grol bakus should be mostly repopulated.</div></div><hr />
