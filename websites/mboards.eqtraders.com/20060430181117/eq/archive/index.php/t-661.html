<br />
2. With Str being the secondary characteristic for smithing, which of the following is true:<br />
      A. If your str is higher than your int/wis, then your str will be used to determine a skillup<br />
      B. You have a chance to skill up according to your wis/int. If you fail you have a chance to skill up base on str?<br />
In other words, with 250 wis will it help to work on my getting my str to 250?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xorshaik</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I took the question a little differently...<br />
<br />
Compare this with perhaps monk defensive skill checks...<br />
<br />
With a monk, and although I am one I have no clue the order this happens, but:<br />
<br />
Skill check dodge:<br />
<br />
if the mob passes the dodge skill check, skill check block:<br />
<br />
if the mob passes the block skill check, check avoidance portion of AC:<br />
<br />
and so on... That's what it takes to hit a monk.<br />
<br />
I think the question is if skill checks on STR work similarly if you have a second stat that his high, IE high STR on a combine fails the skill check for a skillup, does it then check against INT?<br />
<br />
If that is the question, maybe (to be fair) the answer isn't as explicitly given... But I think the answer is that there is a check made only against the one highest of the attributes between INT/WIS/STR... I would expect that if it wasa skill check first against the highest of the 3, the wording we've officially received would have been different<br />
<br />
Bear with me on the use of skill check, I know the attribute check is different for a skill check, that an attribute check affects skill increases whereas skill level affects successes...<br />
<br />
I do think the question is worthwhile and not easily seen that it is answered: Does 2 stats at 255 produce better results than 1 stat at 255?<br />
<br />
I know some folks get STR up and still get a KEI..<br />
<br />
And the fact is, there will always be voodoo, ceremonial dances and superstitions people do.. In all these cases, it might sometimes feel like it works, it might sometimes feel like it hurts, but the fact is that RNG is so fubar that you never really can be sure, can ya?</div></div><hr />
