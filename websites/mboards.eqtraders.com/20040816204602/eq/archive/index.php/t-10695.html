<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>WhiteRoze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Could someone please post the recipe for this drink? I saw this drink being sold at the Bazaar and would like to make it.<br />
<br />
I can't seem to find it in the Brewing section, nor by doing a search for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nimphe Wildwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Fizzlecutter Formula 5000 -- sold by Ping Fizzlecutter in West Freeport newbie area.<br />
<br />
It cannot be player made.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>salomeasillverfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Which is a crying shame :(  Sal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I certainly agree.  We should be able to make several types of drinks with different durations.  Every expansion I hope to see such recipes added, but nothing so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If not fizzlecutter 5000, then something like it.  A long-lasting drink that is simple to make.  Sorta like Fish Rolls for Drinks.<br />
<br />
My pleas are that it shall be 1) simple to make (i.e.  few combines), 2) NOT require any foraged/dropped items, 3) be inexpensive to produce.  <br />
<br />
Put the triv up at 122 to match fetid essence so it doesn't become a high-end ladder but not simple to produce either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">there is a thread on how long stuff lasts.  LOTS of stuff is listed.  link (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5208&amp;highlight=duration)   unfortunately its in the baking forum</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>YurienStonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">if you want long lasting drinks make grobb liquid meat or qeynos afternoon tea. GLM can be made with everythign in SH and is fairly cheap not to mention each combine returns 6. QAT is the same except for the tea elaves. if you can get the elaves for under 30p then you are doing fairly well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>salomeasillverfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">okay guess the previous poster missed the wish for easy to make and one that does not require foraging. For those two reasons thats why I continue to buy my drink, its cheaper and easier that way even though I would prefer to make it myself.  <br />
GLC requires a gazzillion combines and a corking device. QAT requires an expensive foraged item. /shrug. I still agree, wish they had some other alternatives. Sal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>YurienStonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">GLm is very easy to make. and as for the corking device you'll have to buy one eventually anyways for the trophy os get the materials and give a gnome 50p to make it for you. tht's what i did. the onyl time consuming part of the GLM is the liquid meat part but i usually make it while i'm in the baz in trader mode and talking to friends. just me i guess /shrug</div></div><hr />
