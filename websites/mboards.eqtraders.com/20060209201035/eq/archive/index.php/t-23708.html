<br />
My paladin will hopefully be 65 here in the next month or two and I'd really like to buy him a set of the Grandmaster DoN Cultural Armor (Protectorate).  I have yet to see any for sale on Tunare :(  I will also want the GM Augs that go with that set (Integrity).  <br />
<br />
No idea how much this is going to cost me, but I've started to save up, in hopes of finding someone out there who can help!  I'd like to farm some of the items involved if possible to cut down on costs.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I've come here because, as I said previously, I've yet to see ANY Protectorate Armor for sale and haven't seen any Integrity augs for sale in the last couple weeks.  <br />
<br />
Someone has to be out there! Come on GM Smithy Froggies! I need you!!!! :)<br />
Reply here and/or send me a Private Message on this board :) <br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Still no replies here so I've started to up my frog's smithing ..in the mid 180s right now, and already burnt out :(  Would still like to hear from someone on Tunare that can make some peices for me!<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone!</div></div><hr />
