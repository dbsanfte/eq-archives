I must have gotten a good version, I have had no problems with it up to now, and I am comfortable with it.<br />
<br />
However, I want to upgrade my RAM. I have 512, and was thinking of going up to 1024. A friend informed me that WIN 98 will only recognize the first 512 MB of RAM, and will ignore the rest. A second friend countered this saying that it will recognize it, but will not use it.<br />
<br />
To sum up, I do not want to buy RAM my machine will not use. Will WIN 98 allow me to fully utilize 1024 MB of RAM?<br />
<br />
If not, which windows OS is the most EQ AND user-friendly that will?</div></div><hr />

I have yet to have a rblem with EQ and win 2k professional, but it is harder to find in stores and I haven't heard of problems with eq and win xp (go pro) either.  SO either of them should work.</div></div><hr />

Hands down.<br />
<br />
I have no floppy drive, old chipset, and havent updated drivers since carter was in office.<br />
<br />
So I crash.<br />
<br />
If you get all the driver updates, and service packs, and take care of it, XP will rock for you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dunthor Warsmith</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 06:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been running EQ for about a year and a half now on Win2k Pro (clean install, not upgrade from 98 ).  I like Win2k as it still feels like Win95/98, but is MUCH more stable (for me at least) and still runs all my applications well (except DOS applications), including EQ.  I have a few rare crash-to-desktop problems with EQ, but not enough to really impact gameplay or be more than a small annoyance, and that's more EQ's problem than my machine's.<br />
Other than that, my *only* problems with gaming have been some graphics issues, which based on my searching help databases, drivers, and people with similar machines, leads me to believe I've either run into an extremely rare flaw in DirectX and T&amp;L, or my video card has defects in the T&amp;L system, which would not be related to the OS.<br />
<br />
I've been debating upgrading to WinXP, but have decided against it for the time being.<br />
-) Win2k is still fully supported by Microsoft and modern applications. (naturally, don't know when this will end)<br />
-) Win2k has no product activation mechanism, WinXP does.  That's more hassle than I want to deal with if I can reasonable avoid it.<br />
-) Win2k has fewer privacy and &quot;Evil MS&quot; concerns than WinXP<br />
-) I have been extremely happy with Win2k.  It has proven reliable, stable, and able to recover from far more situations than I am used to.  So its akin to the old adage, &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot;<br />
<br />
Since you're upgrading either way, WinXP Pro might be a better investment, just for the &quot;future proofing&quot;.  But I'm going to put my recommendation in for Win2k Pro - I've used it and been very happy with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lothay</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 07:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you do decide on XP, don't get XP Pro unless you really need the Server style features.  <br />
<br />
Windows XP Home will serve you just as well, and is a bit cheaper.  Unless you really need to run a web or database server off your home machine, you'd be spending money for features you really don't need. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ngreth Thergn</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 09:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And the proper thing is.  Windows 98 does not PROPERLY support &gt;512 ram.<br />
<br />
So normally, it will be ignored.<br />
<br />
in some cases, it can even cause problems.  I remeber a change in a setting somewhere was needed to make EQ stable if you had &gt;512 RAM.<br />
<br />
Now saying that.  some individual programs, running on win98 would utilize &gt;512 ram (EQ is not one of them)  An example would be Photoshop, shich is a memor hog, and will take all memory it can get, including &gt;512 ram on win 98.<br />
<br />
But for the norm... &gt;512 on 98 is a waste.<br />
<br />
I agree with the general concensus to go to WinXP.  It is suprisingly stable for a Microsoft product (not perfect of course... but stable nonetheless).  But it isx a memory hog... were you would want the 1024 (win XP wants 128... though it MAY run on less)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kirstin Thornhill</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, one other question:<br />
<br />
Can I CTRL-ALT-DEL with XP (Home or Pro) to get to the &quot;Close Program&quot; window and shut down all programs not absolutely essential to minimum OS operation, internet connection, and EQ (like I can in WIN98)?<br />
<br />
Right now in WIN98 I have Explorer, Systray, Rnaapp, and Everquest running (while I am EQing) with my dial up. (No firewall, I am not broadband and usually an attempt to get into my machine knocks me offline before it gets anywhere...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kirstin Thornhill</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, while shopping I found 3 versions of WIN XP:<br />
<br />
WIN XP Home<br />
WIN XP Home OEM version <br />
WIN XP Upgrade  (the one I am currently leaning toward...)<br />
<br />
What is OEM? Is there any advantage or disadvantage between an upgrade and a format/new install?  <br />
<br />
<br />
By the way, thanks for all the help. I felt kinda comfortable asking here after listening to serverwide:eqtraders chat sessions occasionally revolving around this some nights...</div></div><hr />

In addition to showing you a list of all programs/applications running, it can also show you a detailed list of all systedm processes running, who is running them, and how much of your precious System resources they are taking.<br />

OEM stands for Original Equipment Manufacturer. You do not make and sell PCs yourself, so you do not want this version.  You can save a few bucks buying the upgrade, BUT it WILL check for a valid version of 95/98/Me BEFORE installing, so if you have to reinstall and don't have your 95/98/Me CD handy, you are out of luck.<br />
<br />
Unless you are a packrat and very money constrained, buy the Home version.<br />
<br />
And Lilosh, you can hit ctl-shift-esc to bring up the task manager in one go.  The end now button is broken too.  Windows decides what it will allow you to end now, and it's not a lot really - at least none of the processes I want to gun will die peacefully. (edit: to answer Kirstin's question, yes, you can).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, nice shortcut.<br />
<br />
I've had very very few problems ending processes.<br />
<br />
When Iexplore causes my system ti hang, BOOM.<br />
When EQ Gets retarded, and the Task Manager is able to come up, BOOM.<br />
<br />
Of course, running EQ in windowed mode seems to take up SO MUCH of my resources, it seems to prevent me from pressing Ctrl-Alt-Delete.<br />

As the others said, CTRL + Shift + Esc brings up the task manager in XP (and 2k, incidentally).  However, that's only half the task.  You should also go through Services.  I used to have a link to a website that explains all the stock services in 2k/XP, what they do and whether you need them or not.  I'll have to dig it up to post it, if you're interested.<br />
