<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lorindar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In the Dev chat for 3rd of Feb 2004 the follow Q/A appeared<br />
<br />
Will the new trade skill Quests be anything like as complex as the prayer shawl or solstice earring quests for us tradeskill junkies?<br />
<br />
There are quests for almost every trade skill in Gates though they aren't as intensive as the shawl quests, they should prove to be beneficial and fun.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
So emm these are the quests that allow the conversion, one that requires forage, a fishing one with a illusion troll potion as reward, and bakeing brewing stuff for faction ?<br />
<br />
I must be missing something?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In this case, I am not sure we have found the quests (and I am hoping they aren't the progressive training ones).   Seems like one of them might have to do with Chef Chowderly, but he won't talk to anyone.  I think the fishermen may have a quest or two as well but the trigger items haven't gone live (like perhaps the rainbow trout that was mentioned in one of the patch messages but no one has ever seen.)  <br />
<br />
Maybe it is just me but I am optimistic the quests are out there but may be broken at the moment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One of the earlier steps requires you to have very good faction with the yunjo.<br />
<br />
There are two ways to rais yunjo faction. Kill thousands of mobs in the Riwi arena. Note not all mobs in the arena give yunjo faction hits.<br />
<br />
OR the much quicker way to bake and brew New GOD recipe stuff to feed to the junjo slaves in riwi. The more complex the food/drink you feed em the bigger the faction hit.<br />
<br />
Another step also requires a jewelry combine.<br />
<br />
Yet another step requires you have a fairly good begging skill.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are several NPC's that won't speak to me yet or are waiting for turn in items found in the GOD zones.<br />
