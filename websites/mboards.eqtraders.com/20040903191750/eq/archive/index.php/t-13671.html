<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Finae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The other day i am asked to make earth robe and legs, havin never made this stuff i am kinda afraid to make em, anyways i do.<br />
Made the robe first try failed on legs figured 50% not bad, Now i have done one fire legs, fail, 3 earth robes fails, isnt this seeming low making rate or this normal to fail so many? Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dagarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I assume you have the maximum modified skill (252) or you are wasting the precious components and are better off having a GM tailor attempt these items.<br />
I have attempted dozens (many) of EP tailored (as well as smithed) armors and can say that my success rate has been roughly 50%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">while it's a 50-50 shot at success (at best), going 1 for 6 attempts is easily reproducable.  the larger the number you do, the more closely your success percentage will get to the actual success chance for a single combine...<br />
<br />
...in other words.... you've done 6 combines, that's not a whole lot.  When you finish off 600, and figure out your success rate, you'll be a lot closer to knowing what the actuall success rate is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeh, it really bites on elemental combines.    I've have my 1 for 8 runs.. but in the end it averages out.  I've also gone 4 for 5.. wish that'd happen more often. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GuildorOJemz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The only elemental combines I've tried are earthweave ( other components priced ridiculously high on Torvo ... earth drops are 10k or less usually ).  I'm 2 for 5.<br />

Attempts - <br />

1) sleeves - fail<br />
2) sleeves - success<br />
3) robe - fail<br />
4) robe - fail<br />
5) robe - success<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've gone 5 for 5 on earth legs and 0 for 8 on sleeves. Overall I'm probably 50% after 30+ combines. The RNG gets streaky at times. Altho you do seem to notice the long streams on fails more :(</div></div><hr />
