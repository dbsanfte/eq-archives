<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Breez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently I learned of the location in Halas where Mino Hero Brew Items and Brew barrel are all in 1 room.<br />
<br />
Recently I learned that all Celestial Essence items are located near Fishing pond in PoK, I had been running to Bazaar and EC.<br />
<br />
I have been doing my 10lb Halas Pie combines in Thrug, as everything is either at bank or Oven.  ( open to suggestions about a better place tho)<br />
<br />
I am finished with 8th shawl and am making my push towards 1450 (1325 currently) and I find myself looking at pushing Pottery from 168 to 199 on Casserole Dishes.  <br />
<br />
I know I will need <br />
water flask x2, large block of clay, casserole dish sketch, quality firing sheet, unfired ceramic lining, ceramic lining sketch, small block of clay  <br />
<br />
Per combine, and I found that ceramic lining sketch are sold in MANY more places than I 1st believed...<br />
<br />
My question is, is there a good place ANY where to get all these items with the least amount of running?<br />
<br />
In other words, did you find a non-annoying location to do you skill ups?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">jp for the casserole sketch.  is verry near a bank so i would suggest thurg, pok, or another zone with bank and pottery stuff close together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Casserole dish sketch is only sold in Jaggedpine, no way around that.  The rest can all be bought in PoK pottery area.  Elisha and the dwarf across sell all the pottery things you need, you can get water flask from the Vah Shir smithing vendor in the building west of Elisha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm almost positive I saw the casserole sketch on the Queen of Thorns pottery vendor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bindamel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't have GoD, so I don't know about locations other than JaggedPine for casserole sketches.<br />
<br />
I like Shadowhaven (short area) for the location of parts for Ceramic Linings.  Gukta is also good, and I've never run into someone else using the wheel. (or the zone, really)<br />
<br />
Somebody much cleverer than myself mentioned that you can set an alt in JPF and have them use shared bank plat to buy the sketches, and put them in the shared bank.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Crystal Thrall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've recently found my new home for tradeskilling.  This place has everything you need (I think, I've yet to prove this but so far so good) on a merchant, plenty of banks, plenty of general stuff (water flasks, etc.), and is extremely tradeskill friendly despite its out of the way location on the world map.<br />
<br />
This place is the Abysmal Sea.<br />
<br />
If you don't mind waiting for the boat to come (which usually doesn't take that long), this place has everything...and I do mean everything.  I found the best place for pottery in AS is right up the stairs from the dock that the boat ferry boat from Nedaria's Landing drops you off at.  There's a pottery wheel and a Kiln right next to each other.  AND, best of all, the pottery merchant here has Ceramic Lining AND Casserole Dish sketches.  Once you get to know the layout and location of the merchants and tradeskill equipment, you will praise this zone.  Also, the ambience of Abysmal Sea is just cool, too...despite the &quot;off the beaten path&quot; world location.  :boggled:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">anyone there sell jumjum and lettuce?  looks like i'm getting it for sure if they do.<br />
<br />
edit hehe.  sorry baking curiousity.  have the molds for non-stick frying pans or cheese somewhere there too?  might never have to go to jp again except for the basilisk eggs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ah, pies.  As my other posts suggest, I'm quite fond of pies.  The best place I've found for pies is Shadow Haven, near the square pool (the port to and from the Nexus).  The alchemy merchants stand very near a baking merchant, who is near the merchant who sells lion and bear meat.  There are two ovens in close reach, so you're never waiting in line to bake, and two banks.  Bring your own eggs, wolf and mammoth meat, and you can find everything else without ever having to go past Shandling's Roost.  Need those eggs or meats?  You can hit the Bazaar a few steps away.<br />
<br />
All in all it's a wonderful place for all of the tradeskills.  Even tinkers don't get shorted here (pardon the pun).  It's less crowded than the PoK (I've never had to wait for a pottery wheel or brew barrel here) and still has it all.  The only down side is for you folks on PvP servers.  Not a safe zone, so plan accordingly.  Remember that there's one oven in close proximity to five guards, so get your faction up and they'll cover you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Breez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Rachelou - Go right after your swim instead of left to the bank.  I found 2 brew barrels there, 1 has most the items in the same room.  The other has ALL the items, didnt find that out till my 2nd trip to the better room to refill my bags.<br />
<br />
Headed to Abysmal Sea this weekend to check it out, thanks for the suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kemie Dreamshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've seen lettuce on the Abysmal Sea vendors... and cheese... and King's Thorn... and those plate helms used to make rebreathers for tinkering.<br />
<br />
Not all esoteric items that we had to look all over Norrath for are there, but enough of them are that it truly is a tradeskiller's paradise.<br />

Oh and a little p.s. ... if the tradeskill container such as oven, pottery wheel, kiln, loom, forge, brew barrel closest to your tradeskill vendor is in use, there are others scattered about the ship if you just look (and you can mark them on your map for future reference if you are forgetful).  Joy of joys, there's even a forge in the tailor shop if you need to do a few stud or boning combines for your tailoring. :)<br />

That's right, you don't have to hunt down a Shaman vendor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>etitameh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i have not found jumjum or ribbons on the QoT. other than that, i can't think of anything i've looked for and not found there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">First, thank you all for the suggestions about the Queen of Thorns.  I decided that checking it out would be a very good idea, but then I realized one advantage that my favorite haunt (Shadow Haven) has over that place.<br />
<br />
The Queen of thorns is a long way from anywhere for someone who can't port.  From the Plane of Knowledge, I can get to Shadow Haven with a trival walk and two zone edges.  The fastest route I found to the Queen of Thorns was to zone into either Butcherblock Mountains or Everfrost, going to the Wayfarer's camp, then using the farstone to jump to Nedaria's Landing and riding out, or to the Abysmal Sea and riding in.  Is there a faster way that I somehow missed?  Also, it's not adjacent to the Bazaar, although that's a relatively minor issue since one could just park a mule there and shared-bank the goods over.<br />
<br />
Just a thought to consider.  I'll still be mining the ship as soon as I can get there tonight.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i call bunk.  queen's thorn is a magus &quot;nedaria&quot; and a short boat ride.  this from the wizard who ports to the nexus instead of walking from the qeynos stone in pok.  its not that bad.  if i had to run through jp every time i could see your point though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Eniamn wrote:<br />
<br />
&quot;i call bunk. queen's thorn is a magus &quot;nedaria&quot; and a short boat ride.&quot;<br />
<br />
My point rested on the &quot;magus&quot; part.  From New Tanaan, the nearest path to a magus is through the Kaladim stone and running across most of the Butcherblock Mountains or through the Halas stone and running across most of Everfrost.  I compared that to tagging the Nexus stone and running across the Nexus.  With Run3, it still takes me about three minutes of running, three zones (stone, magus, boat), and a boat ride.  To Shadow Haven takes less than a minute and two zones, on foot.<br />
<br />
Not much, I certainly acknowledge, but that's my reasoning.  Perhaps there's a shorter route to a magus that I'm missing?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Trixzie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Shortest route I have found is take the Freeport stone, run to EC tunnel magus.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zeralenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Actually, my very favorite place for pottery is Shar Vahl.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Not to mention that if you are in Abysmal Sea, it's pretty much a given that the other folks in zone are tradeskillers as well.  I love that it takes a bit of effort to get the Abysmal.  It keeps the doods out and results in a nice, quiet place to tradeskill.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, things NOT on Queen of Thorns..<br />
<br />
Soda<br />
Plate BP Molds<br />
Bar of Velium<br />
<br />
Anything else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Eidolon Faer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Somebody mentioned Crow's Special Brew.  I know what that's for.<br />
<br />
There's a relatively obscure quest in Qeynos, for newbie Rogues.  Crow's Tavern in Qeynos was formerly the only other source in the game for that stuff, and he spawns with a limited amount of it.<br />
<br />
Look on Allakhazam's for Qeynos quests, or at Rogue Poisonm aking recipes, you'll find it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Amaruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Things NOT in Abysmal:<br />
<br />
Bar of Velium<br />
Ribbons<br />
Soda (have to trust Slippyblade I have not checked)<br />
<br />
Fairly sure there are some others but they are escaping me.<br />
<br />
Things of note.<br />
<br />
1. Crow's Special Brew can be used instead of skins to make Vials with, its listed in the new UI. The vendors in Abysmal have an endless supply.<br />
<br />
2. I think the making for CE are both sold on the poison merchant.<br />
<br />
3. I know there was a three but I can't seem to recall what i was going to put...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I love working there since generally the only folks there are other tradeskillers.  Kinda nice having a zone with minimal chatter, and almost all of the chatter that IS there is lighthearted, even tempered, non-foul and mostly decent.<br />
<br />
Oh, and the reason I was checking on Soda was to make a batch of Grobbs Liquid Meat...  Soda is the only ingrediant NOT sold in AS.  :(</div></div><hr />
