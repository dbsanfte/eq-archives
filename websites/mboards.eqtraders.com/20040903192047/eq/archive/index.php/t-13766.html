<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>twylyght</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking for a way to help our friends and make a little money on the side.  Is Alchemy good for this or would my time be better spent hunting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azirux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Unless your Alchemy skill is max, it's not a good money maker. Actually, I'd never call it &quot;good&quot;, just &quot;ok&quot;. I make more money from drops like Acrylia and Velium blocks/bricks than I do with Alchemy. What sells depends on your server, but I find SoW and Gate potions sell resonably well. For a while the racial essences were selling, but the market has dropped off badly on my server.<br />
The new GoD throwable potions - snare and stun might sell ok, but currently they are not stackable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Elder Neodoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most likly the illusion potion I sell the most of myself (thru requests only) is gnome. Most of those being to people questing a Cloak of Greater Pernicity.  This is another possiable thing to sell since most people don't have a high level shaman in there back pocket.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cleat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I found that 5 dose 'essence of whoever' and 5 dose 'gate' sell faster than 10 dose. On my server (Drinal) 5 dose 'Gates' sell well, but the 10 dose 'gates' seem to sit in my inventory. 'Essence of Gnome' and 'Essence of Darl Elf' seem to be hottest illusion potions, and since GoD, I am seeing a marked increase in 'Potion of Greater Power' selling. The 'Kilv's' potions and 'Greater Null' sell well also, they seem to sell in spurts. The Elixir line of potions also sell, but not in trader...what I do is I give a free drink to a caster in a raid I am in or my group, and they always ask for more later, so I built a small but steady client base with those potion....not to mention that the elixirs are great for any new casting peep you make. The 'Awareness' potions don't sell, but I always make the 'Benefit Awareness 4' for my lvl 65 shaman, any mana help he can get in raids is essential.<br />
<br />
The new 'concution' potions, well..if they worked, and they stacked, there may be a market for them. They are the cheapest potions to make thus far, but I tried them and the snare and stun don't work at all, and the damage from the higher end fire/cold really does not do any great amount of damage worth having the potion sloted for throwing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>grossbottom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm not yet a GM alchemist, but I make steady, small money on invis to undead and shrink potions. I'm usually selling smithing stuff and tradeskill components, so when I have some vacant space I make some potions and toss them in the bags.<br />
<br />
Kithar's disease treatment also sells, though not as well. I assume the market is tanks who have figured out that cure disease also cures slow, and don't want to wait for the spell to be loaded by their healer.<br />
<br />
I'd say I add about 20% over cost to the price, and they usually sell in a couple of days. Like I said, not much money, but a little on the side.</div></div><hr />
