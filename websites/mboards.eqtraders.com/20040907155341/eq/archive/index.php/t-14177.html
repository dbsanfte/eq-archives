<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know, the horse is dead, make into Jello and glue, used, processed, fertilized, and a new horse is feeding on the grass growing out of it, but...<br />
<br />
OK, perfect example,<br />
<br />
Misty Picnics.  With the new UI, prices in my bazaar have gone form 20-40PP each all the way down to 5.  I don't mind, my baking is now 242, virtual 250.  I'll have a high success rate, I can donate many of the picnics to the guild, it doesn't bother me (my chanter makes more money now).<br />
<br />
So, I look now.  I see one person selling 14 for 5PP (Mine are at 6 and I have 98 left).  I see one person with over 1,000 for 4PP, 9GP, 9SP.<br />
<br />
Really, that's a difference of 2 gold per stack.  I don't think if someone is going to be buying stacks of Mistys they're going to care about 2 gold per stack.<br />
<br />
Lets be real, if you're going to undercut someone, at least under cut them in such a way that the difference will be noticed.  OK, someone has them at 5, you put yours at 4.5PP each, that's 10PP per stack difference, you have 1,000 of them, you're going to make over 4.5K if you sell them all.<br />
<br />
BTW - has anyone done the breakdown of what the cost is per combine?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's happening again, I have my large blocks of magic clay at 4PP each, a fiar price I think considering that I can only do a stack at a time and have to med med med to make them.<br />
<br />
Someone comes up, 3PP 9GP 9SP 9CP.<br />
<br />
I don't think anyone who's working on high end pottery will CARE about 2 SILVER PIECES!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Not only that, it's rather annoying looking down the prices of 1 to 2 digit prices then seeing this 4 digit monstrosity in the middle, it's an eyesore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As a buyer, I like those undercutters, personally.  Means I can buy the higher priced goods to feel nice about not feeding the blatant undercutter, without much of a hit to the wallet ;)<br />
<br />
(as a seller, ya, they're annoying &gt;&lt; If you're going to undercut me, then undercut me!  Don't just mock my price :p)<br />
<br />
Edit- I say &quot;blatant undercutter&quot; because I draw a distinction between &quot;I'm going to undercut you to undercut you (probably to sell faster, but not necessarily)!&quot; and &quot;I feel I can offer this good for a lower price and maintain an acceptable profit margin, and therefore I will undercut you to increase my competitiveness&quot;.  Can be a fuzzy distinction ( or &quot;arguing semantics&quot; if you want), but its an important difference to me nonetheless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh, maybe I should be a hipocryte and put my large blocks of magic clay at 3PP 9GP 9SP 8CP!  :D :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">a few silver CAN make a difference<br />
<br />
I search for item X and sort it so the lowest price is at the top and search/buy from that person. If its 1cp lower it shows up first therefore I buy it. So yes it in my case it DOES make it sell faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There is also the psychological effects of pricing something at 3.99 rather than 4 (or 3.95, or 399/395, or 3999/3995, or whatever) - the item looks cheaper than it actually is. That's why you get a lot of prices like that in RL, after all<br />
<br />
It is a bit pointless doing it for cheap items IMO, though. And I doubt that is what the undercutters are thinking. ;)</div></div><hr />

***********************<br />
<br />
As for people under cutting by a silver, or a gold piece... That bugs me to no end as well! Seriously, if your going to undercut, make it by some amount worth mentioning... I always go to the 1gp more expensive person and ignore the lower one...<br />
<br />
Same with HIGH end stuff... If somethign's for sale for 10K pp, and you put yours up for 9999K pp, I'm going to buy from the other guy, that's just ludicrous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Breez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Personally I will not buy from someone that is undercutting ANY item buy 1 cp just out of princeable.<br />
<br />
That said however...<br />
<br />
I worked in a Electronics store, to steal a phrase I saw, that has real good Buys you might even call them Best.   I sold a gentleman a $999.99 PC, a $299.99 Monitor, and a $199.99 Printer.  He looked at me and said &quot;Perfect, 900, 200, 100... I am getting out of here for $1200.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Umm I never actually met someont that fell for that before.  I pointed out that actually he was getting out for $1499.97 + tax so more like $1575.  He actually thought I was trying to scam him for a few sec.<br />
<br />
My point being is that to us normal capable folks 1cp * 20 items in a stack is 2sp but some folks will see that as a 20pp savings becasue they slept during Math 101.</div></div><hr />

You sir, are definitely getting ripped off if you are paying 149pp for 100 combines of MTPs.  I believe that I am doing 200 combines of MTPs for about that.<br />
<br />
First, you buy pre-woven mandrake root, HUGE savings, then you buy pre-made jum-jum spiced beer, another timesaver and more savings.<br />

grand total (including room for failures in pre combines): 149p 2g 9s 7c<br />
<br />
total per combine:  7g 4s 7c<br />
<br />
each picnic : 1g 8s 8c<br />
<br />
<br />
So, taking that into consideration, you can sell them for 1pp each, and still make a profit.  There is even a profit at 5g each, granted, it is not a huge profit.<br />

p.s. please don't kill me for pointing this out to everybody that is buying them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">THAT, of course, would be if you can FIND pre-woven mandrake root, or Pre-brewed Jumjum spiced beer...<br />
<br />
Both very rare commodities on Xegony.<br />
<br />
My first 800 MTP combines, I was lucky enough to find JJSB on a merchant for cheap. I also manged to find some pre-made picinic baskets a couple times, but I've yet to find Pre-woven mandrake anywhere.<br />
<br />
My totals were if you have to make every subcombine yourself. It also assumes you farm your own brownie parts, and pay no more than 5gp for Veggies in bazaar. My baker can forage his own, but when i was skilling up, I was using them faster than I was foraging them, so had to buy some... Heh<br />
<br />
*shrug* It certainly can be done cheaper if you can buy some of the subcombines already made, but if you can't, that's a fairly accurate total.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sorry to hear that those are rare commodoties on your server.  I have been fortunate enough that I have never had to make the woven mandrake myself.  I generally find it in SH on the barb alchemy guys, and also in Pok, also on the barb alchemy guys.  I almost always find the beer in rivervale, on a couple of different vendors, andmore often than not, off of the barb brewing guy in the buliding near the bank in PoK.<br />
<br />
That being said, your prices are correct for having to make all of the sub-combines yourself.<br />
<br />
<br />
p.s. don't hate me Balkin, but, I currently have a little over 3 bags of pre-woven madrake root that I have vendor bought on Povar. :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Heh, my druid is my baker, I'm very efficient about keeping banks as empty as possible, so he's got about 14 empty 10 slotters in the bank. I think I might run him around SH and rivervale tonight and see if I can find any components. Believe it or not, the 800+ spiced beer I bought when I started skilling up I found in Neriak with my enchanter while merchant mining! :goodvibe:<br />
<br />
Ya just never know when, or where you might find something useful... LOL<br />

i love the new ui.  made a 200 run of picnics in a little over an hour.  mtps were 15pp on my server last night.  auction for that and then 10pp in pok.  (normal price is 10pp from me.)  then i put up eni in trader mode with 400 of them and prayed to not ld.  even looking at my feet in bazaar.  of course they patched today though.  :boggled:   hehe no worries.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">you will need more but that should get you pretty far.  honestly with the new ui it's amazing.  only problem with new ui is i didn't keep track of stacks and kept dropping a lot of stuff lol.</div></div><hr />

I no longer see bragging about getting to 100 in 5 mins.. I see questions like, I got my baking to 191 or 200, where I can I find eggs?  or, I have X, Y Z , why won't the combination work?<br />
<br />
The day after the patch with the new window my mule sold out of my collection of small smithed tools that used to take weeks to empty.<br />

I do know what you mean though.  I just laugh now.  There is one that literally sets up next to me and sells for just a tad under me most nights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interesting, you must have a vendor who is perma stocked with woven mandrake and spiced beer because I rarely find them.<br />
<br />
Not only that, veggies aren't &quot;free&quot; to everyone, which you also left out in your math, which can easily double to quadruple your prices, possibly even more.<br />
<br />
While you can farm brownie parts for free, say in Steamfont, to get the 3 that you'd need would take a lot of farming there, or more PP (5-10) in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Plus the running around, high trivial rate (high fail rate), time making all the subcombines, time trying to fine an oven in some servers, etc..<br />
<br />
If you think selling anyhting above cost is a rip off, then I guess you think everything for sale in the world is a rip off.  A business can't run by charging people only a little over what the raw components cost, TIME is factored into that.  SKILL is factored into that.  Sure, I could easily network a small LAN in an office as well as someone with their MCSE, CCNA, A+, N+ etc.. but they would charge more because of their SKILL (training).  Now, if I just charged the person who hired me to make the LAN, I would be *insane* to charge them just for the raw components, not the time it takes me to make the cables (cutting, crimping, running the cables), installing the NIC card in each computer (sofware), configuring the router, configuring their model (DSL, T1, Cable, whatever).  All that takes TIME, and TIME is money.<br />
<br />
You name it, *ANY* item you buy is like that.<br />
<br />
So, back in game, I'm not going to spend 8gold to 1.6 platinum (math is here: http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=106579#post106579 , I won't be rude and copy my entire post) per picnic just to sit back and charge 2PP each.  It took me TIME to make them, it took me TIME to get my skill up to where I could start succeeding them, I lost a lot of money making fish fillets, fish rolls, patty melts, candied cockroackes, and pixie cinnesticks.  PLUS, I've lost money now on TWO failed trophies (skill 249).  <br />
<br />
Also, look at what you're selling, you're selling  stat food that's +5Str, +5Sta, +5Wis, +5Int, +20HP, +20Mana.  How much would an item like that go that doesn't take up any slots?  What about a 20-charge item that lasts just as long?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rissenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Heh, I have a personal principle: If I see someone selling &quot;item X&quot; for 5pp and someone else selling for 4pp, 9gp, 9sp...I get so annoyed over &quot;idiot pricing&quot; I go buy from the one that has tehm for 5pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Corii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Haha yes the 4p 9g 9s 9c prices annoy me, so I just do not buy those if I have a choice, I prefer nice rounded prices!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, I just take the time and search vendors I have previously bought from.  I even found some on a vendor in PoT the other day when I was vendor mining after the patch.<br />
<br />
  PLUS, I've lost money now on TWO failed trophies (skill 249).  <br />
<br />
The trophy is not required to make picnics.  It is a choice made by the players to make one to have.  It should not be your customers burden that you failed to make something that is not required to produce your wares that you are selling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Reflan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">When there's something I need a vast amount of, like celestial essences, I sometimes buy out the little guys first, even if they charge a bit more, unless it's quite a bit more.<br />
<br />
If I buy out the guy with hundreds(and yes, I've gone through hundreds VERY quickly on skill-up runs), more often than not the next thing I know he is racing me to the remaining sellers in the bazaar to buy them all out and double the price, hoping I will now just be a hapless target for his greed.<br />
<br />
Plus if people see their smaller amounts aren't enticing people to buy, they may just not want to make 400 more at a time when they can't seven sell 60.  They may leave the market for a while, or forever.  I want to encourage them to stay.  So I buy out some of the lower priced guys, but also some of the people who charge a little more just to keep them in the market so prices don't lock up without any competition.  The guys with monster numbers of items will be there tomorrow; tomorrow if the little guys are left, I buy out more of their stuff so they're motivated to keep the competition strong.<br />
<br />
I almost never buy the guy with tons of stuff out unless he's pricing his stuff at a real bargain, because these guys usually have or quickly develop the ability to control the market.  Buying them out almost always results in them buying everyone else out they can find and then raiding the price dramatically.  Both the big seller and the little seller, all at their various prices, has to see that there's money from everybody but also a threat from competitors everywhere.<br />
<br />
Same thing with spider silk and spiderling silk, which I've used to turn into swatches for my own skill ups and leather padding for sale.  I usually leave at least one of the cheapest sellers with his wares intact even if I'm doing an out and out blitzkreig and buying up almost the whole bazaar's worth of a particular item.  I don't want new sellers thinking there is nothing in the market so they can name their own price, or old hands thinking that either.  I want them to conform to the low price they already see on somebody else.</div></div><hr />
