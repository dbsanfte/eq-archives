<br />
What is the price for a &quot;Fiend Gut&quot; on your server?<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">go to eqecon.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Osprey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They are never sold on my server, and I would expect that's commonly the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aradyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pricing on any tradeskill drop will differ on every server, and quite possibly even from week to week on the same server.  Like Osprey, this item is not commonly sold on my server either, making it difficult to assign a pricetag.  <br />
<br />
It might not hurt to ask your question in our Marketplace forums for the server you reside on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kahmon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have seen a few for sale on Veeshan, but very rarely and always just 1 at a time. When I have seen them they have been in the 10K range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lokase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for he info everyone.  I was just wondering what kind of pp to expect to dump IF or WHEN they show up on my server.  I tried eqecon.com but to no avail as all the beta keys are used up.<br />
<br />
If anyone one else has any pricing information I would be interested to see the price range on the different servers.<br />
<br />
Got Fletching to 250 last weekend and am mapping out my strategy to try and get some of these planar components to try the combines.<br />
<br />
I realize I might not be able to get the components due to the fact that the guilds that raid in the zones required usually stuff them in their vaults.  Hopefully I can get lucky and swipe two off the bazaar.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aerinha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I actually saw a pair of fiend guts for sale on my server...for a short while. They were priced at 26050 pp each(don't ask me why, as I wasn't the one selling, and since I didn't have the cash, not the one buying either).<br />
<br />
If any show up again, I don't expect the price to be in any way similar to this time. <br />
<br />
There was a stonewood bowstaff for sale for 60k recently as well(since it isn't there now, I expect it was purchased, but again, not by me).<br />
<br />
It is going to be a looong time before I can afford any elemental fletching at this rate. one part or another is always rare or waaaay out of my price range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sabine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Fiend guts are rarely sold in the bazaar since they only drop to raid targets, and the staves and metal are as common as the rain (to exp mobs).<br />
<br />
Each time a guild gets 2 guts, that's an attempt at a bow (about 40% chance of success with max skill).  To estimate a price for a gut, take the price of an Obsidianwood bow, and divide by 5.<br />
<br />
If an Obsdianwood bow costs 100k in the bazaar, I would expect guts to be about 20k.  40k gets you the two you need to make a string. The other components (staff and ore) run about 100pp on my server.  If you suceed at bows 40% of the time, you break even buying guts at 20k, if Obsidianwoods sell for 100k in your marketplace.<br />
<br />
People have interesting ideas on pricing for things.  Stonewood bowstaves can be 10k or 35k in the bazaar.  I chuckle when I see three vendors selling vegerog vines for 40k each, since the parts to attempt a stonewood would be just under the cost of a finished bow.  Somehow I suspect that the vines don't sell too quick at that price...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Daikoku Ashikaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As been said the obsidian wood bow is pretty much locked as a Guild only made item,  I do not know any group of 6 elemantally flagged people(or if only 6, would be 6 time flagged/geared)  that woyuld be willing to handle the ostrisation of  their whole server to Blow fenin just to make some PP, especially when it sis so much easier for thesaid group to go farm earth.<br />
<br />
I suppose you might find 1 every once in a while as a part of a /random off a pick up group Blaz raid, if that would ever happen.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mudcrush Durtfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's going to take more than 6 people to get this.<br />
<br />
   Dropped ONLY by the bat wing demon models in fire.  Those take WAY more than six to kill.<br />
<br />
   Omnified, the Fennin ring start mob, and uh, the equivalent models in the Fennin ring event.</div></div><hr />
