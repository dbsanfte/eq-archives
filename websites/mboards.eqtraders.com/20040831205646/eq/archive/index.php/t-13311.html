<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gryfalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, going to try to keep this un-rant-ish.<br />
<br />
Having now failed 10 of 11 Elemental breastplates, including<br />
<br />
4 PoE Plate Breastplates<br />
1 PoW Plate Breastplate<br />
1 PoW Chain Breastplate<br />
1 PoF Plate Breastplate<br />
2 PoA Plate Breastplates<br />
And one other I can’t remember..<br />
(not to mention a hurricane vambrace couple days ago)<br />
<br />
Including 5 I failed JUST LAST NIGHT...<br />
<br />
I am starting to wonder if my +15% on my Gauntlets is working correctly.<br />
<br />
My skill level is 232 (well, was 231, but I gained on a failure).<br />
<br />
We all know the RNG is crappy (I like how they admit that ‘while good over a couple million shots, it stinks at short range, but it’s not worth our time to fix right now’), but I cannot begin to explain how disheartening this is.  I literally blew up over a million PP worth of gear for my guild.<br />
<br />
The only good thing about it was the comment from an officer ‘Grats Gryfalia on failing a Breastplate from EACH elemental plane in under an hour!’, was quite funny.<br />
<br />
Anyone out there using the Gauntlets of the Dark Forge have any comments?  Any heavily bad luck recently?<br />
<br />
Of course, perhaps it’s just me.  I’ve failed 4 elemental JC combines in a row too (our JCM chanter has worse luck than I).  On the flip side, I am now, like 29 for 30 doing Elemental Pottery.  Problem is, if I had to choose, I would prefer insane good runs on Armor and not pottery.<br />

<br />
I have the gauntlets of dark ember too, with smithing skill at 222, but haven't made that many 250+ smithing items, only about 10 emblems of air/water/fire/earth, and succeding about 2/3 on them.<br />

<br />
I can understand that it's disheartening, however, what exactly would you like them to fix in the RANDOM number generator?  It's random, that's the point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gryfalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No, it's streaky.  <br />
<br />
Random doesn't simply mean it's not &quot;yes, yes, yes, no, yes, yes, yes, no&quot;.<br />
<br />
It means random.<br />
<br />
It is far, FAR too streaky.  It shouldn't be '100 yes, 3 no, 100 yes, 3 no' which is generally what it is these days.<br />
<br />
When almost every single tradeskiller has multiple instances of 'not skilling in 80 combines, then 3 in 4', there is a problem.<br />
<br />
I know that when I gain a skill point, I should quickly try several more, because there are very good odds I will gain another point.<br />
<br />
Someone (can't remember his name) flat out admitted it (the paraphrase I pointed out).<br />
<br />
While true randomness does allow for the possibility of 100 yes and then 3 no, it shouldn't be so common as to be almost expected (as it is now).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i tried looking for that with mtp successes.  i would get two in a stack about as often as i wouldn't get any in a stack and both less than 1 per stack.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gurck-Quellious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hate to use the cliche phrase, but I really do think it is 'working as intended'.  Random means random.  Flip a coin for a few sets of ten repetitions, and imagine heads is a success, tails a failure.  The 50/50 chance at either mimics the roughly 50% success rate at GM skill that we have on many cultural &amp; PoP crafted items.  I doubt you see much 5/5, more like 3/7, 8/2, etc.  The only way for them to make it less streaky (which is the essence of random) would be for it to record your last combine; whether it was a success or fail, and work off of that - in which case it would no longer be random.  Trust me, I understand your frustration - I'm 4/12 on EP armors at 240+ trophy (252 mod'd, at hardcap).  But on my server the components cost a lot - in the neighborhood of 60k for an attempt at 2-scale pieces of farwater chain, for example - and that's at the prices I offer to pay.  If I were to pay what the crack addicts in the bazaar want for components, it would cost closer to 80-90k.  Those failures hurt badly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The point is that you should be able to succeed more often at higher skills. Being that I am not a programer for SOE nor do I claim to know about how they coded either the Trade skill engine or the RNG I can only speculate...<br />
<br />
As such it I theorize that there may be some type of logic in place that takes base skill into account before adding the modifier to determine success. For example if the base skill is 250 then add 20% chance to succeed if the base skill is 230 then add 5% chance... If the modified skill is 252 then add 10% additional.<br />
<br />
Again Theory only and not tested but would explain some of the threads here that I have been seeing where a 230ish Tradeskiller with a 15% mod item is not getting the same success as a 250 tradeskiller with GM trophy. <br />
<br />
Anyone else have thoughts on this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would agree with this based on a thread long ago about the Foraging Machette, which gives a modifier for foraging.  Someone posted that their experience was that with 199 foraging skill and the Machette equipped, they still would fail to forage anything on rare occassions.  (At 200 foraging skill, you get something every time you forage).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Current speculation of EP smithing trivial might be around 350, based on the formula we've been using and the average success rate people are having (20%-40%) at effective 250 skill.  <br />
<br />
Culturals (including Haversacks) should be just a tad above 250.  Not even a close comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>AbitooXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Random means independant and random.<br />
<br />
Lets use a roulette example.  Lets say black has come up 10 times in a row.  What are the odds (assuming all numbers are red or black) that it comes up black on the 11th roll?<br />
<br />
Answer: 50%<br />
<br />
Now, what are the odds that after 11 rolls, all rolls will be black?<br />
<br />
Answer: 0.50^11 or .0488%  or 1 in 2048.<br />
<br />
What's different between the two situations?  Simply that in the first example, the first 10 rolls have already occured, making the 11th roll a single independant event.  In the 2nd example, all 11 independant rolls must be made successfully.<br />
<br />
People have a misconception that because something has previously happened, it will affect the outcome. This simply isnt true.  Here's another example:<br />
<br />
What are the odds that last night's lotto numbers will be rolled again next drawing?<br />
<br />
Answer: The same as any other number combination.<br />
<br />
Random does not mean 1 up 1 down. In fact, it rarely goes every other (for a 50% random)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zdapus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have had some training in statics and understanding many of the arguements being made that all is working as it should.  But dang there are some oddities out there like multiple failures one after another on items that are way below your skill level and multiple skill ups one after another after long runs of no skill ups.  These occur at  a frequency that seem to me rule out truely randomness.  I wish I would have collected data on all the combines I have made (17 tades over 240+ and 4 over 220+ currently on multiple characters)<br />
<br />
The following example gives me pause to think but I know the sample is much to small to actually draw conclussions:<br />
<br />
A friend and I decided to work on the Aid Grimel quest by working on our trade skills and collecting materials via the bazaar prior to completing the flags for elemental access.   Once Sol Ro went down, we had enough materails on hand to complete the quest in one night.  I being the more experienced crafter ran both characters thru the actual combines.  I altered between my main and his at each step.  My main never failed on any of the pottery, tailoring and fletching steps.  My friends main went one for one on pottery, two out three on tailoring, and one for two on fletching.  My main had maxed skilled with a pottery geerlok and tailoring and fletching trophies.  My friend used only geerloks and had the same skill as my self in tailoring and fletching but only 222 in pottery.  All these combines were made over six hours with lots of zoning and logging in and out between actual attempts. I hate the elevator with a passion.<br />
<br />
Why was I so lucky on my main and not my friends???  Hehe, I ended up charging 100k for my excess materials I supplied to complete his earing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I am wondering is the %mods have any effect when used on PoP combines. I have noticed MUCH better success rates on pottery from when I was 240 and 241 skill (both 252 with trophy) and I get more successes with 250 skill (252 with trophy).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Silound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Gurck, your example of a coin won't quite fit for this, but you have the right idea. <br />
<br />
Anything that gives a probability of success/failure, 0/1, true/false, yes/no, or any other permutation of options isn't going to achieve randomness, simply because there are only 2 options, and if it isn't one, it's the other. <br />
<br />
My memory is fuzzy past two, been a long time since I took Theoretical Design, but the gist is anything that does not have an infinite number of possibilities is therefore a probability, and by law of probability, eventually, there will be an even number of each option.<br />
<br />
Thus the RNG streaks because it's really a probability equation, otherwise known to programmers and design specialists as a pseudo-random number generator.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sunfire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It is well known that EQ has about the least random RNG in existence - it was actually &quot;TWEAKED&quot; once about a year into the game (before which it was using the most basic Random function you can imagine).  From what I understand, EQII's is a completely different function from a completely different source if that tells you anything.<br />
<br />
That being said - I also believe some skills, smithing being one, are operating at a higher cap now than 252 - something like the 350 which was mentioned.<br />
<br />
Practical advice: If you fail ONCE - do 20 or so easy combines to move the RNG's seed number then go back to the good stuff.  I have been doing this for my PoP combines and I have yet to get back to back failures whereas I had often experienced them before.<br />
<br />
And by the way - you get a big /comfort for all the BPs :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can understant why youre upset. Failing 10/11 very very expensive combines is rough.<br />
<br />
Still, in every possible subset of a RANDOM set, streaks like this are an absolute guarentee to happen at some point. It may not occur as often as, say 5 or 6 out of 11, bt it happens nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Its also human nature to bemoan tragedy far far greater then rejoyce triumph. For every pwerson who went 1/11, theres 5 people who went 10/11 and didnt post anything anywhere.<br />

I hope you are fare more successful in your future combines. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I had a teacher in school one time (probability course) that told us to go home and flip a coin 100 times and write down the outcomes.  Based on what the students turned in, he could tell who actually did the assignment, and who just made it up.  The ones that did the assignment had streaks of 10 or 12 heads (or tails) in there somewhere.  The ones who made it up had streaks of no more than 3 or 4.  As someone mentioned, you can expect to have streakes like this of failures.  <br />
<br />
I also remember reading somewhere that your probability of success is not at it's maximum when you hit the trivial level.  You need to be quite a bit higher.  So if you are making something that trivials over 250 (and no one knows the exact trivial level) then it stands to reason that your probability for success would be less than expected, considering everything I've read says your skill caps out at 252.</div></div><hr />

He was so happy he said i could keep the extra.<br />
<br />
Between what he had left, and some scraps in my bank, I had enough stuff for 6 more combines (woot profit time). Went ZERO for 6. :boggled: <br />
<br />
Well the overall average 6/15 is right where it should be. But it didn't feel like it, as I failed the six pieces I was hoping to sell. Glad I managed to gear out my guildmate though :)</div></div><hr />

No Nolrog, that's not true.  It's true for items with low trivial, but for items with trivials over 180 (somewhere in that area) you get the max success rate BEFORE the item trivials.<br />
<br />
Under the old success rate anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Viacios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Duh!  The items you are attempting were designed to be combined by a GRANDMASTER, aka actual 250 skill with a skill bonus item.  Hence the 250+ trivial.  In our guild only someone with 250 skill and smithing item is allowed to have the components for a combine.  And the success rate is about 50%+  Planer armor was not intended to combine easily, and especially not by non grandmasters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>TheGiantOne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Okay...<br />
<br />
I have made Farwater and all below it for elemental planes armors and overall have hit a 40% ratio of success.<br />
<br />
But at times its 2 out of 7 and next time is 3 out of 3.  You never know.  My rule of thumb is if you fail the first 2 combines stop go get some coffee or a snack and try later.<br />
<br />
But its all about the RNG remember.  It can be nice and give you 100% or just outright mean (been there and done that) and give you 0%.<br />
<br />
Also remember those elemental combines are way above 300 also.  Since the new UI have not tested how much they are but I would imagine 350+ on a trivial scale.</div></div><hr />

The everquest RNG is even worse than most IMO, I belive they wrote the code for it themselves, even the random library in old ANSI C is better hehe.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Laeelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Random talks always remind me of the Monty Hall problem =)<br />
<br />
Most people dont understand what real random numbers are (or probility)<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the Problem:<br />
=================<br />
<br />
You are on a game show. You are presented with a choice of 3 doors: behind one is a luxury car, and behind the other two are nothing. The host asks you pick one of the doors. <br />
<br />
After you do this, as part of the game he opens one unpicked doors which he knows is empty. There are now only the door you picked and one remaining door which are unopened. You are asked if you would like to switch your choice. Should you switch? <br />
<br />
==================<br />
<br />
Almost everyone doesnt thing that changeing or not changeing makes any real difrence...<br />
<br />
But it does.<br />
<br />
It makes a HUGE diffrence.<br />
<br />
if you change you have a 2/3 chance of winning<br />
if you dont change you have a 1/3 chance of winning =)<br />
<br />
Normally the only way to really prove it is to actually set up a situation like that and do 25 or so runs to prove that changeing helps.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess the poing of this is that random isnt what most people think it is any more than probility is what most people think it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Haphern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Assuming that you choose either of the two unlocked doors, there is no way that you should be having a choice of three that your 1/3 and 2/3 odds are showing. <br />
Yes, the original probability of you choosing the correct door is 1/3 but, after one of the &quot;wrong&quot; doors is opened, the odds are changed simply because you aren't picking from 3 doors anymore.<br />
<br />
Simply put, you now have a choice between 2 doors that you have been told that the prize is hidden behind - the unlocked door is no longer part of the equation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Laeelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Simply put, you now have a choice between 2 doors that you have been told that the prize is hidden behind - the unlocked door is no longer part of the equation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats what fools people... it's not a ramdom door that was removed... it was an INCORRECT door... thats one of the things people miss.<br />
<br />
It's always a WRONG door thats removed... Every single time.<br />
<br />
Door (B) is NOT removed from the equation, in fact the entire chain of events is set before the first door is opened... <br />
<br />
Look at it this way...<br />
<br />
(A) - (B) - (C)<br />
<br />
you pick (A)<br />
<br />
There is a 1/3 chance that you picked the correct door assumeing only one has the prize.. You have a 2/3 chance of picking the loseing door... (DONT forget this part, it's critical)<br />
<br />
Now lets play the game as it could go..<br />
<br />
Door (A) has the prize in our example...<br />
<br />
You pick Door (A):<br />
Host opens Door (B) or (C) and shows nothing, you change your choice to the other and lose.<br />
<br />
Your pick Door(B):<br />
Host opens Door (C), You change your choice to Door (A) and win.<br />
<br />
Your pick Door(C):<br />
Host opens Door (B), You change your choice to Door (A) and win.<br />
<br />
As you can see, if you start with the winning door and change you LOSE ever time, you start with a loseing door and change and you WIN everytime.<br />
<br />
1/3 vs. 2/3<br />
<br />
============================<br />
<br />
Also, when trying to figure out how it worked when it was first shown to me I made a program to actually do it<br />
<br />
http://www.startingdreams.com/doors.php<br />
<br />
also, you can go to google or yahoo, and do a search on &quot;monty hall problem&quot; and you will get 1000's of responces from math sites about it (includeing ones with a javascript version of the game to play)<br />
<br />
==============<br />
<br />
If you  still dont beleve it, make an single player version of the game ...<br />
<br />
for example:<br />
<br />
1) Take 3 coins of the same size, mark one with a marker.<br />
2) Mix the 3 coins and set one to the side without looking. (original pick)<br />
3) Look at the 2 remaining coins, and as the &quot;host&quot; remove 1 unmarked coin (open an empty door)<br />
4) Change your pick to the remaining coin (change to the last door unpoened)<br />
<br />
PLEASE before argueing about it, try it...<br />
<br />
IMO this is the coolest math fact there is .. (at least at a level of math i'm able to understand =P .. i'm sure there are cooler things higher up, but i can follow that high)</div></div><hr />
