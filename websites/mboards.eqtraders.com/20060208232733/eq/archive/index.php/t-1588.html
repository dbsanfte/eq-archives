I know you are the only one on Drinal who can make these.  I've been looking for you for a couple weeks, but I never see you on, so I thought I would post and hope you read this.  I want to know what 4 Haversacks would cost -- yes 4.  Ideally I will be replacing a large soiled bag and 2 tink bags with 4 bags with less total weight.<br />
<br />
I was wondering what you would charge me for 4 and whether you would consider a discount if I provided the plat threads and BDs.  Or would you prefer I farm all the materials and just pay you for your time for the combines?  I have skills for everything but the halfling only stuff.  I'd need to know how many combines you would think you would need for 4 successes in that case.  Please post here or send me a tell in game or email me at wooben@hotmail.com<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Figg</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry for not posting till now, i think i may have already filled your order a while ago, but figured i should post here incase i missed you or if anyone else wants info. my standard current rate on haversacks are 8k or 2 for 15k (30k for 4). yes i discount some for supplies.<br />
if you want me to make a haversack from your supplies i charge 500p to click Final combine (on a success only) if you have ALL subcombines done, 1k if im doing all the cultural steps, 1200p if i am doing all steps including non-cultural steps. there is usually at least a fail on a tuft/patch step, often a fail on a step involving BD, but aside from that i rarely fail a final combine (1 in 20 or less it seems).<br />
 also should let you know there is 1 other making the haversacks as i have seen someone auctioning in the bazaar. <br />
any other questions feel free to send me a tell as figg,fratlan or my bazaar mule (often afk though) workermule. if im on a raid resend later</div></div><hr />
