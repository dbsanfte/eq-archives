<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meriru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't know if anyone has explored this, but I am looking to make yet another attempt at the Baking tradeskill trophy... and I want to get the gems (especially the Jacinth and Black Sapphire) at lower-than bazaar prices (like, say, farm yourself prices)...<br />
<br />
Does anyone know of a good quest/mob to kill for Jacinths and Black Sapphires?  The diamonds and blue diamonds aren't too bad, but the other two are up at around 700-800pp each on Firiona Vie.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be appreciated.<br />

Thanks<br />

I'm in the same boat as you are (except Brewing)<br />
<br />
Offering 200pp/each just doesn't seem to cut it, even when that's more than the NPC vendors give you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Iannyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I could be mistaken, but I believe that both Jacinth and B.Sapphires can be recieved as rewards for turning in 4 ulthork tusks to the Othimir Chieftan in Cobalt Scar.</div></div><hr />

I've stocked up on a few for upcoming trophy combines, all teh ones I'ev gotten came from LDoN Adventures</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No to a Trophy! Have you no pride! I view the trophy like the 1750 club, something to aim for. Even if you can get easier items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I can see getting one, but not more than that. It's personal preference, but I see no point in getting something that doesn't prove you're 250 anyway.</div></div><hr />

But I like my trophy!  For a Halfling cleric, there are obvious benefits.  First, it fits in the range slot.  That's three bag slots that aren't tied up any more (2 steins and a Geerlok sculptor).  I never forget to equip it, since it's always equipped, so I don't lose a bunch of money selling stuff when I'm tired any more.  10 wisdom is good for any slot for a cleric, and 10 strength is good for a Halfling.<br />
<br />
Plus, like others have said, it's a goal to shoot for.  Sure, you don't need to be a grandmaster to build one, but it's still an achievement.    Heck, I've never even used it to summon a bag, since I haven't needed it (even the rentable one).  It's just having it that I wanted.<br />
