I just wanted to thank you for the Breastplate you made me.  I mentioned it a few times in game, but I wanted you to know why it's so important to me.<br />
<br />
At level 5 or so, I made a Banded Tunic.  Aragir wore that until level 15 or so, when my guildleader gave me a Brigandine Tunic.  Aragir wore the Brigandine tunic until about level 40, when a guildmate gave me an EBCP (which was pretty high-end at the time, LOL).  Aragir wore the EBCP until I made my Enchanted Silver Full Plate BP.<br />
<br />
Since level 5 or so, Aragir has been wearing a tunic that he either made for himself, or that someone gave him.  I've gone through a lot of other gear, and bought and sold things, but the Breastplate has remained a constant reminder of what can be earned by working hard and treating others with respect and honor.<br />
<br />
By giving me the Engraved BP, you helped me maintain that link to my past and to my honor.  I am humbled and grateful to you for your generousity.<br />
