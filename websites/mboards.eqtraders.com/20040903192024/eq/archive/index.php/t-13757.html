<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Scuzz Zilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think they meant to fronglock on the front page *points*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure why a Froglok with a spear... haven't got it yet myself...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh, heh.  I thought it was a Froglok wearing a shield, and the graphics had been glitched with the release of GoD, making the shield appear in what seems to be the general default position, near the back/center of the model.  Then, due to the design of the shield, it kinda looked like the frog had a shop sign hanging behind him, and they found it funny and so they posted it.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Supposedly a 'Sign' outside a Tradeskill Vendor Shop or something...&quot; seems a bit more likely though, now that you mention it :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>sumamael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Looks like a huge Frog-LOCK to me, you know for keeping gates locked and stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That frog is Niami. :)  She got stuck on that sign while testing things in beta and wanted to capture the amusing moment.  And seeing as she's hanging from the sign with her pointy spear, I suppose it seemed appropriate for release. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It was a shaman BTW (the reason it had a spear).<br />
<br />
But in Beta... the signs would &quot;Grab&quot; people and stick them to it :)<br />
<br />
(I am fairly certain they fixed it)<br />
<br />
So Denmom was part of the sign of things to come!</div></div><hr />
