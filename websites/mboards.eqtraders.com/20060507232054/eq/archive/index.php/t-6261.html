If your an erudite tailor over 200 in skill, please look me up and we can work out a deal.<br />

How many times did you get the AC doing that? hehe<br />
<br />
Currently 157 Erudite tailor, but I will be working on it... can't say I'll be over 180 for a couple months though, as I'd need NTCM to go over 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raamil</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Saw the AC 2 times and got him myself once. Actually what I do to spawn the terrorantulings doesn't seem to spawn any sand giants or the AC. I rarely see those, but can get terrorantulings to spawn every 15 to 20 minutes. I was there trying to figure out how to spawn AC, but that never came to me. I have 140 silks now. When your high enough, send me a tell. I'm interested in trading them for some finished pieces for my guild and friends.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just put a stack of them, say 20 in bazaar at 50pp each (about standard).<br />
<br />
When someone buys them, note the name, track down their tailor (if it isn't them), and work something out.  When I camped the AC I left with 8 silks, I guess I can't spawn them like you ;).  Those sold quickly for the 50.<br />
<br />
This place honestly is getting 1 post every few weeks... I don't think many look at it.</div></div><hr />
