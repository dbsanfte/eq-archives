<br />
I am xonbink and play on tunare - I am a 55 druid who has specialized in tradeskills.  <br />
<br />
Here are my curernt skills:<br />
<br />
baking 135<br />
tailor 177<br />
smithing 180<br />
Fletching 179<br />
brewing 158<br />
Jewlery making 194<br />
Pottery 154<br />
<br />
I am currently working on increasing tailoring and have started collecting the components for the halfling cultural tailoring bags.  I have made 4 slot bags succesfully, and failed on one attempt at a 6 slot bag. <br />
<br />
Basically I am available to do sub combines for you, that would either result in skillups, or for a fee. <br />
<br />
I also make the Engraved Royal Velium Armor which is currently selling at a fair price in the bazaar, however the components can be tough to accquire. <br />
<br />
I can very often be found in the bazaar, I tend to price my leather padding for fast sale, and usualyl try to stock a few stacks per day.  Levelling is becoming neccessary though to continue stocking the components I need, unless I can bazaar them.<br />
<br />
I also seek farmers who will farm acrylia ore and rockhopper hides for me at a reasonable price.  i see too many people in bazaar trying to just make a profit on eerything, and these items are often contested for even at the higher prices. <br />
<br />
if we can work together let me know.  I am always buying acrylia and superb or flawless hopper hides.<br />
