<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Glembidor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all..<br />
My smithing is 201 atm, WIS 295. I just did 87 combines of LDoN armour and not one skill up :( Normally i did the combines in a batch of 15-25.<br />
<br />
Is that skillup rate normal, or was i a bit unlucky ? Also, do you think 295 WIS is reasonable, or should i raise my wisdom cap further ? <br />
I dont have much money left, and willing to get AAs required to raise WIS if it really makes a big difference.<br />
<br />
Thank you ! :angel:</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are in the hell levels of smithing. They are between 190 to roughly 210, and dry runs like the one you described is not unheard of, or even uncommon.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to get a geerlok hammer to add 5% to your skill. This will put you past the hell levels at least.</div></div><hr />
