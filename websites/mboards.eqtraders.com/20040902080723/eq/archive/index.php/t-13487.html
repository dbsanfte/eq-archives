<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cannyar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well. finally. after weeks and weeks.. i went on a binge and made picnics for at least 10 hours. went from 215 to 250. made my GM spoon on the first try..<br />
<br />
sorry to say. my wrists need a rest. i might not try the next skill until the new interface.. (ugh. call me a wimp).<br />
<br />
for all you all-around gm's, i have much respect for you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">GRATS!!! Baking takes a LOT of clicking. It may be cheap plat wise but it takes a ton of time and patience. GRATS on your accomplishment!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cannyar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you mean this is the hardest one? ack. why did i start with baking? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its not the hardest it just ranks right up there with brewing with amount of clicks. Other skills are harder in other respects like tailoring. Most tailoring items have fewer subcombines but require farming, same as smithing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Trixzie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">WTG! Good job :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cannyar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i was thinking of tackling brewing next, but i don't have AA's to master other tradeskills yet (barely have AA's to make myself useful). mastering other TS's will be down the line a ways for me i guess. hopefully i'll put the new TS interface to good use too. :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Brewing is going to be increadably easy once the new tradeskill thing is patched.  The hardest part of brewing is the 9 item combine for Mino Hero Brew! (248 triv)<br />
<br />
If you want to get another skill to 250 this is the way to go...  I havent worked it out but you will probably get there for under 1k.<br />
<br />
Most expensive item will be the Corking Device used for Kaladim Constitutionals 248 to 250.  Only need one as it is returned after combine!  And you need it for trophy anyway!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not counting the corking device, my wizzie with 255 INT got to 248 brewing for 300'ish plat. 300 for corker (had a friend make it). I also paid for KEI's bringing my 0-250 total up to about 500pp (or 800 w/ corker), but if you're talking AA's you already have your primary stat maxed. :) Should be a breeze for you. :)<br />
<br />
Congrats on your Baking and Trophy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>cannyar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">well unfortunately i don't have the AA points to get my tannan mastery and maxing out any other skills. i'm trying to get to 62 when i hear AA's will be far easier to earn. then i'll get back to my tradeskills (and hopefully max them all). this will probably be after GoD is out, so things might work out differently for me then..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Way to go on GMing baking and getting your trophy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tingteng</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you have the money JC with its all vendor bought items and 2 items combines to 250 can be done in about 4-5 hours 0-250. <br />
and that's without the new UI</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mdaisy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Congrats on 250 and the Spoon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">That's a lot of picnic baskets.  Just be sure that Yogi is not around.<br />
<br />
Congrats.</div></div><hr />
