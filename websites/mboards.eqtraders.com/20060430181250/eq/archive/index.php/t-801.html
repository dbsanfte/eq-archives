Look for your local Halfling tailor that makes Karana paladin items, or your local Human smith that can make Karana plate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wold2</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dwarves can make Brellium plate which is comparable , for HLF pallies and clerics. Eg the BP is ac 51 sta 5 hp 40 mana 40 etc, very nice stuff. My little hlf pally will get some one day lol.</div></div><hr />

Halflings and Humans can make Karana imbued.</div></div><hr />

Check out my magelo and you'll see my Agnostic Halfling warrior wears a fair bit of Brellium Plate that I (and others) have made for him.<br />
<br />
Need some help on signature stuff, so you'll have to cut and paste it. <br />
<br />
Its good armor, and when I can afford Legs and some other parts, I will be getting that for him as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niami DenMother</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 08:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, as an FYI, though you asked for &quot;Karana&quot; stuff for halfling paladins and clerics, there's no such thing as a Karana-worshipping halfling cleric ... all of us furfooted clerics are required to follow the creator of halflings, Bristlebane ... and then, as mentioned above, we need to chase down dwarves in order to find an imbued plate armor. <br />
<br />
I've been known to &quot;stitch&quot; up some stormreaper armor for halfling paladins, even if I can't make a single thing that I, personally, can wear.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rsisa</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all your help.<br />
Seems I need a tailor insteed.<br />
The halfling cultural Stormreapers Steelweave match very well the cultural imbued Plate of the dwarfs in stats which was what I first had in mind.<br />

Barbarians can wear the Rallos Zek stuff after all, and so on.<br />
<br />
I have recently been skilling up on imbued field plate using imbued plains pebbles supplied, in part, by a halfling druid worshipper of Karana.  But I can't give the results to a halfling cleric, though I can (and have) to a Karana worshipping human cleric.<br />
<br />
Why can a halfling druid worship Karana but not a halfling cleric?<br />
<br />
Go figure.<br />
