<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oh, I don't know - I have 2 bags full of collected parts for potions sitting in the bank until I have enough to make 10-dose potions.  And an entire bag full of the stuff to make Kaladim Constitutionals.  And a bag of pelts and skins.  They ALL take up space. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i have another full toolbox with leftovers of mtp combines.  the untensils to sew aren't bad.  one skinnining knife.  smithing has one hammer until you start doing other stuff like velium.  oh. i missed wok.  editing now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nepper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Missed the Caserole Dish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thanks.  that takes us to 11 utensils now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ulaxmi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Don't forget a filleting knife, bucket, cookie cutters and cake round. I still have far fewer implements to cook with in game than I do irl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dyllwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Crab Cracker?<br />
<br />
And good point above about cookie cutters, but what about all the racial cookie cutters? They're all seperate tools ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I keep dreaming that one day they'll make the trophy work as an all purpose tool that can be used in place of any utensil. Actually I'll probably end up making a special mule for various utensils and geerloks. I estimate most of this mule's space will be taken up by baking. It's the thing I least like about baking, there's so much fewer tools used in other skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Here are tools that I keep for baking that are not in your list.<br />
<br />
geerlok (maybe you're not counting that one but anyway)<br />
collapsed spit<br />
collapsed mixing bowl<br />
bucket<br />
<br />
<br />
Theres 4 cookie cutters if you gotta have em all.<br />
animal shaped, barbarian shaped, gnome shaped, and troll shaped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">bucket is good.  didn't include collapsed or geerlock cause you dont &quot;have&quot; to have them though it helps greatly.</div></div><hr />
