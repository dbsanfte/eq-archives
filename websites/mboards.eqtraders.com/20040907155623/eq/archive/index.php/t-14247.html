<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i counted 8 different recipes using crab meat when looking at the sight.  anyone want to make them all and try for a party platter type combine?  might be a different one for each of the 4 meats.  it sounded interesting.  someone posted a lot fo the food still had tradeskill tags.  i still haven't gotten god yet or i would try it.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Many more than 8 - I think it might be 10 recipes per sauce (and 9 sauces so far and all 4 meat types work so we have 360 baking recipes in pattern at the moment) but then there are some ones outside the pattern that mysteriously have the tradeskill tag on them:  <br />
<br />
Spicy Tuna Salad Sandwich<br />
Pan Seared Orange Tuna <br />
Taelosian Tuna Kabobs<br />
<br />
Not sure what Millibeans saw when she made the Tuna Rice Surprise (that ate her wok) or if the Chowderly's Delightful Tuna Cakes recipe has a tradeskill tag.<br />
<br />
Too bad the Pan Seared Orange Tuna is only made by Vah Shir Rogues who still have their large pots from their class quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Millibeans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Tuna Rice Suprise does not have a tradeskill tag on it =/<br />
<br />
I have two sitting in my bank and ingredients to make 98 more. I bug reported that my wok got eaten up. If it is a bug then i hope they fix it soon.</div></div><hr />
