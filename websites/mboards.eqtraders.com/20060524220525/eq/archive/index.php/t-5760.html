<br />
i am looking for some underfoot platemail (or whatever brell cultural is called), i will pay and will imbue as many rubies as you want<br />
<br />
i am also looking for some luminant heraldic (mith marr human cultural) for my frog alt, if you are one of these types of smiths either reply here or shoot me a tell in game on either gimlis or niio</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ItienneEQ</div><div class="date">04-07-2003, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Naito made the luminant heraldic my frog wears. I gathered all the ingredients and donated... don't know if he makes it on speculation or how much it'd cost. I'm pretty sure that at the least you'd need to have the imbued diamonds for him.<br />
<br />
If the other stuff you mentioned is dwarven cultural, Eatr/Pbil makes that stuff and I know he makes some of it on speculation, so you probably wouldn't have to have all the ingredients. Don't know what he charges as I've never needed this stuff... I just know him from sickle making back before I started skilling up on those myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naito</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">... and every now and again I browse the EQTC servers.<br />
<br />
Happy to make ya luminant heraldic, either on 'you provide the parts' or 'you just provide the cash' basis.  The latter is faster, and guaranteed, the former is a lot cheaper...<br />
<br />
Find me in-game (usually mon, tue, thu, 6pm pacific - about midnight), and we can talk.<br />
<br />
... assuming you haven't since found someone...<br />

I don't really have any set prices, but in general, the more subcombines you can do for me in advance, the happier I'll be.  Celestial essence is the bane of my existence.<br />
<br />
Gimme a holler if you're interested.  My trader is Punko, I have more characters than I need, usually Groh, Skeelz, or Odjick lately.</div></div><hr />
