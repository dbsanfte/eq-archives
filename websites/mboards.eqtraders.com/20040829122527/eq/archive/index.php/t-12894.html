<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Having worked 60 hours a week for the last 4 weeks I feel its time to spend some of that extra cash on ME! :)<br />
<br />
I found an old post with video card reccomendations but I would like some newer opinions. (other post was from early 2003).<br />
<br />
What is a good video card for around $120-$160? I am looking in the geforce line since their product support is a bit better. I need to run EQ smoother. Currently I have to have clip plane at 0% to run thru most zones :( Thanks for any help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I added a Verto GeForce FX 5900 128 MB to my machine a couple months ago and it runs like a DREAM.  It was a little higher than your price range, $200 after the $50 rebate.  But it and EQ have played together flawlessly so far *knocks on wood* so you may wish to consider something similar at least.  The machine it's on has 2 GB RAM and is a Pentium 4 2.4, so with that card I turned all the EQ settings on full throttle and only ever have any trouble in the Bazaar or on raids.  And even then it's functional, I just turn stuff down a little to smooth it out.  A vast difference from the integrated video I was using till I got around to buying a card. *shudders*  I used to get lag in Halas for crying out loud.  Now the only place I ever pull in the clip plane is the Bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Silound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ATI cards are my snag. I refuse to use GeForce cards anymore since I got my 9700 back when it came out. If you don't want to spend too much, I'd grab an ATI 9600. Costs around 130-160 last I looked. They run the equivalent of a GeForce 5200 FX card, and easily run EQ neatly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I use a Raedon 9800 pro and I love it. Even with the clip plane set to 50% I can run through the bazaar and have no lag. 100% clip plane everywhere else.<br />
<br />
Now I got the raedon when it was still &quot;new&quot; but I would imagine it has dropped in price to your range.</div></div><hr />

Runs like a dream, and the only place I pull in the clipping plane is the bazaar. Otherwise, all models on, throttle wide open!<br />
<br />
AND I know it's in your price range, as I paid LESS than what you quoted through pricewatch.com...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kentarre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=10087) topic was from this Sept/Oct - not too outdated...<br />
<br />
I ended up purchasing the Asylum Geforce FX 5600 Ultra a few weeks ago and it runs great!  I have it on highest resolution and full clip plane, etc.  The only time I see delays is in PoK if there are a lot of people casting and sometimes the bazaar.<br />
<br />
It's for sale here (http://www.compuhq.com/compuhq/bfgasgefxul1.html) for $127 plus shipping.  That's where I bought it  and everything worked out great.</div></div><hr />

I checked pricewatch.com today and the cheapest Radeon 9800 256MB I see is $340. What site did you buy yours from? I see 9600XT 256 for $194 and 9600 256 for $105, but don't see a Radeon 9800 256 anywhere close to the range the original poster mentioned. The 9800 128 is curently $144 there. Can you let us know where you bought your card as I am still running a GeForge 3 Ti 4200 with 512MB RAM on my system which is a P4 1.6Ghz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I saw the older post but it was started 4 months ago. Thats long enough to outdate it. Computer parts dont stay in date for long. Since then I bet prices have dropped 25% on some parts :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gah, been gone a couple days...<br />
<br />
After reading this, I must officially smack myself in the forehead.<br />
<br />
Yes, it's a 9600, not a 9800. Not sure what I was thinking.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it does run extremely well. The only place I lag is the Bazaar.<br />
