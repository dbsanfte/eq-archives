<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was curious about the Collapsed Tackle Box. You pay 500pp for it, it summons a Collapsible Tackle Box which is No Drop. After you summon this Box.....what use does the original Collapsed Tackle Box have? Is it now worthless? I just summoned the Collapsible Tackle Box I need.....so what use is the original item I bought?<br />
I could understand if the summoned item is No Rent.....but that is not the case. <br />
I am new to fishing and was curious about this because it doesn't seem to make sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then, when you need a Tackle Box again, click on the collapsed, and voila!<br />
<br />
The advantage of the collapsed versions is that you don't need multiple tradeskill containers.  I have a collapsed M&amp;P, spit, and mixing bowl in a pack, seven weight reduction bags of various types, and one open main slot, which has whatever uncollapsed container I need at that point.  Without the collapsibles, I'd have three slots taken up with non-WR bags with 4-6 slots.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In addition, the mixing bowl has 4 or 6 slots in it, and you can replace this with a 10 slot bag (gaining 3 or 5 slots.)<br />
<br />
It would be nice if I didn't have to keep a primary slot free for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">spoiled.  i keep a primary pen for clicky.  love these things.  gave me back at least a tool box of space.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its a convenience for people who do tradeskills on the go and\or need to keep a free inventory slot at all times.<br />
<br />
I'm a Magician who does Baking, so I need to keep a free slot for summoning my horse or using summoned items, like the Lev rings (I rarely use summoned bags, since they're No Rent). I don't have a collapsable tacklebox atm - I keep a regular tacklebox in the bank and haul my catch back to the bank to work with it once I'm done. <br />
But I do have a collapsable spit and mixing bowl.<br />
<br />
You summon the collapsable container, shove the summoning device  back into a bag, use the summoned container, and either destroy the summoned container once you're done with it or use it as an extra bag.<br />
<br />
Now, if they'd only make a collapsable brew barrel...... *sigh*</div></div><hr />
