<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brodder FoamyMugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okies me initial recipe had whiskey in it...<br />
 Yall can figure out how whiskey's made...<br />
 Basically water + malt + grain/corn is fermented den mixed wif peat moss and aged/distilled into oak/elm barrels.<br />
<br />
Two recently found items make me tink dat they (SOE) is on track with my original recipe. We(and I) may have missed the boat here.<br />
 Older whiskey's don't work so maybe my underfoot whiskey would work...<br />
 Think that was underfoot brown + something distilled into a cask.<br />
 that might be seperable into shots or bottles.<br />
 What's this item...it's hinted above...<br />
<br />
 Peat Moss, fished in PoNightmare, Tranquility<br />
<br />
PEAT MOSS is also a forage from DEEPEST GUK  <br />
<br />
Now you just need to find a whiskey recipe that's on list but not sold anywhere and tradeskill useable.<br />
<br />
 heh let's call this Brodder's Blend for testing sake. (sake not Saki/sake`)<br />
<br />
Once the whiskey is found and brewed/distilled/aged we can focus again on main recipe.<br />
<br />
 Good luck folks...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just hope these recipes result in a drink that many players will ask for and want to buy - and hopefully something that has a trivial &gt;250 so that we GM's can be in demand.<br />
<br />
Whiskey!  Aye - a warriors drink!<br />
<br />
Underfoot whiskey eh?  Something to use those left over shrooms from the dwarf farm on.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if I linked that correctly.  I remember reading about in game quests that came from these books.  I haven't ever seen the books myself.  But if someone has a chance to look, maybe there are clues for Lewena's Secret.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>nyetro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Curled Whisker Whiskey?<br />
<br />
Saw this on Lucy's database but not on EQtraders or Allakhazam's website. I remember something being mentioned about a certain dwarf curling his whiskers. Anyways i believe that possibly its the Underfoot brown and something else, im gonna brew some today and see if its tradeskill flagged. Who knows...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gaeolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Since whiskey uses a grain of some kind, might make sense to try some barley or rice.<br />

I'll give it a try if I log on this evening and no one seems to have beat me to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyways i believe that possibly its the Underfoot brown and something else, im gonna brew some today and see if its tradeskill flagged. <br />
<br />
It's not tradeskill flagged.<br />
<br />
This leads me to think the raw ingredients for UB are used.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem here is the hints are IMO incredibly misleading.  It is difficult to fill in the blanks when you don't even know how many and where they are.<br />
<br />
Older whiskey's don't work so maybe my underfoot whiskey would work... <br />
<br />
I take this to be the goal.. to make underfoot whiskey?<br />
<br />
Think that was underfoot brown + something distilled into a cask. <br />
<br />
OK.  So UB is not flagged which is why I thought the ingredients of UB were used here instead.  Anyway, the right side of this equation is goofy.  <br />
<br />
&quot;something distilled into a cask.&quot; could mean (UB + something) distilled into a cask... meaning a cask is the container type used in the combine of UB + something.<br />
<br />
OR it could mean UB + (something distilled into a cask) meaning that a subcombined something is needed.<br />
<br />
that might be seperable into shots or bottles. <br />
<br />
Seems obfuscation to me or at least leaning towards the 2nd option above UB + (something distilled into a cask) + (shot or bottle).<br />
<br />
What's this item...it's hinted above...<br />
<br />
Uh.. what?  So peat moss is in.  Except I also read this to mean that peat moss is the 'something' in the first option:  UB + something == UB + peat moss.<br />
<br />
Now you just need to find a whiskey recipe that's on list but not sold anywhere and tradeskill useable.<br />
<br />
Huh?  I don't get this part at all.  It sounds easy but I couldn't figure any way to jibe this with the rest of the hints other than it seems a known recipe is one of the ingredients.<br />
<br />
DNC:<br />
1. UB ingredients + peat moss<br />
2. #1 + various other combined alc drinks (vodka etc.)<br />
<br />
Varied both #1 and #2 for different container types.  I'll probably do a more exhaustive try on #2 but it seems futile given my confusion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vuron808</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Assumptions for this set of attempts:<br />
Combine involves underfoot brown (even though it isn't tradeskill flagged) + a known brew (that is tradeskill flagged, but isn't vendor sold).<br />
<br />
For each test I varied the number of underfoot browns and the number of 'other brews' both up to two each.  I also tried each combination with and without peat moss, and also by itself or with a shot glass, cask, or bottle.<br />
<br />
Tried:<br />
Tumpy Tonic<br />
Vodka<br />
+ several others (don't have my notes handy).  Basically I worked off the brewed alc list here trying brews that weren't vendor or sold and not using the beers/wines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">How about using the underfoot MUSHROOMS instead of the bew.  We know they are tradeskill flagged, and making a whisky out of underfoot mushrooms will make an underfoot whisky.<br />
<br />
Mebbe mushroom + malt + water + Peat moss?<br />
<br />
I can't seem to get any Peat Moss, so I can't try it out, but given the standard formula for whisky is water/malt/grain, if you switch out the grain for a mushroom that'll be something a dwarf would do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
does this mean you do not actually know what the recipe is, or if it works, or that you just have an idea of what it was supposed to be like?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got hung up on this initially too until a friend with much more tradeskill experience corrected me.  My first batch of tries I use the ingredients for UB because it wasn't flagged.  Second I used the UB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Twistagain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">This is something that has confused me for quite a while...<br />
<br />
Lots of people seem to immediately jump on the &quot;it doesn't have a tradeskill flag&quot; bandwagon when someone suggests something.<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, the tradeskill flag is about as useful as the item's icon for information purposes. (read:  useless.)<br />
<br />
There are items out there that we KNOW FOR A FACT are tradeskill-usable that do NOT have a flag.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of items out there that have no known use that DO have a flag. (Granted, it is technically **possible** that ALL of these items do have a place in some set of recipes that are unsolved...but there are too many of these items to believe that this is actually the case.)<br />
<br />
The point is that the tradeskill flag is, AT BEST, a guideline of whether it may or may not be usable. It is not the end-all be-all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So they verified the recipes. If they did it, they should have certainly tagged them as tradeskillable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds like that is step one. Fermenting would seem to suggest that something is done to it before being &quot;mixed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;den mixed wif peat moss and aged/distilled into oak/elm barrels&quot;<br />
<br />
Step two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nepper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">&quot;distilled into oak/elm barrels &quot;<br />
Something I had touched on before, but I couldn't get far with it.  Could this be a smithing/fletching subcombine?  Either elm/oak bow staff, or maybe those anoying Faydark twigs?  Tough to say.  I had put some ideas in <br />
Any thoughts if this is worth revisiting?this thread. (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=11652)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kenamena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">As with other threads we discussed that recipies in EQ are simplified. So most likely a standard cask is used and there isnt a seperate process before combining with Peat Moss. It is likely all one combine at least into the cask. Look at his in game diaries for reference to style.</div></div><hr />
