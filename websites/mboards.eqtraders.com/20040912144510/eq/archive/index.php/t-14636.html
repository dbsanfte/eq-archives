<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I want to Farm Spiderlings.....but the ones in East Commons and North Ro dont have much........can anyone recommend a good zone where there are lots of drops from Spiderlings?<br />
I mean Spider Silks almost grow on trees from Crags in EK.<br />
But for Spiderling Silks I am having trouble......any recommendations?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daikoku Ashikaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if you are a non tracking class, FoB is your best bet, they basicly are in 2 spots with only 2 real roamers.<br />
<br />
othewise, ferrot.<br />
<br />
Dai</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Remi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Feerot! NE of the port in.  Even the spiders drop spiderling silks.  :)  And you don't need track there, just run around killing spiders and spiderlings in the NE corner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Feerrott has had its spiderling silk drop rate cut by at least 2/3rds, due to all the ogre newbie quest drops.<br />
<br />
I'd say get hopper hides from Marus Seru, and shadeling silk from Shadeweavers' Thicket, personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can you make Silk Threads with the Shadeling Silk?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No, but you can make shade silk thread which works with LQ hopperhides only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've noticed a real lack of Spiderling Silk at my level, as far as farming goes. EC used to be a good source until recently; I've killed as many as 52 Spiderlings with 1 Silk drop. Feerot was good, but that dried up too.<br />
<br />
I still manage to get a few, buying from lower level players (which I don't mind in the least, if it's available), but it seems like the drop rate may have been constrained by level.<br />
<br />
Misty, of all places, seems good, but the repop rate is horrible. I always find myself at a bottleneck with this one item; Silks are a dime-a-dozen in EK from the Crags, but I just can't get these things to drop.<br />
<br />
Nothing new here, I just feel like I'm overlooking something...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>xonbink</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">outside gukta (formerly grobb?) is a good area to kill spiderlings -<br />
<br />
some drop up to 4 each.<br />
<br />
however I have noticed in the past that the zone is buggy - sometimes you will go there and find VERY few mobs - seems that occasionally all the mobs will get stuck in one spot - AoE spells work nice in this case.<br />
<br />
also - everything is on the same table - so kill all the trash there to make spiderlings spawn.<br />
<br />
back when the froglok race first became playable, everyone was playing a frog on my server - and litterally thousands of spiderling silks went to the various vendors -  I managed to stock up quite a bit just farming the vendors but of course that has changed now that no one starts a new froglok anymore -<br />
<br />
still imo this is the easiest place to find spiderling silks faster than even feerot --<br />
<br />
good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Seemour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've found Everfrost to have a fairly decent drop rate for spiderling silks.  I run through the canyons, killing anything that moves, and in addition to silks, I also wind up with some low and medium quality hides, and even the occassional high quality bear pelt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rezilaturb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This past weekend while I massacred a few brownies in their little village, I happened to kill the 2 spiderlings there also. Much to my surprise they dropped a lot of spiderling silks, by the time I got 10 brownie meat I had 4 and some stacks of spiderling silks. Spiderlings are on a 6 minute timer, not sure if you can pull them without aggroing the brownies cause everything inside was green to me and some light blues outside. But I got 7 (yes, seven) spiderling silks from one spiderling, couldn't believe it. The average was about 3, only one out of the whole hunting didn't drop a single one. Perfect camp if you happen to be the lazy type like me and watch TV while camping components.</div></div><hr />
