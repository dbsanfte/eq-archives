<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baldaek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night, after some hesitation (3 months sitting at 245), I decided to finish out brewing.  Gratz me 250 GM Brewer.  As if it's a big accomplishment with the ease of acquiring ingredients.<br />
<br />
Data:<br />
<br />
135 to 185  Faydwer Shaker<br />
<br />
Probably 350 combines.<br />
<br />
<br />
188 to 248 Minotaur Hero's brew<br />
<br />
took about 500 combines from 185 to 210 then another 300 to get to 248<br />
<br />
249, 250  Kaladim Constitutional<br />
One time that being a dwarf really helps as the main components are right there for me.  The hardest part of this brew is acquiring the corking device.<br />
<br />
<br />
To max your skill from 135 to 250:  I say spend the entire time in and around Kaladim.  All the Hero's parts are sold in South Kaladim or the vendor houses just outside Kaladim in BB.  The only reason to leave is to gather the few extra parts for the Constitutional (soda, cork, corking device, yarrow, CE's).  Low numbers in Kaladim make lag and zoning almost invisible.  There is only 1 barrel, though, and if it's camped you may have a wait.</div></div><hr />
