Please forgive me for I'm not a tradeskiller at heart.  You are a rare and special breed and I just don't have what it takes to join your ranks completely.<br />
<br />
With that said, I would like to master jewelery and tailoring with 2 different characters and I need some help acquiring the needed materials.  I work 2 jobs and have no time or interest in traveling around to find everything I need.<br />
<br />
Is there anyone here that would be willing to keep me supplied with the needed materials (of course starting out with the basic stuff and over time working up to the master stuff).<br />
<br />
If so, an approximate price range for all the needed supplies for each skill tree would be greatly appreciated (I also understand that individual results will vary).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance to all who reply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kanielle</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, I'm not sure if it was clear or not but I intend to pay in PP for the services rendered.  I don't know if there is a &quot;going rate&quot; for this type of service or not but perhaps if I double the cost of the materials that would be fair?<br />
<br />
In that way a lower level player could earn enough money helping me to master 2 tradeskills of their own.  Of course, that's assuming that the cost of materials for these 2 skill trees isn't too high for my 40 druid to finance.  I do have a sizeable amount of pp saved up for this as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for Tailoring look thru the repices on the site here and figure out exactly what you path you'd like to take and then post here (http://www.eqluclin.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=12&amp;sid=9ea7058e845e71584a52f84ac274a16c)  as not many of the server visit this board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kanielle</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 08:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Moonlilly, that's great advice.  After looking into it further I agree that JC materials are simple enough to find if you have the pp so I think I'll put my chanter to work making jewelry and keep my druid making the pp I need to stay in business then work on the tailoring afterwards.</div></div><hr />
