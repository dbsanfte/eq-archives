<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sannyi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a grandmaster tradeskiller in all trades. I'm able to make almost anything including Human Blue Diamond Cultural, and even a few Elemental Plane tradeskills depending on the items. Please send me a tell on my bazaar mule (Sannyi) if you ever need something made, I'll always try and make what you need if i have the time. Feel free to send me a tell anytime! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pondlife</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sannyi, not sure how many on Stromm are in the 1750 club, but you are in rarified company indeed.  Congratulations!<br />
<br />
I am looking for a GM Tailor to make a couple of combines for Fleeting Quivers.  I have all the ingredients, but just need the services of a Tailor.<br />
<br />
I'll check back here later today, and will send you a /tell in-game this evening (around 6pm EST or so) to see if you can assist.<br />
<br />
I will, of course, offer coin for the service.  Anyone who GM's a tradeskill has much vested in it (I know, having GM'd Fletching, what the costs on PP and time can be) and its times like this you can get a little pay-back!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>iasmin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Congratulations and I agree. A Stromm 1750 Grandmaster is a rare thing indeed. I hope to see you around the bazaar at some point. Perhaps we can /wave. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sannyi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i'm pretty sure there are 2-3 more 1750's on stromm but indeed they are rare and its really rough to pound out tradeskills to max them all =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Pondlife</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Kept missing you yesterday Sannyi - hopefully I can meet up with you soon.  When I find a good LDoN pick-up group, I try to stay with them for as long as possible - too easy to get a group that you know is doomed after the first (over) pull!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Granpa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hi,<br />
<br />
Congratulation on your accomplishment, that's amazing.  I would like to know if you also do combines.  I need a faithstone made and have all the pieces.  I would gladly pay for your services.  Also, I would like to buy 1 small sandblasted wrist and 1 small sandblasted cloak.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Pondlife</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just so everyone knows, Sannyi can be trusted and was absolutely great about responding to my tells, and doing the combine for me.<br />
<br />
Now the proud owner of a Fleeting Quiver.<br />
<br />
Thanks Sannyi, much appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sannyi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks Pond i'm glad you enjoy the quiver. Lately i've recieved 5 more tells from people that want more quivers lol and i simply cant respond to them all lol, so my apologies to those i could not respond too. I think that i have to limit the combines to things i farm myself and then put them on trader. My main intent was to get order for a specific item that is not normally sold in bazaar instead of combining items for people, as i coudl do this on my own time. When combining for people its a huge hassle to work out both schedules as i group and raid quite a bit and rarely have free time (plus work and kids!) So i ask those that want to me to make an item just msg me with the item you are looking for and i'll try to get the things for it and sell the completed item itself.<br />
<br />
Granpa - I sell a variety of faithstones atm, if i dont have yours i can easily make another. On the sand armor thats a bit low for me to do and i would ask you find someone a little more toward the level. I primarily wish to make very high end tradeskill items.</div></div><hr />
