<br />
I am looking for in-game maps of the all the zones in EQ (Ok, maybe not every last zone but as many as I can get). I remember just after LoY came out someone posted a link to a great site that had in-game maps for almost all teh zones. I had to do some major tweking to my computer to make it work and it erased a lot of my EQ folders. If someone can PLEASE help me with a link to a map site I thank you very much. Have a great day, good luck on your levels, AAs and APs!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EnfinitiStarr8</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 12:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, when I said &quot;In-game maps&quot; I ment maps that will pop up in the Maps box we got when LoY came out. I use to have EVERY map of EQAtlas printed but when that came out it made things a lot easier for some zones. And the ones I downloaded for the zones that were not &quot;free&quot; help even more. Like there was a Butcherblock zone map, and I really dont know why LoY didnt give you a BB zone map! But that is what I am looking for. Thank you.<br />
<br />
P.S. Thank you Laureana for trying to help me. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://maps.eq-toolbox.com/<br />
<br />
However, last I checked, they still didn't have meaningful LDoN maps.  A good set of those can be found here:<br />

Hope this helps you out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a spot at the top to download a zip of all the maps.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!</div></div><hr />

I had a feeling I probably wasnt thinking of the same thing you were, but I figured Id try just in case :) Good thing a couple other people knew what you meant and were able to help :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EnfinitiStarr8</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you all, that is the site I was looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dahna</div><div class="date">09-19-2003, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Funny thing is that there is also loy maps for the zone where you cannot use them (like ssra, VT). Or if there is another way to view them ingame...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eumerin</div><div class="date">09-19-2003, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Certain 3rd party programs of dubious ethics and/or user license agreement status also allow you to view the zone.  I would imagine that it would be a simple matter to convert one of those maps into a format that the LoY map reader could comprehend.<br />
<br />
This is almost certainly NOT what happened with the new LDoN maps, however.  There are maps that are missing, there are maps that consist of a straight line showing you the quickest path to take, and there are maps that have highly detailed rooms - except that they're inevitably missing one or two branchs that probably don't have anything of interest in them.<br />
<br />
But yes, I noticed the map bit.  I downloaded a map of Plane of Hate B the other night before my first trip there, and then discovered after zoning in that my map wouldn't work.<br />

And Dahna, I take it you like FSS?<br />

Wow, I am impressed to see that there is someone here who actually know Nagano's work. What made you hint about that ? ;)<br />
<br />
Also about the map, there was a way to use a map as a background image in the old days, but I dont know if it still worth it now.</div></div><hr />
