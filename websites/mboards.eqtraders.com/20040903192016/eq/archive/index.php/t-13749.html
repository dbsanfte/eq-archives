<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Satrn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here goes quite a few Bakeing recipies so the post will be long.<br />
I will not place the stats and trivials except for 2 i leave them for the rest of you to find them and enjoy.<br />
<br />
There are in GoD 4 types of meat, Cragbeast, Crab, Hynid meat and Tuna. Cragbeast and Hynid Meat are foraged in Natimbi and other zones. Tuna and Crab are fished for. Most of these have to be &quot;washed&quot; and &quot;reduced&quot;.  To reduce a 13lb meat of what ever type requires a fillet knife and appropriate container. when the meat has been reduced to 1lb segments you must then Wash it.<br />
To wash it place 1lb of meat in a bowl and combine to get &quot;clean Meat&quot;.<br />
<br />
The next step is fairly easy so i wont go into too much detail other than to give a light explanation and approximate amounts of what i have seen. To make &quot;sauced Meat&quot; (what i will call these combines as a whole) Combine a sauce(brewed) and a &quot;clean meat&quot; and you end up with &quot;sauced meat&quot;. the combine is done in a mixing bowl.<br />
<br />
Let me give you the recipie for the best sauce that seemed to yield the highest trivials.  Beer-batter  is made with red wine(1)<br />
shortbeer(1) flour(1) sugar(1) Vinegar(1)  and Pepper(1). combine this with any meat the beer batter itself is brewed and trivials around 100.<br />
<br />
all of these recipies are made with sauced meat useing beer batter.<br />
+bread=sandwich<br />
+veg water and pot=stew<br />
+Jug of sauce= soup<br />
+Jug of Sauce and spice=Steak<br />
+vegtable=appetizer<br />
+batwing+rolls<br />
+ Milk egg egg veg flour sugar=pie<br />
+egg egg dough veg sugar=cake trivial 222<br />
+egg egg dough veg = souffle trivial 252<br />
<br />
<br />
there are literally hundreds of new recipies and i hope all of ya enjoy the search and this helps to a degree</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">is it generic cleaned meat or is it cleaned crab and cleaned cragbeast?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Satrn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">that is generic meat, ie you do need to use god meats but it works for all of them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brodder FoamyMugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh I see &quot;beer batter&quot; made it in alright...<br />
<br />
  Though wonder about &quot;tempura&quot; batter (ice soda water + rice flour + spices) now...<br />
<br />
  Wonder how many of my old &quot;suggestions&quot; from over 2 years ago are in the works now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Satrn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yessir it did an thanks for suggestion to try Brodder  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Justicator Loremeister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I want to help with figuring out some of the trivials and such, but what is the method for identifing an item's trivial value?  This is my first attempt into trying to help figuring out recipes and such :)<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
BTW:  Wouldn't it be fun if we could use the 12 lb tuna to create a 12lb tuna steak rather than having to break it down and only creating 1lb tuna steaks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">stacking issues with your 8 lb, 9 lb, and 15 lb tuna steaks.  several other recipes were like that in the past.  making it all 1lb portions isn't as bad as you think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">from EQTraders website:<br />
<br />
Baking Components: Barbequed Cragbeast Meat, jug of sauces, pixie dust<br />
In: spit, oven, tanaan oven, collapsible spit<br />
<br />
I am getting DNC ... has anyone figured it out?  Or is there a book with the source for this recipe that I might buy off a vendor and check it?<br />
<br />
I have figured out that recipes that call for a snake egg, really require two of those.  Guess I will head off to Felwithe and see if I can scrounge up more Pixie Dust and give two of those a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">is it for the baking quests like simple file and other stuff is for smithing?  they require a sort of hybrid flag/skillup/faction system i think to make on your own.<br />
<br />
edit doesn't work.  ok well that was my idea.  it might not be live just yet.  that gets us no where though so keep up the good hunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've actually completed all 7 of those tradeskill quests on the boat ... don't ask me why.  So I don't think not be flagged for the combine is the issue, but twas a good thought :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Drubear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wonder if they can be &quot;broken down&quot; now too? Hmmm... (something to check when I get home tonight.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pixie Dust = Smoker <br />
<br />
Going to test it as soon as I figure out where I stored my Smoker away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Let me see if I understand you.<br />
<br />
Are you saying that you can make Beer-based batter:<br />
<br />
Brewing Components: cup of flour, cup of sugar, Ground Pepper, red wine, short beer, vinegar<br />
<br />
(db says trivial is 95, BTW)<br />
<br />
And then<br />
<br />
take the batter plus 2 eggs, one clump of dough, and one vegetable, and get a Souffle that trivials at 252?<br />
<br />
Seems like a forager's dream, esp. witht he new interface making subcombines easier, or am I missing something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ariaya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I love these new recipies .. trying to hit the 200 mark (182 atm) ... but .. <br />
<br />
On the recipies that require eggs, only snake eggs are listed in the database but can we use other types of eggs?  <br />
<br />
... it's gonna be a while (probably tomorrow) before I can make the sauce to check myself ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Pardick_KB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I know basilik egg do not work.<br />
<br />
I have yet to try the others</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Satrn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">no sorry only snake eggs work atm, as to the fillet knif sorry it worked in beta. some things did change for live</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sinead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Taelosian Tuna Kabobs:  (Trivial 228 according to Baking UI)<br />
<br />
- 3 lb. Saltwater Tuna (Fished all over GoD)<br />
- Ground Garlic (Purchased from rogue weapon vendors - I got mine in Neriak 3rd Gate)<br />
- Skewers (Non-stackable - NOT returned on my one success, but that may have been a bug - I reported it in case it was)<br />
- Habanero Pepper (Foraged in PoFire / PoKnowlege)<br />
- Spotted Mushroom (NODROP, Non-stackable, VERY RARE drop off of any mushroom model mob in Dawnshroud Peaks)<br />
<br />
Kabobs are flagged as usable in tradeskills, so be looking for some sort of combination plate / basket / platter thing down the line that includes this one.  I threw my one success in the bank to make sure I didn't eat it.  Tagged as &quot;This is a meal&quot;, no stats.  The mushrooms are rare enough (1 drop in over 120 kills) that this isn't likely meant to be used for skilling up.  I'm gonna guess it's for a quest later on.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I haven't yet got to try other weights of Saltwater Tuna, but I plan on trying as soon as I get my hands on some more spotted mushrooms.  It would be great if the recipie would allow the reduced 1 lb tuna as well... I'll keep ya posted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ok, I've only tried fishing in one GoD zone so far, but all I'm getting are 6-14 lb saltwater tuna. I see you have to break it down to get 1 lb - but how do I get 2 lb? Is it fished somewhere else, or a further combine?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Laeamilea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Barbecued Crab Souffle<br />
<br />
The trivial is 242 according to the new UI<br />
<br />
The recipe is as follows<br />
<br />
1 Barbecued Crab Meat<br />
2 Snake Egg<br />
1 Vegetables<br />
1 Clump of Dough</div></div><hr />

<br />
With 200 Fishing, I only get 6-15lb tuna and crab.  Only with an alt (Fishing was low 20s, now 50s) was I able to get 2-5lb tuna and crab.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Laeamilea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I've found that with a fishing of near 100 I get everything from 1lb to 16lb for both tuna and crab. I'm pretty sure it doesn't have much to do with your fishing skill.</div></div><hr />
