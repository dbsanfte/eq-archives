<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhodari Mawr</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 02:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, and thanks for your time in reading this/posting a reply...<br />
<br />
My wife and I are about to embark on our journey into EQ (formerly UO players), and I have some starting up questions (well, mainly one):<br />
<br />
In order for my wife and I to both play at the same time, I know we both need separate accounts, no problem there.  Yet what I don't know is what exactly should I but when it comes to the software of the game and the expansions.  I asked a few at work who play, and they THOUGHT that if I just buy the PoP, which has the core game, that when I patch, I will get &quot;patched&quot; for all the updates.   I somehow think that won't work, just because it would be too good to be true.  So, my root question is, will that work?   If not, how about if I bought the Gold collector's version, which has everything, and also the PoP to get a separate account key, or whatever it is that will give my wife and I each accounts...  That way I can install the older expansions from the Gold, then the PoP with it's key on one cpu, while the other would be just Gold install.  Would this work?<br />
<br />
Any help is greatly appreciated, as we are anxious to get started!<br />
<br />
See you online, soon hopefully!   :mrgreen:</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can only access the other areas (Kunark, Velious, Luclin) if you purchase and install those expansion packs, again for BOTH machines.<br />
<br />
Each expansion comes with its own registration key, possibly the Gold version comes with a universal key, that needs to be entered to enable the zones in game, but this key is unique. Yes you could install the same to both machines (ie from one set of cds') but you would encounter problems should you try and run them at the same time.<br />
<br />
So in answer to your question : install Gold on one machine : have access to all EQ, Kunark, Velious and Luclin zones, but NOT POP, with a valid account<br />
<br />
Install PoP on the other machine, and the other machine and have access to All EQ zones and Planes of Power zones. (as i understand it)<br />
<br />
You will NOT get patched for the other zones, or if you do, you will not be able to get into them.<br />
<br />
Hope that was clear.<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curufea</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 06:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you install EQ gold your computer will have access to all EQ, Kunark, Velious and Luclin zones with it.<br />
If you install PoP your computer will have access to all EQ and PoP zones.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BUT : <br />
Your computer having access to one zone (IE : have the files for it installed) does not means you will have access.<br />
Indeed, you need to register for EACH accounts the game AND every single expension you want to play with.<br />
<br />
<br />
So in order to have 2 accounts active for EQ, Kunark, Velious, Luclin, and PoP you will need 2 EQ gold + 2 PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pietre Christopher-Ryskin</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your account is basically separate from the installation process. If you want two Accounts, you need to create two accounts with valid unused Keys for the Expansions you want on that Account.<br />
<br />
Any given Key is used when applied, and as such, once you have used your key (be it for creating a new Account, or adding Expansions to another), its gone.<br />
<br />
The patcher will, based on what files you have, determine what expansions you need to patch.<br />
<br />
Two EQ Gold, and two EQ PoP will allow you full access on two accounts to the entire game. Any other combination will leave one or the other short of contents. In addition, LoY has just been released for preordering &amp; download, and each Account would have to purchase the Expansion to access the contents.<br />
<br />
In short, your Account determines what you are allowed to access, and the installed files determines what you -can- access. If you're not allowed to go somewhere, you won't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not 100% sure (about 98% though) - But I think that the gold tin has PoP with it. Thats the nice part.<br />
<br />
I traveled around and found an EB Game World store that had the gold box for about $55. I'm not sure this is regular pricing though. It's box (metal tin) was dented a couple of times - so that may have effected the price.<br />
<br />
In any case - check the tin before buying PoP separately - there would be no need if it was included!<br />
<br />

&quot;Many see the advantages of the Scavenger - but few are able to be truly called one.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
This thread on the necro newbie boards but does an awesome job of wandering through a lot of newbie tips and questions.  No, it doesn't answer your question, it's more in-game advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhodari Mawr</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks to all who responded, I have a pretty good idea of what's up now...<br />
<br />
FYI:  PoP is selling on www.amazon.com for 25.99, BUT there is a $20 mail in rebate, so for $5.99 total, and has free shipping.<br />
<br />
Also, amazon.com has the tin Gold version for 49.99, $20 off normal (because you can get it at sony for 49.99 as well), but it too has free shipping. The site also says that PoP IS included with the Gold tin...<br />
<br />
Sounds to me that al who replied wouldn't benefit from this info, but maybe you can pass it along to someone who hasn't bought one or the other yet.<br />
<br />
One other thing, the tin gold box is going for about $100 on eBay, and that is with another day of bidding left..   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KyrosKrane</div><div class="date">01-20-2003, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing to be aware of.  Sony, like far too many companies, uses the same name for different products depending on where it's sold.  I'm in the unusual position of having bought both the American and European &quot;Gold&quot; boxes.  Here are some of the differences:<br />
<br />
American:<br />
[list] Gold-colored metallic &quot;tin&quot; box<br />
 Includes PoP<br />
 Includes five CD's -- one each for Classic, Kunark, Velious, Luclin, and PoP<br />
 Includes ONE key code to activate a new account with all five expansions, OR upgrade an existing account to use all five.[/list:u]<br />
<br />
European:<br />
[list] Black and gold cardboard box<br />
 Does NOT include PoP<br />
 Includes five CD's -- Classic/Kunark on one, Velious on one, and Luclin on three. <br />
 Includes three key codes: One for Classic/Kunark, and one each Velious and Luclin[/list:u]<br />
<br />
With the European box, you can use the key codes to upgrade different accounts -- so you could create a new account with Classic/Kunark only, upgrade a second with Velious, and upgrade a third with Luclin if you so wish.  I don't think you can create a new account with the Velious and Luclin codes.<br />
<br />
To get access to a particular expansion, the following must both be true:<br />
[list] The files for the expansion are installed on your machine, AND<br />
 The account you're logging in on has that expansion enabled[/list:u]<br />
<br />
Note that you can install all the files (from either boxed set) on as many PC's as you wish.  You just can't log in to one account from multiple machines at once.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps clear things up a bit.</div></div><hr />

You made one little mistake in the europe box. Namely you get 2 accountkeys, one for classis/RoK/SoV and one for Luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KyrosKrane</div><div class="date">01-20-2003, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Odd.  I distinctly remember entering three keys when I first installed.  I wondered whether they'd simply repackaged spare CD's and manuals from the first print runs of the games in a new box, because that's exactly what it looked like to me.<br />
<br />
Of course, my memory does tend to resemble Swiss cheese at times ...<br />
<br />
I'll double-check the CD numbers when I get home and edit this message with what I find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KyrosKrane</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 02:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/em curses his bad memory.<br />
<br />
I've been forgetting to check this for over a week now.  I finally remembered last night.<br />
<br />
There are three distinct codes in my package.  Each activates an expansion, as I said earlier.<br />
<br />
Maybe there were multiple versions of the box?  One with three codes, and a newer box with one or two codes?</div></div><hr />
