<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>elty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Besides 10lbs pie and MTP, what else is easy to make?<br />
<br />
I see some tuna fish that trivial at 202 and some GoD baking with cragbeast/hynid meat that trivial at 222. However all other seems to require vegetable and/or egg (and I heard drake/wurm/dragon egg is not working)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Beer-battered Cragbeast/Hynid steaks triv at 222.  requires beer battered cragbeast/hynid meat + spices + jug of sauces.<br />
<br />
End of problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did the Tuna to 202 and then the Cragbeast/Hynid (as posted above) to 222.<br />
<br />
Very easy skilling with new UI.<br />
<br />
Only point is you need to be a forager for Crag/Hynid meat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's kinda slow, but if you're a Druid or Ranger, Jagged Pine is great. I did 250 there on Griffon, Anaconda and Vegetable Casseroles and you can even get the eggs from Basilisk Genitors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Footsore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">PoP meats.<br />
<br />
Search for Jord, Boar, and Bloody Raven. They all triv above 250 and require few other items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>uncleshmoozo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Because I can forage in the Plane of Justice I'm using Planar Fruit Pies (a.k.a. Justice Fruit Pies) which trivial at 282 (I think) to get there, myself.<br />
<br />
I like the stats on them for some of my alts, and the materials are fairly easy to put together once you forage up a few stacks of the Planar Fruit.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Murmullo DelBosque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you can forage and fish, Breaded Storm Salmon (PoStorms - fished) will get you up to 213 and if you have planar access and can remain invis or FD, fish from PoWater and breadcrumbs will take you to 222.  <br />
<br />
Just another alternative.  Take a little while to collect the bits but it is less clicking when it comes down to combines (not much of an issue now though with the new UI).  <br />
<br />
AFter that, I'm going to switch to Planar fruit pies since I can forage...<br />
<br />
Happy baking!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bauhb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I know you're not interested, but seriously, MTP's are the way to go. There's almost no farming required, and the vast majority of vendor-buyable items can be bought in pok. Most of the forages can be bought for gold pieces in the bizarre.<br />
<br />
All things considered, they're pretty cheap to make - and if you're enterprising enough, you can make one heck of a profit while making them.<br />
<br />
/auction WTS Misty Thicket Picnics 10pp each, or a stack of 20 for 175pp!!<br />
<br />
People in the Sol Ro PoK got tired of hearing it, but as a level 40ish druid, I was making several K per day, which went towards my spoon.<br />
<br />
While making MTPs, you get your tailoring into the 80's. You get your brewing into the 160's.<br />
<br />
Yes, there's a lot of subcombines. But, as someone who can't stand farming, I found it much better than farming in JPF, which I was tired of anyways, since I had been xp'ing there all the time. Only the brownie parts need to be farmed, and then only a small amount is needed, and the brownie camp at lfay has great drop rates.<br />
<br />
And, MTP's sell. They're used for the EoTS quest, and they're a very good (and very cheap) stat food.<br />
<br />
If yeh don't want to do them, then that's okay... but IMO it really is the best way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kahmon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree with Bauhb that MTP's really are the best way to go, but they left out one of the main reasons:<br />
<br />
All of Misty Thickett Picnic's Subcombines have yields of about 10. That means that for just 1 set of subs you can then make 10 tries for skill. I went 200-250 in about 4 days doing only MTPs and only spent a couple hours a day baking. This was even before the new UI.<br />
<br />
The only catch is needing to have brewing, tailoring, and smithing all at about 80 and all 3 of those are easy to get to those levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hammerfoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok maybe its just my characters luck or his lack of wis (183) but after doing 5 stacks of MTP combines I went from 234 to 236.  I even tossed in a stack of Gryphon melts with no skill ups.<br />
<br />
Is this the usual route of skill gains or should I wait a few levels/thousand pp to get some better gear then try to continue with baking?  <br />
<br />
I choose to try MTP's because after burning through 12 stacks of vegetables doing the souffle route I was looking for a better use of the limited vegetables.  The bazaar costs have skyrocketed for vegetables.  I have a druid constantly foraging for them to supplement what I buy but he cant keep up with my baker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I got 10 skill, (222 to 232) on 400 MTPs<br />
<br />
1 skill per 40 combines.<br />
<br />
With the yealds on components and yealds on successes its a pretty good route for selling your results, but it is quite a bit of work.<br />
<br />
HAMMERFOE: 183 wis is not great for a tradeskiller.  I dont know what level you are but you really should look at investing in a set of Tradeskilling Clothes.<br />
<br />
Go to Baz, fill in your race and class, then set the thing to look for wis.  Now choose an item slot and it will list wis values.  Just buy any cheap ones with good wis.<br />
<br />
(studded rockhopper gear is pretty good)<br />
If you have the cash, a Shield of bane warding is 20 wis.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hammerfoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ok thank you for the information, btw 39th level cleric.  Been looking for items in the bazaar more for adventure wear.  However I went back the souffle route today just before getting booted and not getting back in I got to 241.  <br />
<br />
I will go and invest in some + wis gear for trade skills... of course I will have to make room in the bank for it... packed with junk for trade skilling anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Daragoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I agree Justice fruit pie seem the way to go.  I have been getting between 5 and 8 skill-ups per 200 combines</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>myss miou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Tuna to 202 <br />
Cragbeast/Hynid  to 222<br />
Planar fruit pie up to what ever you need / want.<br />
<br />
<br />
imo this is the cheapest way to skill up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Naeadiene Needsamap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">But at level 39 the PoP forages and drops are harder to come by.  Though the GoD meats are easily fishable &amp; foraged.<br />
<br />
I did MTP's and it took a long time, but I got the benefit of the stats on my first success and sold a ton of picnics.  Selling MTP's has funded my other tradeskilling.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, do whatever combines you can get your hands on.  Everyone has a preference do what makes you happy. :D</div></div><hr />
