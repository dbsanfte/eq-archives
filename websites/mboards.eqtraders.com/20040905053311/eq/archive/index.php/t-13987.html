<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tshesebe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello fellow tradeskillers.  Looooong time reader &amp; fan here.  I'm struggling to get my tailoring up (currently 194), and have read the thread about Othmirs vs. Solstice robes.  I'm a halfer so Imbued emeralds are limited now (none for sale on my server for over a week), and was wondering what I could do to break 201.  The question is, is Othmir faction really that necessary?  I know about the ulthork tusk, Lodi shell, and crusty quests, but is Othmir faction necessary for anything besides those quests?  My othmir factin is very high (amiable or better), and I'm kos to the walrus types (can't get worse), so I was hoping to get some hides, skill up, and work on bringing otter faction back up if necessary (they ar cute little rascals).  Thanks everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PetrosDaroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The only reason I have ever found to keep your othmir faction is because of the fact that one of the vendors at the brew barrel sells components that are ONLY available from him (brown algae amongst some other ingredients).  Brown algae is most useful for making Coldain Velium Temper.  But it's easy to have someone else grab it for you.  Quad 'em until you can quad no more, I say.<br />
<br />
I leveled on those little critters from level 57 to 60.  Killed thousands of 'em and took me quite a while to actually become KOS.  You'll need to harmonize the chief since you don't really wanna pull him anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KanadWinterstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">never thought I'd see a druid wood elf complain about being kos to a merchant...<br />
<br />
I think I'll add to my sig, that sneak is by far the most unbalanced ability in the game today. Getting brown algae is no problem for you Petros, just click and wow! blumblum sells to you again.<br />
<br />
grumble</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aside from the above mentioned merchant, there is no reason to keep othmir faction other then personal reasons for not clubbing otters :)<br />
<br />
 BTW it is now cheaper to buy the tempers from Nimran Stonecutter in Thurgadin then it is to make them now.</div></div><hr />

aroo? He has them again?<br />
<br />
Death to otters...even if you can't sneak to sell, if you have a second account, bring a mule with you to the beach to load up all the droppable vendor crap the otters drop (and they drop quite a bit, great for a bit of cash farming) and sell it right back to the vendors...<br />
<br />
FYI, even when you get KOS, the vendors will not aggro on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bocote</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">otter people have a couple quests that are pretty outdated.   the othmir totem thing is still semi nice, but you can always have a friend do the turnins if needed.<br />
<br />
I've pasted thousands of otters in my day and the only thing I had problems with after is sea monster kills.   <br />
<br />
go for it.  crusty armor sells good to vendors also.<br />
<br />
its nice being ally to the walrusmen in EW too, but they don't have quests or anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tshesebe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for all the excellent replies everyone!  I rooted &amp; rotted for about an hour &amp; looted 5 furs.  My faction is still amiable too.  There were some important details I noticed...like dont snare the warrior next to the Cheif because the chief aggros you &amp; he can't be snared or rooted and he casts some nasty DOT that takes you down to 19 health &amp; then you have to run enough space to give you the time to cast off a CS port since you forgot to load egress, and once you get the port to cast without interruptions or fizzles, if you're not down to 10 health by this time you just might have enough time to load  an egress &amp; cast it in time to wipe aggro and escape with that 10 health &amp; 5 mana.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and our friend IS for sure selling CVTs in Thurg on the Vazaelle server.  I bought 5 stacks last night.<br />
Now if they'd only increase the bank space to 50 slots for we tradeskillers...<br />
Thanks again everyone!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you are a druid, you can harmony the chief and then pull the warriors from around him no problem. The chief, however, is immune snare/root if I remember correctly, but dispatched easily enough at full speed kite if you're 60+, etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I just can't bring myself to kill those guys.  The fezzes crack me up.  The only time I've had a bad run in with them is during a &quot;whoops&quot; while kiting wyverns.<br />
<br />
In wolf form.<br />
<br />
I suppose they can be rather frightening when you have the entire otter clan stampeding down the beach at you :(<br />
<br />
I still couldn't kill any, even in self defense!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye that is correct, also one kill of him(the dhief) will make you instant KOS.<br />
<br />
And yes Cupcake the tempers are back on Nimren for 5.9 pp each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Diani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hmm, I still keep good faction with them to get th emerald dragon chestplates and lodishields that I try to sell for mucho pp at the bazaar ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zudelvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Helloo there :&gt;<br />
<br />
You would have to verify, but I believe the CS-only bought stuff can also be bought out in AS on the ships.  So that should help out your need to buy from them if you decide to kill them.  Just gotta wait fer the boat to come pick you up then off you go.  hope this helps.  :&gt;</div></div><hr />
