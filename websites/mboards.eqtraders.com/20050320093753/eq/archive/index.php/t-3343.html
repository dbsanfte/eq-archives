I ahve been in the bazaar the past couple of days looking at items if i had know better when i was a wee younger cleric i would have never switched from the plate to the robe i am wearing now ...but that is i the passed ....hehe<br />
My problem is i have seen several items in the bazaar that have charges on the items and they are going for like 4 k an time well i ahve enough for the item and the stats are good  but when the charges are gone is there any way to get them back.<br />
thanks for all the help</div></div><hr />

<br />
basically there are 3 options:<br />
-option 1: gone is gone, there is no chance at recharging<br />
-option 2: when you sell the empty item to a vendor, and that vendor has a charged item in inventory, both items will have charges when you buy them back<br />
-option 3: quest/hand in to npc(might involve payment to npc)<br />
<br />
hope this helps<br />
<br />
<br />
ps: if you ask this sort of question again, it would help immensly if you would post the actual item name with your question</div></div><hr />

<br />
Recharge by combining in a toolbox with the appropriate mana battery (see Tinkering forum for the sticky thread on how to ...come to think of it that thread will also tell you which specific  Tinkered items are available/rechargeable :) )</div></div><hr />

<br />
For tinkered items, there is also an option 4: The item is rechargeable in a toolbox by making a no-fail combine of the exhausted item with a Mana Battery of some kind. As mentioned, the Anizok items are rechargeable thus, also the Gnomish Vanishing Device and possibly others (check tinkering.org)</div></div><hr />
