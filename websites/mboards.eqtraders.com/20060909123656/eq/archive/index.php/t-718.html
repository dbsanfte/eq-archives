I've been very frustrated with EQ lately and my tailoring had stagnated.  I got really upset when I magically rolled back from 197 tailoring to 194 and the GM couldn't find it and wouldn't restore it.  However, last night I was digging around and found enough stuff to make eight Solstice combines.  I quickly burned through the first seven with no success, but on the eigth I got a robe and &quot;You have become better at Tailoring! (201)&quot;.  Sometimes ya just gotta smile.<br />

Question have you used the robe to do the majority of skillups since 158?</div></div><hr />
