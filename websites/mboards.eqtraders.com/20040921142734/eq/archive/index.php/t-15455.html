<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aario</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While I was making some Anizok's Minimizing, Maximizing, and Gauze Presses, I came across some sub-components that could not be learned.  Thus, I had to manually combine each one using the old &quot;experiment&quot; slot machine method.  So far here is what I found is not learnable nor in the database for recipes in game:<br />
<br />
 Perpetual Steam Pump<br />
 Perpetual Air Pump<br />
 Base Prototype<br />
<br />
I have already bugged these combines / UI issues are there anymore that ya'll have found?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fyrmana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">can not be learne Meterological rocket -&gt; advanced propulsion unit combine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its been pretty obvious that sub-combines cannot be learned, only final products. <br />
<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
<br />
The same reason that snakes kick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gnormy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Being unable to &quot;learn&quot; these subcombines makes the UI window worthless for the point of PoP tinkering which happens to be about all I do since I'm already skill capped.<br />
<br />
Why arent they learnable? Its a conscious decision on the part of the SOE tradeskill team.  There is a field on the server that denotes wether or not a recipe CAN be learned.<br />
<br />
I too have submitted bugs and feedback on this issue.   Aside from the two or three devs who have visited here - there is little chance for ANY response to the playerbase on this topic.<br />
<br />
Honestly, if its a tradeskill combine/subcombine - make it learnable.  If its a quest or a one-shot combine - it doesnt need to be learnable but what difference would it make?<br />
<br />
So....just make them all learnable and avoid the headache entirely.  Its such a no-brainer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aario</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That really does not make sense though, if you think about it.  The planar bow cams that are used in another skill, and are a subcomponent, can be learned though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gnormy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Developer explains the learning system and states that its 'a work in progess'.<br />

However, he also states that hes not responsible for changes and suggest submitting requests thru Naimi (which i consider odd).</div></div><hr />
