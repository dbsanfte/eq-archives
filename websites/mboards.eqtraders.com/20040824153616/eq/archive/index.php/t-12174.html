<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moonsorrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off, hello to all the fine folks of the EQ Traders community.<br />
<br />
I've learned a lot by reading the articles and message boards here, and have started enjoying tradeskills as a way to stall my levelling progress!  Soon however, I have a feeling I'll be looking at levelling as stalling my precious tradeskilling.<br />
<br />
Now, the real topic of concern here.<br />
<br />
I was in Rivervale, killing that insufferable Nillipus for his succulent brownie parts.  I had successfully done so, and he also had on him 2 jum jum stalks.<br />
<br />
I thought this would be a fine way to start off my growing component pile for Misty Thicket Picnics, so I went to pick up 11 more from a local vendor, and stick them in a stack, so I could make a veritably gigantic pile of MTPs when it comes time to go from 200-250 skill (which I intend to do with the blasted picnics)<br />
<br />
Well, to my surprise, the Jum Jum wouldn't stack with the stuff I had nabbed from Nillipus.  They look precisely identical, and I haven't yet tried baking them into a cake or brewing them into a beer, but I did drop a petition to one of the friendly guides, who says the 2 incompatible jumjums are &quot;working as intended&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, not being intimately familiar with Rivervale, I figured that maybe someone around there had a quest where I could give them these mysterious and special Nillipus Jum Jum.  But I can't seem to find anyone who mentions anything about it.<br />
<br />
Anyone have insight on why my Jum Jum might have some invisible difference?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>lonewylfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There's also a third I believe, that looks the same as the other two. I think the only difference (that causes them not to stack with each other) is how they're gotten. I seem to remember using some of the ones of Nilli in the MTP's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are 3 different types of Jum Jum, but, they all look the same.  The first, you can buy from merchants.  The second is the ground spawn in the garden.  And the third, of which you will need 4 of, is from Nillipus, and is used in this quest:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">those silly halflings!<br />
<br />
/em hides and begins to hybridize more types of Jumjum....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naeadiene Needsamap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think it must be that peppy halfling music in Rivervale.  After awhile it will make even the most sane go round the bend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cerpicio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Gah!  That music is insidious!  I'm glad I can train my li'l halfing in PoK rather than Rivervale.  I quickly grew tired of their happy, peppy tune.<br />
<br />
Any idea how the three different jum-jums Identify?  (Or is that in the link which I didn't click?)<br />
<br />
And I thought the shells for the Shawl and Ring quests were annoying.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cedir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">According to Lucy (whose item database hasn't been updated in a while--but these are old items), there are three types of Jumjum Stalk:<br />
<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/itemlist.html?searchtext=jumjum+stalk<br />
<br />
Item #13973 identifies as &quot;Stolen Jumjum Stalk&quot;<br />
<br />
Item #13974 identifies as &quot;Nillipuss' Jumjum&quot;<br />
<br />
Item #13975 identifies as &quot;Jumjum Stalk&quot;<br />
<br />
:cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaaba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Basically what happens is the ground spawn pops and Nilipuss picks it up and it changes.  He wanders around the city and if another pops he picks it up again.  This is why there's different jum jums, if you don't kill him right away and let him walk around and pick up more you end up with more when you kill him.</div></div><hr />
