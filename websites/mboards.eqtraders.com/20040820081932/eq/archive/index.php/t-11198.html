<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Malodium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wanting to start into diety idols and noticed that I need ivory for my shammy to imbue.<br />
I know this is mob dropped in certain places, but relying on vender mining or bazaar searches for it I suspect will turn up very little.<br />
<br />
Is there anywhere it is sold?  Nothing is listed is the database here for that.<br />
If so, how much does it cost?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ivory is not standard stock for any merchant.  Any that is found on merchants has been sold there by players from mob drops.  Costs about 7 - 8 pp from merchants though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Malodium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thats what I was afraid of *cry*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">never fear.  bud has same problem.  apparently the drvs in sro drop ivory.  don't expect tons but it will be a real easy camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>baldorrex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The evil eyes in the Gorge of the Beholder seem to drop ivory with some regularity.  Of course, as soon as I say that they the drop rate will change; lol.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wyntyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Some mobs in Swamp of No Hope drop ivory. I can't check my logs from here, but I THINK it was from the man eating plant type of mobs. I will check my logs later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sadonumspa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you go thru the Bazaar and Plane of Knowledge and Plane of TRanquility Vendors, you will find a good supply of Ivory that People have dumped on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wyntyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Checked my logs and found that we got the ivory from man eating plants (all types) and an Iksar pariah. So it looks like a random drop in SONH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Malodium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the replies all.  I went through PoK last night since there was a patch the other day and checked all the venders. <br />
Actually found 7 ivorys hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>thrashette</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I usually get 2-3 ivories per clearing of the orc watchmen.  That's about 6 per hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Malodium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Since originally posting I have had quite a bit of success gathering ivory.  Seems nobody wants it for anything, so a day ro two after any patch or after the server crashes (happening a lot lately yay!! heh) I run around PoK and hit all the venders.<br />
<br />
Since I originally posted I have gotten about 5 stacks of ivory doing this.  not too shabby.</div></div><hr />
