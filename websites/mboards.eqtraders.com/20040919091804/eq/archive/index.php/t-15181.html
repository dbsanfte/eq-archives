<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Happyhardcore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Howdy peeps,<br />
<br />
Best give u a brief run down of how i got to were i am.<br />
I am currently 167 in smithing and have got there the expensive way. think i have spent a total of about 20k so far to get to this lvl and came to a quick halt as pp dries up very quickly.<br />
<br />
i started of sharpening swords then went onto mail armour upto 115. then came the not so cheap chain mail. platinum bars setting me back 115pp per bar. went from 12k to 3k in the space of 2 hours lol. then i moved onto making fine plate armour. now this i found wasnt to bad. everything accept for the padding was available in POK and only lost about 15-20pp per combine which after doing chain mail was refreshing for the bank manager lol.<br />
<br />
well ive nearly trivialed fine plate and am looking for the next step. acrylia seemed the best coarse of action but being a warrior farming the bits i need is to hard ( u try getting a cleric to stand there and heal and not get alot or any xp for a few hours while farming, aint gonna happen). what im looking for is any easy way to get to 200+ from my present position idealy making as little loss as possible. was hoping some1 might be able to help with this.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

You're going to hate that after you read the guide.<br />

Your current skill is 167,  and fine plate trivials at 188.  You still have 21 points to go.  Personally, I don't consider that nearly trivialed.  I didn't start fine plate until 163.<br />
<br />
Are you farming your own subcombines (leather padding?)  If not, then you should consider doing that, because it would cut down on your cost considerably.  Once past 188, consider EVBs.  They would cost you about 20pp per combine, if you farm your own velium (or closer to 150-200pp per combine if you get velium from the bazaar.)  They trivial at 222.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zolina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Once you trivial fine steel plate at 188, consider this.  If you do LDoN adventures a lot, ask the groups for sand verbenas, pondweed, gargoyle granite, ice lichen, and goblin bones.  These can be made into armor which trivials at 212 and is very similar to fine steel plate, except you use storebought padding instead of tailored padding.  You'll need to get brewing up to make the drops into tempers.<br />
<br />
Another method is to farm velium for enchanted velium bits.  Crystal Caverns and Tower of Frozen Shadow shouldn't be too hard to solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ZealSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't know where you were farming acrylia but you can probably get decent xp from farming that or velium with a cleric if you hunt the right dungeons. I'm guessing you are broke now from plat ornate? shadowscream has to be the cheapest way since you're not tempted to sell subcomponents in the bazaar- every time I make a piece of armor I total up what all the dropped components could have been sold for and consider it a cost to subtract from the bazaar sale profit, make the wrong item and lose pp. <br />
<br />
If you aren't broke the sickles for potc would be a way to get high skill with vendor parts. the thing that makes acrylia my favorite choice is that I can sell it in bazaar but evbs seem to be what many on this forum recommend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>aaer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Could do EVB's from as low as 158 skill using a geerlok, or 165 without. I'm currently taking this approach myself.<br />
<br />
As a sidenote, I heard that golems in ToFS could be a good source for velium, anyone who can confirm this? Working my way up the tower atm, think I'm two floors away :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're not.  Shoo.  No velium on the 5th floor of ToFS.</div></div><hr />

Riiight.. move aside ol man, all your velium are belong to us :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>baody</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There is velium on the fifth floor of ToFS, but not a lot of it. Remember, too, that if you're farming your own velium for smithing, you're not spending time farming something that could bring you on more money. When I farm there I set an egg timer for the spawn and do other things around the house. When the egg time goes off I kill golems as fast as possible, loot up, then go back to house work. I hide my character in the alchove in the hall that's to the left of the wedding party, having died once from a train while AFK.<br />
<br />
Enchanted velium bits will be my skill up of last resort, and even then, only when I get to 212. LDoN armor still has resale value, but you have to be patient enough to make a little bit at a time and only replace what you sell. That will get you to 210 without spending a lot of pp or spending a lot of time farming. All of the velium farming I've done so far has been for tailoring.<br />
<br />
PS, the economical smith is an amazing guide for those of us who don't have buckets of pp to burn on trade skills.<br />
