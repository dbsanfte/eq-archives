Hello! I'm helping to rework the Pricing Guide so that the Denmother can do other stuff. I could try to do everything, but it's rather time consuming, and I would greatly appreciate any help I could get from the EQTC community in helping me fill in some blanks.<br />
<br />
My current &quot;wanted list&quot; is posted on the Pricing Reporting forum, listed as &quot;Pricing Section Revision&quot;. I will update the list to check off found prices as well as to add items I hadn't realized were needed. This message will self-destruct upon fulfillment of the wanted list as it pertains to smithing, which is actually fairly short.<br />
<br />
More skills will be added to the wanted list, as I progress and finish up what I've started so far. Thank you for your help! <br />

Very few items are still left, and I've begun a new post under the Pricing Reporting board called, &quot;Latest Round of Pricing Reporting.&quot;<br />
<br />
I've posted the update on smithing pricing already. I will continue to seek complete information; incomplete costs are simply highlighted as incomplete.<br />
<br />
Thank you smiths,<br />
