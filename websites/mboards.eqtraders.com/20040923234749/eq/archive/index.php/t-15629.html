<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>fesc_necrado</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can you use your training points with your guildmaster to raise a skill over 200?  <br />
<br />
If no, what is the highest you can use the points for training with the guildmaster? I've looked for this information and haven't found it anywhere, even if it was staring me in the face.<br />
<br />
For background, I have brewing at 248 and plan on spending the 3 aa's to get tailoring past 200.  Once tailoring is allowed to go over 200, can I train it at the guildmaster?<br />
<br />
-Thanks for any help in advance, eqtraders has been a great resource to date.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inien of Vazaelle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No you can't and the max you can train any of the general tradeskills at a trainer is 21.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Benthair Dunthat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">However, if you are an Int caster and can therefore do Research - save those points. They can be used to raise your research skill to the 200 level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>fesc_necrado</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the info guys, that's what I needed to know.  <br />
<br />
Makes me sad I can't run tailoring up to 200 with the training points tho - just too expensive!<br />
<br />
Maybe that training points to 21 for basic and 200 for research should be added to the post &quot;Things I Wish I'd Known Earlier&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zudelvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Helloo there :&gt;<br />
<br />
It is possible to use training points on another trade skill, Fishing.  You can also use the training points for foraging as well.  I hope this helps.  :&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Inien of Vazaelle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Fishing isn't one of the main tradeskills though as you can't take it over 200; and foraging isn't a tradeskill at all (you can't craft anything with a foraging skill. ;)).</div></div><hr />
