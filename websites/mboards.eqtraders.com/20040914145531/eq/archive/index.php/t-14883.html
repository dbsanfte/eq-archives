<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mcarm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well first off thank you to everyone forthe info and support here, helped me immensly with my tradeskill push. Started all this only to get the Grimel earring and not intending to get 1750 club. Just got my earring, and the time that I would have been tradeskilling I no have empty, been going off to exp as I should, but just doesnt seem right after all this time to not be sitting doing endless combines. What, oh what shall I do? : -)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ancarett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First off, congratulations on finishing a tough and occasionally maddening tradeskill quest!<br />
<br />
Now for the advice, hahah! Start rooting through the other tradeskill quests to see what you'd like to do. There's always the Thurgadin shawl for consuming hours and hours of your time and energy on tradeskills.<br />
<br />
Or, if the shawl doesn't seem attractive (or if you already have it or better on your main), start it up with an alt! :p</div></div><hr />
