<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eqgilethan</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 01:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I was a bit disappointed by something the other day that made me think more on an idea I'd had.  My secondary, an enchanter, finally made 250 (WOO HOO!) in JC (imagine that! :P ).  I can't remember where I heard or read this, but I had believed our 'Master' status under skills would be replaced with 'Grandmaster' at 250.  Granted my mild disappointment that it wasn't, was greatly out weighed by my joy in finally reaching 250.   It did, however, once again remind me of an idea for tradeskill 'levels' I had quite some time back.  Thought I'd throw it up here to see what others feel and I'm sure many have thought of something similar.<br />
<br />
Now, we know that the level 'names' can be changed.  I remember not long ago when 51 to 70 with anything was 'Average'.  Suddenly this 'Above Average' pops up for 61 to 70.  Second, not all skills have to have the same name for the same number.  100 in all other skills is 'Excellent' however, since languages only go to 100, you are a 'Master' at that level.  So why are you a 'Master' over 150 points from 101 to 250 for tradeskills?  My thought...<br />
<br />
101-200 Journeyman- Yes I know, hundreds of people will immediately think &quot;What!?!  I was a 'Master' yesterday!&quot;.  Journeyman however is a title that shows you have earned some respect.<br />
<br />
201-249 Master- Congratulations!  Your first little 'pat on the back' for a huge accomplishment in your particular trade(s -if you've spent the AA for more than one).<br />
<br />
250 Grandmaster- 'nuff said<br />
<br />
Yes, I know there are at least hundreds of other little bugs and problems that Verant needs to work on, making a thought like this trivial.   I also realize these 'titles' would only be for us to view on our own characters and therefore wouldn't effect status in game.  Its just a thought though (and me killing some time  :P ).  Let me know what you think!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KyrosKrane</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 02:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with your post; I would only modify it slightly.  I feel that 100 skill points is far too broad a range.  Ideally, there should be about 7 named ranks between 101-250.  My ideal world would have the following:<br />
<br />
101-120: Tradesman - Apprentice<br />
121-140: Tradesman - Journeyman<br />
141-160: Tradesman - Craftsman<br />
161-180: Tradesman - Adept<br />
181-200: Tradesman - Senior<br />
201-225: Master<br />
226-249: Craft Master<br />
250: Grand Master<br />
<br />
The logic is that if your skill is 101-200, this tradeskill has become your &quot;day job&quot;, or perhaps what you moonlight in.  Either way, it has become part of your career, and it should be recognized as such.  It is your trade, hence the name.  Once you exceed 200, you have gone beyond mere tradesman, you have achieved full mastery of the craft.  And for the highest levels, you are either a Craft Master, who has completely mastered the main aspects of your trade, or a Grand Master of the craft.<br />
<br />
However, that would be a big enough change that I don't think it would be implemented.  So, I reduced it to four steps:<br />
<br />
101-150: Journeyman<br />
151-200: Adept<br />
201-249: Master<br />
250: Grand Master<br />
<br />
I feel that would be the best compromise.  What do you think?</div></div><hr />
