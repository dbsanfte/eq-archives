I have all the components and am just looking for someone w/ a high skill to do the combines for me (mastery and salvage aa's would be nice as well but not a must).  Post here or talk to me in game and maybe we can work out a reasonable price for these combines.  Thanks<br />

For expensive combines I charge a percentage of the value, it's not a small tip like getting C3 in PoK.</div></div><hr />

Failed on one of the black gold inlays unfortunately but oh well, it happens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its one of the reasons I do not like to do combines for folks I havent had the time to get to know, once a failure happens on any combine that includes a rare component like Discordant Scoriae folks while understanding that it can happen tend to get upset.<br />
<br />
It is also a reason I dont charge for any combine. <br />
<br />
I dont advertise to do combines, most all I do are for guildmates or friends of guildmates.<br />

Just a trade skill addict.</div></div><hr />
