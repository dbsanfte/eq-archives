<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
<br />
I have a 56 Enchanter with 194 skill in research that I use to make all my Druid, Shaman, Cleric and Enchanter spells. Currently I have been trying to make Breath of Karana for my druid. here is what I have in her Phantasmal Tome:<br />
Rune of Alternation<br />
Etched Signet<br />
A Piece of Parchment<br />
A Quill<br />
<br />
Every time I have hit combine it states those items cannot be combined in this container type. Did I miss something in a patch that prevents Chanters from making Priest spells or is my Phantasmal Tome Bugged? <br />
<br />
It allowed me to make another Enchanter spell but simply will not combine this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Either the recipe is wrong, or it's bugged.  Can /bug report it in case bug is the right choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bregalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just looked up the old component cross-reference list.<br />
<br />
There, it lists Words of Abrogation as one of the components needed for Breath of Karana.   The database recipe must be wrong.<br />
<br />
All lvl 56 spells are 3-component combines, in fact. (not counting parch/quill)<br />
<br />
Which is of course, bad news, since Words of Abrogation are also used to make the best DE cultural robe (one with Aura of Healing effect), as well as Necro spells like Zevfeer's Theft of Vitae, Gangrenous Touch of Zum'uul and Banishment of Shadows.</div></div><hr />
