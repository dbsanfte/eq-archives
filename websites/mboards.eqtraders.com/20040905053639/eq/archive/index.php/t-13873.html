<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oxie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It seems like all the other trade skills have new recipes, but I can't seem to locate any info for making poison. Is that a section that is still being worked on here at eqtraders, or are there just not any new recipes for this trade?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Turlo Lomon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Poison makers are a rare breed.  I know there are at least 8 confirmed poison recipes so far, but I don't have details.  All 8 are for the tradeskill quest.<br />
<br />
As soon as I finish a big project I am working on in game, I will be able to check it out in detail first hand.</div></div><hr />

Other than the Muramite blood, the components for these are all given to you by the quest givers and result in non-usable poisons.  Have been collecting blood and bile for refinement, but thus far nothing I've tried has combined.<br />
<br />
Will be working on this more as my guild progresses, perhaps there are items deeper in that will make something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Osprey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's a combination of things. First is that EQTraders is not a hotspot for poisonmaking activity - The Safehouse is really where developments tend to show up first. Second, there's nothing going on. Other than the quests on the ship, nobody's really found anything. The quests seem to lead you certain directions with muramite blood/distillate, but once you have it there's nothing you can apparently do with it. The distillate is not even flagged as a tradeskill item.<br />
<br />
I'm continuing to distill blood when I get it in hopes something will happen, but frankly I've started to give up on any notion of any new poisons in GoD</div></div><hr />
