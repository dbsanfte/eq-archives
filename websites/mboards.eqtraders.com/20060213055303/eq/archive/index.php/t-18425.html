<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angelsyn</div><div class="date">09-24-2004, 05:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) A GM (maybe JCM?) Jewelcrafter.  I picked up a Mossflow Stone (vs. Disease Aug) and I'd like it upgraded.  Not sure if I want to go with Brilliant Cut or risk Radiant Cut though.<br />
<br />
2) Slugworm Acid (or 2, or 3).  Yeah, I know this one's unlikely...  I do have a Trean Flies to trade though.<br />
<br />
3) If #1 and #2 go through, I'll need a Poison Maker or Alchemist to do the combine... then another with the White Gold Inlay from the Dust of Discord I found.  I'd really like to have an &quot;Augment of Haste&quot;. :)<br />
<br />
4) Two or three Lightning Cores.  Now I know I'm dreaming.  :D  I'm gonna try making some Magnetic Leggings &amp; Vambraces and would love to try some Charged Magnetic Vambraces.<br />
<br />
5) Still looking for a Metallic Substance (or two).  Once again, unlikely.  The MoBs are stingy, it seems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've got 1 Lightning Core...  Would love 3 more, would settle for 1 more.  :D<br />
<br />
Don't need any more Metallic Substances... but if someone wants to fetch, oh, 4 of them...   :love:</div></div><hr />

Willing to drag Auliesa (52 Ranger) around through all manner of hazards instead of Aleks, if Foraging and Tracking are prefereable to more firepower.</div></div><hr />
