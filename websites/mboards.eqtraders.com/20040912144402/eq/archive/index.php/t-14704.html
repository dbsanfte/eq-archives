<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aethn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">These are now nerfed on Test, do not buy or sell these becuase you will either get a) ripped off in the end by changed stats, or b) knowingly be ripping off your custoemr base selling a product already nerfed on Test.  <br />
<br />
Repeat buisness is based on honestly and integrity.  Each time a person sells a product for tens of thousands of pp knowing its going to be nerfed, they hurt the smithing community as a whole.  But give up our reputations just so you can make a short term profit is wrong and helps no one but your own wallet.<br />
<br />
I have personally offered refunds to every customer who bought cestus from me, because my reputation is worth alot more to me then the few pp I might make off these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It might be worth it, though, to buy it and use them until they whack it with the stick of nerfing.  You'll get the benefit til then.  I know people who were using the delightful orb until it got nerfed and did quite well (and I'm sure a nerf is coming on the CHoS too (it procs at level 1.))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taadieri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Please be specific.  If these have been nerfed on test, what are the new stats there.  Have all of the GoD hand to hand weapons been changed?<br />
<br />
Given the difficulty of acquiring Raw Shimmering Nihilite and Shimmering Ore the Pale Velium Inlaid Claws do not seem that unbalanced and the stats of the Pale Velium Inlaid Cestus would be reasonable if they were for the Velium Inlaid Cestus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Apparently on Test (I've not confirmed this myself) damage and delay have been doubled, and they have a rec. level of 50.<br />

So claws will be 12/20, and cestus will be 10/22.</div></div><hr />

Ah but level gives bonus damage to main hand.  So yes, that 5/11 weapon is just that to a level 1.  But in the hand of a 65, the ratio is actually much much higher than 0.5.  That's why super low delay weapons are very desirable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ratio does not change (unless they fixed the recommended level damage bug) regardless of level.  <br />
<br />
In the off hand, a 5 11 will always be a 5 11.<br />
<br />
In the main hand, a 5 11 will be a 5 11 always.  However, you'll do more damage than the simple ratio would suggest due to the damage bonus.  The damage bonus does not affect ratio, however, it only affects how much ratio plays a part in determining relative weapon power.  5 11 or 10 22 . . . in the hands of a level 20 toon, both are the same.  In the hands of a 65 toon, the 5 11 will outdamage because the damage bonus will be applied twice as often (statistically same hit rate, just twice the hits on the 11 del weapon than the 22 del weapon).  However, a 16 20 should outdamage a 5 11 even at 65, because the increase in per hit power is so much greater than the extra amount of damage bonus applied.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hola-<br />
<br />
A 10 or 11 dly weapon can do MASSIVE damage (dps) mainhanded, because the dmg bonus for primary 1h weapons is 13... on top of the normal weapon damage.  With the new offhand damage bonus AA some classes get, they'd actually make decent (tho not spectacular) offhanders too.<br />
<br />
At max haste + bard overhaste, weapon would be an aggro magnet, and a death sentence vs. high dmg/hit mobs that riposte or have a DS.  The spam is epic, and it would be a joy to use vs. a mob that's been MoK'ed...<br />

Seems to be the theme of the week.  They nerfed those poor GoD fish to complete uselessness.  They sell for 1 copper each -- you spend more on the freaking bait than the fish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sulkano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">They still have the 2 augment slots, aye? could still be a decent weapon if properly modified. Never be a real money maker, but still decent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>falkahnhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Personally I think they should have increased the dmg/dly by 50% not 100%.  I would have been much happier to see a 9/15 and 8/17 h2h weapons.  The low delay is what made these weapons popular and that's kinda been killed by this last patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can add a proc to it, but unless they changed the type 7 slot to a type 5 or 6 slot, you won't ever be able to increase the damage it does. <br />
<br />
As for 10/32? Considering I can buy a 11 21 (+1 disease damage) 1hb thats mnk/bst useable for under 2k in the bazaar every night (without recommended level, I might add), there is absolutely no reason to use this weapon unless it was like 500pp and that was all I had.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>thrashette</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Sold one today for 2k pp. So somebody still wants em.<br />

I could sell foraged roots for 2k if I tried.  The bazaar is full of idiots with infinite platinum.<br />

I know. I am one.</div></div><hr />

Again... why would someone spend ldon points augmenting a bad item? Dumping 2k points into something bad (and these weapons are very bad) is pretty stupid. By the time you acquire 2k ldon points for a decent type 7/type 4 aug, you will have a real weapon. At over 500pp per attempt, Pale velium is a waste of database space, there is no way around it. Ask any intelligent melee, and they will scoff at the idea of blowing valuable points on it. Its the equivalent of putting badass rims on a rusted out pinto up on blocks in the front yard.  Hell, Id rather have another fire beetle eye with a ft 2 aug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Emptybuckets</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Let's face it, they want to save all the best player-made weapons and armor for EQ2.  This game will never come out on top in the tradeskill dept. no matter how easy they make it to perform tradeskills.  <br />
<br />
Also, a few posts back someone mentioned that they didn't see the problem with changing this weapon from 6/10 to 12/20.  The un-nerfed version has twice the chances for procs if you were to augment it with one.  That weapon would have been well worth 20k if it weren't being nerfed.  Now I can't see it being worth much more than 500pp, I agree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Emptybuckets</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">What about the other GoD smithed weapons, they're not nerfing those are they?  The 1hbs are plenty good.  They're 16/20 with good stats, right?  The 2hbs aren't bad either, 34/28 I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Suutar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Actually, evidence indicates that the proc rate is tweaked to result in a certain number of procs per minute on average, so upping the delay shouldn't do much to the proc rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is a known fact that certain weapons were designed to have a higher proc rate.  Specifically, the Cleric Summoned Hammers (the ones with procs) and some other Cleric proc-Hammers (in PoTime/Elementals).<br />
<br />
Further, SoE posted specifically that the proc rate was (and could be) adjusted on these and other weapons.<br />
<br />
I wish I remembered where the post was, but someone had found some of the &quot;underlying numbers&quot; on weapons and discovered that a very few (this was pre-GoD) had a positive number (instead of a zero) in one catagory.  These weapons were the Cleric proc-hammers, including the dropped ones and one or two others that I can't recall right now.<br />
<br />
So SoE could quite easily make a weapon that &quot;procs more&quot; than a similar weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>casala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Just to add a little bit of clarification.<br />
<br />
Every weapon with an innate proc has a procratemod field associated with it.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
Copper Hammer of Striking<br />
procratemod = 0<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemraw.html?id=62186<br />
<br />
Hammer of ****ation (lvl 63 summoned cleric hammer)<br />
procratemod = 530<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemraw.html?id=29365<br />
<br />
As you can see, the hammer of ****ation procs a lot more than the copper hammer of striking.  Ignoring stats and AA bonuses, you would expect (as based on the values) that the CHoS would proc on average once every 30 seconds.  Similarly, you would expect the Hammer of ****ation to proc on average 5.3 times every 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
The procrate can be modified by a number of factors (dex, AAs, etc) but in general each weapon has the procrate hardcoded.</div></div><hr />
