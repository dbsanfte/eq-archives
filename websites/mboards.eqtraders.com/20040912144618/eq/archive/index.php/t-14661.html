I just recently started to go back to tradeskilling and one of the frist ones i wanted to get to 200 was Brewing. So last night i got my skill up to 122 and then switched to Minotaur hero brew. Well, to make a long story short i reached 189 and then went to do about 300 combines and nothing advanced. Is this just a hard skill up to do or should i switch to another brew?<br />

<br />
The high 180's thru 220 or so is a hell level for all tradeskills.<br />
<br />
Keep at it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">cool, then. I will trudge through tonight and see what a happens. <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baldaek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">MHB's are the only way to go from about 170 to 248.  The ingredients are redily available and with the new UI, it's a cake combine.  It can take quite a few clicks to get through the last few skill-ups from 180 to 210 or so.  After that you should find smooth sailing in brewing as high as you want to take</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It took me about 40 tries, average, per skillup from 200 to 248 using MHB's. For 248-250, Kaladim Constitutionals were a piece of cake. Apparently hardly anyone picks the ground spawns in Kaladim anymore, so you shouldn't have a problem with them; at least that's true on Veeshan. Everytime I went there, the crop was full and no one waiting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm surprised more people are not farming the shrooms nowadays. Actually I think on VS I'm encountering people more often. But then again it could be because I check more often, My Kaladim's sell out too quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">To many people making KC's on Xegony now. Last few times I've been down in Kaladim for ground spawns, someone else is either already there, or tries to get in on the spawns when I'm already collecting them. :(<br />
<br />
Guess I need to post in primal scream...</div></div><hr />

You didn't post your Int/Wis which I suspect is plenty high but ... I have noticed that if it is too low for the next skillup, then almost no amount of attempts will result in a skill up.  I noticed this with foraging at around 148 trying to get to max at 155.  My Wis was about 90 and I foraged every attempt I could for many hours with no skillups (amazed I even got to 148).   When I boosted the Wis to about 140, I got to foraging 155 very quickly. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wisdom was 260 at the time i did. So ya it was plenty high. Did the next 100 combined and got 5 skill ups. so i was happy<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>hyelaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wisdom was 260 at the time i did. <br />
<br />
How do you get your wis to max at 260 instead of 255?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hyelaw,<br />
<br />
61+ and lots of AA's...<br />
<br />
Maxes out at what, 305, and then with Planar AA's 355 now?<br />
<br />
Something like that...<br />
<br />
If you're under level 61, the max cap is 255.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ya every level after 61, you get your wisdom cap raised pts without the use of aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>hyelaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">figures I'm only at 55...<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />
