I saw this thread a few days ago, and got shivers at it, but after reading Phabos' reply, I was ROFL and still laughing. <br />
<br />
Thanks for making my day Phabos, it's nice to start the day off laughing  :D</div></div><hr />

When we stretched one out, it measured 21&quot; from tippy-toe to tippy-claw. Was also thicker in the body. <br />
<br />
The wierd bit was the native peoples in Central America catch 'em, toss the whole thing in the fire til the hairs burn off (They're urticating hairs, ie: they fall off easily and cause irritation, kinda like fiberglass) -- and then they pry 'em open and eat 'em.<br />
<br />
And no, I didn't partake, thank you very much! Meal worms sauteed in garlic and chocolate covered critters are my limit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morani</div><div class="date">04-10-2003, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">MY S.O. is Phillippino and has the typical Phillippino attitude towards spiders: they LOVE them. I thought it was pretty weird that the majority of a culture would have such a friendly attitude towards a creature that is pretty universally looked at with fear and suspicion. Then I learned more about their beliefs and it started to make sense. They view spiders and friends and good luck charms/omens. A home that has a healthy population of spiders in it is considered blessed. (And there's some sort of connection between ancestors and spiders too but since the family is Catholic I've not been able to learn much of the &quot;old beliefs&quot;). <br />
<br />
Now, I know, some of you are shuddering at the thought of a house full of spiders but if you think about WHERE they are it makes sense: Spiders eat mosquitoes &amp; mosquitoes carry malaria and other nasty things. A home with lots of spiders has no mosquitoes so the people in it are &quot;somehow&quot; spared from the nasty sicknesses; thus the home is blessed.</div></div><hr />
