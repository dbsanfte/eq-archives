I'm not claiming that they should be, I'm merely reporting that they are not there yet.<br />
<br />
The kits are smithed, if its not on your list you can still try and make it. if you aresucsessfull it then appears on the list. Did this with lemming bags last night.<br />
<br />
I'm not talking about the kits. I'm talking about the arrows/bows you can make in the kits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Greymantle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Opps sorry mis-interpreted what you ment. Never thought about the container specific type of recipes. IE culturals, bet ya they didn't load more than the standerd one's to start.</div></div><hr />

Tried 20 combines of mithril arrows, they were not added to fletching.<br />

Hopefully this is something on the list of things to fix.</div></div><hr />

When you state 'Ashwood bow stave' I have to ask you to be more precise... Exactly Which Ashwood Bow are you refering to? There are 9 different Ashwood Bows.<br />
<br />
When you say Shadwood/Sedgewood XXX Bows are ALL Trivial at XXX... you saw the trivial for all 3 versions showing the identical Trivials?<br />
<br />
When you say linen string... what recipe is that? We don't have it that I can see.</div></div><hr />

Hey Krazick,<br />
I should have been more specific. I made some assumptions about the reader's knowledge of how fletching worked. Except for Sedgewood &amp; Shadewood bows, bow trivials are determined by the most &quot;complex&quot; item in the bow, be it the bow stave, string, tool, or cam.<br />
<br />
Ashwood Bow Staves have a trivial of 128. So all Rough and Carved Ashwood Bows (not Shaped since planes have a trivial of 148) have a trivial of 128, regardless of string type.<br />
<br />
For Shadewood / Sedgewood Bows, I saw all three versions (all three strings) had the same trivial. Only the number of cams changed the trivial of the bow. Weird little development there.<br />
<br />
The linen string has no recipe. If the linen string is the most complex item in the bow, the bow would have a trivial of 31. So the Rough Hickory Recurve Bow with Hemp String has a trivial of 16 (Hemp String trivial), the Rough Recurve Hickory Bow with Linen String has a trivial of 31 (not 32), and the Rough Recurve Hickory Bow with Silk String has a trivial of 46 (Silk String trivial).<br />
<br />
Hope that clears things up a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vallorean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">One thing that makes me wonder about the new Tradeskill UI...since they are exposing the trivial points for items that are above/beyond the current max skill level, will they (might they) bump up our current max?  Pure speculation on my part, but if anyone has any VI/SOE developer forum/chat type of knowledge on this, it would be good to know where the future lies.<br />
<br />
And, on another note...<br />
<br />
Since many people talk about the skill cap and &quot;all I really need to do is get my XX tradeskill to 240 + geerlok gives me the skill max/cap.&quot;  ie - 5% of 240 = 12 ... 240 + 12 = 252.  And the statement also implies that a true max skill of 252 + geerlok will still put you at 252 (ie - &quot;cap&quot;) instead of ~265.  (Also stated in the EQT main F.A.Q.)<br />
<br />
So, my other thought might be that VI/SOE keeps the hard level skill cap, but maybe...just maybe...they might have (or are going to) look into the modifiers &quot;cap&quot;.  So, if you have a modifier, you get the true advantage of the modifier.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Allyra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Did some cultural smithing/fletching yesterday.  After a successful combine, the recipe didn't show up until I searched for it specifically.  I now have all four of the recipes needed for Blessed Champion Arrows saved in my &quot;favorites&quot;.<br />
<br />
IIRC, the triv for BCAs is 355.</div></div><hr />
