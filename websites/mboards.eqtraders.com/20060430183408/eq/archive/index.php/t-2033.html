<br />
For Agnostic Hie Elves there is Full Mithril Plate vs Blessed full Mithril for Tunare worshipers.<br />
<br />
For Agnostic Ogres and Trolls we seem to be left out so far.  Is this something sony overlooked or just a recipe we havent discovered yet?  <br />

The Rallos/Cazic/Innoruk Ogre/Troll armor is AWESOME just like the Brelium and Mithril.<br />

Are there any Ogre smiths trying to combine unimbued materials yet ???<br />

There is another option, theoretically easier (hah) than Nightmare/Hurricane Plate...<br />
<br />
Tae Ew Plate has some very nice pieces so far, and is good for Iksar Warriors/SKs, Vah Shir Bards/Warriors &amp;amp; Agnostic Ogre/Troll Warriors.<br />
<br />
Of course, the Tae Ew Blood (for Tae Ew) is much more rare than the stuff you need for Nightmare/Hurricane Plate... :(</div></div><hr />

Please, no matter HOW much this topic may irk you, swearing on my boards will NOT get this topic the attention it deserves, and WILL get you unwanted attention from the site owners if it continues. <br />
<br />
Ok, giving the PON/Pos armors as an example is ******, pure and simple. Why not list the elemental armors as well? Or skyshrine? HEY! I know, cazic thule armor. How flipping stupid of me to forget that! <br />
<br />
They need to add in cultural items, patch the holes and fix some stats. Like wis on the armor needs to shift to int. Oh wait, nerfing clerics and bards role in raids in the last patch was too important. On top of that, the pon plate armor sucks. Low ac AND hp?!, a winning combination! Gnome paladins everywhere rejoince, as you now have something that sucks almost as much as you for the effort involved!<br />
<br />
All I as for is a simple cut and paste of human armor. And no, humans should not make ogre/troll agnostics. They hog the market enough as is. Adding in beastlord armors wouldnt hurt either.</div></div><hr />

Look, Sony Online Entertainment is well aware in the gaps in cultural armors, but just in case you think you're alone in being left out:<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Agnostic Trolls<br />
&lt;li&gt;Agnostic Ogres<br />
&lt;li&gt;Solusek Ro High Elven Casters<br />
&lt;li&gt;Solusek Ro Dark Elven Casters<br />
&lt;li&gt;Bristlebane Wood Elves<br />
&lt;li&gt;Bristlebane Humans<br />
&lt;li&gt;Bristlebane Dark Elves<br />
&lt;li&gt;All Vah Shir<br />
&lt;li&gt;Iksar Casters<br />
&lt;li&gt;Warriors that dont follow Rallos Zek<br />
&lt;li&gt;Any class that doesnt worship their race's patron diety<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
<br />
All of the above have no cultural armors that they can use.  So, you can either find a viable alternative (and there are a lot of craftable, viable alternatives to cultural armors for those that dont have one) to the cultural armors, or you can post on the Sony development boards, and hope they change it, or you can keep making topics like this here, beating this already pulverized, long deceased horse.<br />
<br />

<br />
First off, Plane of Nightmare and Plane of Storms armors, all types, are very, very good, albiet time consuming or difficult to craft; they are a very viable example.  Cazic Thule armor, while even more time consuming, was recently upgraded; it is now better than the cultural.  As for Skyshrine, well, this is a board for tradeskilled items.<br />
<br />
They need to add in cultural items, patch the holes and fix some stats.<br />
<br />
Then, post on the Sony boards and say this.<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm sorry, but what armor are you looking at?<br />

As you can see, the Night Terror plate is comporable to the Fierce Heraldic plate in AC, and has better overall stats in most cases.  It doesnt match the HP that the Fierce Heraldic gives, however it also doesnt have the race/diety restrictions of the Fierce Heraldic and, if you gather the materials and smith it yourself, is much cheaper to manufacture.  Also, all of the items for Night Terror armors come from the same zone, except for the Imbue Diamond scroll needed to make the imbue spell and the blank emblem for the Emblem of Nightmares.<br />
<br />
All I as for is a simple cut and paste of human armor. And no, humans should not make ogre/troll agnostics.   They hog the market enough as is.<br />
<br />
Now, here is where I have to greatly disagree, on both sentances.  I strongly dislike the fact that all of the blue diamond cultural armors were cut-and-paste copies of each other.  I preferred the differences between the old cultural armors; they gave each culture personality, and a unique set of armors to craft.  Also, humans dont &quot;hog&quot; the market; not every Warrior follows Rallos Zek, not every Cleric follows Mithaniel Marr, Karana, Rodcet Nife, etc.  Royal Temper is a pain to gather ingredients for, worse than any other temper aside from Moonlight Temper and Tae Ew Temper.  Most importantly, however, is the fact that a person, regardless of race, class, or tradeskill, sells their wares as fast as they want to, by putting forth the effort to sell their armors.  Everyone is capable of that, if they wish to try.<br />
<br />
If you want something done about the armor situation, do a /feedback ingame, or post on the Sony Online Entertainment boards.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flabbo McFattyfatfat</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, no dark elf sol ro caster armor? How about unimbued? Same with high elf caster. Same with bristlebane humans. Theres actually something for just about everyone. Sure vah shir are left in the cold, as are certain casters. Thats really about it. Oh wait, and agnostic ogres/trolls. HOW could I forget? Anyways, thats what this thread is about. What race smith are you? How would you like it if, oh say they removed your agnostic armor? <br />
<br />
Ogres and trolls have a pitifully small market to work with. Fewer and fewer people play them, because most quickly come to the intelligent conclusion that decently equipped melee reach stat cap quickly, so why pay an exp penalty for not being able to take full advantage of your primal proc? Not that stats other than sta matter.<br />
<br />
And I dont know what kind of tanks you group with, but next time you see them, please beat the stupid out of them if they would take nightmare plate over fierce heraldic. HP &gt; all. Dex and agi are meaningless, str is nearly so. Stamina is the only stat that really matters for any mellee, especially at higher end. As a shaman I raise my group mates phys stats by 100 or more, and I barely notice a difference. Experienced tanks prefer raw hit points, and nightmare plate makes poor cleric armor. Hell most intelligent shaman prefer hit points to mana (after hit point/mana regen).  Ever wonder why people bust their butts for spirit wracked cords?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niami DenMother</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Folks, this topic IS a dead horse.  These issues and more HAVE been presented to VI on several occasions, a small novella of several pages was submitted on the MANY gaps in the blue diamond cultural, and getting to the ranting/raving/swearing stage here isn't going to get it fixed.<br />
<br />
I KNOW folks are upset about this.  I hear it MANY times a month, and many times a month we seem to end up locking these threads because folks want to turn them into primal screams, VI-bashing, etc.<br />
<br />
We've already proven that the ranting, raving, screaming and VI bashing on these boards a) drive the VI folks *away* from these boards, b) drive up our hosting costs on issues I've already personally submitted in to VI more than once, and c) drive me to the point where I start not only locking posts, but breaking out the banning stick if folks insist on inciting near-riots on the boards after I have to wade in, again, and tell folks to settle down, again.<br />
<br />
Please, folks. The people on THESE boards know full well that there are many holes for MANY races/classes/religions in this armor. I'd LOVE to be able to keep open a thread full of civil debate and constructive suggestions on how things could be fixed, but frankly, we've got a very hotheaded group of smiths here, and it's already been proven several times that the chances of a thread on this topic staying civil past the first couple of responses is about the same as the chance of all of this being fixed any time in the near future ... I can't hold my breath that long.  :P</div></div><hr />
