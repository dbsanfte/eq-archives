<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was gonna do the quest for a Brell Fishing Rod......I was curious if these break also?<br />
If they do break..,.....what is the average amount of time one would last?<br />
If it breaks....can it still Summon Ale?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it can break however if it does just summon a new one.  :D  thats the wonderful thing about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have never had one, but I am pretty sure that ALL fishing poles can break.  And, when they do break, they poof, so, no it wouldn't be able summon any ale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nepper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Here's how it works.<br />
First, I'm assuming you're talking about the quested Brells Fishing (fisherman's?) Companion.<br />
It does nothing but summon the fishing pole. (icon looks like a little chest)<br />
The pole then summons ale.<br />
So, you right click the companion and get a pole.  Fish and drink to your hearts content.<br />
Get stupidly drunk, and break the pole scratching your back.<br />
Right click on Fishing companion again, and VOILI!  A new back scratcher/fishing pole!<br />
<br />
Oh, and BTW, I LOVE MINE!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>branagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah its definitely worth getting.  No more trips back to buy more friggin fishing poles.  And plus once you are done fishing you can simply destroy the fishing pole to save inventory space.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Awsome...thanks folks....I am brand new to fishing and I have never touched trade skills in my 4 years of playing EQ.<br />
I bought the Bones from both fish that are needed and tonight I will hand them in to the npc in POK for my Fisherman Companion :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thank you Eniamn, I love Fishing in RL and I can't believe I ignored it so long on EQ. I am gonna be doing the Raptors in TD for at least 2 levels on those lonely deserted islands. <br />
Fishing during my Med time will be great. Plus the free Ale will also help :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">just remember ale has been known to greatly increase claims of mana among those who are under the influence.  :)  i took fishing almost last.  after the others it was so simple i love it now hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Congrats on getting the FC, Tejaye. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Congratulations on your Fisherman's Companion!  Here's what I do for a long trip out.  Get yourself a tackle box or collapsed tackle box, a skinning knife (which you can get your favorite smith to build or just buy it in the Bazaar) and stacks of Gunthak Mackerel.  The reason is that Gunthak Mackerel can be put in the tackle box with the skinning knife and you get back five fishing bait, so one stack of mackerel is the same as five stacks of bait.  Takes up much less space, so you can load up and not have to come back to a fishing merchant for a long, long time.<br />

Happy casting!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kelador Stormwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Every type of fishing rod can break ...and I've broken every type including a Gnome-tinkered one 5 minutes after buying it :mad: - after that I went and quested the Fisherman's Companion and now it doesn't matter how many I break there's always another one in the box :)  Free beer too... helps when you spill it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Nice tip Silverfish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What Fishing Skill must I have to make the baits using Gunthak  Mackeral?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Tejaye:<br />
<br />
You only need a skill of about 15 to cut Gunthak Mackerel into bait, so it's very seldom that it fails.<br />

Please PLEASE tell me that one of the poles you broke wasn't a blessed fishing pole.  That would hurt too much to discuss.<br />

Am I the only Halfling who thinks one should be able to pull Gunthak mackerel out of the Gulf of Gunthak?</div></div><hr />

Yup - broke 1 of those too :steamed: although if you knew my luck you wouldn't be surprised - I broke 3 poles in 20 casts last Sunday. :boggled:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tunnonu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thankee for the Gunthak Mackeral tip.<br />
<br />
That will help when going fishing in the Plane of Nightmare<br />

Actually, you fish for it Ocean of Tears. If you're not evil, go to Sister Isle and see if you can find any on the vendors there.</div></div><hr />
