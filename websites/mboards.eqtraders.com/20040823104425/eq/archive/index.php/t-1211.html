<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kyrial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Made it yesterday and found out it has a 2 second casting time. My notes had said insta-cast.. that's a lie :)<br />
<br />
Ps: good news.  Adroitness and Aura of heat stack... that's a total of 50 stamina. And I couldn't find anything it didn't stack with... harness, riotous health, nimble, and resist cold all stacked on top.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eepjr24</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since you mentioned 50 STA, I assume you are talking about Greater Adriotness and Greater Aura of Heat? Basically, you will need to be 55+ to have a decent shot at making them, but still, 50 STA is a nice little boost. Did you try stacking Greater Cohesion or Greater Stability on with it? Anyone have any charts for how these things stacked before?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kyrial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I found one reference by one person basically saying they'd stacked pre-change too.  But who wants the negatives? =P<br />
<br />
As to me... I tested the small versions of the potions first, then just to make sure, I made the greater versions... hence the 50 stamina comment. But someone could make the middle ones and conceivably sell them too... I wouldn't make the little ones for selling since I&quot;m pretty sure the duration on those is only 15 minutes :(<br />
<br />
The potions with strength in them dont seem to stack with other strength buffs, that's pretty much all I know otherwise.<br />
