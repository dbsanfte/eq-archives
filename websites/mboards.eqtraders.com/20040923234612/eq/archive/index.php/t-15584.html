Did they change the fishing results?<br />

(Please say no, I need jellyfish!) :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I recently was in Gunthak waiting for my group to show up so I took out my fishing pole and fished near the lighthouse.<br />
<br />
I got all of the eels, urchins and jellyfishes but the thing that amazed me more was the high rate of junk that was fished there.  My fishing skill is around 150 and in most other zones I get more &quot;fish&quot; then junk - but here I was getting a lot of junk.<br />
<br />
Anyone else notice this lately?   Maybe I was spoiled with the success rates in Abysmal Sea.  This place still has one of the best sell back prices for fish that I can tell.<br />
<br />
I got just as many jellyfish as eels and urchins so I didn't see a problem there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What recipe is the Jellyfish used for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Was finishing from the lighthouse just yesterday and I was getting plenty of jellyfish and eels......... of course I actually wanted Gunthak Gourami but isn't that the way?<br />
<br />
Confirm that there was a huge amount of junk compared to other areas - my skill is 190 and I use a brell's fishing rod to take it up a few notches and I normally expect to get a lot less junk than I was getting. Maybe this is a feature of this zone - it is full of shipwrecks? Although I still can't understand the huge amount of rusty daggers I keep finding, I mean where are all the heavy duty black ribbed knobblers?<br />
<br />
Tejaye, Rogues use the jellyfish to produce Nematocyst Poison which adds a poison proc effect to their weapons with dmg of their level +10 pts (so the max proc effect is 65+10=75). It's one of the cheaper and easier recipes to skillup poison making.</div></div><hr />
