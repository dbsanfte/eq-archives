		<div>Hi, two quick questions.  I am planning to make a blessed fishing pole or two and I want to forage the branches myself.  Would it be possible for a Vah Shir bard to enter the plane of Growth unmolested? and is it possible for a bard to actually forage said branches?  I have a fishing skill of 188 so I could work on that while foraging, so time really doesn't matter.</div>

		<div>dont know about the kos possabiliteies in growth, but the foraging of the branches. it took me 3 hours to forage 3 branches. and went from fisdhing of 20 to skill 123 in that amount of time. i think they made the branches less foragable.</div>

That's a really good point. Unless you have a thurg gate potion or some other way to teleport out of the PoG, don't go in there... there's no exit.</div>

Eeep. No. Not necessarily. I'm max KoS in PoG and the fauns love me. They're not on the same faction. Granted, I've hunted in PoG, hence the KoS thing, but I've seen other race/deity combinations that the fauns don't mind.. but that are KoS in PoG. Just a warning.<br />

		<div>Just a note, I went a while ago and for a Vah Shir bard, everything was indifferent to me.  In 3 hours, I too foraged about 3 branches (made 3 poles as well.)  Got to 190 in fishing and got about 20 points into intimidation.  Next trip, 3 hours, no branches, fishing 200 and intimidation 50.</div>

Anyway, My Brother's guild kills Tunare regularly, so in the process of clearing the plane, he'll forage up 10 or 15 branches, so that's how I get mine. :p</div>

		<div>I made my first visit to PoG yesterday with another druid friend. I spent about 4 hours there just fishing and foraging (max'd out). During that time I picked up 12 branches and went from 138 in fishing to 170. My friend (also 200 in foraging) managed 7 branches.<br />

The rate of foraging didn't seem much different to that of any other zone I've foraged in for special items (misty acorns, rose of firiona, tea leaves).</div>
