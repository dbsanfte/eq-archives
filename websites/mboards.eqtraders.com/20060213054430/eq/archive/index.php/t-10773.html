<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ceggon</div><div class="date">09-21-2003, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I finally have most of the flags for Aid Grimmel and am working on polishing off pottery and smithing.  <br />
<br />
Until last night I had NO idea how bad the adjustment to pottery skillups had been. /sigh<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if someone with more time than plat might be interested in working up several hundred (300-500) ceramic linings for me that I could buy. <br />
<br />
I'm willing to work out a fair price for your time, I also have a BUNCH of high end baking bits that could be part of any compensation package if you are interested. <br />
<br />
If you are interested, leave a post here or look for me in game<br />
<br />
Hope to find something that works out well for all involved =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have to drag Angelsyn out of Gunthak anyway. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ceggon</div><div class="date">09-21-2003, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I polished off 100 combines I had mostly set to go earlier today, got a whole 3 skillups. I suppose I should be happy though =)<br />
<br />
I have 5 points to max out casserole dishes, I figure 200ish linings should (hopefully) do it.<br />
<br />
If you do have the time Angel, that would be great. I think you were still looking for baking bits too so its could work out really well. <br />
<br />
Lemme know</div></div><hr />

I'll look for you in game to make sure Angelsyn hasn't covered your needs before I get started. Skill ups have kind of been running cold for me, maybe a few hundred trivial combines will break the monotony.</div></div><hr />

I just haven't had the free time lately. :mad:</div></div><hr />
