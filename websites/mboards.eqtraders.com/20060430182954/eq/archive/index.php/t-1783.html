<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xorshaik</div><div class="date">01-02-2003, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wanted to state this briefly to get feedback on a theory from everyone possible, rather than lose the people who don't read 2600 words to get to the point...<br />
<br />
Have you ever seen a Owlbear/Sonic Wolf/Grimling be attacked or launch an attack after losing their home camp (&quot;North&quot;, &quot;East&quot; or &quot;South&quot; respectively?)<br />
<br />
I believe the answer is no, and would like to hear if anyone else's experience is consistent or contradictory to this observation. I think if this is correct, it should provide a precise answer to what is bugged about the HS war.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaman Arriana</div><div class="date">01-02-2003, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the assumption that there remains a group of that species to make the attack, yes I've seen them make and receive attacks from camps that are not their &quot;home&quot;.<br />
<br />
IE: After several hours, I managed to get wolves in control of the south, wiping out the grimlings. A while later, a message popped up that the owlbears in the north were attacking the wolves in the south.<br />
<br />
If you remove a species entirely, then it would not be able to come back into the zone until it is reset (yeah, right), crashed, or the server is patched.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xorshaik</div><div class="date">01-02-2003, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes.. I've seen that, but it doesn't necessarily answer the question...<br />
<br />
What I have seen: <br />
<br />
Owlbears in the North and South, Wolves in the East.<br />
<br />
Owlbears home is the North<br />
Wolves home is in the East.<br />
<br />
Owlbears may attack from the south (according to the messages)<br />
<br />
I don't really care about that. I might at most wonder if there is a real difference what camp the attackers are coming from, if there is a real difference in number or location of origin of the attacking mobs (I doubt it)<br />
<br />
Consider the above scenario, if Wolves took over the North camp. Would you see Owlbears attack from the South? Would wolves attack the Owlbears in the south from either camp?<br />
<br />
There are logically 6 possible situations where this could happen: Owlbears in the East or South only, Wolves in the North or South only, Grimlings in the North or East only.<br />
<br />
I guess you could think of it as a refugee scenario.. and one would think the war shouldn't be over, but from what I have seen it has the same effect as one beast taking over the whole zone: No more war.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saleani</div><div class="date">01-02-2003, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While playing a character with a green name, and responding to a petition on this issue, I observed owlbears pop outside the wolf cave (grimlings held the rest of the zone, and the wolf cave was empty). One of the players involved in the petitions proceeded to slaughter the (rooted) owlbear defenders. I cannot tell you if the owlbears could have spawned sufficient force to retake the zone (with or without assistance), I can tell you that the person, through ignorance, prevented it from trying to fix itself. I do know that some zone wide emotes stopped when the last owlbear defender was killed.  :roll:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kradlum</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 05:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't say I have seen this happen, but I wonder the same thing sometimes.<br />
<br />
I'm not tough enough to deal with the grimling defenders on my own due to their casters, but have little problem with the owlbears or wolves. After the last patch I got on with a friend and we removed the Grimlings from the zone altogether, so I could then control the war as I wanted. I went away for the weekend and came back to find that the Grimlings controlled the whole zone? :(<br />
<br />
I asked my guild if the servers had been reset again, and they said they didn't think so. I don't know how the Grimlings could take over when they didn't have a single camp left, so I can only assume that a GM re-set the zone, removing all of my hard work.<br />
<br />
Since then my PC has blown up 2 power supplies, so I can't even get on to continue playing around with the war. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xorshaik</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The player involved in the petition was likely just finishing off the zone to strengthen the case for a zone reset.. It sounds like owlbears owned the east camp, and when that happens the Owlbears will spawn only once inside the cave... I doubt the situation would have fixed itself, especially if the petitioners had an interest in seeing wolves up in the zone.<br />
<br />
I was a bit annoyed last night. The zone had been reset and wolves were beaten out of existance before I even logged in. Owlbears have owned the south camp prior to last night for at least a week (the time I had off work.. grrr) and now I'm left holding 15 stacks of wailing substance.<br />
<br />
I gave up and went to do sickle sub-combines. By the time I logged, grimlings had the whole zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tillomiki</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you need shrieking substance head for Tenebrous. The sonic wolves there range from 33-36 and drop the shrieking fairly often. In my experience the drop rate is about 1 in 3 or 4.<br />
<br />
BTW as a side note, don't try to skillup to 168 on humming orbs. It's just a bad idea because you run out of bank space and I can guarantee you're not going to want to go back and farm later to replace orbs that you destroyed because you ran out of room. (and carrying them around is kinda heavy) I've actually tried about 6 or 7 SS combines at 165ish... one success and no skillups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kradlum</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the same problem. I have never seen the wolves in control of the camp on AB, and the only times I have seen them attacking is when I have been alone in the zone and unable to help them against the Grimlings. The wolves in TM are nice, at 44 I still get XP and a reasonable drop rate on the substance, but since TM is so out of the way none of my guild ever want to go there. This means, as a solo warrior, I have to rely on the generosity of strangers for buffs and put up with horrendous downtime, even with my Ceremonial Iksar Breastplate. As for those occasions when I get killed, then I normally just have to suck it up. The last time this happened, I got killed twice: couldn't find a rezzer on my CR back from PoK the first time, but did the second time, just too late to rez my first corpse.<br />
<br />
Just give me one night alone with the wolves in control of the southern camp and I will be a happy smith (well, as happy as anyone who has to farm Swirling Shadows for the rest of their life can be)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saleani</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I was inside the (empty) wolf cave looking around when the owlbears outside spawned. They were not there when I entered the cave. The player was trying to follow me, but the version of sow I use at that time is real fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xorshaik</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's what I do with my 59 monk when I'm farming in HS: Pull an entire island and kill one at a time, usually 5-6 seconds per kill unless I have to chase. I wouldn't expect this to work too well in TM, so I prefer wolves in HS.. At the same time, I am expecting to have to go to TM. <br />
<br />
I also don't feel too bad making orbs below 168 on my monk (Once made, I trade them to my human smith for making shadowscream) My failure rate is satisfactorily low, and I get skill raises pretty quick anyway. I don't have much interest in pursuing smithing on my iksar monk.<br />
<br />
I also don't mind carrying stacks of substance... Ordinarily I would only have 3 bags, but since these are green I abandon my weight concerns which opens me up to an additional 160+ pounds weight, which easily handles 5 bags of stacks of stuff that weighs 0.1 per stack.<br />
<br />
Sounds like if you went into an empty eastern cave, then there wouldn't have been any chance at getting owlbears to go on the offensive.<br />
<br />
I'm inclined to believe that there is randomness in trigerring attacks, but I still have to wonder.. A zone where I am all alone and just laying around seems to have no attacks.. My provocations seem to change that. Call me still on the fence until further studies are conducted I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryfalia</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah Xorshaik, I was getting pretty sick of the owlbears too.  I am going to try something that might make the farming easier tho.  Will tell you if it works.<br />
<br />
I heard that someone managed to get wolves there, but I was on a raid so I couldn't go.  Sigh.<br />

<br />
Its getting really frustrating too. I petitioned to have the zone reset because the wolves have taken over the whole zone, but the guide told me that there is a way to reset it myself...  <br />
<br />
I havn't seen 1 owlbear in hollowshade moor ever since the wolves have taken over the zone. How can I do anything if there isnt a  single owlbear in the zone.<br />
<br />
There are some grimling's in huts with the name of &quot;a sonic tracker&quot;... but who cares about grimlings  :P <br />
<br />
So, I'm stuck with the 4 owlbears in Pauludal Caverns... /sigh</div></div><hr />
