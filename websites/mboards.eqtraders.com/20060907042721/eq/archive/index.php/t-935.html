They need to be combined in the cultural forge in Freeport (on the platform behind the warrior guild).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elmarr Armoursmythe</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Antonian Javelins cannot be made in the Freeport Forge - they can only be made by human smiths in the Qeynos Royal Forge in South Qeynos. It doesn't matter where your human smith was born, only that he/she is human.  The Qeynos Royal Forge is found in the big &quot;Town Square&quot; area in SOuth Qeynos, right across from the big clock. Here is the link with the info on Human Qeynos Cultural Smithing (http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_smithing_human_qeynos.htm).<br />

Seems there is so little short of BD cultural, sickles and maybe some acrylia armor that folks actually would buy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">burnttoastv</div><div class="date">12-14-2002, 07:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Monks don't like the javelins because of the weight, they prefer the fishbone darts.  Beastlords or other types that can use them, I've always wondered about if these would be preferred because of the nice range on these and the higher damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leewei</div><div class="date">12-14-2002, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Damage is immaterial.  The only class that goes for ranged weapons for damage is the Ranger.  As a monk, the stats and the range are what I consider to be important.  Stats are nice for obvious reasons.  Range is important for pulling.  In general, the longer the range, the less time something is chewing my backside on the way back to camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kuronekosama</div><div class="date">12-14-2002, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A monk in my guild loves these for the range, and they are definately easier to obtain than HQ fishbone darts.  He usually carries one stack at a time and dumps the rest off to a fellow groupmember to hold on to.  I mean you really want to go fishing in Karnor's?  While certainly the darts are a better item, even the normal ones are tedious to make.  With the javs, you just buy the supplies and churn them out at the forge.</div></div><hr />
