<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eqNichola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a heads up on a nasty little bug that might cause you problems. Yes I have /bug'd and /feedback'd this in game like a good EQ citizen :)<br />
<br />
To repro:<br />
Go to PoK<br />
Go to brew barrel<br />
Open brew barrel<br />
Click Experiment to get 'old' interface<br />
Back away from brew barrel till you are far away enough so that it autocloses, result:<br />
EQ client crashes to desktop<br />
<br />
UGH :(<br />
<br />
Dunno if this is only pok, only brew barrels, only if you have them open in old interface; I don't really have time or inclination to test. Above sequence crashed twice for me, that counts as 'reproducible' in my book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Same thing happened to me in abysmal at the oven and it happened to my husband in thurgadin at the forge.  Sucks.  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maddoc-the-Wayfarer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've forwarded this to Tanker -- Make sure to put in a /bug report with your system information, in case we need it. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jora_Delossian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This happened to me with one of the PoK forges.  I was using the old &quot;experiment&quot; UI, backed away until it autoclosed, and my client crashed.<br />
<br />
I was able to autoclose the forge in Shadowhaven without a problem though, so maybe it's only happening with Tanaan containers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tanker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanx, guys.  I'll look into it in the morning.<br />

<br />
I'm the husband Tinile was talking about. Didn't bug it because I didn't come back on after crashing (and probably won't now that Tanker is aware and on the case). I did answer yes to the pop up about sending the system information.<br />
<br />
Maddoc or Tanker, if you are still reading this thread, should I put in a /bug basically saying the same thing or do you have enough to investigate. I'd be willing to help recreate the problem if you need, it happens every time (well twice anyway).<br />
<br />
I just thought it was just the extra dagger twist after failing 3 smithing trophies. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bebinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">oh, that's a nasty bug, I'll check that one out myself later on if I remember it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tanker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Believe it or not, that was Graphics Engine related.  One of the guys had fixed it last night when he noticed another problem, but it didn't make it onto test.<br />
<br />
Should go up next live patch, and look for the fix on test today (next time we patch the DLL).<br />
<br />
Thanx for the help finding it.</div></div><hr />
