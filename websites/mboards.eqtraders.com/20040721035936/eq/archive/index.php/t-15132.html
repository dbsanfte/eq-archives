<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zumavt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've read the FAQ so know which stats affect skillups for various tradeskills and have read many logs of skillup and combine rates for people who have posted their path to a skill of 250. These have been available for years.<br />
<br />
What I am wondering is whether those who post that their WIS or INT is some value above 255, does that always mean that this value displays on their Inventory screen? I read a thread recently that with some class AAs, some classes may exceed the original 255 value. Does this mean that those who post a value of 300 see that value on their screen or are they simply continuing to add up the WIS or INT attributes of their tradeskill gear after their screen displays the max of 255.<br />
<br />
For example, my 58 ranger has a WIS suit for tradeskills that raises my displayable WIS to the max value of 255 before I put on the last couple of items. Is it beneficial to continue putting on those last couple WIS items and pay for a +25 WIS KEI or am I truely stuck at 255 with no way to improve skillup rate?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>zumavt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I deleted this post from another thread when it went unanswered for a few hours. Thanks to Azirux for answering it there. However, there wasn't an absolute answer for adding additional WIS gear after reaching 255. Azirux's response would seem to indicate No. Does anyone else have a different opinion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azirux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'll rephrase from the other post: What you see is what you get. There are no hidden values for Int/Wis. Your only options for getting above 255 is to get above level 60, and start spending AA points in Adv Enlightenment, Planar Power, and whatever other AAs are available to raise your cap.<br />
<br />
And gosh, give us more than a few hours for an answer before deleting it if you don't want to look it up yourself. Some of us have jobs :-)<br />
<br />
Full info:<br />
<br />
Cap on all stats pre level 60: 255<br />
At level 60 to 65, you gain 5 points to the cap.<br />
AA: Innate Enlightenment. Requires level 61. Each rank increases the cap by 10 points in INT and WIS.<br />
AA: Planar Power: Requires level 61.  Each rank increases cap by 5 points in all stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thicket Tundrabog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have all the AA flags and physically see 355 wisdom on my character when I'm buffed with KEI. I see 344 wisdom when I'm unbuffed. In theory, I have more than 355 when I'm buffed with KEI, but the maximum cap is 355.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Timper Tantrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yep 355 is cap for int/wis<br />
<br />
I have 355 INT unbuffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You will get 5 points added your max int/wis when leveling past 60 also. Not just spending AA. Atleast for casters, not sure about melees<br />
<br />
My druid has 265 wis and my necro has 265 int at level 62 with no AA . You can get to 280 with level 65 to go past there you will need to speed AA points to increase your max.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Itek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">INT/WIS/All are capped (hard) at 255 at level 60.<br />
<br />
To go beyond this you gain 5 points of (hard) cap per level 61 - 65 (in all stats)<br />
<br />
To go beyond this you must spend AA in Planar Power. This is 2 AA points per level. One level (max) per level 61 - 65. Each level of Planar Power allows 5 more points of (hard) cap (in all stats).<br />
<br />
Pure Casters and Priests (Nec Wiz Mag Enc Sha Dru Clr) get Enlightenment AA which costs 3 AA points per. One level (max) per level 61 - 65. Each level allows INT/WIS -ONLY- to gain 10 points of (hard) cap.<br />
<br />
Now... that's fairly clear and visible to anyone who has the PoP expansion installed and checks the alt. advancement window.<br />
<br />
What is UNCLEAR is the actual effect of stats beyond 255. Personally I see a massive improvement up to 200, great improvements up to 255, and -diminishing-returns- for 256-355. Meaning that adding 30 points of stats going from 210 to 240 will see better results than adding 30 points from 270 to 300. Things seem to still improve, just at a slower rate.<br />
<br />
Your mileage may vary, and I don't have &quot;hard data&quot; to prove it. (All my hard data was on the hard drive that went -boom- last december.)</div></div><hr />
