<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KanadWinterstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My apologies Branna, it seems my post on the subject has been removed from the quests forum. Seems server politics and the bullying of a few is more important than quest information for the community.<br />
<br />
Hynid Hair Strand is in the database, hopefully we'll see this recipie added soon.</div></div><hr />

Actually, i asked the powers to be to remove the post because it was stolen from our message board and the walk-thru was not ment for public viewing.<br />
<br />
I also said to keep and use the recipie and tradeskill info, so i would ask you not to speak when you don't have the facts and cause drama where not exists.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KanadWinterstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">*this post has been removed by the writer*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nihixul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">so does anyone have any info about this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KanadWinterstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Muramite Needle is made using Muramite Residue and 4x bone chips, that recipie is in the database already. Then there's an npc named Tublik who wants you to collect four Frayed Flesh Scrap (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=60164)s, they are if I'm remembering right ground spawns and each identifies as a different corner (upper left, lower left, etc.)<br />
<br />
Then you need to make a Hynid-Hair Thread (from four strands and the needle as posted) and then use the needle, the thread and the four scraps to create Sewn Flesh Parchment (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=60166) and then hand this to Tublik for the next step in the progression sequence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Heartsong_Steelsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pardon me, but since it was, after all, removed, bringing up the same subject is not really a good idea.  I'll draw attention to this for the moderator who did remove it and they can privately contact people on the subject if you wish.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Yella</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heartsong, it's not like the the guild who's walkthrough was &quot;borrowed&quot; are the only ones who know how to do the quests, so I dont see why there would be a problem saying what the context of the recipe is, provided that it hasn't been cut directly from their boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually...<br />
<br />
Our problem was not that the information was posted.  We are against the &quot;secret society of Uber Guilds&quot;<br />
<br />
Our problem was that a whole &quot;writup&quot;, Guide, whatever you want to call it was taken and posted with no credit to the original author.  AND the original author requested the writup removed.<br />
<br />
Even the original author indicated that the information about the recipes was not his to keep secret.  What he DID have a right to was to not have his writup plagerized... and this we suport, so the exact copy writup was removed.<br />
<br />
If someone wants to give a summary (as above) that is not plagerism... (it is not plagerism above) we are happy to have it.<br />
<br />
We feel a writer has the right to control his written material.  In this case, the INFORMATION in the material is public domain...  the way the writer put it together is NOT public domain.<br />
<br />
it is not a KanadWinterstorm said &quot;server politics and the bullying&quot; it is more about the above :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>KanadWinterstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Glad to see I'm not the only one against the uberguild secrecy ngreth :)<br />
<br />
Sorry to blow up about it like this but I was rather offended when a post I had made in which I did credit the person from the safehouse who posted it (how was I supposed to know he was not the original author) was removed without any message saying why or how. It felt like I was being punished for doing something I felt was completely in the right for me to do. I knew someone had posted on my thread saying it was their guilds information, but the post was unsigned and I hadn't given it much credit.<br />
<br />
My apologies to Triton, if I offended or caused any harm to your guild.</div></div><hr />

*exactly*<br />
<br />
thank you. that's exactly why i *did* bring it up, because i knew some people had to know the quests, and since i had a couple of the items, i wanted to know, too. :)<br />
<br />
i wasn't asking for someone to post the borrowed write-up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Faeyd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There's no point to keeping it secret anyway. You can't skip any of the steps prior to this, and I mean any. And when you get to this step the NPC tells you exactly what you need to do and what pieces to use, so it's hardly a big secret at that point that's going to slow anyone down. The drops aren't particularly rare, so the most you're spoiling is what not to throw away when your guild is raiding the area.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did not point blame at you specifically since it seem like it was &quot;stolen&quot; to get on the safehouse in the first place :)  It is not important who &quot;stole&quot; what :)   just that it was not our writup to &quot;post&quot; :) (but was our information  to take :) )</div></div><hr />

Clandestinely archived, perhaps, but never stolen... ;)</div></div><hr />
