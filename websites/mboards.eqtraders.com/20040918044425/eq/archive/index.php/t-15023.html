<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know it's not at all likely to happen, but I can't help dreaming.  Wouldn't it be marvelous to be able to filter chat based on the content of it?  To filter out anything in any channel that includes &quot;PST&quot;, &quot;New Trader UP&quot;, or &quot;can u spare&quot;!  Or even fancier, to filter out &quot;WTB/WTS/WTT&quot; in any channel but /auction? Not just the offending phrase, but to filter out the entire message containing it?  Oh, bliss!<br />
<br />
I say it's not at all likely to happen since it would have to be something where the user can determine the text to be filtered, or else people would just find a way around it.  That would probably be much too much work.  <br />

But I can dream....:meditate:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The only real problems I could see involve stuff that's annoying most times, but necessary other times (filtering &quot;A magic die is rolled&quot; prevents rolling on loot) and non-channel stuff like emotes.  Beyond that, I'd love to see it happen.  But you're right, some folks would figure out a way around standard filters (&quot;P$T&quot;) and custom filters would be curious to program.<br />
<br />
Oh, well, I'll dream the dream with you.  But not in /shout.<br />
