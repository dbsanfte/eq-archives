<br />
Cantatus - Thank you for all your help with everything, for being my tradeskill mentor, for helping me with combines, recipes, and encouragement when I needed it.  You better stay in touch with me, will miss being able to check my friend list to see you are on.<br />
<br />
Verdandi - One of the sweetest polar bears around.  Though we have not talked much, I know you were always there for encouragement when I needed it.  Stay as sweet as you are.<br />
<br />
I know I am leaving others out.  These are the two who come to mine most when I think of Karana and tradeskills.  I did not know a lot of the tradeskillers, just know of a lot of you.  Good luck, and may your wares always sell.<br />
<br />
/hugs</div></div><hr />

Goodbye, Teni  :(  I hope Maelin treats you well!!</div></div><hr />

Right now mainly working on stuff for the guild, most people forgot to stock up before we moved.  And whatever food stuffs I had on karana on my mule, I left there for my RL husband to use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was always a pleasure being able to teach someone the ropes.  Of course, with cross server chats, you can still always feel free to ask me questions (unless my channels are down  :? ).<br />
<br />
Best of luck on Maelin!</div></div><hr />
