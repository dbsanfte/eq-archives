<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'v killed like 140 yard trash Diaku since the patch and not a single polished gem has droped. <br />
<br />
On the other hand that mob &quot;tortured soul&quot; that used to pop randomly is no where to be seen, so exping in that zone is much simpler now.<br />
<br />
Prior to patch I would have gotten 3 or 4 drops of polished gem with those kills.<br />
<br />
Have they removed the Gem drop from PoTactics low level Diaku?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
edit ok tortured soul is back ... still no gems though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gherad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I got a gem a few weeks ago off a normal Daiku, haven't hunted in tactics since then though.  I stopped hunting there so much when the market for earrings dropped on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bregalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We got a gem a week or so ago.  I think it dropped off a diaku Scout at the bottom of the stairs, just before you enter the 'dining hall'.   We went down there a couple times since, but no more gems dropped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bregalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yup, just yesterday got another gem off a Diaku Oracle, right next to the pit.   Successfully made the earring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bregalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh, and to add - so far, war wraith blood has been the real bear to come by.  Even now, I got 2 highly polished gems in bank, and need blood to attempt the combines.</div></div><hr />

 i'm on Xev also, and the blood still falls fine from the War Wraiths.   The blood isn't common, but it does fall. ;)  I was in the pit with a xp group on monday and we were pulling maybe 35% wraiths/65% other stuff, for 3 hours, and got two bloods to fall.  <br />
<br />
I have 5 or so bloods banked now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Platinu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One day in the dining room area we had 2 HPG's drop within 5 mobs of each other.  Then the rest of the night we didn't see a one.<br />
<br />
Then yesterday I and a shammie friend (with my bot druid) killed 2 diaku and got 1 to drop, but the rest of the night we didn't see a one drop.  They're just rare but seem to drop all over Tactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mindmelder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They drop about one per 50 daiku on average. I xp north of the pit in the halls up there and in the last months or so xping have accumulated 17 HPGs.</div></div><hr />
