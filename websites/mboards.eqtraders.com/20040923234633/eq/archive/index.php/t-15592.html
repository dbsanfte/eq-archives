Get accepted by a GM?  Since it has the ' in the name, it was petitioned ot a GM and accepted.<br />
<br />
Nice to see one sided yet erratic enforcement of the rules.<br />
<br />
I know, it's a :dedhorse: , but it's still annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cmon, all you have to do is take a look at all the legolas variations running around to realize they don't give two whits about the name policy (no names from popular fiction or homonyms thereof, forget what rule that is). <br />
<br />
Disclaimer: I don't mind names from fictional works, as long as you get the name right and don't massacre it. If you can get it right, it's usually little known fiction and wouldn't be offensive to anyone. But cmon, Legolllas, Leggollasss, Llegoolaas, etc...*boooring*. Same for Bilbo, Drizzt, etc. It's also better to pick a minor character from a fantasy work, because the name usually sounds really good and you don't look like you're trying to be the star of the show. <br />
<br />
And if I see another bard named Brittneee Speeeers I'm going to scream.<br />
<br />
Though when I was told that a GM probably wouldn't change the name &quot;Hotnsexy&quot; because it didn't violate the naming policy and because it was &quot;only a bazaar trader&quot; I basically gave up reporting offensive names. They don't care.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Itek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They do NOT care about enforcing the naming policy.<br />
<br />
Not only do they NOT care, they ACTIVELY discourage Guides and GMs from enforcing it unless absolutely required. (I was booted from the Guide Program years ago for actually enforcing the policy they gave us.)<br />
<br />
I've posted about this before, search posts by Itek and you'll find it.<br />
<br />
But there is a MAJOR caveat to the naming policy. Once a toon hits 35th level they DO NOT EVER change the name unless it violates rule 1 or rule 2. &quot;Reputation&quot;<br />
<br />
So if you can slip a name by them for 34 levels... you are home free.<br />
<br />
Oh, and since the majority of naming enforcement falls to Senior Guides (normal guides don't have a name command, GMs now are not server resident and could barely be bothered before when there was an official &quot;server-GM&quot;) the naming policy varies from server to server, and from year to year as the Server Managment Group evolves.<br />
<br />
i.e. On my play server they have, in the past, enforced the rules. Whackyweed Pipesmoker eventually became Whacky.<br />
<br />
i.e. On my guiding server they enforced the &quot;can't badmouth the CS staff&quot; rule, and patted me on the back for my actions in that incident, but shied away from enforcing the &quot;can't have a religious connotation name&quot; rule, to the point of kicking me out. (By the way, both those naming violations happened in under an hour.)<br />
<br />
YES I am still bitter about it. 29 months later. Took me almost a year to start really playing EQ again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sulkano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There's a guild named De'Vir on Fennin....go figure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Saleani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Surnames with ' or ` in them can currently be issued by senior guides and GMs. Seniors cannot change first names. Maybe they used to, but they cannot now.  Regular guides are allowed to issue surnames only for weddings/divorces, and they have to witness the other surname. Maybe in the future, your local guide may be able to give you whatever surname you want. Who knows.<br />
<br />
Frankly, there are enough broken things in the game that the name police should take a break. Yes there are some real bad ones (like tittytwister or asspoker or any number of variations of sexual acts legally defined as sodomy in many states), but there are more than enough people who lose whole characters to bugs, or spend 4 weeks waiting for a reimbursal because someone has a stick up their rear due to names. Take a look at the naming policy. There are a number of categories for bad names. And pretty much as Itek says, if it violates rules 1 and 2, it gets immediate attention (immediate sometimes means sometime this month ).<br />
<br />
There are also some people in this game who intentionally and deliberately screw over other folks. Like intentionally training and killing the turn in mobs for someone's ring 10 battle. Or deliberately training raids in BoThunder to ninja the loot from the tower bosses. Or deliberately training raids in BoT because they won't let the buttmucher join in the Agnarr raid. The person doing all these has merely been suspended for 1 week. Not banned. No matter how many hours of many peoples evenings or weekends get messed up as a result. Note: Narandi's head is no-rent. The turn in mob takes 3 days to repop. I wonder how many folks have to quit EQ before something happens. Don't get me started or I can really rant on about this. All I can do is vote with my wallet. If the game becomes unplayable due to a couple jerks deliberately trying to make a blue server red, I won't pay for it, and neither should the hundreds of other people affected by the clowns.<br />
<br />
Yes, one of my characters has a dorky name, that day I rolled it up, I could not get a random name past the name filter, so anyone who runs unix webservers looks at my ranger's name and laughs (it is the name of a directory found on unix based webservers). Roleplaying name? Nope. Would I lose a wink of sleep if it got changed on me? Nope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">From what I have seen in game if it will get SOE in trouble (wether from copyright lawsuits or bad publicity) it will get changed.  Otherwise you're on your own.<br />
<br />
De'Vir is a copyright protected name and was probably altered for that reason.  Names with overt sexual or racist tones likely will get the axe too.  Stupid names GMs will likely not bother with unless they are in a bad mood and want to take it out on someone.<br />
<br />
I agree that enforcement is spotty and irregular but with the current state of customer service from SOE I doubt that will change.</div></div><hr />

Kitikar Cottonpicker (erudite..see where the last name is going?)<br />
Manghina (mangina....*sigh*)<br />

All I can say is WTF?<br />
<br />
I mean, how hard is it to pick a name with a &quot;feel&quot; to it? If I see a name like &quot;Fatboy Eatsalot&quot;, that will ruin my experience of the fantasy world. im sorry, but I think a non NO DROP server where RP isnt preferred would take care of this problem.<br />

I also think this would become the worst griefer and d00d server ever in existance really, really fast.</div></div><hr />

De'vir was a Drow family in the ever-popular series that brought us the umpteen-zillion Drizzt clones. They could be basing their refusal on that copyright.  <br />
<br />
Its also the last name of one of the possible party members in the popular Baldur's Gate CRPGs (not the Dark Alliance games).  Viconia De'vir is a female drow cleric that, provided the player saves her from a lynching, can join the party in both Baldur's Gate I and Baldur's Gate II.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whats the big deal about picking a name from a book?<br />
<br />
Lets say some yoyo picks the name Frodo and plays it in EQ and sneaks by the GMs and gets to 65. <br />
<br />
Whoever is in charge of the Rings books copyright finds out and  gets said panties in a wad and sues SOE.<br />
<br />
Wheres the loss? Any judge would laugh and say 'How did Sony harm you in any way?'<br />
<br />
Usually any trademark infringement lawsuits are because someone is faking another persons good name to make money or, to ruin their rep, and someone is actually being harmed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Originally posted by splunge <br />
Wheres the loss? Any judge would laugh and say 'How did Sony harm you in any way?' I'm no legal expert, but my guesses would be:<br />
1) Defamation to the franchise, but unauthorized acts by the SOE's &quot;Frodo&quot; being applied to people's impressions of the Tolkien &quot;Frodo&quot;.<br />
2) Violation of trademark (and copyright?), by having unauthorized Tolkien material as an aspect of your commerical product, which may draw &quot;Tolkien customers&quot; to the SOE product and away from authorized Tolkien products (there is a hobbit MMORPG in the works).<br />
3) Potentially some simple violation of copyright, although I'm not overly strong on non-digital copyright law.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, just my thoughts.  Then again, I'm the type of person that ifnds modding an EQ UI to be a violation of the EQ EULA, but SOE doesn't seem to care enough either way to either modify the EULA's modifying code/reverse engineering/3rd party modifications sections or to persecute UI modders ... something similar might ultimately be true for the derived names - they're technically violating, but not in a manner worth actually dealing with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That, I knew, and if that was their consistent reasoning for rejecting it (while it was accepted on two other servers) I would have been a lot better about it. Besides, I've had that name BEFORE I read R.A. Salvatore's books.  (I know, it won't make a difference, but that's the truth).<br />
<br />
But, their consistent reasoning was that &quot;It might mean the virus in German&quot; (I don't know German, so I can't verify, but it also sounds like these GMs might not know too much German either), which might be insulting to some people.<br />
<br />
(Well, I do know some Spanish, and it would mean 'of life' in Spanish).<br />

It's just interesting that a GM would deliberately allow Heyeu Pull'Myfinger.<br />

You're right about the threat of racking up big defense bills being a major reason for care on SOE's part when issuing rules but there is one thing that has to be remembered - HOW are they going to find out that someone has used the name Frodo in EQ?<br />
<br />
And even if someone does make a legal threat all SOE have to do is say &quot;Oh, really? Thanks very much for pointing it out to us.

<br />
The problem with this analogy is no one will believe you when you say you did not know it was a person you hit. (Unless you can convince the judge you thought it was a real mannequin.)<br />
<br />
On the other hand, by current US law, a hosting company can't be held liable for copyright violations by it's customers until it is notified. Now Sony's legal relationship to it's customers is probably hazy, I'll admit. But I think the good faith efforts Sony makes to catch violators would probably protect it in court. But I bet Sony will try everything it can to avoid court just in case.<br />
<br />
Edit: I meant good faith. &quot;God faith effort&quot; does not sound legal.</div></div><hr />

My druid is named Oonagh (alternate spelling of Una or Oona, depending on your language preference).  <br />
<br />
I'll occasionally get people mentioning &quot;Oh, hey, that's the fairy chick from Legend.&quot;  Which is true - though not sure exactly how hers was spelled.  Therefore, I am a horrible awful person who is violating the rule of using a copyrighted character name.  (Though at least it's a semi-obscure one.  I want to strangle someone every time I see this guy on my server named Legolizzit... *grumble*) <br />
<br />
However, Oonagh is also my real name.  It's on my driver's license, etc.  (I was having an uncreative moment when I made that character).  <br />
<br />
So, if you were a GM, and some silly person complained about my name.. what would ya do? *grin*<br />

Beat you with a stick?  Not for your name or anything.. but because I would be an overworked, underapreciated, underpowered guide that is supposed to save the EQ Customer service reputation without the power to do jack crap.<br />
<br />
And then I'd tell the complainer to piss off too :)<br />
<br />
I'd probably also learn to type....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Itek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Well... since you asked...<br />
<br />
I'd thank the /pet (petitioner) for their input and tell them I'd look into it.<br />
<br />
I'd pull up your account records and see if you had been previously warned about naming violations or had this name previously noted as an exception by a Guide or GM.<br />
<br />
Then I'd window out (old days, check on second computer) to see if that spelling were indeed a copyright violation.<br />
<br />
Presuming:<br />
<br />
1) No prior naming problems<br />
2) No prior permission<br />
3) It is the copyrighted spelling<br />
<br />
Then I'd contact you, politely, and tell you about the problem. If you claimed it was your real life name I'd say that it's a Bad-Idea(tm) to use your real life name in an online environment because of the rise of identity theft. Then I'd explain that you would have to request a name change from a GM.<br />
<br />
(In the old days I'd tell you to /petition during Server-GM L's office hours, or if that was not possible to email the Server Senior Guides and make an appointment with one of them. Now Sr's don't have power to change first names and there are no &quot;Server-GMs&quot; ... sigh)<br />
<br />
Then I'd ask if you wanted me to suggest some possible names. Then when you were ready to get re-named I'd bump the petition up to red and go look for a GM to resolve the problem.<br />
<br />
OF COURSE if you happened to be level 35 or higher the point is moot, I'd thank the /pet, note it in my log and delete the petition. (No first name changes for 35+ characters unless they violate naming policy item 1 or 2. Period. Ever. ... Unless they pay the fee for it.) :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Of course... I was booted from the Guide Program for actually enforcing naming policy as written. So your mileage will certainly vary.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Yeah. Bit him too.&quot;<br />
<br />
(old Simpsons quote.... laugh with me)<br />
<br />
Extremely. I hold UTTER contempt for the SOE CS managers. And they know it. On other threads I've discussed in greater detail exactly how screwy the &quot;naming policy&quot; enforcement was and is, and exactly how I got booted for enforcing the written policy.<br />
<br />
As &quot;the policy&quot; is defined more in the mind of the closest GM / Sr than in the PnP, and as I said, your mileage will certainly vary. Maybe the &quot;35+ reputation exception&quot; only exists on my Play and Former-Guiding servers. As I've only ever logged in to those two servers, with the exception during the first live week when I was playing on my friends account while I visited him, I really couldn't say.<br />
<br />
But if you want to see exactly WHY this is a sore subject with me wander over to the EQLive site. Check up on the &quot;name change&quot; list for the server BristleBane. Nearly 50% of the name changes (approved by SOE GMs) are from and/or TO ILLEGAL (under the written policy) names. No kidding. SOE let people pay money to GET names that are prohibited.  :boggled: <br />

Look at it this way and see if it gives you some insight.<br />

Itek: Um, you clearly have a pair of socks under your shirt and didn't pay for them. This violates our &quot;no shoplifting&quot; policy.<br />
Harry Moe: I'm a good customer, and I didn't know about the &quot;shoplifting&quot; policy.<br />
Itek: Sorry, that's no excuse. If you want you can talk it over with Missy when she gets in to work in about 2 hours.<br />
Harry Moe: You are a *CENSORED* and have no right to talk to me this way.<br />
Itek: Ok, now I'm going to ask you to leave and in addition to shoplifting I'll add employee harassment to the list of charges.<br />
<br />
*later*<br />
<br />
Missy: Itek can I see you in my office?<br />
Itek: Sure.<br />
Missy: Why do I have 3 police reports on my desk from you?<br />
Itek: Crazy Larry, who you had arrested perviously for public disturbance came back and bad-mouthed you.<br />
Missy: Ah... and you threw him off the property, even though you really didn't have the authority, and called for another police report. Good job.<br />
Itek: Then while I was on the phone I say Harry Moe shoplifting. I called him on it and he got abusive with me. I'd have let it go with a warning if he'd just paid for the socks.<br />
Missy: Hmmm... well he is a paying customer...<br />
<br />
*2 days later*<br />
<br />
Missy: Welcome to the monthly awards meeting.<br />
Sally: Congrats Itek on 3 months service.<br />
*Itek blushes*<br />
<br />
*Next day*<br />
<br />
Itek: Sally my ID card won't let me into the break room before my shift.<br />
Sally: We fired you, because you upset Harry Moe.<br />
Itek: That was 3 days ago.<br />
Sally: Yeah, but we decided to let you run the store all day Saturday and close Saturday night and do the deposit so you could finish out the three months. We felt you had done a wonderful job and deserved to get your 3 month service certificate. Bye now.<br />
Itek: I intend to appeal your decision to the governing board.<br />
Sally: We thought you would. Best of luck. Oh, by the way, we've never been overturned.<br />
<br />
*Itek files an appeal*<br />
<br />
*Itek follows up on the appeal after a month*<br />
<br />
*Itek follows up on the follow up after 2 months*<br />
<br />
*Over 90 days after the filed appeal Itek learns of a new GM assigned to the appeals board, and directly emails them, using a list of email addresses he had from before*<br />
<br />
*90 minutes after the email is sent*<br />
GM-Newly: Itek, I'm sorry to hear your appeal has taken so long to be processed. I'll check into it and see what's going on.<br />
<br />
*26 minutes after GM-Newly's email is sent*<br />
SR-Stuffy: Itek, after a full review of your employment records we are denying your appeal. Best of luck in all your endevours.<br />
<br />
No kidding. I waited 3 full MONTHS for them to spend less than 26 MINUTES reviewing my appeal.<br />
<br />
BITTER? You haven't seen the tip of the iceberg. It LITTERALY took over a year before I logged my main play character back in.<br />
<br />
On at least 3 occasions I've had Guides and Sr. Guides on my play server invite me to re-apply. No, I can't set myself up for that kind of pain again. But, and I always say this, I strongly encourage everyone to apply to be a Guide. The guides are always short handed and if you aren't willing to be a Guide you have no right to complain about slow or non-existant response to petitions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I had a feeling the system went something like that.  I have applied to be a guide 3 times now, and have yet to have an answer on them, granted this first time I probably wouldn't have chosen me either now that I look back and think of the ridiculous answers I put in some of the blanks (I was new, and uninformed.) <br />

Back to the main thread...GRRR Naming Policy is a joke, however, I have had rather good luck with getting offensive surnames changed for 60+ characters, however, I do not think I have really tried with first names.  (Saddamslayer was my most recent victory.)  Seeing some of the names that were overtly approved by the GMs irritates me, but as far as the non-fantasy names that get through (mine probably included,) there are so many characters created that I am sure trying to review the names is just near impossible.  I saw a new little level 1 character in market named Lesbian yesterday, it gave many people a good laugh and they started taking a pool on how long it would take to get changed. any bets?  I give it at LEAST 4 months...</div></div><hr />
