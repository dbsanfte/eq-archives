<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ockhamsrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been reading this web site for a least 2 years and everyone always talked about how difficult it was to GM tailoring.  I started a few weeks ago to just reach the shawl trivial, not even GM it.<br />
<br />
Over all this time I was building a HUGE stash of trade skill components, enough I had thought to easily reach shawl trivial if not GM.  I had, and stress had, several mules stuffed with flawless rockhoppers, wyvern, velium hound fur, velium studs, heady kiolas, silk, black panther etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
Unfortunetly I didn't bother to keep track of how many combines I did, but several days later I'm out of supplies and only at 183.<br />
<br />
I just can't believe how many combines I've had to do to only get to 183...183!  My int is maxed, I chanted the lucky chants, spun in place, did it all.  ONLY 183!<br />
<br />
Ok so any suggestions here?  I'm out of supplies but have a large bank account, 300K roughly, and can buy a lot of stuff.<br />
<br />
Would you try to do the acrylia studded to get to 188, and then pick up with reinforced from there?  There seems to be huge gap between 188 and 250 without much I can do without resorting to cultural.<br />
<br />
I'm looking for things that don't involve a tremendous number of sub combines.  Making the velium studs almost killed me.<br />
<br />
Oh, btw this is a 50 char, not a planes char, so planes recipes are out.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

solstice robes but you don't want subcombines.<br />
<br />
please tell me you went through the entire wu's progression and didn't just start burning your good stuff?<br />
<br />
arctic wyvern is prolly the easiest to farm/fish but you need velium which is top $ now.  <br />
<br />
good luck farming the hoppers for a bit i guess.  :)  i am waiting for the new ui for wu's.  heady kiolas annoy me.<br />

And yes, you should have kept all the components you acquired for later and done loy ribbons to 187.<br />
<br />
Knowledge is the key, and obviously you didn't seek it out before beginning your combines; well, I made the same mistake, but it didn't take me that long to acquire it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think you need to plan your skill ups a little better.  There's no way you should have used up your hopper hides until after everything else was trivial.  With a little up front preparation, you can minimize the time and cost that your skilling up will take.   Also check the how to skill up guides under the learn a skill link on the main page here.  <br />
<br />
People here are very helpful.  Feel free to ask for help when you need it.  (and don't forget the search function, because chances are, someone else asked that question before.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ockhamsrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rest assured, I did Wu's till trivial, then ribbon to high 170's, then I ran out of stuff for ribbons so I started into the &quot;Good&quot; stuff.<br />
<br />
I had 70-80 stacks of good stuff though, 245+ trivial stuff.  I just never imagined I would only get around 10 skillups with all those final combines.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>JMorgana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Personally, if we're talking about the ungodly 6th shawl tailoring combine (200+ trivial one), I would go for it...I've done that one twice on the first shot...once at 158 tailoring on my wizard and once at 140 tailoring on my druid...REALLY not worth sinking the money into trying to raise it higher unless you're really planning on GM'ing it at some point anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lladnarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">LoY ribbons for skill ups... hmmm, I know, seems simple. I am not a forager, so I have to buy the foraged items, or get friends to forage for me (sometimes this works) Platinum ribbons cost 105pp each. so for a stack of combines, that is 2k+ (for just the ribbons). skill ups from 1 stack of combines normally results in 2, maybe 3 if your lucky. I guess I just don't get how people make that much pp. I dont (and wont) run a casino. ( I put any I hear advertising them on ignore) I get pp from selling stuff I get from loots in Bazaar or splits from groups. I dont put rediculous prices on my items either (1million pp for a white dragon helm) (85k for a spell) To me all this just seems crazy. The economy is insane, Imo. I used to make Blessed fishing rods to make pp. As I stated earlier, I do not forage, so... the price of planar oak has gone from 200pp to 1-2k, and dragon eggs are rarely found in the bazaar anymore. <br />
<br />
I guess I am ranting a bit, I appologize for this. I just get frustrated.<br />
<br />
I am currently doing the 7th shawl, my tailoring is 155, with a geerlock that puts me at the trivial for the 7th combine. I really hesitate to try, because I have already failed with the enchanted velium powder once. (3k for a runed sea shell, GAH!) So, I face skilling up tailoring to 176 so that I can be a little more secure in finishing the 7th and 8th shawl. So.... lots of farming for me, for superb rockhopper hides to do skill ups with acrylia studded, just cant afford the LoY ribbon route.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand; if you've finished the sixth already, why bother raising your tailoring further?  You're already at the trivial (with geerlok) for the 7th and the only other tailoring combine is soft fur padding, for which you will be at near trivial and will get near minimum fail rates.  Worst case, just make another padding; it's far easier than cheaper than raising your tailoring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>AbitooXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I killed the level 4 greens in Steamfront for steamfront water to do most of my LoY ribbons.  Also got some lichenclover (slaughter drolvargs in FV) and bazaar farmed.  I believe I was only getting about 20 per hour (  pay some noobs!<br />
<br />
I did solstice robes to about 210, where I was so sick of subcombines, and my success rate was really killing my funds (cost me roughly 120pp per fail and another 500pp per success), that I moved on to Artic Wyvern.  I had been bazaar farming hides at 40pp each or less for a month or more, quickly burned through them.  Started buying velium and fishing for oil, decided learned it was faster to do it the other way around when the bazaar permited.<br />
<br />
As far as how people make the cash to support their tailoring habit, I cannot speak for anyone else, but since I had smithing and brewing GM'd (ok, smithing is 221+15%) when they added ornate drops to Sol Ro I probably farmed 100-200k in ornate in with my exp group in a week, averaging almost 1 drop per person per 2-3hr session.  Also, another 20-50k from sheets and rings....  Market isnt as good on those anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>xonbink</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">With 300k in the bank, and desire to GM tailoring, the only sensible way is to make solstice robes.<br />
<br />
Find a JCM3(Jewelcraft aa) chanter friend who is 250 skill jeweler, offer some cash to make the chains - get 40 or 50 chains at once and goto town.<br />
<br />
At your current skill, you will have roughly 1 in 10 (if you are lucky) success rates - therefore you would end up with some 400 or 500 skill up chances - expect 1 for every 40 - <br />
<br />
the greatest cost for the robes obviosly is the chains.  The silks and emeralds are of cost too, but not as great.  A jcm3 250 skill jeweler will be able to make the chains for under 250 each with very few failures thereby greately reducing your cost to make them.  Since the robes still fetch 400+ on many servers you will in the long run eventually start to make a profit from your efforts.<br />
<br />
Fortunately I did this back when robes were still 1k each, and even with failures once I hit around 210 skill I was able to continue my tailoring indefinately utilizing this route. <br />
<br />
However, the most difficult part of the solstice robes is all the combining that you must complete - there are many subcombines and you will definately need to clear out your bank to do it in the above manner- but this is definately the easiest way to do it if you have the cash to spend.<br />
<br />
good luck :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kulyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Are you trying to simply do the shawl, or are you trying to GM tailoring?<br />
<br />
If it's just the shawl you want, stop trying to skill up - you're much better off simply farming the components for the shawl combine that you are burning so much money/time on raising skill. <br />
<br />
Simply finishing Wu's is close enough for the shawl in my opinion, any further than that is simply pain you do not need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>ockhamsrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Thanks for the suggestions all.  As for GM vs Shawl, I had intended to GM the skill because....I dunno, I just wanted to.  :-)<br />
<br />
I wanted the challenge, the effort, etc.  On my way to GMing I had intended to get the shawl, but it is only a stop off point.<br />
<br />
Sometimes you just have to experience something yourself, no amount of reading the primal scream posts will really make it sink home how umbelievably frusterating getting this skill to 200 is, let alone 250.<br />
<br />
I have a totally different amount of sympathy now for people pursuing this.</div></div><hr />

but I'll just write what I did to skill up.<br />
<br />
I was at 180 when SoL came out.<br />
So, I did...<br />
studded rockhopper to 188,<br />
reinforced rockhopper, arctic wyvern, black panther, cobalt drake<br />
and some solstice robes from there to around 240.<br />
I was lucky enough to get a bunch of yew leaves from my guildie<br />
for the blackpanther armor combines,  and drake eggs for the <br />
cobalt drake armor was easy to get and cheap to buy.<br />
So from there I used mostly blackpanther and cobalt drake to skill up to 250.<br />
Both black panther and cobalt drake armors use velium &quot;boning&quot;<br />
wich makes the subcombines less and cheaper.<br />
And also both can be sold in the bazaar for quite good price,<br />
(at least in veeshan) to make back a part of your expence.<br />
<br />
Only you can pick and chose what path you take<br />
money or time, even a middle path using both by situation.<br />
Good luck on your skilling .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Meirril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Just a thought, if you have a friend or two thats willing to go farm Dragon Necropolis for Phase Spider Carapice (still sells well in the bazaar). While your farming them combine 2 phase spider silk (min skill 160's to combine, trivials at 220). The silk seems to be an uncommon drop. You would be able to do the entrance with a well ballanced 50's group, or duo with a 60's melee and a healer. Or solo with a 65 beast lord/paladin. Not sure about the last two but I think either one would be able to solo the dragon constructs that spawn near the entrance and agro to the zone in.<br />
<br />
Dragon constructs are the only real danger here. You have to stand in melee range to cast on them. Also they summon. Other than that they go down fairly easy. Did I mention they agro from their spawn all the way to the zone in? Realy cuts down on soloing in DN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Abazagaroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Dragon constructs are traps in the bones, if you don't step on them they do not aggro.<br />
<br />
Believe me, I've soloed there before when waiting for a raid as a 65 paladin, and its easy, and its a massive pain to try and get those things to spawn =P They never will pop it seems unless you are in the exact right spot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>drtyaty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I've read by many posters that these are extremely rare drops, making it a not so good skill up option.</div></div><hr />

Hehe, 105pp per combine is cheap, considering the alternatives.  Its still cheap even after you add the cost of buying the LoY dye (or forage).</div></div><hr />

RE: Dragon Necropolis<br />
<br />
Aye, I have quad'ed the spiders for a while in order to get drops for tailoring combines.  I 'd estimate the drop rate to be about 1 in 8 to 10.  I got some early skill ups in the low 200s (seemed like every other combine), but now that I am 217 I have gone 20 some combines without a skill up.<br />
<br />
The spiders start to turn light blue at 65, and the experience gain is not close to what you could get elsewhere.  Drops are uncommon enough that trying to skill exclusively using this method would be very time consuming considering you need 2 per combine.  However, if you want to spend some time soloing and maybe getting a drop or 2 for the bazaar, it is definately viable option in the low 200s (in my experience).</div></div><hr />
