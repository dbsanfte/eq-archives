<br />
That is a new server that will be opened that will not allow transfers (for at least 6 months, possibly never).<br />
<br />
Meaning everyone will be starting out again from the very begining.<br />
<br />
So, what would you do if you had a fresh start?<br />
<br />
What character/class would you make?<br />
<br />
How would you survive in an untwinked world?<br />
<br />
Is anyone planning on making a fresh start on this server?</div></div><hr />

Someone at SOE has been reading this board or someone from here actually made a suggestion to somebody that could do something about it.<br />
<br />
I think my brain just exploded.....................I have no idea. It would mean leaving behind everyone I know on Quellious but to be the first one to craft a piece of armor or GM a tradeskill..........tempted, don't know if I should fight the temptation or give in............................My cerebellum is fusing.......................arrrrrrrrhhhhhhhhhhggggggg.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will create a character there, and try to be among the first to do a few things on the server.<br />
<br />
I'd love some company from here, it would be very interesting.  I figure if I give it a week, and see what happens, I've given it a shot.<br />
<br />
Currently I plan for my main to be a Gnome Enchanter.... so sue me, I want to have a chance at 2 tradeskills ;).<br />
<br />
If we could get a full group from here to &quot;PL&quot; eachother we can get untwinked up in levels fairly quickly to the mid 30's at least... tradeskill raids would not be unhead of either :).<br />
<br />
I was 3 years late for EQ, so this is a great thing for me...</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing that first sucked me into EQ was the challenge and the excitement of doing &quot;new&quot; things. <br />
<br />
Tunare, my home server, was the first server added after the &quot;live&quot; date.  Granted it was only 3 days after the live date for EQ, but still. <br />
<br />
The world was new, and trips from Qeynos to Freeport were fraught with peril.  The highest level players in the first week were in the low teens, and few were brave enough to try it.  Teleports were next to unheard of, and someone wearing ringmail or bronze was a god. <br />
<br />
You'll have some fun, I know you will.  But as for me, I'm staying where I am comfortably level 60 and have resources.  It's taken me 4 years to get where I am now in-game, and I don't relish doing it all from scratch. <br />
<br />
That said, I want to know what happens when you do.  Heck, I might even be tempted to stop by and visit. <br />

Even with the new server and no transfers, it can't be the same. With soulbinders, Nexus spires and PoP clicky books, the peril of travel &quot;old school&quot; has no meaning. I think that the original game many &quot;old time players&quot; experienced (and I'm certainly not saying I was one of them - I only played for 2.5 years) will never be accomplished again unless they take out the Nexus and PoP book ports and soulbinders to shorten your walk if you die.<br />
<br />
Then make people walk from Erudin to Ak'kanon...=)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You laugh, but I've done that, or something very similar to it. Died just on the Qeynos side of WK and was bound in Freeport. I knew I should have bound in Highpass Hold. Oh well.....  ;) I even remember a day when you could make money binding people. *gasp* ;)<br />
<br />
Call me old and lazy, but I like the PoP books and the Nexus, but I also have a druid husband so I can get just about anywhere anytime. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delfontes</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am very split on the PoK books...<br />
<br />
The spires make you wait 15 minutes, which is a good way to kinda ease travel, but not totally trivialize it.<br />
<br />
The books I have always thought should charge you, in accordance with your level.  <br />
<br />
My idea was 1pp ever level you are, so a level 50 guy pays 50pp for the convienience of using the book, and a level 1 guy pays 1pp.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I am basically over it now ;).  On the new server it will make life a whole lot easier, and is the primary reason I will create an enchanter, and not another wizard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lothay</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 05:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my day we walked uphill both ways to the nearest dungeon.  In the snow.  And when we got there, the mobs just killed us.  And we LIKED it. <br />
<br />
*snicker*<br />
<br />
Chenier - You're right.  The &quot;old school&quot; will never come back.  And in many ways, I'm happy about that.  I started playing 3 days after commercial release.  When /consent let someone LOOT your corpse.  When the clipping plane was NOT adjustable.  When getting to level 8 to get meditate (for a shaman) took weeks.  When the spires were a mystery because wizards weren't high enough to have teleport spells.  When going to a new zone usually meant a lost corpse. <br />
<br />
I don't miss those days.  Sure, I had some fun.  But the way things have been improved or simplified makes the game much more enjoyable to me. <br />
<br />
But then again, I'm happy being level 60 with a large stable of alts/twinks.  I'm not sure I'd want to start from scratch.  <br />

With no transfers and macros mostly dead (Huzzah), the relative value of goods will be interesting. Stuff that you can't give away on the old servers will have value but the amount of platinum out there will be more limited.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EnfinitiStarr8</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, maybe we should all make new toons on the server and then start a new guild thier, &quot;DenMom's Childern&quot; that would be a cool little guild. Something to do when your main is killed 3 times in one day.... What ya think?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds like a plan, but we'd better ask the Denmom if that is ok with her ;).<br />
<br />
Toss up there Quin, it'd be nice to have someone to bring us back to our corpses in a rez form, but Shammy buffs are very nice for the tanks ;).  <br />
<br />
Actually thinking about it, if it is a small group of regulars, Shammy/Enchanter overlap more than Cleric/Enchanter, but I'm not one to care, this is for fun :).<br />
<br />
Whichever you'd most enjoy playing would be fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iceblossom</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been thinking about starting a new life on the new server as well.  There is a non-tradeskilling erudite SK in me that wants to get out and this seems like a good opportunity (ok, knowing me I will probably have to do some cultural tailoring or something).  Actually, I am going to login and make a bunch of lives with all the names I really like and could never get on my main server (not that anyone is actually actively playing those names, just that they are taken).<br />
<br />
I started on FV the day it was made and loved the server so much in the early days before it was nerfed, before it became the farming grounds of Stormhammer and before a lot of other stuff.  Is definitely different on a fresh server.<br />
<br />
It will be hard at first.  Exhilirating to some of us, too brutal for others.  There will be no economy.  There will be no one to buy those spiderling silks or what-nots.  Money for spell classes will be tight.  I remember on FV when I was one of the first people able to make backpacks (well... I got lucky far below the trivial point) and traded banded legs from one of the first smiths and we both considered it a fair deal.<br />
<br />
I know that I am preaching to the choir here... but for those who don't think newbie quests are worthwhile, well, here's a chance to change your view.   And for those of you who think gear is the end-all and be-all of the game, well, again, time to find out that you can level perfectly well naked and with your birth weapon (at least at first).  Ok, so maybe you can't do levels 1-10 in 2 hours, but then again you will be needing to get that newbie armor anyway, and you can easily do it in a day or two part time playing.<br />
<br />
With everyone on an equal footing, it will be indeed the skill of the player, along with their available hours and dedication.  Still... in two weeks, a month, a blink of the eye things will be &quot;back to normal&quot;.  Sorry to be a downer on this, because it is exciting and fun, but none of us can go back home again, at least until EQ2 and SWG and other games come out.<br />
<br />
However, in six months it will be an established server, my bet is in two months there will be established end game with entire guilds 60-65.  I don't really see any need in restricting all transfers ever there.  But I am looking at going in and having some fun while it is rough and wild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quinner Sparrowhawk</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Del, how does this sound - Dwarven Cleric. I was thinking of a human cleric but the Dwarven armors are nice. Will this new guild be working hard on leveling or will there be tradeskill sessions?  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delfontes</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds good, yes, and yes ;)<br />
<br />
I want to get levels, but a good portion of the time on this char I'd like to devote to tradeskills, maybe we can do entire raids for exp and tradeskill items.<br />
<br />
Like heading to EK mid way through a grind in Paludal to get silks/pelts for the tailors, tea leaves and griffon feathers for whoever does brewing, wolf meat for whoever is baking etc.  <br />
<br />
Personally I'll be working on JC and Tinkering (when I can), looks like you'd be smithing ;).   <br />
<br />
I'll think about it more as the day gets closer, sounds more and more fun every time I think on it.<br />
<br />
P.S. <br />
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=55602<br />
<br />
That new announcement means they have comitted to a year without even considering letting transfers into that new server.  It will be an island, sink or swim, this should be a blast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EnfinitiStarr8</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, this was my idea, I want it!  :D  I was thinking and I like the idea of a Wood Elf Druid. I play a Human Ranger so I want a little change. Spells, for me, will be hard at first, but if we all make one guild we can raid starting at level 1 (IE: Crushbone, Black Burrow, Running Eye....) We can help each other gain levels, use each other's skills to equip ourselves and become the UBER guild of the server. It would be fun.<br />
A Wood Elf Druid can port, not like anyone still needs that with PoP books, but also I'd have Cultural Tailoring AND Fleching, with an easy way to the 160s for Smithing. That would help a lot. So, now we just have to ask DenMom for use of her name.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delfontes</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just on this thread if you'd be willing to join us we have Smithing/Tailoring/JC covered.  Fletching and Tinkering also would be covered, but I don't know if I can get far with tinkering until we're a bit larger.<br />
<br />
With me to enchant vials etc. you can be up to Wu's within literally days of release, assuming we can farm enough cash. <br />
<br />
A backpack monopoly is a great way to be able to afford stuff ;).  <br />
<br />
BTW, I am doing this for fun, and I don't know if I'll be giving up my 'main' for this unless it is extremely enjoyable.<br />
<br />
So I don't know if I'll have the time to actually run a real guild (or the expertise, who am I kidding), but I wouldn't mind being an officer of &quot;Denmom's Children&quot;.</div></div><hr />

The idea of starting fresh is amazing to me. :shock:  I came to the game only 1.5 years ago. The roads were paved and I just cruised right into it. I would cherish the chance to be uber with a fine steel weapon.<br />

I know I don't post here as often as some, but I would be honored to be part of DenMom's Children. <br />

Lots of challenges ahead -- already thinking of special strategies for getting cash and tradeskills up. <br />
<br />
It will be fun to look at every item and think of the following questions:<br />
<br />
1. can I wear it?<br />
2. can I eat it?<br />
3. can I make something with it?<br />
4. can I make something with it eventually?<br />
5. should I just sell it?<br />

My characters all now leave an amazing amount of stuff rotting on mobs. Not anymore. I'm going to be in the &quot;go through its pockets and shave the fuzz&quot; mode.<br />

This server has got me seriously thinking about things. while i have only been playing 3 years on Xegony I did go to PvP diety on it's launch and had some good fun playing their and stuggling against the masses as a WE Druid doing jc of all things!<br />
<br />
I would be very interested in joining you. I'm just having a hard time deciding on what to start and what trade skills to work. Of course having the serious trade skillers in one place would certainly help us all establish a firm economy and a basis of support.<br />
<br />
I like playing melee over casters it has to be said but I have 2 boxes available so I could have a bot. So while my choices are pally either Dorf or HIE (no HIE smiths stepping forward correct?), sk  DE (smithing again), ranger (WE for fletching) or Human bard (again smithing...). Most likely to go for a shaman on the 2nd account..not sure i want to do alchemy though.<br />
<br />
Getting more and more excited about the prospect. Of course the thing about this server is maxing stilsl for trade skilsl will be very hard...no kei in nexus, no cheap gear in bazaar. Enchanters will be a must for stat jewellry.<br />
<br />
Once we own the economy we can pay to be PL'd to 60!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly for me the main reason I wanted to have the guild is so that we can all communicate with /gu.<br />
<br />
Makes it a ton easier to get together to help eachother level and also to help eachother gather tradeskill ingredients.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't want anyone actually telling people what to do, as this isn't completely structured :).<br />
<br />
The only &quot;rule&quot; I'd want in the guild would be that charging for tradeskill combines within it is forbidden... and as the only enchanter to post yet, that will extend to me enchanting all the pearls and poison vials you can afford to give me starting out ;).  The only problem there is the time it'll take at low levels unbuffed to enchant a few stacks.<br />
<br />
At this point we are just waiting on a name, it can be anything, Denmom so far hasn't said yes or no on using hers.</div></div><hr />

When i clicked this link, i was like, eh, another server means another charactor i have to think about, time away from my main... but the more time i spend away from sullon, the more i.... dislike sullon.... most of the time you can't even PLAY. you have to worry about pkers, and where's my corpse and who's camping it, etc. <br />
<br />
So, this won't be pvp, will it? ^_^<br />
<br />
I so want it, i just hope i can. <br />
I'll be anything but a rogue. or ranger or SK or paladin. not sure why, just have no desire. <br />
<br />
I'll be whatever is relatively needed. what could i be... <br />
bard, <br />
beastlord, <br />
cleric (i have a couple already, but i'm not adverse to another), <br />
druid (see cleric), <br />
any INT caster, <br />
monk (see cleric), <br />
shaman,<br />
warrior. <br />
<br />
race? <br />
not a human unless there's no way around it, they're just so plain.<br />
erudite if int caster if possible, or else high elf if int caster.<br />
high elf if cleric<br />
wood elf? been that too much, tho.<br />
DE? neriak makes me carsick, lol. <br />
barbarian... they run slow, but barb-lords are nifty.<br />
iksar if monk, regen rocks. <br />
oooo if gnome i could tinker!!!<br />
dwarf? depends. seems like other races would haev better stats.<br />
frog, see dwarf. <br />
halfling, if druid... tailoring... <br />
no troll or ogre. wis/int too low for tradeskills, cultural limited. <br />

The key to having a long lasting, respectable, friendly guild is the leadership.  There must be strong leadership that will make sure there are standards of behavior for members, and will enforce those standards as necessary.  (No KSing, no flaming, no cheating, etc.)  <br />
<br />
There must also be a very clear policy for loot.  As I see it, loot is the number one cause of death among guilds.  Even if you don't plan to raid a lot, or not for a while till people get some levels, set up the rules NOW.  They can be changed later if need be.  If it gets put off entirely till later, the first time it becomes an issue can be the death of the guild.  <br />
<br />
A council of leaders can work if those people are very close and have a lot of trust and respect for one another.  But ideally, there should be a single leader who has the last word on everything, for those issues where the council can't agree or there are complaints about the council itself.  <br />
<br />
Of course these are just my recommendations.  But I really hate seeing good guilds go under due to a lack of leadership.  I cannot emphasize enough how important this is, especially in guilds with more than just a handful or two of members.  It could make or break you.  <br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galathnor</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too would also like to make a new character and join the new tradeskill guild. I would not care to be an officer unless necessary, as I am an officer in my guild now, and that takes a fair amount of my time. I am not sure just what class or race to try, I have been almost every class/race combo available and do prefer a casting class of some sort. Also as far as a starting tradeskill, I would like to do either baking or brewing. <br />
<br />
Please let me know how this goes. I am getting very excited. I have been playing on Povar now for over 3 years and am really looking forward to getting to know some of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delfontes</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the heads up Verdandi....<br />
<br />
I may be Naieve (even if I can't spell it), but I think that is a bit drastic there.  <br />
<br />
My current guild has around 40 active players, with very seldom more than 15 on at once.  We are a family, loot is basically CAWU, and if no one there CAWU it is FFA, never had any problems with it.  We know that we aren't on a raid to Twink our alts, and accept FFA even if our lvl 30 druid could use the item etc.  Some loot goes to guild vault/peri fund, but if anyone expresses an interest in an item no one else wants, it isn't a big deal at all.<br />
<br />
We have done well with that, and are in Tier 3 zones, Tactics/HoH etc... with our friends and allies we may break into planes someday, but not someday soon.<br />
<br />
Maybe if at some point this evolves into a large distant guild it will need a &quot;council&quot;, and to award &quot;points&quot; to people who participate in raids etc.  but to me that just seems petty.  <br />
<br />
If it devolves into something where we need to point to a &quot;rule book&quot; for basic common courtesy, it wouldn't be a guild I'd want to be a part of any longer.<br />
<br />
P.S. Another post sneaked in while I was making this ;).  I will be able to tinker, but I don't imagine we will have BD's enough to make a corking device for at least a couple months... a brewer would be good to have, but I think QAT will be the only thing we could make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EnfinitiStarr8</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, like I said to DenMom<br />
<br />
HERE (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=7077) I see this guild as a FAMILY guild first who all likes to do serous Tradeskills with raids later on in life to help people get tradeskill items and level up/explore.<br />
<br />
If one person does not want to be the leader then I was thinking of maybe doing a dual leadership with Quinner Sparrowhawk if Quinn does not mind. BUT...I also agree with Verdandi about the ONE Leader and a high council of elders. The council should be 12 with one more for the &quot;leader.&quot; The only reason I picked 13 total for the council is there are 12 tradeskills, Baking, Brewing, Fletching, Tailoring, Smithng, Jewelry Craft, Pottery, Poison Making, Tinkering, Alchemy, Spell Research and Fishing. The council member does not have to be a GM and should have a fair (Not supreme) knowledge of it; also they should be the collected voice for that sec of the guild. 13 officer’s mean there is no tie on a vote, and also the one leader has the last word, period. This is a little larger then I originally wanted the council but it should still work. (If anyone was a Babylon 5 fan think the Membarrie (sp?) Grey Council and that’s what I’m going for.) To start there can be a pre-selected council and then we can have a vote to see who should remain on the council. The council will hold for a few months and then voted on again, time TBA for revotes and all that. <br />
<br />
Also, the council will be the &quot;Elder Officers&quot; but there will be other Officers in the guild to help manage raids, items, looting, recruiting and other such items. As with any guild, the officers can not be every other person but we will try and maintain a healthy following for ease and fun. Remember people, this is a game for fun and we like doing this stuff.<br />
<br />
Also, once the council is decided we should and will form the rules of our order. I do not want to start the application process until DenMom says yay or nay to the idea of the name.<br />
<br />
So, brothers, sisters, who is with me? Who shall venture forth into this new world? Who will stand at my side and who will serve with me on the council? Let me hear you proclaim it! We are DenMom's Children!<br />
<br />
P.S. I originally stated that I was thinking of playing a Wood Elf Druid and use Cultural Tailoring and Fletching but I have always played a Hybrid (Ranger [Main], Beast Lord, Pally, SK) so I was thinking of maybe a BL again, maybe Iksar? Druids are fun but I don’t know how to really play one. Or should I just say this is the time to learn? <br />
<br />
NOTE: Edited to rework the council idea.</div></div><hr />

/agree about Research as tradeskill. ^_^ (esp if i end up being an int caster, which i'm not familiar with. ^_^ )<br />
<br />
Presuming I am in the country when NewServer goes live, I offer myself up as candidate for officorial position, should need arise. (As credentials I offer that I am currently leader of AWL on sullon.) Inasmuch instant direct leadership, rather, i am good at managing things. (noo! not the dreaded 'middle management' term! ^_^) Item flow, who wants what, etc. At least, *I* think i'm good at it..... ^_^<br />
<br />
<br />
Enfiniti - I am rather partial to the idea of a council, but here are my thoughts, just for... more thinking. ^_^ <br />
A) Council positions should not be totally-permanent, <br />
B) Officer opportunities should extend beyond Councilship, <br />
C) A given Council member should understand that just because she is Council-JC (for example) does not mean her word is be-all-end-all for anything in the guild regarding JC. <br />
<br />
But the idea of a Council with one person as the quasi-temporary head of, say, Pottery, is rather a good idea. There's always someone you can go to who will most probably know the answer to your question. Someone who will always know what to do with such-and-such an item. <br />
<br />
And it doesn't strike me that a lot of people here would come into conflict with ideas along the lines of that; we're generally pretty nice people here. But it's still good to set out guidelines, etc etc, in the beginning. <br />
<br />
You know, sometimes I wish there were a part of the boards here that were organized in less of a direct linear fashion, and more like those older-style BBS boards, where you could have one sub thread of 'post here if you want to be such and such a class' or 'post here if you want to be considered for officer-something' or the like. <br />

<br />
Actually all kidding aside I have a level 30 druid/twink, and the learning curve isn't as bad as you'd think.<br />
<br />
Basically grouping with friends I'd put a thorncoat on the tank, then snare what they are fighting, dot it, and if I had extra mana I'd throw in an occasional nuke.  Then sit back and enjoy the fight, under level 20 you might get in there to melee a bit just so you get the skill up, and actually do a bit of damage.<br />
<br />
Druids don't get many buffs, not nearly what shamen do, so you will need to keep sows/str/ac buffs fresh, not too much of a problem.  If we have a cleric with us the same level all of the AC buffs are overwritten at the same level, twas annoying for me, felt useless a bit ;).<br />
<br />
Anyhow, choose what you like, any group of 6 at that level, so long as someone can heal, will grow quickly.  We might even level in SolA in our late teens to mid 20's to get away from the crowd in Paludal, and get LOTS of FS/Ore/gems for skills, early cashflow.</div></div><hr />

Like it doesn't make sense to me to start dark elf smithing until you are killing shadowmen and elves en masse and have a large supply of needed stuff.<br />
<br />
I've nickel and dimed it on a newer server before, its not fun and kind of backwards. Other people pass you buy and they just eventually buy their way to making stuff.<br />
<br />
Not sure if even something like backpacks are a good idea, people bought them for storage on tribunal when I was small there, now you have trader satchels instead for bank storage. Hmm.. one plat or 50 plat or more from a player?</div></div><hr />

Right now I play a HIE mage doing all trades, I'd consider an enchanter of some kind to make some of the trades easier, and I don't have a *favorite* trade, but I guess I'm partial to brewing.<br />

Classes(in order of desire): Magician, Druid, Enchanter<br />
Races(in order of desire): High Elf, Wood Elf<br />

It's offical from her, now we have to start the guild process. I can or if we decide on the &quot;One true leader&quot; they can do it.<br />

Also, I think I am going to give the Wood Elf Druid a try, work on Fletching and Tailoring. Also like I said I have an easier root to the 160s in Smithing. And I was thinking, it's going to be odd to be UBER with Breeze on me.....(/cry no KEI for 3+ hours)</div></div><hr />

Other people will outlevel you and then use their greater resources to power right past you in tradeskills.  That 'levels before everything' strategy actually works.<br />
<br />
There used to be a truism that the fastest way to raise tailoring was to first level a necromancer to 50, then use it to gather supplies, then start combining.  People said that for a very good reason... and there's a reason why they chose that specific level, never saying level 49 or 47 or 29 instead of 50.<br />
<br />
You need to think about levels before trades if you want to be included in the market economy at all, let alone have near-monopolies in the early days.  There are some things that are useful early on... banded armor, wisdom jewelry, a few others, but you have to have a plan if you really want to market them.<br />
<br />
A few other things learned over the years<br />
<br />
1. Do you plan to break the EULA and use the shout and ooc channels to sell your stuff?  If not you'll be at a significant disadvantage.<br />
<br />
2. Do you plan to have extra accounts to keep a trader (or several) up 24 hours a day to sell your stuff, and stuff from your other guildmates?<br />
<br />
3. Do you plan to break the EULA and share account passwords so that you can level up a few characters 24 hours a day, then use them to powerlevel others?  If not you'll be at a HUGE disadvantage.<br />
<br />
4. (removed.  We won;t talk about exploits}<br />
<br />
5. Do you know other powerleveling techniques?  How about spots where mobs respawn instantly, so you never have to have even one minute of downtime?  When it's faster to die (and reappear with full mana) than to try to survive?<br />
<br />
6. Do you know any good spots to use pathing exploits?  Do you have rogues ready to pickpocket mobs that other groups are fighting?  Do you have monks prepared to create trains in crowded zones?  If not, nobody in your guild will get to xp in any of the best spots.<br />
<br />
7. {Lets leave SOE out of it too...}<br />
<br />
Ok ok, I could go on and on, but let's forget all that competitive crap and assume you're going to me a more friendly, for-fun sort of guild, and you'll start trades even before level 10.<br />
<br />
A. Do you know which newbie zones give the most platinum per hour?  If you haven't tried them in the last six months you don't... it's a much different situation that it was years ago.<br />
<br />
B. BTW, I think there's more than 12 tradeskills.  Take research for instance enchanter research and magician research are almost totally seperate, with hardly any recipes in common.  An enchanter with high research can't make any magician spells at all.  Also woodelf fletchers can make various useful items that other GM fletchers can't... it's not even like cultural armor, where other races make different but equivelent items.<br />
<br />
C. Your guild will have many different levels of characters.  Is it even possible to treat them all equitably?  How much help will the slower players expect -- powerleveling, hand-me-down armor, a few trade supplies, or just advice?<br />
<br />
D. Suppose you have three tailors, all offering free combines to the guild for skillups.  Will only the one with highest skill get all the business (raising him even further ahead), or will they all be helped equally?<br />
<br />
E.  Will trade supplies be traded (or sold) mostly person-to-person, or will you try to set up a guild banker to collect and distribute everything?  If the latter, what punishment will be given to those who don't use the guild banker, or use it only some of the time?  In any case... if someone uses the guild's supply of spider silk to skill up, how much of the profit from selling that armor in bazaar do they get to keep?  And what of future profits they make from higher-skill items?<br />
<br />
F. What will you do when two guildmembers get in a pricewar and start undercutting eachother in the bazaar?<br />
<br />
G. Suppose a few groups who play with eachother often outlevel the rest of you (in part because they always have a group -- with eachother), and mostly chat with eachother, and mostly trade supplies and loot with eachother, having no interest in grouping with the rest of you.  Would you care?  What if they got a few skills up and then left the guild... then would you care?<br />
<br />
H. What if some of your folks want to level-then-skill (with some specific level as their goal), while others want to dabble in both?  What if some folks want to do raids and others don't?  Differences in playstyle never resolve themselves.  The guild will either split in half, or certain folks will leave the guild one by one.<br />
<br />
That last one is most important.  You all want to start fresh but you probably don't all have exactly the same thing in mind.  There will, at a minimum, be some politics.  Unless you state very clearly before the server opens which playstyle you support, you'll have a rather large number of people who don't really belong in your guild.  They just assumed that you'd support their playstyle (because all the posts on this thread *seem* to be in agreement) and when you don't, they'll drift away in various fashions, some quietly others rather noisily.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to post repeatedly and be a party pooper, but there really are quite a few pitfalls.  Now's the time to make clear, realistic plans, the more specific the better.  And even consider that you might not all get along (you might, but it's not a given).<br />

How much to charge on a server where (in theory) no one has more than 100p or maybe even 10p on the first day?

she also made the point that whomever flakes out within a month would most probably not return. So yes, opening day would be hellish, but after a while an even keel would be reached..... <br />
<br />
And what about the people who might respond to any '/ooc making new tradeskill guild' calls.... never TSed before, complete and utter 'TS-noob', 'what's a loom, what's a forge', etc, but it just sounded kind of fun.... yeah, first week or so be REAL fun for Leader-person. Unless of course it is being planned to restrict the guild only to people who come here (which is of course unfair), or you must some how prove that you know something about tradeskills (recite a recipe or soemthing) which is not necessarily unfair. DMC could certainly have an entrance exam of a sort, that's not that uncommon. <br />
<br />
Hah. Denmother's Children, abbr DMC. Should a 'faction'ization occur and a split happen, the splinter group might leave and form DNC... Does Not Combine. Okies, sorry, back on track. <br />
<br />
And the people who level fast and then sell the needed components for way too much in /bazaar... and make it too difficult for you to get them yourself... yes, hyper-lvling is possible, ask the 59 druid who's been playing for 2 years on sullon who wants to know why the HELL a froggie cons red to them???<br />
<br />
It is theoretically possible to set up a table of sorts with the common members about who contributed what to guildbank, what sold, how much plat they get in return. A more complicated system would be splitting loot to whom wants/needs it.... and how do you justify 'need'? Does the new halfling tailor need those tufts to gain a little skill, or the older, been around longer, higher halfling tailor need them to make a bag? etc etc. how long would a guild-noob have to be in the guild, what would they have to 'prove', for their percieved need to become important enough to recieve 'guild help'?<br />
<br />
yeah, there's lots of questions that need to be answered. Anyone or most of the 'i want to be leader/officer' people free on saturday noon/afternoonish to hop on and join some channel and hash this out a bit straighter? I am and should be sullon.iroke (unless for an odd reason i am vallon.nolyfe or, for a less-odd reason, mithaniel.clico). <br />
<br />
And if we're going to 'split up' the tradeskills into certain 'factions' like brewing, baking, etc, and include spell research, then i can see how it would be beneficial that the specific INT-casters need their own columns. IE, Mage-Research-Officer shouldn't be expected to keep up with Wizard knowledge. <br />

<br />
<br />
My first EQ character was in made when Velious was live but no Luclin yet. I had only Kunark as expansion from the start. I made an Erudite Necromancer on Vazaelle(where a friend and my brother had started playing) as Necromancer was an interesting class. I played mostly solo because mostly people didnt want necromancer in group. Something like &quot;you can solo&quot;. :p Of course I met good people to group with yes after a while but still mainly soloed. I started tailoring back then and didnt get very far as being a newbie to the game and didnt have resources/knowledge. In the end I got bored when my Necro was at level 31 and was tired of seeing lvl20 people with over 100k twink stuff running around. That was it I stopped playing.<br />
Then after some months I got back in to the game and leveled to 39 and whee it was fun again.<br />
Then I heard Kane Bayle was coming live.... a new server with no transfers for 6 months. Everyone starting from scratch! My friends/brother thought it would be fun to make some chars there are try it out. Originally I was against the idea of losing everything but in the end I made a Halfling Druid to have fun with on Kane Bayle and try to play with different people.<br />
Hours and days passed as I really started to love this new server. :) Even when at start there was over 100 halfing running around in Misty Thicket things calmed down and KB became KB. A low population server.<br />
I joined a guild while grouping in Paludal Caverns and got to know nice people who started from scratch as well...<br />
... and now after a year has passed on Kane Bayle I'm a member of The Celestial Rapture (a hardcore raiding guild), I'm lvl65 with some AA, I have my epic and lot more better stuff from raiding. I never would have guessed I liked raiding every day but it just happened that I met the right kind of people and got really into the game.<br />
<br />
If you are little bored with your old character(s), then do start from scratch on a no-transfer server! It's a wonderful experience!<br />

(I have to admit I have made a hellish twink myself which I hated back in Vazaelle... :P)</div></div><hr />
