Don't worry, the Baking is just as Lackluster.<br />
<br />
Hail, Yet ANOTHER skillup path to the 220 region. (with 5 mana, and 2 Agi!)<br />
<br />
Here's hoping we haven't seen the High-End baking/brewing yet.   Maddoc mentioned that there was some high-end smithed weapon that we haven't even stumbled across the items for yet.<br />
<br />
Maybe Baking and Brewing or will be similar.<br />

There are some decent items, but nothing that will dislodge those Meat Pies from your grasp. :)<br />

:( :cry: :( :cry: <br />

I was sorta hoping for something better than Qeynos Tea or Kaladim's, even a decent alternative. Guess I gotta wait a little longer.</div></div><hr />

This is the most disappointing thing I've read about the new expansion.<br />
<br />
Honestly, the last time we had nice food was PoP.   LoY,  LDoN, and now GoD have passed without anything to make bakers pause and raise an eyebrow.  <br />
<br />
:-(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Myrron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just a friendly reminder to keep civil, despite the disappointment.  Also, we know there will be at least one more expansion for EQ and we know that at least a few developers peep in here from time to time, so try using /feedback in-game and maybe we'll see something nifty tossed our way down the road.  :)  It can't hurt to try feedback.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If anything express disappointment at the leaves being annoying to get. There is, was, still is I guess a gap in the stat drinks section. There just haven't been many drinks to bridge the gap between QAT/Kaladims and um, water. Food has been much more balanced, with a lot more variety to chose from. The new drinks are nice, no it's not uber stat food but it's by no means bad for the people who can't/won't pay a lot for high end food and drink.<br />
<br />
Of course the meats used in the baking sells for enough that it's almost more practical to sell it than use it, the tea leaves seem to go for an average of 300 plat on my server and you'll rarely find more than one up for sale. If I bought supplies, well lets just say those lower level players couldn't afford my teas. Add to that that GoD is not nearly as easy a place to get items from as the components for stronger food and drinks and well... I don't see myself stocking a lot of GoD drinks for a long while. Not any in fact. I'll make 'em for friends if they bring me the pieces but that's it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Carmaris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">At least the bakers got something nice in PoP, Lilosh.  What few decent drinks brewers have have been around since pre-PoP.  And in some respects, those don't compare with the pre-PoP foods--no drinks with +mana/hp.  Well, the GoD ones do, but being just normal drinks and having such low amounts of +hp/mana, they're still not as viable as foods.</div></div><hr />

*nod*  I'm no brewer by trade, but I can understand your point.  :-(<br />
<br />
I guess I just don't see how anyone would think that a 3hp 7 mana snack/drink would help.<br />
<br />
Neither baking nor brewing was in Dire need of a new skillup path.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">People are using some of the new teas as stat food.  Most of the mountain teas I was able to make were given to guild warriors; while 10 hps doesn't help a lot, consider how much people are giving for the 30 hps from the first level of the health enhancement leadership AA, it makes the teas seem downright easy to get.  Though it does help that most people in my guild have improved metabo 3 and are used to force feeding.  I do wish there were something nicer, or at least something with a longer duration, but I'm still working on outfitting my guild with plenty of the new teas for raiding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One of the most underrated AA skills in the game, I'm glad you made note of it. I've never regretted the points spent and often proclaimed it's virtues; it saves a fortune in plat/time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Very much so, I eventually got tired of eatting my bristlebane's party platters by accident if I missed my force feed time by 5 minutes and trained it up to level 3, haven't mistakenly eatten a party platter since then.</div></div><hr />

Then someone in the thread about the teas had this to say about the mountan tea leafes:<br />
<br />
They drop (very rarely) in the deeper in zones like kod`taz etc <br />
<br />
Those 2 statements dont mix very well, it's like saying a rare drop in plane of fire is targeted at lvl 40 players without much pp. ;)<br />
<br />
So a rare drop from a high end zone that results in a 10 hp/mana &quot;drink&quot;, I'd agree that is dissapointing to say the least.</div></div><hr />

This is true.<br />
<br />
With brewing, anyway.     The meat is a common enough fished item in Abysmal, which is any level.<br />
<br />
But having Drinks for lowbies who can't afford 10 plat for a Qeynos Tea drop off of elemental mobs is a great idea.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The new teas are great.  The old drinks with stats are useless to me as I have maxed stats.  The new tea's have 5/10hp that's an actual gain to the most important stat in the game<br />
<br />
HP &gt; all.  <br />
New teas have HP, <br />
therefore new teas &gt; all</div></div><hr />
