<br />
1. the rogue's SVP goes up say, 4 points (but doesnt seem likely) -or-<br />
2. the mob's resistance to poison goes down say, 4 points (ie: Poison Counter +4)<br />
<br />
but it might mean something else entirely...  :oops: Can anyone explain this part of a made-Poisons' effect to a non-rogue. Thanks!  :D</div></div><hr />

A cure spell has to remove that number of &quot;counters&quot; to remove the effect.<br />
<br />
Which poison effect did you see it on, out of curiosity?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnastassja</div><div class="date">04-09-2003, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh duh... now that possibility never even crossed my mind. Thanks Tibis!<br />
<br />
So, would it be safe to assume that the CounterNO. is not very useful information except for perhaps on PvP servers. NPC's are just gonna cast whatever spells are loaded into their arsenal on spawn so it's not like you can count on them to stop to cure the counters. /shrug<br />
<br />
As for the poisons with counters, there seems to be a counter+xNO. on many of them. I've sorta browsed for pattern from what I've catalogued so far and havent found an 'absolute' set formula. Soon as I finish up the records perhaps I can do a sort-function that might make it more obvious and will let ya know (or at least will then have a complete  list of the Poison+CounterNo. I can post for ya). :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tibis</div><div class="date">04-10-2003, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, poisons like Injected Poison V (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1883&amp;source=Live) add poison counters as they're a lasting effect (a DoT in this case).<br />
<br />
The same goes with many cast DoTs, like Venom of the Snake; they add counters as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnastassja</div><div class="date">04-11-2003, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">aye... perhaps what threw me off was finding PC's on other poisons such as Carnivore Mortis (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1844) and other DD's that do not contain a DoT component. <br />
<br />
Also found PC's connected to other debuff-types such as Crippling Peptide (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1869), but after you explained them to me it made sense (ie: multiple casts of a cure-poison type spell despite not being a poison hindrance per se). :D<br />
<br />
Coincidently, have found some of the new L53 poisons have Poison-Counters up to +9!! I bet that is a shaman or cleric's nightmare in the PvP worlds. ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your help in my understanding Poisons, Tibis!!</div></div><hr />

It's hardly a nightmare.  Abolish Poison (CLR/49) removes 36 poison counters.  Pure Blood  (CLR/51 DRU/52) removes 18 poison counters (and disease counters too).  Disenfecting Aura (SHM/52) removes 20 poison counters (and 20 disease counters too).</div></div><hr />
