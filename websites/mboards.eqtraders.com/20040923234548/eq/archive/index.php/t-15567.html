<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>garet allenon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">wyvern hides, tigeraptor hides, and velium. spent a few kpp for all the cobalt cod and drake eggs i needed. enough for 90 combines, and only got 3 skillups. <br />
<br />
am now at 195. <br />
<br />
is this the normal progression at this level? every other tradeskill i've done has had much better skillup rates at this level...and that's been brewing, JC, pottery, smithing, and fletching....does it get ANY easier past 200? <br />
<br />
someone please kindle some hope while i go farm silk for 100 more solstice robes!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tshesebe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well bud, You're not going to like what I have to say, but whereas you might have gotten 3 skill ups in 30 combines, it seems like that might be par for the course.  I just read on the 158+ tailors that the first 1750 serverwide had an average of one skill up per 26.7 combines for the 200-250 run.  I had one notorious run at solstice robes where I was at 199, did something like 67 combines and got ONE skill up.  There are others who have posted here who have made 90 attempts and gotten no skill ups.  <br />
Tailoring can best be described the way that someone once described &quot;the easiest job I ever loved:&quot;   to succeed in tailoring You have to prove you can take a bunch of grief, and maybe give some back in return.  Of course, that's the cleaned up version, but get stubborn &amp; give the random number generator, and maybe several 100k plat later, You'll be another proud 250 GM.<br />
<br />
On a lighter note, on the evening of March 31,  I somehow managed to get 3 skill ups in tailoring (including one right after the other!).  The next night, when driving home from my night class, my car engine locked up &amp; I had to get a tow for my broken down car.  It was the RNG getting revenge in Real Life,  I figure. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In an effort to further blacken your day, I just did 99 combines of Casserole Dishes at 190 Pottery and got 0 skillups. The levels from ~190 to ~220 are generally considred the hell levels in Tradeskills, and will typically not go well.<br />
<br />
My run is uncharacteristically skanky, in my limited experience, but don't expect many freebees in this range... it stinks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mewkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just did 70 attempts at solstice robes and went from 200 to 207, or 10 attempts per skill up (making me extra lucky is I only had one success). That was with 335 int. I'm pretty sure that different items have a different skill up rate. I'd easily belive that the velius stuff could take 60ish combines per skill up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The longest run I ever heard of was 1200+ combines for 1 skill up.<br />
<br />
The longest run I ever had was 1043 combines for 1 skill up in brewing (from 199-200). <br />
<br />
<br />
While it may seem slow it will likely get worse before it gets better. Just keep plugging and eventually you will get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Maisie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">is this the normal progression at this level?  <br />
<br />
yes :boggled:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Leafrat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">enough for 90 combines, and only got 3 skillups.  <br />
<br />
Thats actually very good.  I've seen much worse but I've never seen better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tshesebe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yesterday I had enough components to make a run at 50 tries for solstice robes.  Not only did I NOT get any skill ups, I also had 10 successes at a skill of 207.  :steamed: <br />
<br />
Recently, CSRs have been selling for 350 and less, since there's such a glut on the market.  At this rate,  it'll be soon selling for less than what the chain costs, oh wait...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Originally posted by Maisie <br />
yes :boggled:  <br />
<br />
Every possible outcome of any quantity of combinations versus skillups is NORMAL.<br />
<br />
Please learn how a RNG works. <br />
Random means RANDOM.<br />
Random does NOT mean Average.<br />
Random does NOT mean what you expect.<br />
Random does NOT mean what you want.<br />
Random does not mean anything that anyone can seem to grasp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">190 - 200  is what we tradeskillers call a Hell Level.  Everyone seems to have problems over this stretch.<br />
<br />
Personally i think its a bit early to be doing Velious stuff at your level, but I guess there arnt too many alternatives.<br />
<br />
To make you fell a little better - took me 147 combines (Reinforced acrylia) to get from 192 to 193.</div></div><hr />

you're lucky ... on Torv they're going for 100-150p. :cry: :irked: :steamed:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Marinoni Oakenshield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">On Brell, I have seen Solstice Robes as low as 50 plat, and that particular trader has about 50 for sale. The usual price is about 100 plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Maisie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have bought Solstice Robes off the the NPC merchant for 16pp</div></div><hr />

<br />
So if someone asks if there ratio X is normal, and I say yes, then i am correct ? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Suutar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well, any combination of number of tries vs. number of skillups (barring skillups&gt;tries :) is _possible_, but there's an average value that's _expected_. It's usually more common than the extremes, and frequently gets considered &quot;normal&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Pointee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Tailoring has truely been a test of patience.<br />
<br />
I have been working on Solstice Robes. First 120 combines 1 skillup :/ Ok no biggee I thought...just a bad run.<br />
<br />
Then I had the stellar run of:<br />
<br />
100 combines 1 skillup<br />
121 combines 0 skillups<br />
118 combines 0 skillups<br />
124 combines 1 skillup<br />
176 combines 0 skillups<br />
<br />
After that run, I was a tad bit nuts.  :boggled: <br />
<br />
I put off combines for a while and exp'd for the next week or so to take some of the sting off.<br />
<br />
I saw 89 sacred silks for sale and bought them yesterday. Made one more silk real quick and in 30 combines and got 4 skillups!!!!!!  :) <br />
<br />
So back on the wagon today and did 122 combines and got 6 skillups. At 205 now and feeling a lot better.  :cool: <br />
<br />
Thank god I've been lucky on pottery and elemental bow combines to finance this madness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fufinski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Something to bear in mind is the relationship between Triv level and skill up which I believe has been documented elsewhere in these threads.  Out of my last 90 solstice robe combines at a skill of 193 I got 1 skill up (Triv 335) I then did 20 Excelletn Sabertooth (Triv 216) and got 1 skill up.  After this I did 67 reinforced acrylia (Triv 242) and got 6 skill ups.  In total I have done several hundred CSR and am lucky if I get 1 in 50-60 combines.  I was able to see this effect more clearly when I ddi baking.  At a skill of around 205 I tried MTP (335) and had a horrible skillup rate, I switched to Hales Pies (226) and the skillups came flying in.  I did a few more MTP at 226 and rate was still poor so switched to GoD souffles (252) and the skillup rate improved again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sadly I think arctic wyvern and Tigeraptor are both 335 triv combines so same as CSR which probably means cultural and acrylia reinforced are better options if you can get the bits you need.  Also any other sub 250 stuff you can lay your hands on.</div></div><hr />
