<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm new to Alchemy, and have been reading through the threads.  I haven't found one that lists what zones may be good to hunt in for finding Ingredients to potients.  Are the ingredients we need mainly bought only? Such as Birtward, Genugreek, Jatamasi and such?   I was just curious if anyone had some suggestions on best places to find these, without paying an arm or leg from a vendor.   Thanks<br />

EDIT**  I just read further and found that most of the old information was lost.  I will keep an eye out, for this information as it is re-entered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All of the alchemy ingrediants with the exception of one component for each of the ldon potions, one component for each of the &quot;old world potions&quot;, and the giant toes for the giant toes potions is vendor sold only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are drops in Chardok in the Herbalist area, however the sarnaks drop a random variety. Not at all farmable. Seems like i've looted herbs elsewhere too but we used to live in Chardok near the herbalist, so maybe i'm just remembering those months :D</div></div><hr />
