<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gathrintain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">dont enchant your bars anymore. they now sell back for less than unenchanted. speculation says macroers were abusing it and this nerf went a little too far. not expecting it to be changed back myself. <br />
<br />
How does this effect the over all cost. clearly it cuts down on the time needed, but i need to get JC up without spending more than 10kish.<br />
<br />
Can it still be done?<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nanndas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't know how high you want to go, but I went from 20-181 on approxiamtely 2,500 pp. I only used non-enchanted metals and sold the product back for a slight loss. <br />
It took 1,500pp from 20 - 154 and 1,000pp to get to 181. I stopped at 181 as the RNG wasn't on my side. From 179-181 I had a lot of failures, so I stopped until another day... :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Horanaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, I recently went from zero to 200. This was jsut before GoD launch, so no freebie points for me. I wasn't overly worried about price at the time, mainly because I allowed myself a budget of 10k and no more (I was bored one afternoon before a raid, and decided that since I had decided to do aid grimel, I would knock out some of the skilling up). The point is, I sometimes skipped steps of 2 or 3 points that would have been cheaper in order to buy in bulk, so I'm sure it can be done cheaper than I did.<br />
<br />
I went from 10 to 179 for roughly 2kpp. By skilling with geerlok equipped, I figure I saved a few plat on failures. From 179=200, it cost me roughly 7kpp, mainly because of the  massive number of combines per skill point it took after 179. Losing 2 failure's worth of supplies per stack is a LOT cheaper when it only takes you a stack to gain a point then it is when it takes 3 or 4 stacks per point.<br />
<br />
YMMV though, as I wasn't particularly worried about getting maximum value for my plat.</div></div><hr />
