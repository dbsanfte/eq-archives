<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>NobbinTook</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I've been at around 180-195 tailoring for several months. I finally convinced some Tunare worshipers to make me 3 stacks of imbued emeralds and I go to town. I have 3 gem studded chains and the making for 2 more.<br />
<br />
By the time I get down to my last 5 stacks of tunare swatches, I have gone through 2 of the chains. I send a tell to my Jeweler friend (I'm not in the 1750 club although I am probably close to the 1225 club. :)) asking to do the combines for the other two pieces. He's on a raid. I plow through them. My skill has jumped to 198!<br />
<br />
I do a few more combines and I hit 199!  I tell my fellow tradeskiller &quot;I may be able to hit 201 on this batch! I'm so excited!&quot;<br />
<br />
Wouldn't you believe it. My very next combine resulted in a robe (and no skillup).  I ran around like a maniac looking for anything to combine to get those last 2 skillups. No success.<br />
<br />
I stayed up until almost 1:AM for my friend to finish his raid. He made 2 attempts. One successful chain. I did the last few swatches. No more skill ups.<br />
<br />
I suppose being stuck at 200 would be worse, but I could cry... Anyone want to imbue some emeralds?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Candien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've been stuck at 195 for a while now :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Celestya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Try being stuck at 247.  :(  I'm up over 117 combines now I believe, with no skillup. <br />
Just have to keep plugging away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rennol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">why in the world would you bother? slap a geerlok on and you're maxed.. why anyone goes beyond 240 is beyond me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Optimum1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes. The new tradeskill UI has confirmed all of our wicked assumptions: that 252 is indeed the max mod's skill for any given 250-skill tradeskill. Ergo buy a geerlok, get 240 and stick a fork in ya....ya done!</div></div><hr />

<br />
3  days ago was 195 skill. Got enough materials for 40 cultural robes. At the end, was 199 skill.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, got 3 plains roots, to go with a few of my many concussion swatches. THREE combines, on second one, ding 200.<br />
<br />
RNG swings both ways :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fulminate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was at 199 Baking, up from 191, after having made either 500 or 600 MTPBs.  Well, I wanted to hit 200, but no more, since I dont want to specialize in baking.  So I did all the prep work for another 100 MTPBs, 40 slots of subcomponents, ready to go.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't you know it, the first combine, I got the skill up.  I ended up basically giving away the remaining 99 sets of components...</div></div><hr />
