I have just come from a killing spree in WFP for rat ears, the rats still drop ears, feet, whiskers, tails(rarely), fur, scorched fur, teeth and meat. I did not see any eyes, but those have always been rare as well. Also, after killing many, many skele's not a single bone dropped. many rusty weapons, however. more later as the body count increases. )</div></div><hr />

We didn't have a listing for the skeletons - what exactly are they called?  If you name the rusty weapons they're dropping we could add them as sources for those, too.<br />
<br />
Thanks much!!  I do really, really appreciate it :)</div></div><hr />
