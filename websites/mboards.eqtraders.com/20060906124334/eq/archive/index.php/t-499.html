<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Knek</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You might want to try the caves in Dawnshroud Peaks. Either the rockhoppers or the sambatas will be up.<br />
<br />
You might also want to try Marus Seru, but here you will have to be careful with adds. Might be safer to do it in a group.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sir0die</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm currently leveling there in DSP. I'm a (was 40) 43 shaman, the xp is decent, I've been hunting with a variety of guild members ranging from 40-51, we've had groups of only 4-5 (most of us KEI'ed). We've been killing the sambatas, they drop alot of acryllia. so if  the rock hoppers aren't there, the sambatas are still a decent group xp spot with some financial reward. If you're smithing you can work up a few lvls by making rings and stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lunariel</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 10:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the hopper drops are like this:<br />
Shadeweaver and Hollowshade: LQ, MQ and HQ Rockhopper Hides.<br />
Marus Seru: LQ Rockhopper Hides and Greyhopper Hides only.<br />
Dawnshroud and the other higher zones: Any kind of Rockhopper Hides including Superb and Flawless.<br />
<br />
So Marus Seru is only useful up until 95 where Greyhopper Armor trivials. <br />

I was able to charm solo there in my low 50's as a Druid. But melee classes will need to be grouped in this zone with a slower or a priest until their mid 50's. As a mid 40's melee, a mons letalis rockhopper would make you his girlfriend.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the Sambatas are up you have to fight your way to the bottom of the cave and kill the Tribal Advisor  (40 - 40)<br />
<br />
If the Rock Hoppers are up you have to fight you way to the bottem of the Cave and kill the  An Age Old Rockhopper  (50 - 51)<br />
<br />
Warning, if people are killing one or the other please be polite enough to ask them if they mind if you do this and if you do switch it back for them if you can talk them into it.</div></div><hr />

You really want to fight Sambata Tribal Leader Garn.  His PH is the Sambata Tribal Keeper (Light Blue to me at 58 ).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks,<br />

This is also my question.  Is there someone with experience in Mons Letalis who can tell me if certain types of rockhoppers drop the superb and flawless hides more than others?  <br />
<br />
Also, do the the stonegrabbers here drop iron oxide too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pockets FullOfGold</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have never seen a specific type of Rockhopper have more of a drop ratio than any other type.  Would you get more to drop in Mons Letalis or Scarlet Desert than in Dawnshroud Peaks?  I have no idea.  I do know that at level 59 there are still Dark Blue Rockhoppers in DSP.  Last night while doing some slow hunting in DSP, I had a Flawless drop off of a Green con Rockhopper.<br />

Well, I can't really answer the question for sure but my ranger friend and I duoed in Mons Latalis for hides and we only stayed about 15 mins, during those time we only got up to HQ hides. I would assume that if we hunted more, we would have gotten superb and flawless. I will let you know in the future since we are planning on a longer session. No idea on stonegrabbers.<br />

It was rare I would see anyone else in the zone. I would just make laps of the zone walls killing any Adult or Mature RH I could find. Would usually spend about 2 hours doing this and would usually walk away with a couple flawless and a couple superb for my troubles. Flawless being a bit more common.<br />
<br />
Then I sobered up, and thought wth! am I doing tailoring for? Am on a hiatus (permanent?) from the skill after getting to 169 and was tired of brutalizing myself hehe.<br />
<br />
Good Luck,<br />
