<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Smartheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a wizard researcher on Saryrn server and I have been making and selling every wizard, cleric, druid and shaman spell on which it is possible to make a profit buying spell parts in Bazaar. There are 163 spell components I try to keep in stock.<br />
<br />
My observation is that sales are slowing and prices of spells and spell components are dropping on Saryrn - the Law of Supply and Demand is firmly at work. Even spells made from rare parts - like Torpor and Remove Greater Curse are always available at lower and lower prices.<br />
<br />
My thoughts are:<br />
<br />
1. The majority of toons are level 65 and most have bought any missing spells - although I still sell a Levitation almost every day<br />
<br />
2. There are not many toons level 50 - 60 meaning low demand<br />
<br />
Is Saryrn similar to other servers? Are volumes and prices dropping?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No.  Many people on Xegony sell research bits for LDoN cash (or otherwise) since so many mobs drop little cash now.  In fact, tonight, out of two 60+ LDoN, we had two mobs with pure cash - one for 20pp10g, and the other for 8 silver.  I looted both when the regular looter was afk... she never got any cash, she said.<br />
<br />
As an example, Torpor still goes for 12+kpp, and even then, you can't find a copy for sale.  RGC is only getting cheaper as people zip through Hard LDoN faster.<br />
<br />
edit:  However, since my group usually consists of the same four people, I make sure all research and tradeskill stuff comes to me pre-selling, assuming the rest of the non-regular group assents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really a problem, if I buy a research component off a merchant for 7pp and sell a spell I made with it for 1000pp instead of 5000pp, I still made a nice profit. :)</div></div><hr />
