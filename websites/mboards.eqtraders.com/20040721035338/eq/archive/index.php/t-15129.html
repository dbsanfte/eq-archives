<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eileah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Before the new UI went into effect I saved up some supplies to make a few PoP combines hoping they would be CanLearn so I could add them to my fav list...<br />
<br />
Last night I made Slarg Stuffed Poppers and recieved the message that I had learned the recipe, but when I did a search it wasn't there (using collasped spit), later I did a Jord Meat Pie combine and again recieved the message that I had learned that recipe, but again it did not show up in a search.<br />
<br />
I /bugged it and put my stuff away but I am very upset about this, I stored up tons of stuff to do combines purely to get the recipes Learned, I am already a 250 baker with spoon so I don't need them for skill ups, just for simplicities sake.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I want to scream :steamed: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Serenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had the same issue at first with my 250 baker.  For whatever reason, the collapsibles aren't flagged properly for PoP combines.   Go to PoK and use the Tanaan oven, and you'll find your learned recipes.  Rather inconvenient until fixed, but a known issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eileah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks =)<br />
<br />
I will try to get to PoK and see if they work there, really sucks having to do that since I have been keeping all of my toons in GoD and the trip there sucks.<br />

Wish the port spells took you to Abysmal Sea instead of Natimbi.</div></div><hr />
