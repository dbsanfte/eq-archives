<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ancarett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I didn't think this would happen. Almost two years back my husband got tired of EQ and we made the switch to DAoC. Grandmastered two trades in that game during that time, had fun but. . . he became bored with DAoC and now we're back in EQ.<br />
<br />
I've casually followed EQ tradeskills during my hiatus by keeping this site in my bookmarks and visiting at least once a month. I know, however, that I'm woefully behind the times. We quit before PoP and just learning our way around PoK took me a while.<br />
<br />
Anyway, nothing exciting, but I thought I'd let you know that you have one more rusty old tradeskiller back and levelling up her skills! ;)</div></div><hr />
