<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>remydelebeau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone been getting a DNC on making powdered granite?  I tried the 3 pieces of chips of granite in a mortar and pestle and a collapsed mortar and pestle.  Also, I tried to combine two earth silks into a swatch in the loom in pok and it didn't work.  It only worked once I bought the planar tool kit to do the combine.  I'll go try a few more times, but this is weird, or maybe I have missed something obviously new in the latest updates.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The old combines where anyone coudl do in a mortar and pestle are now done in a mixing bowl. Its been verified the powdered granite works in the mixing bowl now. Also one of the looms in PoK (the one near the door) has been linked to only doing non-PoP combines. It seems only the one up the stairs is a true tanaan loom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mocean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are two looms on the bottom, one will do pop combines, the other won't. I did a ton of ethereal swatches last night on that loom. I can't remember which it is but if you're strapped for loom access and someone's using the other, you *can* use one of the bottom ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the reminder on this.  Will tackle fixing the powdered recipes in the morning.<br />
<br />
Tonight's patch also *should* fix the issue with the PoK loom that's confuzzled.  {fingers, toes and eyes cross}</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Elfdruidess</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I (non-rogue) have done Powdered Sandstorm Pearl and White Lead *after* the CE-went-to-mixing bowl-patch in Mortar and Pestle and it works fine.<br />
<br />
So some no-fail mortar recipes have been moved and some have not.  Perhaps it'll become more consistent after this patch.</div></div><hr />
