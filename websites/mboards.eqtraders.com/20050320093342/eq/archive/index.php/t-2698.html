It would be a hybrid of Enchanter, Wizard, and Magician available to Barbarians, Ogres, Trolls, and Vah Shir. Would not be as powerful as any of the other Int Casters but would have more versitality. I find it a bit unfair that the Big Races get no sort of Int Caster. (So what if our Int sucks, at least throw us a bone.) This would be for the Big Races the counter-part to the Shaman.  The idea is very rough and needs lots of work and ideas so throw some in here!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe as a suggestion for EQ2?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zyrtryx Conjureblade</div><div class="date">02-27-2003, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking of something along that lines, except the casters have to actually carry physical runes, sort of like ancient Viking types did, and these would be expended as the spells are cast. (So once you run out of runes, you're out of luck until you make more) The runes could be made by anyone using Pottery, but the user would have to enchant them themself (and only that class could use them).  Basically, they'd be a component for casting the spells, like the items used to summon Magician and Enchanter pets.<br />
<br />
To make up for the limitation of needing the runes and the fact that the spells would be weaker, the class should be able to wear either leather class armors or certain robes (Like Robe of Living Fungus or Crystal Covered Shroud, but not Robe of the Oracle, Crystalline (or Blackened Crystalline Robe), etc)  and use Piercing, Bashing, and Thrown weapons. (But not allowed to use shields) Or give them a weak pet that doesn't follow commands like the Enchanter pet, and make it great for soaking up damage but lousy at inflicting damage.<br />
<br />
This class would be limited to classes that don't have Int casters already. And to make up for the fact that Ogres and Trolls would look stupid in robes, any robe they wore would appear to be a shirt, instead.</div></div><hr />

A non-mana using caster class.<br />
<br />
Stackable rune blanks made by pottery or sold by NPCs.<br />
<br />
Different levels of spell would require different qualities of runes.<br />
<br />
Spells are &quot;etch rune of spell&quot;, and summon LORE NO DROP 1 charge expendable &quot;etched rune of spell&quot;, with a right-click spell effect on it.  Higher level &quot;etch greater rune of spell&quot; versions summon multiple charge runes.  The lower and higher level versions are the same item, just more or fewer charges.<br />
<br />
Some runes would have unlimited charges, but be NO RENT.  A rune of continuous flame could act as a right-click DD for constant DPS without having to juggle other runes in and out.<br />
<br />
Etching a rune takes a pretty long period of time for most runes.   The act of etching your rune is analagous to meditating for other classes.<br />
<br />
The Runecaster would travel with backpacks full of well organized runes.  During downtime they would reetch the runes they used.<br />
<br />
Fitting such a class into EQ class balance would be hard.</div></div><hr />
