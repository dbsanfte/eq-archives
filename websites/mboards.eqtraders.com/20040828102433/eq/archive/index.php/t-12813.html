<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tengrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know you all have heard this question before but. Is there a way to make SoW potions for less than 7.2pp each.<br />
<br />
If not I just don't see the point in making them for as low as a 7pp profit for each 10 Dose potion.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your feedback.<br />
<br />
Oh, by the way I'm Triv for SoW pot. and have 154 CHA.<br />
<br />
Thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Saleani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I suspect there are some possibilities for your competition in the bazaar:<br />
1 - folks selling the results for below the cost to produce to offset the cost of skilling up (for example, 10 dose mystical infusion for 20pp).<br />
2 - too many competitors for the market driving the price into the ground.<br />
3 - they cannot do the math.<br />
<br />
To my knowledge there is no way to obtain the stuff to make sow potions other than buying them at the price you are mentioning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arghargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">2.1pp + 2.1pp + 1.05pp for the componants, so 5.25pp per attempt.  Assuming 5% failure rate, this gives a cost of 5.526pp per success.  Not sure where you're getting 7.2pp for your costs (unless vendor prices have changed).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Was wondering the same, always cost me about 55pp over time to make 10 dose SoW potions.  Have prices changed to make Alchemy even less desirable than it already was?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>iasmin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The 7pp price for a 10 dose is way too low. I'd believe it to be mistyped, personally. I've seen them on my server priced for 10pp and known immediately they've been mispriced. I usually send a tell to the seller to see if they're around to reprice the item (because I *know* they sell for more). Now I wouldn'tbe at all surprised if someone accidently priced them at 7pp when they mean 70pp. However, assuming it's just someone offloading potions...Another Easy solution: commit yourself to the plat outlay and derision associated with being a reseller. Go buy those potions up at that cheap price and keep them on your own trader for a higher price. Either you'll continue to make money or they'll raise their prices. Either way you win. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: though it occurs to me now in rereading that you probably meant 7pp profit total... I think the advice still holds in some cases though with an associated increase in the possible negative opinion of your trader being a reseller. I usually price my potions to cover the cost of my failures since I'm level capped right now and I level slowly. Still a 7pp profit doesn't seem like much to account for failures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I routinely see 10-does SoW potions in Bazaar on Bertox for 70pp or even less. Just not worth my time at that point. Frankly, at this point, I only use alchemy to 1) make things like SoW potions and DS potions for my alts, and 2) to make Quintessences for guildmates to use with the clicky Gate neck.<br />
<br />
However, to answer your original question: there is a &quot;possible&quot; way to make them cheaper, but its not worth the effort. There is a mob in the depths of Chardok (I forget his name atm, but its something like Royal Agronomist, or Royal Agriculturist, Royal Herbalist or something silly like that) who drops alchemy components when you kill him. Long ago, I spent some time down there farming the area, and I collected a fair number of the rarer alchemy items from him. I remember that at least some of those were or the SoW potion, too. But as I said, unless you would get exp from bashing there, you are almost certainly spending more time farming per cost of item than you would farming elsewhere for better pp mobs and just buying the components.<br />
<br />
But then, I don't know anyone who tries to actually make money on alchemy. The ROI is terrible, compared to farming almost anywhere.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Alchemy has actually turned a decent profit for me over time.  It's not awesome, nothing like being a GM smith back when cultural armor was the thing to have, but, still, not bad, a nice steady income.</div></div><hr />
