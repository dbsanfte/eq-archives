<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Binkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I moved to another server and lost my learned recipes.  This is only annoying, but I'm wondering if there's a file somewhere in my EQ directory that I can rename to get them back?  Or is this information stored on the server side?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A few patches ago, all recipe information was changed to work from the server only.  (It was originally set to work from a file on the hard disk, but that caused problems every time they patched.)  The information is now stored server-side only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Binkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bleah!  Oh well.  It's an annoyance, but I'll cope.  Thanks for responding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tanker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmmm, you shouldn't have lost your recipes when you moved, unless you moved right before the patch where EVERYONE lost their recipes.  I'll check out the player move code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Binkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No, I moved just a few days ago.  Sunday I think.  Or maybe Monday.  To Stormhammer.<br />
<br />
My necro lost all her learned spell recipes, that was the more annoying loss, and the hardest to fix.<br />
<br />
Thanks for looking into it, it'll be great if nobody else has to put up with this annoyance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jetfire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No, I moved just a few days ago.  Sunday I think.  Or maybe Monday.  To Stormhammer.<br />

I would feedback and /petition it. Send it to Brenlo (and the Tradeskill reps as well). Since saved recipes are so new, it may simply be someone forgot to include that particular table in the Move Character procedure and it will be something that will have to be fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tanker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok, thanx for the heads-up, guys.  Turns out that the tool used to copy characters between servers hasn't been updated recently, so new data added to the PCFile (like the recipes) is not being copied.<br />
<br />
I'm told by the guy who handles that tool that it'll be updated soon. <br />
<br />
As far as restoring the one's you've lost, I'm not sure that will be possible unless you accept a rollback to the time when you transferred (which you probably wouldn't want :irked: ).  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ya know, even though this is something that should never have happened, it is gratifying to have Tanker post and let everyone know what's going on.  Much of the angst in the EQ crowd would dissipate, if only other developers were as forthcoming.</div></div><hr />
