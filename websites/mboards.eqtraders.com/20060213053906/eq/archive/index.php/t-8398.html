I started messing around with a hand-held when someone turned it in last week, and something like that would prove most useful.<br />
<br />
Anyone?</div></div><hr />

Using Web2Doc Beta3 (Freeware) (http://home.netvigator.com/~clarenho/Web2Doc) and pointing at some of the pages here, I was able to come up with a crude but useable .prc file for some of the recipe pages.  <br />

I need to do some more research and see if these can be cleaned up any, but meanwhile, they work.</div></div><hr />

If you could see my desktop -- all the printouts, the maps, the quest info (there's even NON-EQ stuff!) -- you'd understand then.  <br />
<br />
Anything to get a few pounds of paper off the surface!</div></div><hr />

Makes my life easier :)<br />
<br />
edit: like those 3-ring folders, not computer desktop folders, lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
To my left are two 5 drawer file cabinets.  The middle drawer, closest to me, is half full of manilla folders.  I'm constantly pulling some out, putting some back.  However, certain things (like recipes) never get put away.<br />
<br />
Now, ambiant light permitting, I know where to find them at a glance.  <br />
<br />
YMMV<br />
<br />
Come to think of it, this would be a good place to put a list of quest gems, to help determine what is vendor fodder (we were nearly encumbered with all the gem drops in SG the other night.)</div></div><hr />
