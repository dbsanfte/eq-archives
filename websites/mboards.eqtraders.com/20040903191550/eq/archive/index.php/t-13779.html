<br />
Just wanted to say that in using the new tradeskill UI, i've found that if you're missing recipes, all you have to do is Experiment, make one item that you wanted and it will be added to your recipe list as a new recipe...even old ones like for example Misty Thicket Picnic baskets....<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sloee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Trying to find out where you get the Taelosian Tea leaves from?  Not in Natimbi or Abysmal sea, have foraged there quite a bit.  Anyone know?  Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>djerren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, I did some work on the Taelosian Teas tonight, after getting my Grandmaster Brewer's Coerker, i might add :)<br />
<br />
First off, Taelosian Tea leaves are dropped not foraged, as posted in the other thread.  I found some in the snpools zone, off of what mob i don't recall.  Others have found them dropping off of tureptas and stonemites in natimbi.   Taelosian Mountain Tea Leaves are reported as dropping in the advanced zones of GoD.  I was unable to find any in the bazaar yet. <br />
<br />
Secondly, the ingredients that are foraged (mint, ginseng, moldy tea leaves, and a handful of tea leaves and twigs) are RARE.  I foraged one handful and one mint in 3 hours spent in natimbi and the hanging gardens (barindu).  That's a bummer, but given that the tea leaves themselves are also rare, it balances out.  Not something to be doing just for the fun of it - I would reccomend just foraging while XPing in the zones.  However I did find some in the bazaar at reasonable prices.  <br />
<br />
Finally, here is one new recipe outcome not yet posted on the brewing recipe board, and three new trivials....<br />
<br />
Taelosian White Tea, trivial 132<br />
<br />
Taelosian Green Mint Tea, cha+3, agi+4, cold/disease+5, hp/mana+5, trivial 156<br />
<br />
Taelosian Green Ginseng Tea, trivial 162<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>djerren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">... had some more fun with tea tonight, two new stats and trivials verified:<br />
<br />
Taelosian Black Mountain Ginseng Tea:<br />
magic item, drink<br />
sta+5, wis+6, hp/mana+10, disease/cold+8<br />
trivial 242<br />
<br />
Taelosian White Mountain Mint Tea:<br />
magic item, drink<br />
cha+5, int+6, hp/mana+10, disease/cold+8<br />
trivial 196<br />
<br />
Also decided to write up a small Tea guide, based on observing the logic progression of stats in these teas ... not all this information is verified.<br />
<br />
Tea Leaves:<br />
Taelosian Tea Leaves: mob drops in beginning GoD zones, such as natimbi, barindu, etc. <br />
<br />
Tealosian Mountain Tea Leaves: mob drops in advanced GoD zones, such as Kod Taz, etc.  <br />
<br />
Place a tea leaf into a brew barrel and hit combine (after being trained by the brewing quests in the abysmal sea) to recieve 1+ quantities of the appropriate type of Tea.<br />
<br />
Basic Teas:<br />
<br />
White Tea: Taelosian (Mountain) Tea + water<br />
int+4(6), cold/disease+5(8), hp/mana+5(10)<br />
<br />
Black Tea: Taelosian (Mountain) Tea + Moldy Tea Leaf + water<br />
changes int to wis<br />
<br />
Green Tea: Taelosian (Mountain) Tea + Handful of Tea Twigs and Leaves + water<br />
changes int to agi<br />
<br />
add Mint to any recipe, and you add cha+3(5)<br />
<br />
add Ginseng to any recipe, and you add sta+3(5)<br />
<br />
Moldy Tea Leaves, Mint, Ginseng, and a Handful of Tea Twigs and Leaves are all foraged, it seems in any of the beginning GoD zones, and possibly in the advanced zones as well.  <br />
<br />
Enjoy :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>DogEye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">tried these recipes in GoD<br />
dwarfen dressing needs 2 dwarfen ales... not 1, the rest is correct<br />
and chocolate milk is a drink not a wistal(bah spelling)wetter... hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Marah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Mountain Tea leaves + Ginseng + Mint + water didn't combine for me =/  Would make a lovely tea tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Xodar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I believe you first have to combine the tea leaves alone in the container to produce tea (if you did the small quest in abysmal sea).  You can also hand the leaves to the quest giver for 2 teas, but the implication is that the more you practice the conversion on your own the better ratio yield you will get per combine.</div></div><hr />

 There are soo many old recipes that never made it in or were passed over from my old notes...I guess too much from one source would make the folks who held dem slots look bad.<br />

I forrage about 2 times as much Tea Oil, as I do anything else, along with the rediculous amount of differing weight meats.</div></div><hr />
