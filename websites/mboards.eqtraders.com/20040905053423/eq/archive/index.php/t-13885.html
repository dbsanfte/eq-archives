<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tweedldum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">New expansion loads of new tradeskill items etc, ERR tinkering, ERR batterys  ERR doesnt seem so at the moment as i thought all recipies were released or am i missing the plot some how? please somebody tell me i am and explain to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not all recipes are in the new UI yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What?  You didn't get the memo about the new Collapsed Forge recipe?  Let's see... Coiled Spring, 6 Folded Metal Sheets, and,  ah..., a partridge in a pear tree? ;)<br />
<br />
We don't know.  If I wasn't attending a convention this weekend (darn this social life!), my tinker would try doing the quests the tinkering merchants talk about to try to learn about new recipes.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, we will be able to tinker more than batteries with this new Dark Matter stuff.  After all, it powers spaceships on Futurama! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh. I thought the dark matter was to tinker our own universe in a bottle. You mean the expansion wasn't called GoD because of that? :p<br />
<br />
Figure there's gotta be some more stuff, just a darned big boat with a darned lot of people to hail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>baldev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually I was making Grobb Liquid meat today and it was the first time I had tried it with the new UI trade skill window. The link was not there. So I did one combine and then searched again. The link showed up!<br />
<br />
So, if you are missing some recipies, do a combine that is in a triv range for that item and search again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>tweedldum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sorry thanks for replys but as brodybeard spotted i wasnt taliking about missing from the new UI i was talking about missing from game tinkering seems to have had no usefull or fun new recipies with the expansion and as i presume all recipies have been released(even if not showing in UI) then it all seems rather sadly dissapointing unless i am missing lots of new recipies as all i know of are batterys and a  couple of non working or findable items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gnormy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I suspect there will be a fair number of new recipes that will be exposed as progess is made on the storyline.  Compare with PoP where the Bucket, WoK and Crab Cracker were discovered well after the release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sennes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hold on. Bucket?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Doremi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Originally posted by Sennes <br />
Hold on. Bucket?  <br />
http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=5307&amp;menustr=035000000000</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Originally posted by Sennes <br />
Hold on. Bucket? The bucket is an smithing tradeskill item, which is used to &quot;bake&quot; a Bucket of Crab Legs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Budrick_Drinal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I came here looking for a reason to this as well/<br />
Currently GoD tinkering leaves a lot to be desired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gnomtrix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeh, not taking anything away from the other skillers, pleased they got so many new recipes.<br />
<br />
Just dissapointed than in two expansions running, tinkering seems to have been left to one side.<br />
<br />
Mana battery combines are cute - but .............</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Think that's bad, pottery hasn't had anything new since PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>windkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">WTS stacks of 20 class 3 mana batteries PST. <br />
<br />
P.S. please hurry they are selling like hotcakes.</div></div><hr />
