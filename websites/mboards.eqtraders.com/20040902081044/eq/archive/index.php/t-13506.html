<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lilsneezy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">From what I have gathered so far on the new berserker class, it seems to me that they are going to be an amped up warrior that can not wear plate.  So if this assumption is close to correct and the highest snithed armor they can wear is chain, what do you think the most sought after smithed chain will be?  <br />
<br />
I think starting out the fashionable beserker twink will be wearing Gothic ringmail until the 51st  level and then going to Tae Ew chain for a while.  This is assuming that he wants to be fashionable and help his local smith out.<br />
<br />
What do you think?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nepper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm expecting to see quite a few new chain items/recepies released on 10 Feb, so it's hard to say!  But that's just my guess...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dwiz_VS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Im hoarding swamp/granite tempers atm. Gonna mix the LDON chain in with acrylia and maybe some seafarer's ringmail once I know the races allowed to berserk. I figure the Tae ew market will firm up a little too, but Im not gonna go mad on it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Looking at the official release on The Berserker class it would appear that they will need Str, Sta and Dex (for ranged attacks). So I think that they will be competing with the Rogues/Rangers for Chain armor. I think that Swamp and Gothic would be a good choice possibly do the Acrylia Chain BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sylphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Crafted chain is tricky.<br />
<br />
Take, for example, Hurricane Chain.  Both sleeves and tunic have good stats.  However, the tunic has to compete with Crypt Robber's Chestplate with roughly the same stats and no required level for one tenth the price.  Sleeves have no such competition, not even Tae Ew is as good.<br />
<br />
Recommended levels probably won't matter much to twinks... they intend to level fast and grow into the armor, but required levels are a big problem.  That will effectively kill the Tew Ew market.  HP and Str are bound to be the favorite stats, unless dex proves to be as important for throwing as for archery.<br />
<br />
Rangers won't pay much for gloves and helm because there are some common drops with great stats for under 100 plat.  Berserkers can't wear those ranger-only items so they should buy yours... but it will be an uphill battle at first because gloves/helm prices have been depressed for awhile now.<br />
<br />
But... I don't mean to be pessimistic.  Overall, the addition of berzerkers can be nothing but good for the chainmail market.</div></div><hr />
