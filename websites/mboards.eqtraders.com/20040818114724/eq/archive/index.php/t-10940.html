<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DaariAyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm not seeing a post over the quest to get the research book.  I see only the wizard's lexicon actually says it's a result of a quest, but the others have no info.<br />
<br />
Now I know people have them.  Anyone want to share how to get those?   Looking specifically for the phantasmal tome, myself.  thanks for any clues  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go to the Gulf of Gunthak.<br />
<br />
Find Research Alvaro (or something similar, starting with A), and hail him.<br />
<br />
Then say &quot;I am an enchanter&quot;  (Or, if you're on a different caster character &quot;I am a wizard&quot;, or whatever..)<br />
<br />
Poof, you have the 8 slot, new research container for your class.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In addition to the above post, which is correct, you must have a research skill over 100 or you will not receive the book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>DaariAyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">oh my, so easy, yet so hard.  Thanks for the help girls.  I do have my research at 163, so that won't be a problem.  I had found the guy's selling stuff that related to research, but didn't think to try to talk them out of one!!  I did hail them, but couldn't get them to say much of anything hehe.   Guess I didn't pay good enough attention to what he said.<br />
<br />
Thanks B)</div></div><hr />
