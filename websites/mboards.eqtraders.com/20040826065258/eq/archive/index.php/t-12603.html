<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I know I have some rather unique emotes I use often.  Now, I'm not talking about something you came up with once but something you use often that is funny or strange or just odd.<br />
<br />
examples:<br />
<br />
/emote hums the theme song for jaws<br />
I'm a monk, so I use that when I go out to pull.  Or I used to until they told me I can't pull anymore because the pally can paci-pull and so can the bard and that's faster than the FD split.<br />
<br />
/emote kicks %t's corpse<br />
used after I land a killing blow on a mob or if our group kills a mob that was particularily annoying.  For example, the mob that kept turning around and attacking me while completly ignoring the pally's stuns or my FDing got it when it died.<br />
<br />
when I am trying to get aggro (as silly as it is for a monk to gain aggro, it's better than the cleric having it) I usually throw in a /point /rude /smack combo on him just to get his attention. Well... that and flying kick/beg/intimidate/disarm/duo wield procs/anything else that is rumored to generate hate.<br />
<br />
/emote farts in %t's general direction<br />
used when I resist a mobs spell, espically an enchie's mez or charm.<br />
<br />
/emote looks around... everyone knows monks can't ML<br />
strange as it may seem, as a monk, I have been asked to ML.  This is my typical response, followed by the explaination that if I get more than 16 wt that my AC starts dropping faster than Fippy at the queynos enterance.<br />
<br />
/emote pulls out a can of whupass<br />
I had started using this one years ago, completly oblivious to the fact that there is a GM given item called 'a can of whupass' that is a one shot right clickable uber-buff that gives the same emote when used.  At one point I was asked by a GM if I was actually using a 'can of whupass' and where I got them from.  I explained that I was from below the mason/dixon line (i.e. southern states in USA) and I loved Redneck Rampage (1st person shooter doom clone).  I think he was checking my inventory and buffs while I was explaining, because he then realized I wasn't using the uber item, I was just being funny.<br />
<br />
/emote cracks his knuckles<br />
used when I decide it's time to get serious, after I found out that pulling out a can of whupass has other implications.<br />
<br />
/emote pulls out his 2X4 with NAILS!!<br />
used when I pull out my 2hb (patchwork jetsam), usually with the /say 'I've got a board, and it's got NAILS, and it's also got YOUR name on it %t'<br />
<br />
/emote 's speed set to PUREE<br />
used when I pull out my 1hb and h2h weapons, or when I get a really cool haste.<br />
<br />
/thank<br />
this is *always* used when someone buffs me if I know who to target, invariably followed by an attempt at donating.  It may be refused, but I *always* try to donate something for their efforts.  I'm not rich, but I support my buffers.<br />
<br />
These are just a few of my funny emotes I use often (being a monk, combat is less button-intensive than for, say, a cleric), if anyone else has some they use, please share them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I always thank too, and my alt druid just hit 14, I'm learning how thankless people can be.:steamed: <br />
<br />
Interesting, I also get set to 'puree' (hi damage, low delay backstabber and sword) on my Rogue..<br />
<br />
I also use /roar and / bite a lot as an Iksar, and I'll also occasionaly use &quot;/em starts to foam at the mouth&quot; when we're about to go into a good battle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moonlilly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My favorite:<br />

<br />
/em kicks %T in the Jimmy!<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
/em Headbuts %T in the Jimmy!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I also saw a halfling once who ran by me with a train behind him. As he ran by he <br />
<br />
/em says Always after me Lucky Charms!<br />
<br />
I about fell outta my chair laughing!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>storywalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only semi-clever emote I ever designed was to practice FD with my monk.<br />
<br />
/em screams in panic and faints dead away<br />
<br />
immediately followed by a human death scream and me falling to the ground.<br />

I enjoyed it, anyway. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I have a few buttons set up.  My favorites:<br />
<br />
As a Halfling cleric, I often get asked for SoW, because everyone assumes that Halflings are all druids.  I set up two of them.  The first, if I'm busy or in a hurry, is:<br />
<br />
/em looks meaningfully at her PLATE breastplate.<br />
(sometimes followed up by casting Shield of Words, since that's the SoW I have...)<br />
<br />
The other, longer one, is:<br />
<br />
/wait 5, /em 's spell fizzles!<br />
/wait 5, /em 's spell fizzles!<br />
/wait 5, /em 's spell fizzles!<br />
/wait 5, /em remembers she's a cleric.<br />
/wait 5, /em remembers that clerics can't cast Spirit of Wolf.<br />
<br />
To get Temperance moochers to leave:<br />
<br />
/wait 5, /em 's spell fizzles!<br />
/wait 5, /em 's spell fizzles!<br />
/wait 5, /em 's spell fizzles!<br />
/wait 5, /em 's spell fizzles!<br />
/say Sorry, out of mana, and I have to run now.  Good luck!<br />
<br />
And once I encountered a beastlord whose hotbuttons said stuff like this:<br />
<br />
/say Get over here, you dumb dog!<br />
/pet follow<br />
<br />
/say Go do something useful, you mangy mutt!  Kill that!<br />
/pet attack on<br />

It doesn't happen as much lately, but there was a period of time when I was frequently asked for SoWs. If they were high enough level to know better, I'd say something like, &quot;wait for my mana to come up,&quot; sit down and emote:<br />
<br />
/em taps his screen<br />
/em taps his screen again<br />

Then I'd apologize and explain that my mana bar must be broken since it hasn't risen in XX levels.<br />
