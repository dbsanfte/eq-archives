<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sindarea</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if I can ever find low quality pelts, I am rapidly climbing the ranks of the Khati Sha. My concern, however, is the Sonic Wolfbane (http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/luclin_sonicwolfbane.htm) part of the quest which requires a player made item from each of the classes: <br />
<br />
Beastlords must create toughened sinew lashings. First ask Jhimis &quot;what about stretching dowels?&quot;, and he will ask for 2 owlbear claws and your apprentice cloak. Give him the claws and the cloak, and he will return your cloak, and give you the no drop stretching dowel. Combine stretching dowel, owlbear tendons, sonic wolf tendons, kelp salts and fish oil soaked rags in any sewing kit to create toughened sinew lashings. Trivial for the combine is 135 tailoring. Owlbear tendons drop in Hollowshade Moor off the owlbear cubs and grapplers. Sonic wolf tendons appear to drop off any wandering sonic wolf in Hollowshade Moor. Kelp salts drop off the moor tortoises in Hollowshade Moor. Fish oil soaked rags are dropped off the grimling fisherman (and their chief), also in Hollowshade Moor. <br />
<br />
Rogues must bake the sonic wolf bane poison. This requires: salass moss, tortoise saliva, sonic wolf blood, poison dart felt. Mix in these items in a no drop acrylia mortar &amp; pestle. Combine the results with a posion vial and water in an oven. The digested salass moss is dropped off owlbear cubs and grapplers in Hollowshade Moor. The sonic wolf blood can drop off any wandering sonic wolf in Hollowshade Moor. The poison dart felts are dropped off the grimling spiritists in Hollowshade Moor. Toroise saliva is dropped off moor tortoises in, yep, you guessed it, Hollowshade Moor! <br />
<br />
Shaman must brew a reactive sealant soak. This is done by combining blackened salt crystals, sonic wolf brain, crystalized ygri root, digested night palm, a water flask, and a ceremonial strainer (no drop) in a brew barrel. The blackened salt crystals are dropped off grimling mystics in Hollowshade Moor. Sonic wolf brain can be dropped by any wandering sonic wolf in Hollowshade Moor. Crystalized ygri root is a ground spawn near the sonic wolf caves in Hollowshade Moor. Digested night palm drops off the owlbear cubs in Hollowshade Moor. <br />
<br />
Warriors must smith a porous dagger or claw blade (based upon which class is receiving the final weapon). This requires bag of white sand (no drop), powered wolf claws (no drop), sonic wolf blood (no drop), chunk of porous ore, water flask, and either a blade mold or a claw mold, depending on which item you are making. The chunk of porous ore is a ground spawn in Hollowshade Moor, reported to be &quot;just before the bridge&quot; in Hollowshade Moor, &quot;left over the hill&quot;. The white sand drops off grimling fishermen and grimling mystics in Hollowshade Moor. Powered wolf claws drop off wandering sonic wolves in Hollowshade, as does the sonic wolf blood. The molds are apparently given by an NPC, and further details are needed. <br />
<br />
Bards mush create the ceramic sleeves using pottery. The ingredients are: ashes of dark ritual, flask of water, vial of owlbear bile, sonic wolf blood, black silt clay, sketch (NPC provided). Then fire with a quality firing sheet. (Many more details are needed.) The ashes of dark ritual drop off grimling spiritists in Hollowshade Moor. Owlbear bile is dropped off owlbear cubs and grapplers in Hollowshade. The sonic wolf blood can drop off any wandering sonic wolf in Hollowshade Moor. The black silt clay is an underwater ground spawn in Hollowshade Moor. The sketch is NPC provided, and details are not available on how to obtain it. <br />
<br />
This can be done by races other than Vah Shir, but the Citizenship quest must be MQed and each part MUST be made by the correct class (You will not get the quest if you are not of that class). <br />
<br />
The Sonic Wolfbane weapon you receive is not that great, but this quest must be completed before you can go on to receive your Garrison Officer cloak (complete with a skill mod for the tradeskill of the class) and perhaps even further your rank.<br />
<br />
Personally, I love these quests. They're great, and I have fun doing them. The quest itself, not the reward, is why I am skilling up in tailoring :) I am currently only of Recruit level (almost to Apprentice!) but I would like to get a head start on finding others who are doing this quest. I propose we start a channel on Tunare and encourage those working on the quests to join. My hope is that we can support each other even before (and after) the Sonic Wolfbane part of the quest by forming a bond of Vah Shir tradeskillers. :)[/url]</div></div><hr />
