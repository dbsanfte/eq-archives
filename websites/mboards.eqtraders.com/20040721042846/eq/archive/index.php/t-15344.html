<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kharakid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just finished a round of combines for the Eternal Tempest compound bow for my trader mule.  This was my first attempt at it since the new trade skill UI went live.  I noticed a few things that I am hoping on comments on.  <br />
<br />
First while doing the combines for the stable planar beam I failed on one of my attempts and &quot;poof&quot; there goes my steel working knife!  Grrrrrr, run back to SFG for more steal and back to SH for hilt and dagger mold.  I have attempted these prolly 100 times before, cant tell you if I failed on a combine prior to now or not, you would think that I have.  I have not how ever had to make a new steel working knife prior to today.  Did I miss a change somewhere???  <br />
<br />
Second, I cannot seem to &quot;learn&quot; the fletching sub-combines for the bow, such as the stable planar beam and the well balanced planar beam.  I have to do the combines the old way.  I can however use the new UI for the actual bow.  <br />
<br />
Third, a FYI, at 250 in fletching with GM trophey and max dex I had a 50% success rate on this bow again.  5 out 0f 10 attempts.  Seems about normal from all of my attempts so far.  <br />
<br />
Lastely,  GRRRRR!!! man all the running around to differant vendors and forges and brew barrels is a pain!  lol, youd think that a place geared towards the tradeskiller would have a better layout of vendors and containers.  Having to run around just looking for a vendor for a few water flasks for cripes sake!! smithing vendor for acid for a brewing combine, fletchign vendor for a brewing combine, pottery kiln for a brewing combine.  lol AHHHHHHGGGG! <br />
<br />
O.K., I feel better now! :D</div></div><hr />
