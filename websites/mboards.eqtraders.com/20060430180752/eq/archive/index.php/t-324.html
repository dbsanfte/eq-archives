Its Ogre cultural and I was wondering if it would be worth it to get a few pieces made for my troll shaman. Unfortunately I can't find stats for most of the pieces. Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To my knowledge the Crimson Darksplint pieces dont differ much from Fulvous.<br />
<br />
Sadly most items are not worth the investement in time and components (Blue Diamonds and such) cause you can get similar items (AC, HP-wise) much cheaper in you local bazaar.<br />
<br />
Things i would recommens to take a closer look are bracelets (nice resist gear), mantle and belt.<br />
<br />
I still have no idea why the cultural plate armour is on par to Velious quest armour, but most of the chain items are worse than Velious or do not even compare to Jaundiced.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flabbo McFattyfatfat</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like a good number of the crimson pieces, the boots and helm (better than thurg pieces) are also pieces I would toss in the mix for consideration. I will also be wearing the neckguard most likely, as I get sick as all hell keeping my agility buffed above 75.  With the prices of blue diamonds dropping considerably, if there is a smith on your server capable of making the armor, some of the chain pieces may become more viable.<br />
<br />
Some pieces need to be looked at.  The tunic and leggings really need to be looked at in terms of ac, bumping them to around 38 and 26 ac respectively.<br />
<br />
What particularly gripes me is the massive stat disparity (fulvous armor has more total stats than others), along with idiotic stat placement.  Int on a shaman only armor? Wis on sk armor?  Sheesh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roddotorv</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reason I asked is because a friend of mine does have a smith capable of doing these, would really like to know stats for all slots so i can prioritze what ones I want/am willing to save up for. The plate is pretty much a no brainer, all slots but back and belt are extremely nice for the cost, even if you get 1-2 failures per success. I was already planning on having the bracers made, but not sure if any other slots are even worth trying to make.</div></div><hr />
