<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Emron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Aye, but which vendors?  And do they drop them only after a player has sold them to the vendor, and then you supply the vendor with some coin?  Or do they always seem to have them?<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Blue diamonds are not vendor sold as part of their normal base stock.<br />
<br />
If a vendor has some for sale, its only because some player sold them to that vendor.<br />
<br />
Blue Diamonds are drops only. (Well theres a couple simple quests which *can* get you a BD, but you still have to turn in drops for the attempt).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zazra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">a lot of them drop from gobbie in PoNightmare -- that's a good source or BD, and raw diamonds as well.  I hear the same is to be said of the Nightstalkers -- but don't have personal experience in this.</div></div><hr />

You can turn in ulthork tusks to the otters in CS for gems.  You can turn in planar armor to the Guild trainers in PoK for gems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
cool thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I had ok luck getting them in PoJ on death row. It's about 1 in 4 chance of getting one from turning in Fear/Hate armor, but the plus side to fighting in Hate is that it's ok AA xp and you get a shot at the trophy gems as drops as well as some research items and other goodies. Also I've yet to experience crowding in Hate unlike many other planes, but then I do know a good wizard for rides there. Dulak is an easier place to get them however, although of course not as many side goodies dropping there.<br />
<br />
But my biggest source of BDs is and remains PoT and PoK vendors after a patch or server going down for some other reason. I've farmed maybe a stack or two, but have bought... well enough that I sometimes forget which mule has the latest BD stack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's the deal.  People are continually selling BDs, but only at first server up are they visible.  <br />
<br />
Vendors keep the first items they are sold, and drop off new items.  Some of the first items are always blue diamonds, so you see them to buy.<br />
<br />
After your server has been up 2 days, vendor inventories is full.  When you buy all the blue diamonds off a vendor, it creates a void that gets filled by the next thing that is sold.  All future blue diamonds sold to that vendor go into poofland.<br />
<br />
So after a few people vendor mine, no new blue diamonds will appear until a patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The &quot;for some other reason&quot; part was in reference to servers going down for some other reason than patches =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes, quite right on that. I'm on Xev, which a couple of months or so ago was going down quite a lot for various reasons other than patches. Quite lovely for my usual checking of the vendors. People sell some pretty nice items to them, just gotta catch them before every other tradeskiller with the same idea finds 'em first.</div></div><hr />
