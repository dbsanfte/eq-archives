<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sheshonk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a chanter strapped on cash, but would love the grandmaster item to place in my ranged slot.  Was wondering what tradeskillw ould be cheapest to max out at 250 to make this item.  Also, an estimate on how much cash it would take to get there would be a big help.<br />
<br />
thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqdoctress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Brewing took me ~ 100 plats roughly, maybe 200 plats to 248<br />
<br />
However the trophy will need a corking device.. that's expensive</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Smithing is relatively cheap...if you farm absolutely everything yourself and don't mind taking forever to do it (and losing your sanity in the process). ;)</div></div><hr />

Brewing. Cheap and easy as heck.<br />
<br />
Vendor dive for diamonds and sylvan oak. Buy the other parts for  corkers in pok. Find a nice tinkerer and pay him to combine you some corkers (or give him one of the successes).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Brewing, hands down. I don't recall exactly what it cost, but it was insignificant in the overall scheme of things. You can buy your way to 248 and the last 2 points with Kaladim Constitutionals just require picking up ground spawn in Kaladim.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sheshonk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">All right I got 248 skill in brewing in less than 200p with 214int...w00t<br />
<br />
Bought a corking device for 800p at the bazaar, haven't started putting together the KCs yet.<br />
<br />
Was sad to see that the artisan's seals go for 6.5K at the bazaar :eek:, but took the time to look up the ingredients and saw the highest triv is 16!  So guess i'll get 30ish in jewelcraft and pottery so I can put together a seal myself.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SauriaSoulfarer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">just be careful with the darned corkers...<br />
<br />
I was up late at night and so tired I could hardly keep my eyes open...was selling off some junk and unfortunately I am able to report that with max pricing (indiff+ and CHA 110+) corkers sell to vendors for 1 silver 1 copper.  :boggled:<br />
<br />
The kicker is, it didn't even appear in her stock when I realized what I had done!</div></div><hr />
