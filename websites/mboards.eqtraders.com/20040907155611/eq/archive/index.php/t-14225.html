<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">... I figure this will turn into a rant thread, so might as well start it here and save the mod's the trouble of moving it.<br />
<br />
Okay, so now the window that opens up when I click on Skills button defaults to alphabetical order, as in Barbarian language is near the top right under Baking.<br />
<br />
Okay, I can sort by name, rank and serial number.  So if I sort by skill number, it moved the language skills more toward the bottom of the list where they are out of my way.  But if I camp and come back, the window is back to the default alphabetical sort.<br />
<br />
Were there REALLY EQer's asking for this change?  With all the other issues creating a gaming nightmare, was this REALLY a priority to change?<br />
<br />
I just don't get it ... at all.  And if I typed any more, I would be banned from this board forever :0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Erm...<br />
<br />
Not sure I understand the reasoning behind a change like that. I personally had no problem with the way it was.<br />
<br />
*shrug*<br />
<br />
But I suppose someone MIGHT have asked for the change... for some unknown reason... that escapes me at the moment... and I'll probably never comprehend...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Serenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most likely they had a new programmer on staff who did this change as an easy way to get started in the code.  Modifying software as old as the EQ engine and core programs are is a nightmare when you first come in!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Would have been nice if the Home Room Monitor would have checked the newbie's work and realized that you can't save the sort of your preference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was so used to the 'grouped' order.<br />
<br />
Melee skills<br />
Casting skills<br />
other skills<br />
tradeskill skills<br />
languages<br />
<br />
I was so used to the scroll bar and how far to drag it down to get where i wanted to go....<br />
<br />
was most put out by this new order. :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cantatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The grouped order was perfectly fine with me.  Of course, after 4 1/2 years you become pretty accustomed to the order in which the list was put.  Perhaps they should just add an option to reset the order to default.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/agree Cantatus. /agree /agree /agree /agree <br />
<br />
<br />
thing /f would work in this situation? <br />
<br />
-- Sanna</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naeadiene Needsamap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/agree <br />
<br />
While the old order was never perfect, I was used to it.  I knew where things were.  <br />
<br />
Alphabetitcal has me confused.  lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok, after fiddling with this, I must say I'm absolutely not impressed.<br />
<br />
How bout a little check box that will use the default?<br />
<br />
Would that be hard to code in?<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />
