<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LadyAz</div><div class="date">03-19-2003, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I finally got my 8th prayer shawl last night. YAY!<br />
<br />
Toes, then heads. The baking was a breeze. Finding that distraught coldain and getting jumped by giants. Wolf Whiskers! I did that shawl combine 3 or 4 times before I got it right. And the days in Velks, before the silk was stackable. Once I got the skills I didnt have number 6 for very long. 7 was a very comfortable wear. So comfortable that even though I had skills and supplies for number 8.. I still had to be nudged to finish it.<br />
<br />
I want to thank those who came to help me with the war. Old friends, new friends, and aquaintences. Was told I had nigh unto 7 groups. Overkill? Yes (well it was nice since we ended up with Lodi agro). But they came to support me, and I felt loved.<br />
<br />
So you are wondering why I am posting my thanks here, when many of you may not even know me or have never been involved in any part of my shawl questing. I wanted to thank you to Verdandi for the wonderful write ups she did. Without them and this site and forum, I would have never been able to accomplish the shawls. And now I am helping others. I could have posted it on the general forum but here are our roots. I want to thank her for her time and sacrifice gathering, compiling, posting etc.. so that not just our server community can better themselves but all of Norrath.<br />
<br />
Thanks Verdandi!<br />
&amp;lt;hugs&gt;</div></div><hr />
