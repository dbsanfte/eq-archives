<br />
Okay I understand most of the cultural armor bit...<br />
<br />
Excpet Heraldic Armor....<br />
<br />
As an Ogre following Rallos Zek can I only make Rallos Zek Heraldic Armor or can I make any armor as long as I get a cleric to imbue the stones?  Also do I have to use a special forge, or can Ogre's even do Heraldic, I only find recipe reference in the Qeynos culturl section.<br />
<br />
<br />
Again I apologize in advance about my ignornance on this subject, and I thank those that can answer this for me in advance.</div></div><hr />

Assuming you aren't a Shaman, you can WEAR Rallos Zek Heraldic armor that a human smith has made.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would a Human Agnostic Monk be able to make the Cultural Armor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For making racial armor, the religion of the smith is irrelevant.  The race is the only criteria.  Its only when it comes to imbuing the required gems that religion plays a factor, the imbuer must have the correct religion to cast the correct imbue spell (and be an appropriate class to have the spell to begin with, of course).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Unnone</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe ogres can make their own racial cultural armor, and that it can be rallos zek imbued.  I know for sure that they can imbue for cazic thule... I believe the other imbue they can do is rallos.  Pretty sure Innoruuk cannot be imbued by them, but I could be wrong yet again.  It's called Crimson Darkscale, I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Togaran/Saldawen</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ogers can smith for Inny CT and RZ, just only for other ogers and trolls. As to your question about an agnostic human, yea they can smith any human cultural, they would not be able to wear any of it is all due to class/diety.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps</div></div><hr />
