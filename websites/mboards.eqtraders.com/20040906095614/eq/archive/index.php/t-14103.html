<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>IrrikEndil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK so I heard that Marus Seru is a great place to farm rockhopper hides, so I go there and run around for about half hour and don't see a single greyhopper (and I was the only one in the zone).  Where exactly do they spawn?  I thought I would see at least one, and 15 pelts and hour in Shadeweaver isn't cutting it for me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>oerin trubble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you want rockhoppers? or greyhoppers?<br />
MS is a good place for greyhoppers. Haven't been often enough to say if one part of zone is better than another. But every time i've been thru there i've seen some greyhoppers.<br />
<br />
If you want rockhoppers and the tribe has the cave in DSP try Mons Letalis. Rough terrain and watch out for the stone grabbers but there are plenty of hoppers and faction is different from DSP. They were indifferent to me and were not social. I could be fighting one and another walk right between us and keep going.<br />
<br />
But uhhhh, this is the smithing forum . . .<br />
If you want padding quality hides only Shadeweavers is probably the best bet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fluteria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Greyhoppers are a random spawn throughout the zone.  I farm my LQ pelts for paddings there, and being a mage I just send my pet absolutely everything in sight, to keep the spawn cycle going.  If you didn't see any grey hoppers and were the only one in zone, it could be that someone was farming greyhoppers (only) earlier.  If they were only targeting the greyhoppers, you might not see many up just on sure respawn odds.  What I'd do is start whacking everything in the zone.  Even when I was farming there were times that I noticed a decrease in population and then all of a sudden the whole zone seemed to be filled with them.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.  I've farmed well around 1000 pelts between greyhopper hides and LQ pelts in mseru.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>IrrikEndil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">OK I went back there and the place is swarming with them.  Someone probably was farming them earlier.  Unfortunately I'm only level 32 so I do have some downtime if I get adds (I actually almost died once).  Now I'm getting a lot more pelts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baneluk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Slight corrections<br />
<br />
There are some named hoppers in Mons Letalis (Furious, Raging, etc) that will agro on you, but the good news is that they are lower level than the rest.<br />
<br />
If you are fighting An Adult Rockhopper or A Mature Rockhopper, Rockhoppers will join in the battle against you. Practice careful pulling, and you should be OK.<br />
<br />
If you are fighting A Stonegrabber, A Mature Rockhopper will assist. <br />
<br />
And watch out for the Shiknar Hatchlings...</div></div><hr />
