<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After the patch my armor on my Druid looks like it did 2 years ago before expansions. I have 256RAM but was never a problem till patch.<br />
Then I have a second computer with only 96RAM that I used for buffs when 2-boxing. Well that old computer cannot even access EQ anymore after patch, even though it has Direct X 9.0<br />
***What did Sony change on this patche that caused these problems?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Saleani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dyes seem to be not working for some folks. That might be  another of the things fixed in today's (3/25/2004) patch.<br />
<br />
The new graphics engine went into use with the last patch. Some new collision detection went into place too. Collision detection is where the computer decides that the tree or wall is in the way and won't let you move through it. The new detection makes bards and horses extra slow up and down hills. I think it also gives problems with short races and stairs.<br />
<br />
As for your other computer, may I recommend that you check into the latest drivers for your video card? If the card is an intel chip, it should get fixed (or less broken) in today's (3/25/2004) patch. The intel chipset is very inexpensive and is frequently built into most mother boards. However, it is not on the supported video card list. If you have an intel card, may I recommend putting a few bucks a month into a jar for a replacement card?<br />

Check out the tech support forum (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board?board.id=tech) <br />

815 chipset (http://downloadfinder.intel.com/scripts-df/Product_Filter.asp?ProductID=797) <br />
<br />
810 chipset (http://downloadfinder.intel.com/scripts-df/Product_Filter.asp?ProductID=798) <br />

Some people are on very tight budgets, I know I was on one like that for the last year (being unemployed for 12 of the last 14 months). A $40 video card may be out of reach for some people. It would have been the difference between eating or going hungry for almost 2 weeks during my unemployed period. When Luclin came out, my existing computers at that time were unable to display the graphics, so I bought a video card that was near top of the line (as well as being on the supported hardware list). That same video card is near the bottom of the supported list, and has been placed in my latest computer.</div></div><hr />

I have a Compaq Presario with windows 98.</div></div><hr />
