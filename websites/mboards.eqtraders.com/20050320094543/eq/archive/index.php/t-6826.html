I just need to get one more patella for the sleeves.  Then I will be one green druid... It isn't easy being green (in the voice of kermit)  :) <br />
<br />
By the time I get it, I should be level 11.  I have looked at EQAtlas, and see that I can get experience in Misty Thicket up to about level 15ish.  What would be your recommendation as to where to go a) either once I finish my armour quest, or b) once I am no longer getting experience in Misty Thicket?<br />
<br />
I have also gotten to skill level 15 in tailoring doing silk threads and swatches.  Should my next steps be Patchwork, padding, then raw silk?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or going to the new server that doesn't allow transfers, and be among thousands at your level before getting too far.</div></div><hr />

Patchwork is very good.<br />
Padding is VERY GOOD.  (Either sell it in the bazaar, or send a tell to me, and I will buy it from you).<br />
Raw Silk is ok.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rewde</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I do have Luclin.  I will check out EQAtlas to see how to get there, to Paludal, as I know how to get to the Nexus, and Bazaar.<br />
<br />
As for the tailoring, I was just looking at the most likely way to go to increase my skill.  In the recipie page it has patchwork trivial at 26, padding at 31, and raw silk at 36.  I thought that this would be the best route to go.<br />
<br />
And, Lilosh, with the exception of my first 2 misty acorns, I have not foraged another since.  I have foraged water, rabbit meat, vegetables, berries, fishing grubs, and black roots.  But when I do get some, I will save them until I have a reasonable amount and make a post to let you know.</div></div><hr />
