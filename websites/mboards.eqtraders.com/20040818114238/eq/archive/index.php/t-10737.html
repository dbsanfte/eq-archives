<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">with the addition of ldon would you have rather had the staff or a possible +2 dmg - 5 or 10 delay string instead?  even if it was only a lv 65 drop i think i would have rather had the string with that trivial instead of the bow staff.  dont mind the bow staff though.  can buy some cheap from a bud to skill up on much cheaper than merchant bought.</div></div><hr />
