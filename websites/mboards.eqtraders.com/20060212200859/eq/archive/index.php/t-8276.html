<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verdandi</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I need werewolf pelts, 11 or more depending on how lucky I am.  There is an alchemy potion, Soluan's Vigor, which requires them.  We need data for the 5 and 10 dose versions of it.  They're not in Magelo or Lucy.  The single dose is only in those because I made one last week out of a werewolf pelt bought in the Bazaar.  The five that I found in the Bazaar were at 5-20pp, which is fine, but now the only two I've seen are 50pp and 100pp respectively.  Considering that I'm also paying about 25pp each for the herb that goes into this, and the fact that the potion itself isn't all that valuable, that's a bit much.  <br />
<br />
So, back to the point, I need werewolf pelts.  Donated pelts for the sake of the database would be gratefully accepted, but I certainly don't expect that, so I would pay as much as 20pp each.  <br />
<br />
(Out of the original five I bought, I failed one combine, so I have 4 completed potions.  That's why I need another 11 pelts yet to make a 5 and a 10 dose.)</div></div><hr />
