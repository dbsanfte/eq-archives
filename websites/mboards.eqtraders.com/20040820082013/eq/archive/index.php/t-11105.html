<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>diverdwn030</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I need a ton of Celestial Essence in order to make many of the crafted items I make.  As of late I need 4 for each combine to make a temper.  <br />
<br />
I have the mortar and pestle and I can buy the solvent but I have the darndest time coming across the words, runes, and other items to complete the essence.<br />
<br />
I came across a trader in the bazaar that was selling several hundred of them for 4p each (80p per stack) and bought a k’s worth.  I did this happily because of the trouble I have getting the combine items.  <br />
<br />
Then I got to thinking that there must be a simple cheap way for this particular trader to produce the essence is such quantities.  If I can make it for less and pocket the profit….  Yeah!!!! <br />
<br />
My question to you is, What is the easiest / cheapest way to create the essence myself and save the 4p each I’m paying?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can buy Scent of Marr (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=2968&amp;menustr=035000000000) at a few vendors (who never run out)... which is sold for about 1.5 Plat each</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/nod  one is the dark elf in western trade building of pok.  he sells celstial solvent.  one of the dark elf posion merchants sell scent of marr i beleive in the same building.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, PoK is the easiest place I’ve found to make it.  The two dark elves are located in the central area of PoK near the pool of water with the barbarian fisherman.  One dark elf is located directly across from the pool.  The other dark elf is upstairs above the pool in a room full of dark elves.  But if money isn’t much of an obstacle for you, you might still want to buy it when you can.  The combines are no fail, but they are a major pain in the writs if you have to make a lot of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Soulfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And I've been running to WC all this time. :(<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Near the fishing pond at the back of the zone you can buy the celestial solvent from the one dark elf vendor near the pool.<br />
<br />
If you then stand with your back to the dark elf you just bought your CS from, go up the stairs to the right of the pond and enter the room on your right. This is the poison vendor room.<br />
<br />
The dark elf straight ahead will sell you a mortar and pestle, and the one on your left will sell you all the Scent of Marr you could ever want for just over 1pp each iirc.<br />
<br />
I usually sit in this room and make my CE, and then sell the mortar and pestle back when I'm finished.</div></div><hr />
