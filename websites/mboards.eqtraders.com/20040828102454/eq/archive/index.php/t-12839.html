<br />
I will soon complete the Qeynos Badge of Nobility quest.  For this, I need to find some panther livers in Jaggedpine.  On Allak, the item is ranked as &quot;uncommon&quot; and there are only two comments linked to it: one saying it took the guy 15 kills to get one, and another saying it took him 40 kills.<br />
<br />
I was wondering what is your experience with those?  I'd like not to trash my faction with Critters of Jaggedpine too much since I'm a big softy at heart.<br />
<br />
Will they still let me pat them on the head when I'm done eviscerating their friends?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's all luck really.  I've gotten them on the 2nd kill, and it's taken me a few hours.<br />
<br />
On average I'd say about 20 kills per.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorvari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">One day I farmed about 30 panthers and didn't get any to drop.<br />
<br />
The next day the liver dropped from the 2nd, 4th, and 5th panthers.<br />
<br />
All depends on the RNG.</div></div><hr />
