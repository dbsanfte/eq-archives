<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Being a hobbit I prefer to force feed myself foods that roleplay fairly well. I eat jumjum salad and when I'm needing my fix I drink the jumjum spiced beer, but I need a godo drink. I've been making root beer floats but I saw 3 jumjum juice for sale in the bazaar. Is this brewed? I can't seem to find a recipie anywhere. If it isnt brewed is it vendor bought? I managed to get to 250 brewing with never hearing of this :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alorob Bolrodo at the Lost Turnip in SH. (loc neg 335, pos 1625).<br />
<br />
It is in the cave like area across from the port to the nexus. As for it not being in the database, it is not tradeskill flagged and i don't think it can be brewed.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: It costs 2sp 6cp per, and he is on Stout faction, so he may not sell unless you do one of the quests or have a faction spell, which is what i use.</div></div><hr />
