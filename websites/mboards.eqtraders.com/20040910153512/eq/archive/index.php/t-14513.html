<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weberran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am assuming since the recipes only cover to Plat that velium cant be used to make imbuded jewerly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would not make that assumption myself.  I would probably wonder if no one has ever tried the combines.  Perhaps someone with more information would be able to answer your question.<br />
Personally, I say to try using the enchanted velium with imbued item xxx, and see what you get, then post your results here.<br />
<br />
just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqNichola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All the velium imbued recipes were tried when imbued recipes were first put in - at that time they were DNC (as in, they weren't a valid recipe). That may have changed, but I doubt it. It costs nothing to try :)<br />
<br />
Oh and before you ask - no there isn't a list of things that aren't valid recipes. Consider how long such a list would have to be :)</div></div><hr />
