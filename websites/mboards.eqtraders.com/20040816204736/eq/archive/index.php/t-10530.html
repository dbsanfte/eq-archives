I decided that I would like to feel that nice mushy stuff called clay squishing through my fingers, so I decided to take up Pottery.<br />
<br />
When i place a sketch on the pottery wheel it says that this item cannot be combined in this container.  This is even when I have the right ingredients!! Please let me know what I am doing wrong.   The wheel does let me squish water and clay together though!!! That is fun!<br />

Can you give us an list of exactly what you are putting on the wheel? Otherwise everything will be only guesses.<br />

I will always think of the first 21 levels of pottery as the Playdoh levels. First you put 3 small blocks of clay and water on the wheel and get a block, then you put the block you made and more water back on and get a small block back. Just like playdoh. Now if I could only make a good tiger out of the clay.</div></div><hr />

<br />

I have also tried using the mush (where you have already combined the clay and water ) and the sketch</div></div><hr />

<br />
She put all the right stuff (that she had been combining all morning) in the forge, but the combine wouldn't work.   One second it did, and the next it didn't.<br />
<br />
Might be a bug.   Stranger things have been known to happen on an expansion launch.</div></div><hr />
