<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solarax_Manastorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok so im currently at 185 and im farming velium in Crystal Caverns and since im a 65 wizzy i can AE the entire area pretty easy but i heard that Tower of Frozen Shadow also drops velium. is this a better place to go if CC is camped?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's ceratinly a quieter area to farm, but there are less than a dozen spawns on only one floor that actually drop velium.<br />
<br />
Swings and roundabouts, really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solarax_Manastorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ah ok thanks was hoing to find a secret of the pros type deal there. is the drop rate ok there?.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">no, not so much. as a 65 Wiz you will have them dead in no time and have to wait 15 min for them to spawn again.<br />
Each Spawn of 12 I managed to get 1-3 pieces total</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Solarax_Manastorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">omg thats horrible. at least in cc there is a forge and i can refine the stuff into small peices while i wait<br />
for repops</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">can try velks or skyshrine.  golem in skyshrine and i beleive in velks too.  might be from some of the spiders as well.  i'm still trying to get to velks to start farming the threads for the shawl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Solarax_Manastorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i need to kepmy cov faction for now so i can keep farming the wyvern hides and i might do some old school quests later . already done shawls but wanna keep factio there too untill im 1750 and finnished with grimmle so i guess im just gonna have to grin and bear it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">cc is superior because of the forge in zone.  velks has a better drop rate from what i hear.  definetely better if you have to share the spawns in cc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aquila Swiftspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just so you know, at 65, with even the slightest care, you can easily hunt wyverns in CS while hated and detested by CoV.<br />
<br />
Heck, to be real, I hunted CS for wyverns and drakes for exp in my low 50s with max KoS to CoV.  <br />
<br />
If you really do plan to do old school quests in Skyshrine, then by all means, keep your CoV faction. <br />
<br />
Since you're a porter, you might find Skyshrine especially convenient.  You can port right into WL, run over, killing any panthers you see on the way.  Take out the tigerraptors near the entrance.  Zone in, hunt through, use the forge to break stuff down, rinse and repeat until you're too heavy to move comfortably, pop back to the PoK bank, and do it all again.<br />
<br />
I almost never see anyone else in Skyshrine when I'm there; when I do see someone, they're most often doing a quest, so I just make sure not to interfere with the quest mob they need.</div></div><hr />
