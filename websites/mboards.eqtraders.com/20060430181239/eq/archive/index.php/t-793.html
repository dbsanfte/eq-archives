<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frubo</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 01:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok i recently started smithing with my gnomer warrior, and  have gotten him  to 115 in matter of hours with close to no pp used, maybe a couple hundred pp. I am about to start making fine plate armor up to around 188 or so and i had a few questions .<br />
<br />
 Once I am close to  200 do gnomes get to make dwarven armor? And I am agnostic and am planning on making full cultural for my gnomer when i reach high enough skill, I have yet to see any armor for sell that is for a agnostic gnome warrior.  Whats it called? can i even make it? <br />
   Its not a huge deal if i cant , ill just make other and pay someone to make me some.<br />
<br />
<br />
 And one last thing.... What are the advantages and disadvantages of being a gnomer smith???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorgin</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 01:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only Dwarves can craft the dwarven cultural armor as only they may use the proper forge. A gnome warrior who is agnostic would wear Brellium Platemail made by a Dwarven Smith. The armor is not deity restricted and is usable by halflings, dwarves and gnomes of the plate wearing classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From 188-220ish, what is the best and cheapest way to get it up, not to mention fast if its possible... I have heard of the shadowscream stuff but my guy is only 41 atm. What other things could i start making at 188 to level up and possible have something to sell at the same time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frubo</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, does anyone know where i can find a list of gnome smithed armor? I have no idea what i will be able to smith and what i will not be able to smith once i reach high enough... is there just not very many gnoem smiths or do you guysjust have no idea?</div></div><hr />

<br />
With a high end gnome smith, you can make Acrylia armor, black acrylia weapons, and the various POP armor. You should consider browsing around the recipies pages.</div></div><hr />
