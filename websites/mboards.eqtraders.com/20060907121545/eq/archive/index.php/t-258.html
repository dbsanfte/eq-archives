Bad news for those who farm velium and use the new forges there.  Hope it's just a bug!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gello</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mutter.  I use the town a lot to sell the other junk as I get velium.  I'm curious why this change was made.  It seemed the orcs and the dwarves coexisted independently like the gnomes and goblins in sola.  Even in the lore, Glight Snowchipper, who founded Froststone, had no apparent affinity for the orcs.  The dwarves and orcs remained guarded enemies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yakk</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm guessing the faction hit is supposed to be positive.<br />
<br />
There are a few reasons why it might be negative:<br />
<br />
1&gt; Attacking the orcs might reveal the existance of the dwarves.<br />
<br />
2&gt; The dwarves have allied with the orcs against the giants.  I doubt it.<br />
<br />
However, I'd bet dollars to donuts that the faction hit is backwards.  =p</div></div><hr />

The current theory is that this was intended to be the postive hit they mentioned possibly adding, but someone screwed it up.  Suggestion is to bug it.</div></div><hr />
