<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Emron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been trying to gather many of the components for druid spell in the bazaar, but I haven't noticed any of the &quot;part of yaeth's compendiums&quot; having a page left or right legend.  How do you tell them apart to know which page you are getting?<br />
Thanks,<br />
Em</div></div><hr />

<br />
if the left side is smooth, and the right side is jagged, then it's a &quot;Left&quot; side page, and vice versa for a &quot;Right&quot; side page.<br />
<br />
Annoying isn't it? Can't just bring up /baz and check, you have to go to every trader and look. :(<br />
<br />
It's the same for like, half of enchanter research pages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You do NOT have to go to the trader and look... you can right click the item name in the bazaar window and it will bring up the item just like clicking on a link.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Emron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ah, I see.  You have to open it like it was a message.  I'll try that tonight and see if I can find what I need.  Thanks much for the info!!<br />

You're missing it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Go, in real life,  and tear a piece of paper in half.<br />
<br />
You see how the left half looks?<br />
You see how the right half looks?<br />
<br />
<br />
There's your answer. LOOK at the icon for the spell page before you click on it.    Look at both sides of the paper you tore.   See which one matches.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">**** IT!<br />
<br />
All this time, I've been running to the merchant to look at the **** page, and here, I could have right clicked them all and seen them? ARGH!!! WTF??? LOL<br />
<br />
/smacks forehead<br />
<br />
You'd think, after all this time, I would have freakin figured that out... DUH!!!</div></div><hr />
