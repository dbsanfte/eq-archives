<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night (OK, technically very early morning today), right around 3:00am, I was finally greeted by a message I didn't expect to see.<br />
<br />
You have become better at Pottery! (250)<br />
<br />
Pottery was the last skill I had left, and I had been saving it for the end because I thought it was easy.  Barring one hell level at 227, skillups were fast and furious, oftentimes two or three per stack of combines.  The only really irritating part was finding enough imbued gems, mana vials, and magic clay to keep churning out those unfired items! =)  I think I kept half of Veeshan's enchanter population busy over the last couple of days making the needed vials and clay, though I had enough imbued emeralds in the bank left over from my tailoring and smithing days.<br />
<br />
I'd like to extend a very hearty thanks to EQTraders, particularly the DenMom and the House Ogre.  Without this site and especially the new database, I would never have been able to reach this milestone.  <br />
<br />
It's been an amazing run, and it feels great to have a dream long fulfilled.<br />
<br />
Things left to do:<br />
<br />
Get my last trophy (pottery, natch).  Will do as soon as I can find some black sapphires ...<br />
Complete the Aid Grimel quest.  Will do as soon as I get a Rallos and Sol Ro kill, and farm those sacred waters and a Hope Stone.<br />
<br />
Um ... <br />
<br />
Help?  I'm running out of goals!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">GRATS KYROSKRANE!!!!<br />
<br />
Need a goal? hmm.... make me a full set of Farwater Chain.... free of course ;) That farmin should keep you busy  :cool: <br />
<br />
P.S. Skip the BP and Legs I made those last week :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Liwsa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Set  PP in the bank goal(mine was a million should have set it higher is funny once you finish trade skills not much to spend the pp on).<br />
<br />
Level an alt<br />
<br />
Have a alchemist?<br />
<br />
Have a tinker?<br />
<br />
Have a poison maker?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Congrats Kryos!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Goal #1: Pottery trophy.  Achieved.  Yesterday, after our first Sol Ro raid (which we won, yay!), I decided to waste some more cash on another trophy attempt. I couldn't find any black sapphires for sale, so I had to resort to buying a complete Artisan's Seal for 6K.  Much to my surprise, the trophy combine succeeded -- so now I have my pottery trophy on my second attempt. I'm a bit irritated that I didn't get any of my trophies on my first attempt, but hey, you can't have everything. =)<br />
<br />
Goal #2: Complete the Aid Grimel quest. Sol Ro brings me one step closer to fulfilling all the requirements for AG; now I just need a Rallos kill. Oh, and I need to FARM. I need to get the sacred waters and (eventually) a Hope Stone.<br />
<br />
Goal #3: Get one million pp in cash ... I'm very close. I could actually get there in a couple of days if I just sell off some of the droppable items I've been hoarding, but I can wait. :)  I recently banged out a pair of Farwater plate greaves that I've been wearing, but I'm honestly not convinced they're a significant upgrade from my Ornate pants.  I could sell the Farwater and be pretty darn close to 1Mpp. ... or I could just keep as I've been doing and eventually get that 1Mpp and keep my pants on! :D  ... wait a minute, that sounds wrong.  :boggled: <br />
<br />
I'll pass on the option of gear up Renjah; that midget has better gear than me already! =)<br />
<br />
I have no real interest in poison-making or alchemy, but tinkering and research sound like fun.  I could also use an enchanter, so my next project (when and if I ever give up on Kyros) will probably be a gnome chanter.  Right now, though, I want to round out Kyros first.<br />
<br />
I just got introduced to the joy of Sol Ro exp.  I think it's time I started cranking out some AA.  My tanking AA's suck, and I really want to start getting the fun AA's like Slay Undead and Holy Steed.<br />
<br />
Well, that's enough to keep me going for the nonce, I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1 mill plat? DANG MAN SHARE THE LOVE!!!! Ive been lucky to see more than 30k lately ;) GRATS on SolRo!
