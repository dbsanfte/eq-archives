<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For a while now I've been regularly making Acrylia plate for skill ups and selling the results.  However, I've noticed that blocks of acrylia are becoming more and more scarce in the bazaar and when I see them people want around 150pp per.  And the only windstones I've seen being sold in the last week and a half, the seller wants 375pp each.<br />
<br />
Blue diamonds have been dropping in price.  Many are showing up for under 400pp each.  Which is pretty darn competative to what windstones are going for recently, which has me wondering.<br />
<br />
I'm a barbarian, so my temper isn't that hard to put together.  In fact I've been stock piling essence of winter for weeks and have something like 6 stacks of it.  And farming some of the other components wouldn't be too difficult, the big difficulty would be blue diamonds which are becoming cheaper and cheaper. <br />
<br />
I tried a run of sickles this weekend and at 205 skill with gearlok I succeeded 5 out of 25 combines.  Which leads me to believe I might have somewhat similar results with either the high end chain or a lower skill item like a bracer for the plate, in cultural.<br />
<br />
Price seems very similar, what do you think?</div></div><hr />

Morning dew is still just too much of a bottleneck :/</div></div><hr />

You betcha.  Good plan.</div></div><hr />

It costs about 330 pp or thereabouts to attempt sickle. For that you just need level 29 tunare druid. If you're going to burn that much money why not just do sickles?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's an easy one...<br />
<br />
Because if you succeed on 3 Sickles out of 20, then you can sell them for 200-300pp each.<br />
<br />
If you succeed on 3 pieces of BD Cultural out of 20, then you can sell them for 9-40kpp each.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I don't have money to burn, not really.  But nothing I can make with a reasonable chance of success is going to actually make much money.<br />
<br />
Sickles are viable, but extremely time consuming with little or no hope of a return.  I'll be able to only sell a few sickles.  So I'll quickly run out of money.  And with Acrylia components going up in price will acrylia plate prices are slowly dropping, I can see that very soon acrylia plate won't be very viable either.<br />
<br />
If I can get a couple of successes on the cultural plate I least have a chance of selling them for enough to finance a lot more skill ups.  And the price per combine on the cultural plate looks like it is or will very soon be cheaper than a acrylia plate combine.  Which is messed up as hell, given the difference in quality and resale value.  Acrylia is becoming too expensive because too many people are using it as a skill up path and windstones have never been as plentiful as blue diamonds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Windstones are now ~300p each.  An Acrylia Temper requires 2 Windstones.<br />
<br />
Blue Diamonds are now ~500p each.<br />
<br />
Morning Dew is a nightmarish PITA for a High Elven Cleric, especially with all the competition from other High Elves and Wood Elves.<br />
<br />
I've still got ~70 Moonlight Tempers.<br />
<br />
Maybe it is time to just try banging out a piece or two...</div></div><hr />

On my server at least, you have to work to make money from that stuff. There are very few Barb Warriors who are Tribunal. I recommend you always find a buyer before you make the plate, else you are stuck. On Drinal, sickles still sell for 2k, and sell often.<br />
9k-40k doesn't work anymore.<br />
I made one pair of Artificers leggings, which are really one of the best droppable pre-PoP leggings for Shaman, I thought I could sell these. I started at 30k (10k per ring). I'm down to 18k, noone has even offered. I had figured there were many more Barb Shaman Trib than warriors...<br />
If there are no other Barb GM smiths on his server, he could do ok, but if there are the market is probably already gone.<br />
Sickles, I say, Sickles!![/i]</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup, yup, got those.<br />
<br />
It costs about 330 pp or thereabouts to attempt sickle. For that you just need level 29 tunare druid. If you're going to burn that much money why not just do sickles?<br />
<br />
Because imbued emeralds sell for 50pp each in the baz.  Tack on the mass of subcombines (with corresponding chance for failures), add 250pp for gems and it's probably not going to be cheaper to make sickles per combine over 1 sheet BD cultural.  330pp or thereabouts, plus 120pp for imbues and suddenly you're not looking at a HUGE cost savings (well actually, I get gouged on enchanting and temper components as well).<br />
<br />
On stormhammer, 99 percent of the people below 50 (hell, 60) are twinks that are being powerlevelled for a given purpose.  There's bugger all of a market to buy imbued and enchanted stuff from (I make part of my passable living selling the vials my in the process of being power levelled to 49 enchanter makes at double material cost - which is half of the price of the one or two others that sell).<br />
<br />
Of course, I'm a dark elf, so my BD cultural will probably sell well to the packs of shadowknights and clerics on my server (though we have a lot of fatties). Sickle market appears to be breathing its last.  Most of the people making money have moved out, leaving the few that waited to get their earring scrambling to find people still making the stuff.  Not good odds for selling the results of bulk combines.<br />
<br />
I'd say that even with the higher cost my sell price per success will be way higher for BD cultural versus sickles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angelsyn</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's another good point...<br />
<br />
The Bracers &amp;amp; Boots are both &quot;Single sheet&quot; items... and easily the best ones on a cost-per-attempt basis.<br />
<br />
The low cost (at least on Xegony) of the Death Mask of the Elysians makes the BD Cultural masks less favorable, but the Collars (Imbued especially) should still sell fairly well.</div></div><hr />
