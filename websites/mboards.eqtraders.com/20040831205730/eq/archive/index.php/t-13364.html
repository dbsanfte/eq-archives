<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kawaru23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm trying to get an idea of what the approximate trivial values of 250+ items are.  For instance the Economical Smithing guide mentions that Mistletoe Cutting Sickles are thought to be around 300 or so because of the failure rate of people who have maxed smithing.  Any ideas on dark elf BD cultural gear or POP smithing items?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>solithan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">These are really hard to determine because of the nature of it all, but from everthing I've read here it seems to be the avg most folks experience on BD culturals including DEF culturals seem to be around 50% with max'd skill. So the triv at 300 or even 350 was probably soted out based on that formula that was kicking around on chances of success based on skill.<br />
My personal experiences with only skill level 227+5% on DEF BD cults are around 50% but I feel I've been fairly lucky.<br />
