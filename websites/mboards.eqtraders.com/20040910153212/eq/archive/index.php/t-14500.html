<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>whatparadox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Right after the 1017 patches on the Fennin Ro server, I ran around grabbing all the components for a new round of tries at making a Trueshot Bow. <br />
<br />
However, when I toss the items in the combine bag for the staff, nothing happens, no error message, nothing at all. I noticed this on Sat afternoon - still having no luck.<br />
<br />
I have used the combine bag before, without any problems. I'm using one each &quot;Wooden Shards&quot;, from Jyle in Freeport, &quot;Dwarvin Wire&quot;, Micro Servo&quot;, and &quot;Spiderling Silk&quot;. I destroyed my combine bag and aquired another each day since - same trouble.<br />
<br />
I sent a /petition, which doesnt show in my /viewpetition, but have heard no answers.<br />
<br />
Can anyone else get a combine? Or think of something I might be doing wrong?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sirul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep, same trouble here.  I did /petition, /bug, and emailed Sony.  You are correct, there is no error message, nothing.  Just nothing happens when you hit combine.  I hope they fix it soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sirul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Update:  I received an email from a GM that said that they are working to have the Trueshot bug fixed at next patch.</div></div><hr />
