<br />
As a pally I am thinking of doing the loyalist shield of honour quest (Alla Link (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=15971) ) and that has a 250 trivial combine in it.<br />
<br />
Anyone tried using this is a skill up route, cos the sketch relatively easy to get.<br />
<br />
My real thought was how likely am I to succeed at this with a skill of 200, which is much more likely for me :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I didnt fully read the quest, but it seems to me there is a lot of stuff to go through before you are handed the Pottery Sketch.  Including some encounters that you need a few people for.<br />
<br />
Now, if you fail you keep the Sketch..... COOL<br />
<br />
But EVERY time you make the item, you will probably have to redo the quest to get another Sketch.<br />
<br />
May be ok for someone moving up through the 190s, but as soon as you start succeding on the combine its gonna be a real pain in the hoop!<br />
<br />
Nice idea tho.....   If we just had to hail an NPC to get another Sketch it would work.....<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work! and may the RNG smile upon you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh and as for your quest.<br />
<br />
If you fail you keep the sketch so you should be ok.  Just keep trying!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sylphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wow that's a rather elaborate quest.  Too much to do just to get the pattern each time.<br />
<br />
A pottery skill of 50 is plenty for this quest.  You can take as many tries as you want to make the figurine, you just want to succeed when you fire it with the glaze.</div></div><hr />
