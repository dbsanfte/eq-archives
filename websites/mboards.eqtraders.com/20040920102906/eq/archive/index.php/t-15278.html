You cannot combine these items in this container type!<br />
* I cannot get this or a regular M&amp;P to open as a tradeskill interface container.<br />
Did I goof, did this change, or is it broken? Anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This has changed.  As of the last patch, CE is now made in a Mixing Bowl or Collapsible Mixing Bowl.  This applies to all the CE recipes.<br />
<br />
The change was made so that you could use the new UI to make CE.  Only rogues are able to get the new UI on a mortar and pestle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drexxell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can anyone find confirmable information that SOE has either decided to take away M&amp;P CE combines or that they are addressing this and are going to FIX it so you can do either a MB or M&amp;P combine?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Whats the difference?  Its a no fail combine.  Hardly matters what skill its on.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yah... but Windstones aren't working in Mixing Bowl now..<br />

<br />
We now have to also carry around a mixing bowl to make CEs.<br />
<br />
It's a slight inconveneince to the non-baking Rogues out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">But a huge boon to all the non-rogue bakers.<br />
<br />
I think we outnumber you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you have a custom User Interface skin?   If so, it might not be updated to include the new window.  <br />
<br />
Also, the command to get the tradeskill window to open is usually *right-click* on the mouse.  If you've changed the setting on the window you use CTRL+*right-click*.  That's press and hold the CONTROL key and *right-click* the mouse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mialliw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ok first thing dont have to be like that. I knwo hwo to use the keyboard fuction as i am a computer tech. second on the rogue no i am not using a custom ui. third i didnt change the setting. forth i have dont ctrl right click done the ctrl r also niether work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Turlo Lomon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Does your rogue have make poison as a skill yet?  I believe this is a prerequisite as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kalelce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah, I think you need to be level 20 to get the new UI.  Thats the level rogues get the Make Poison skill.</div></div><hr />
