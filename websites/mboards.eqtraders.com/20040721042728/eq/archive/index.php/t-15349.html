<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>thesaint517</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been checking out this forum since I started playing EQ four month ago, and I appreciate all the wonderful information that is posted here.  This is my first post and I hope it does not come off as a stupid question.  It has been stated that the max skill lvl for any craft is 252, but I have noticed that the trivial for certain items are way above that (specifically the Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement, trivial=308.)  Is EQ just designed so that you'll never be able to create these items consistently or am I just misunderstanding something about the skill levels?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>thesaint517</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Also, a sub-question.  If you can never get to a level where you can make these items consistently, how does one know what the trivial is?  It would seem that with a max of 252, it would be impossible to state that the trivial of an item is 308.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The trivials are designed so that you still have a significant failure rate on the higher-end items.   From a game-design perspective, this is a sound choice.  Otherwise, everyone and thier dog would have only the very best gear. <br />
<br />
The trivial values are reported by the Tradeskill Interface -- that's how we got those numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mewkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also, the highest skill that you can have is 250. The cap of 252 means your modified skill cannot exceed 252. So if you have a skill of 240 and a geerlok (skill +5%), then your modified skill is 252. If you have a skill of 250 plus that same geerlok, your modified skill is also 252 (capped).</div></div><hr />

I havent a clue how they figured the trivials before the patch other than through intense parsing followed by long equations to find the exact trivial. Now after you ve made an item the trivial is listed for you in your jewlery kit along with all the items needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>JMorgana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They didn't before the new tradeskill UI...anything that didn't get a trivial message at 250 was noted to reflect that...exact trivials were put to them as people did the combines after the new tradeskill UI went live.</div></div><hr />
