<br />
I sign up for beta, I don't get in... But people I know do and I am very happy for them =)<br />
<br />
I am not worthy =/<br />
<br />
But, the final straw, the absolute heartbreaking thing was seeing EQ2 beta accounts for sale....<br />
<br />
I mean, c'mon people, if you didn't want in beta why did you take the opportunity away from other like me that would sell their soul for the invitation to beta?<br />
<br />
It just isn't fair....</div></div><hr />

I'm in the same boat as you are.<br />
Unfortunately, I think those people selling beta accounts are just tryng to take advantage of people like you and me :'(.</div></div><hr />

The excuse was not enough people were interested so they're trying to entice more to test. Well neither myself, nor my brother, nor my friends got into EQ2 beta, so I guess we must not have signed up for the right thing /sarcasm off<br />
<br />
Edit:: Yes, the accounts were a reward for those who registered, mostly to sell tickets. What grated my cheese was the comment by one senior person about lack of willing beta testers for EQ2. Tried to keep as far from Sony bashing as possible here.</div></div><hr />

A friend of mine is in the beta, and he tells me that while the pictures are pretty and all, the game feels too impersonal for his taste.<br />
<br />
If I have anything to add to that, it's been my experience from WAAAAAAAY back in the day of the BBS Door Game that what makes or breaks the game is the people playing it; one reason why I stopped playing Diablo online was all the player-killer-cheaters, for example. In any case, EQ2 is probably going to suffer the same number of idiots that all MMORPGs suffer, and in time, it's probably going to be &quot;just another MMORPG&quot;.<br />
<br />
At least, that's been my experience, anyway . . .<br />

I doubt the acct would last long like that. But it does suck big cheese someone is making money from nothing, from what I understand they didn't buy the acct, why should they be allowed to sell it? Well technicaly they can't but it wont stop them trying  :steamed:  :rant:  :steamed:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">perryslots</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">those accounts are selling for alot of money too i saw one for 120$ and another for 40$<br />
<br />
the games coming out soon anyway people should just wait and buy it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">perryslots</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oops those sold now there is one selling for 350-400 lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
But for SOE's part, I would think that they could tell which beta accounts were not being used and revoke them and give them to others that will use them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ColdHeart</div><div class="date">10-10-2004, 05:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is weird, why pay 100's of dollars for an acct which is only tempery and only to test EQ2... Somehow I doubt the people buying these accts are going to stick strickly to the NDA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elyssanda</div><div class="date">10-10-2004, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a few days ago.. I sent an e-mail to Sony regarding the selling of EQ2 beta accounts on ebay. I got a real (not computer generated) reply the next day from someone at sony.. but checking today, the same people selling their EQ2 beta accounts are still there. SO even KNOWING that this is happening doesn't seem to matter.  :irked:</div></div><hr />

<br />
All I received was a generated auto-response when I reported the selling of the beta accounts.<br />
<br />
I'm glad at least one person heard back from a real human, but it is dismaying that there seems to be no effort to stop the selling  :irked:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check here. (http://eq2.warcry.com/)  They are supposed to be giving away 30 beta accounts.</div></div><hr />

Think I will have to have my Daughter look at these, I donated all my creativity genes to her a long time ago =P<br />

Maybe not. but, they do have control over those beta accounts, so they just need the info and can shut down those accounts.. that would stop this in a hurry.. can't sell something you don't have access to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ngreth Thergn</div><div class="date">10-12-2004, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe not. but, they do have control over those beta accounts, so they just need the info and can shut down those accounts.. that would stop this in a hurry.. can't sell something you don't have access to.<br />
<br />
Again, it is a problem getting ebay to respond to give that info.<br />
<br />
The smart dealers create a temporary email that has no relation to their email they use at SOE, and then they close when the sale is done so that there is really no feasable way to track it without supeonas and such, which can take weeks to process which then the auction is done already and the damage is done.<br />
<br />
SOE  DOES try, they really do... there is just only so much that they can do.</div></div><hr />

Yup, and your CC gets stolen you get another bit of punishement and get banned from every playing EQ2, just becasue you CC number changed. Even reserving to full changes would punish people getting a divorce and making massive life changes...  That is not a feasable way to control it.</div></div><hr />

There are a ton of reasons the CC and billing info can change that isn't case of taking over/selling an account.  For two:  at one point, a friend of mine was in a cash flow crunch and planned to quit EQ as a result.  I didn't want to see him leave, so paid for his account until he could afford to resume payment as a gift.   Another friend didn't have a credit card (before you could pay with gamecards) so a friend of his paid for both their accounts on his CC and he paid his friend cash.  In both cases, it looks like the entire billing info has changed since of course the billing name and address must also change.</div></div><hr />
