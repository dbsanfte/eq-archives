<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, so I come home and run the patcher for EQ.  <br />
<br />
After the patcher is done, it says I need to update my video drivers (odd).  So I follow the link, NVidia, OK so it's legit.<br />
<br />
Reboot, blue screen.<br />
<br />
Now I've spent the past 45 minutes trying to fix this issue, my video is all messed up and I've had an extremely long and stressful day at work.<br />
<br />
I REALLY DIDN&quot;T WANT TO GO THOUGH THIS TONIGHT.<br />

<br />
When I tried making the recommended updates I got a couple errors about bad files and then rebooted and EQ told me I didn't have a 3D card.  Eventually I figured out it'd been my mistake when I picked the update to make and after reinstalling my drivers and then picking the right update things are working, although acting a little wonky in game.  But I don't think that's my system's fault.<br />
<br />
Not that it's necessarily the same case but...keep at it.  I hope you find your breakthrough soon too. :(  Oh, and be sure to watch the Tech Support forums (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board?board.id=tech) and if you don't see your problem, post when you can't take it anymore and want to ask for help.</div></div><hr />

I had to visit my old friends, Safe Mode and RegEdit.  Great guys if you're on their good side and know how to manipulate them.<br />
<br />
System is acting a little screwy now, but hopefully I can get it resolved soon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Oww :(<br />
<br />
You're definitely reinforcing my (bad habit) of not touching drivers (for whatever component), regardless of how many people/sources scream &quot;update them now! constantly! immediately!&quot;, if my current ones work good enough for me.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, video drivers *are* (the only) ones I like to keep updated, since NVidia's updates usually fix errors (other than 12.38 to any more recient version - there is STILL a big bug I have to go back to 12.38 if I don't want to have to deal with: for some directx applications, textures get misapplied and clipareas ignored (at least that's what it looks like - probably more happening, too), with shards of various skins &amp; effects constantly flickering and vieing for priority.  Usually makes the application virtually unusuable, although occasionally you can see through the visual trash enough to get an impression of where the mouse is to click on where you think you remember the button is. /sigh)<br />
<br />
Best of luck Draggar.<br />
Dunthor would like to cast Ressurection (90%) on you.  Do you accept? [Yes] [No]</div></div><hr />

2+ hours just because they wanted to to update my drivers..  <br />
<br />
I feel for you.  Truly.  I had the same thing happen a while back, for no apparent reason.  That is basically when I had my friend rebuild my computer.  You may have to try reinstalling what ever version of windows you are using, and then start all over again.  If that does not work, like on mine, some sectors were corrupted, someone else here will have to offer up some suggestions (new HD).  Good luck to you.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I read your post as I was patching, and did not go get the new drivers for my card.  My problem is with the alt-enter.  I have to pound it like 40 gazillion times before it registers and goe to windows mode.  Makes it extremely hard to try to run 2 accounts on one computer :steamed:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>scarbrowed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I initially thought that the new graphics engine had really decreased lag in the bazaar by an incredible amount. Then I noticed that the bazaar had fewer than 200 traders on Kane Bayle. Looks like you are not alone, Draggar.<br />
<br />
Mine is mostly working (crosses fingers and toes), except in Natimbi. I ported in windowed mode and switched to full screen. Suddenly, all the letters on the screen and the cursor were just square blocks of color. So I /quit, and restarted EQ, and crashed in full screen. Luckily, I was able to come back in this nutty mode windowed, and run to the boat. <br />
<br />
I see interesting days ahead until they fix this. I hope you are back in action soon, Draggar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Wooh. Pretty fluffy clouds. Totally worth my low-spec bazaar-mule computer being taken out of action. <br />
<br />
Or was there some hidden benefit that I have failed to notice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Dunthor - I'm usualy a &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot; kind of guy.  Even with Video drivers.  It seems to be an issue with the NVidia drivers and my video card (Creative Labs GeForce Annihilator (NVidia chipset)).<br />
<br />
I've done a complete uninstall (including safe mode and RegEdit) and reinstalled with the original disc, then updated though CreativeLabs.com it seems to be OK now, but I was dropping a lot last night.<br />
<br />
Rewde - Before I *EVER* do a FFR (FDisk, Format, Reinstall) I check some sources first, including the MS Knowledge DB and a site, www.windrivers.com (heh, first time I've been on there in years).  I found many hits on both, mainly including a bad wininit.ini file, which I've tried to take care of and the %1 from %2 errors did seem to go away, only to  happen when I update the NVidia drivers, so I'm not touching them.  But it does seem that with the orig install that the display adapter changed it's name from the NVidia chipset to SB0100 (or somehting like that) which would make sence (SB = Sound Blaster - Creative Lab's golden child).<br />
<br />
This is a rather frersh install of Windows, only about 6 months old and I have done a fraction of the installing that I've bene known to do in the past, and I don't want to spend a whole day re-installing my software (EQ, MSOffice, Corel, Adobe, some other games etc..). I'll use the FFR as an absolute last resort.<br />
<br />
Scar - long time no see!  Thanx for the reassurance, I'll have to check the support page to see if anything is going on (TY Verdani for the link). If it is a widespread issue like this, then maybe they'll make it a high priority to fix it.  :D<br />
<br />
I'm also debating if I should even attempt to log on my tinker to get that up....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I looked into something else with the lag, it is not so much that folks cant get on, but a good number of bazaar mules on a second account on a single computer, and the new patch broke EQWindows, as such we can't play and mule at the same time with any where near the ease as before :steamed:</div></div><hr />

I was having the same 'cannot copy file %1 %2 stuff' when trying to update my nvidia drivers.<br />
<br />
Do you run Win ME?<br />
<br />
If so, get a new Operating system. I changed to 2k and i was able to update my drivers with NO problem.<br />

Pretty much everyone i spoke with says ME blows worse then the Stormfeather camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Funny, Splunge.  Everyone says that to me but,<br />
<br />
1) This is probbaly the first or second serious issue I've had with WinMe since I began running it (when it was released).<br />
<br />
2) My computer probabaly can't handle Win2K (P3-650 12MB Ram 20GB on the primary partition).<br />
<br />
3) I can't afford Win2K.  :D<br />
<br />
I've done some work, and un-done some previous work, I'm logging my tinkerer on now (I think he's in Shadowhaven) and I'll see how it foes with him.</div></div><hr />

It forced me to change fonts for some reason, but other than that and having to diddle my gamma slider for each character, it was flawless.<br />

You may want to try leaving well enough alone.<br />

Oh, and Tweedledea, the trees and stars are much prettier, too!  Feh.  I'm with you.  It'd be nice if we could turn all that useless detail off for machines that lack the horsepower for it.<br />

<br />
The 'hidden benefit' would be the rewritten-from-scratch new graphics engine, which will allow SOE to have shinier stuff (tm) in game without making everyone's PCs die screaming in agony.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once the bugs get ironed out, of course. :)</div></div><hr />

I am now wishing I did, I can't seem to stay on for long unless I plan to stay in a not-so popular zone (which isn't easy).<br />
<br />
We're going on 20 hours now, and still nothing but problems with this.  Maybe I'll drive to Sony's HQ and yell at someone.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">OK!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Complete uninstall of EVERYTHING related to my video card in safe mode, complete removal of it all in RegEdit.<br />
<br />
Reboot, I did NOT install new drivers for the video, I let it run as a generic VGA display adapter.<br />
<br />
THEN, I installed the suggested NVidia graphics driver from scratch, no &quot;Cannot update file %1 form %2&quot;!<br />
<br />
PC booted up, and with the exception of a few generic icons (which can easily be fixed) it seems to be running fine, now all I need to see if EQ will run.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>etitameh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">my husband and i have 2 computers, his runs win 98, and mine runs win me. i was at work the first opportunity one of us had to log in after the dx9 patch, so he booted up his computer, and was told to update his drivers -- he did so. no eq.. no idea why, just wouldn't work. 3 hours later, he reinstalled his original (from disk) drivers, and it works just fine now. <br />
<br />
needless to say, when he booted up my computer and was told to update my drivers, he clicked &quot;don't show this again&quot; and happily ignored it.<br />
<br />
upshot? both of our computers have the &quot;outdated&quot; drivers, and no problems running eq.<br />

2) My computer probabaly can't handle Win2K (P3-650 12MB Ram 20GB on the primary partition). <br />
<br />
I've got Win2k running happily on (for the low end):<br />
a) Dual Pentium Pro (forget mhz), 128mb memory, 4 gig hard drive (actively used)<br />
b) P3-450 128mb memory, 30gig hard drive (active, remote machine)<br />
c) P2-300 (disconnected that comp ~8 months ago, forget hard drive and memory sizes)<br />
<br />
The bottleneck would only be the memory, I think.<br />
<br />
Not that it would be practical to upgrade any of it given #3 or necessary since what you've got works, but just wanted to point out only 1 of those specs would probably be a problem, not all three ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Breez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">For the record - I have no experience with ME, went from 98 striaght to XP.<br />
<br />
I have been a Deskside support, PC tech, for 6 years.  (the nerd that shows up when you forget that turning the monitor off and on isn't the same as rebooting.) What does that have to do with this?  Nothing... but my friends are in the same buisness.    Some of THEM are the type that run out and buy the newest $300 video card becasue it is a 2% increase in performance over thier current card.  <br />
<br />
They are the same people that install every new OS as soon as they can get thier hands on the beta, you know, the ones that install Chicago, or baltimore or whatever the prerelease is.  They all installed ME and for 1 months I heard nothing but praise about it and how I am a slacker for not joining the dark side.<br />
<br />
The next 6 months was me laughing till my sides split everytime one of them had a problem.<br />
<br />
Everyone is on XP now, except for 1 diehard that swears he likes 2k better.<br />
<br />
*Inc Joke---&gt;* It always seems to me that ME was the red headed step child of Microsoft, I think Microsoft is trying to erase all evidence of its exsistance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I've only worked with XP a little.  I might like it a little more if I used it constantly and became accustomed to its differences, but I'm pretty sure I'd still prefer Win2k.  Why?  Win2k is stable, simple, so far has been fully compatable with every more recient application I need to run, and works well for me, but it doesn't have the &quot;ET phone home!&quot; aspects of XP (yes I'm a privacy freak), nor &quot;Product Activation&quot; (yes, I do actually own 8 copies of windows 2000 for the 8 machines I have it on, but I *still* don't like product activation one bit).  There are the smaller aspects too: for example, not having to deal with the program properties (I forget the exact name - what makes it so you can't alt+tab by default out of EQ, for example), but that's also a loss of a sometimes-useful feature, so I figure that probably sums to zero.  And then there are the &quot;probably goes away with time&quot; things, like that horribly ugly look&amp;feel, and so many more &quot;preview&quot; and &quot;web enabled&quot; aspects of the desktop&amp;explorer that need to be disabled and worked around.<br />
<br />
Upgrade with downsides and no significant upsides that I can see? Even ignoring the (large) cost of upgrading, I'd still pick Win2k over WinXP for any machine I cared about (one comp running WinXP could be nice to experiment, but that's true for just about *any* OS).</div></div><hr />
