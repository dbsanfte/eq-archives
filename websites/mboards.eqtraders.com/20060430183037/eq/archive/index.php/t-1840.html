The defenders are no stronger than the average mobs in that location for whichever race your fighting.  If you can take normal grimlings you can take defenders.  Sonic defenders were green at 53 to me and died very quickly.  Just make sure you leave one up, the faction that is to win must kill the last one.</div></div><hr />

Yes, you can beat them.  Try to aggro only 1 at a time.  When approaching a line of them, approach from the end of the line and fight up the line.</div></div><hr />
