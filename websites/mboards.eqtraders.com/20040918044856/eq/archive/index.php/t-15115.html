<br />
I just started a Necro (he's lvl 34 now) my first int caster, and I'm looking for research components and I'm stuck as to where to find froglok eye's.<br />
<br />
So far I have been to Swamp of No Hope killing froglok's and no froglok eye's, Firiona Vie killing froglok's and no froglok eye's, Innothule Swamp kiling undead froglok's and no froglok eye's, Upper Guk killing everything there (or trying to) and no froglok eye's. I haven't tried Lower Guk yet because of my level.<br />
<br />
Can anyone suggest another zone to look for these illusive froglok eye's please.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

p.s. I hope this isn't a repost of someone else's - I did do a search and couldn't find anything about froglok eye's</div></div><hr />

I think that's what you're looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are no tads in Innothule anymore since the frogloks took over Grobb and renamed it Gukta. And it wouldn't be very bright to wander into Upper Guk and start molesting tads while their parents are watching.<br />
<br />
Best stick to the east side of Feerrott around the PoK book for Oggok, there are plenty of tads around there to keep you busy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>baldorrex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For practice runes you do not want a froglok tadpole eye (or at least they were DNC when I made some of the practice runes for research a long time ago).  As I remember, to make the practice rune you need froglok eyes that drop in Guk from live frogs.  For a long time they did not drop.  As a result, I skipped this particular practice rune.<br />
<br />
At some point, there was a patch message indicating that they would drop.  I believe they did drop, because I saw a few for sale on vendors.  The froglok eye was blue.  However, I was past the trivial at that point so I did not care too much.  I also have a memory of making some of the practice runes for friends, but that was probably more than a year ago.<br />
<br />
It is probably cheaper and certainly much easier to simply purchase your research skill from a guild master.  FYI, there were several threads discussing this topic in the spell research forum.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Curare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thank You Laurrill for the advise, I think I will spend the practice points to reseach 41. You are correct I need the blue froglok eye's - I did find some one day on a trader in the bazaar but he only had 5 for sale. If I ever run into froglok eye's - I will post where I find them....<br />

Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>vwdiesel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The froglok eyes you need are dropped off the frogloks in Guk (both upper and lower). I searched everywhere for them (including Guk) several months ago when I was doing the practice runes and only ever found one or two on a vendor. I recall slaughtering about 20-30 frogs in upper guk at that time and never saw one. I gave up on that particualr set of runes and went to the next. <br />
<br />
In Lower Guk last night getting the Collector's undead froglok tongue I had about 3-4 froglok eyes drop in 10 or so kills. Also got one eye to drop in upper guk on my way out. Maybe they upped the drop rate on them.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, I don't think you'll have any regrets about just buying those practice points from your GM.</div></div><hr />
