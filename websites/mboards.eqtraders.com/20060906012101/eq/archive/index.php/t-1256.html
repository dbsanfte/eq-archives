I must have already made 10,000 or more of them.  I think that when my friends and I were making Sickles we found that we needed roughly 200 of them per 20 combines.  Something like that.  Anyways, I now have to make tons and tons of them for tailoring to make the robes. <br />
<br />
Just venting, thanks.<br />

<br />
For tailoring skillups, I combine a lot of arctic wyvern masks and othmir caps. I'm getting a pretty decent success rate on them now, so my trader mule is just flooded with the darn things. Unfortunately, a couple brilliant ppl out there have decided to destroy the market on both... down to about 30pp each, and they do NOT move.<br />
<br />
So... I go directly to the ppl that would want these items... low level wis casters. I go to Halas or whatever newbie grounds and find someone thats interested in receiving one of these fine items for 30 minutes of work. Then I start handing them stacks of components and work them like dogs creating celestial essences for me, hehehe.<br />
<br />
Have only tried it a few times, but its worked well for me so far. GL! =)</div></div><hr />

I have a mule that makes them and stocks them, but it seems that she is constantly out of them because I need them for everything.  <br />

Celestial Essence, the bane of tradeskills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cravin</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea I have created a mule called essance just to make and store essance. I have a piece of tape to hold the CTL key down on that system so I can make them while doing raids and such with my main. bets the heck outa trying to buy them from folks in the bazaar at 6PP per or more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arghargh</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">20 sickles takes 180 CEs, trust me.  CEs are almost half the total combines needed on a sickle.  They range between 4pp and 5pp on my server.  I always buy them off traders.  <br />
<br />
Although I'd love to see a CE recipe that produce more than one at a time, I doubt it will happen.  CEs are sort of a rate determining step in some recipes.  They also encourage buying from others.<br />

I pay 60pp per stack, which works out to a healthy income for clicking.  I have a guildie that has anoth 50 stacks to unload on me, but I need to use some of the ones I have now to make room :)  coldain tempers anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paldor</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have started calling them Celestial Timesinks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol, hehe, that's just what they are! TIMESINKS! They do everything and anything they can to make a timesink for Uber guilds and I guess they wanted to slow down Tradeskillers also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">laloin</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have found that if you take a bunch of the celistal solvants and goto seb with a cash group, you can farm alot of pages and runes that combine to make the CE you need, plus you get some cash and drops from the cash run in seb :)<br />
best laloin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xonbink</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just do what I did - find an eager lower lvl who wants cash - show him how to make it, and tell him that you would like 10 stacks per day -<br />
<br />
<br />
The next thing you know he's knocking on your door with 30 or 40 stacks asking if u want em all cuz he wants uber_bazaar_item_01 <br />
<br />
at 3pp each this is very profitable for him and a huge time saver for me.<br />
