&lt;Shrug&gt; I guess I'll keep track of them the old fashioned way...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tanliel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's unfortunate, but GuildMagic hadn't been actively supported in a LONG time as it was ... I'd say that it's now gone for good.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Melinia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">or the site has been hyjacked. Last time I went there to update my characters I kept getting this pop up do down load some software. At first I said no but the site wouldnt load... stupid me said ok then. now I'm still trying to get all of this fricken spy ware off my pc.  :steamed:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aryse Andenter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are still some posts on the message boards there, and some people have been able to kind of offer suggestions to 'ninja' fix some of the problems with it, but that site hasn't been updated in a long time and it doesn't really look promising, as well as it has been down off and on for the past few weeks it seems.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Windru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yea, I kept getting that also, and I wrote down the &quot;vendor&quot; offering the download, and then did a google search for them.  &quot;IBIS.LLC&quot; .  I visited that site and thought, I don't trust it.  I'm glad I didn't, and I'm sorry you have all of that spy ware.<br />
<br />
I too knew that it had not been maintained since before Planes (I believe, since the chars don't go past level 60?)  I was an admin for two guilds on CazicThule there (Friends Infinity and Omnipotent Loyalty).<br />
<br />
Thanks for the link to the boards there, I will check out the responses.<br />
<br />
Thanks again all!<br />
