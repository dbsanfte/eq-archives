<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>illovich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">According to the patch message the price vendors will pay for fish caught in the Abysmal Sea and Natimbi has been reduced. <br />
<br />
I can't get in atm, so I don't know by how much, but my guess is it was significant.<br />
<br />
I wonder if they changed the value of the forages in Natimbi (they had a similar value I think).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those things were gumming up all the merchants.<br />
<br />
Not that I mind players having a source of money, but so many variations of just one fish/item was a bit overboard in my opinion. I merchant search a lot, and a merchant full of fish is a bit annoying.<br />

Back to regularly scheduled programming, while I wait for servers to open up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>vovinit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sony never half asses anything when they nerf some thing they outright destory it. Now fish in abysmal are worth their weight in copper. 8lb fish = 8 copper. Lol went there and there were only 2 others in the zone. So this lil nerf has effectively killed this zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drubear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I suspect the thinking was that the &quot;benefit&quot; of doing this fishing was &gt;&gt;not&lt;&lt; the vendor sell back but the bazaar sellback to people levelling baking. <br />
<br />
I wonder if the Vendor Sell price was left alone? If it was, that would allow fisherpeople to baz their items below Vendor Sell (it was platty as I recall); if it was not (i.e. nerfed down to Vendor Buy levels), it may not be worth the trouble as there will likely be enuf on vendors to suppress any baz price high enough to bother with. <br />
<br />
Altho, I suspect it would be easy enuf to farm/fish your own tuna/crab to raise baking. Will depend on market forces I s'pose. <br />
<br />
I do know that Vegetables and Eggs have been flying off my Trader.</div></div><hr />
