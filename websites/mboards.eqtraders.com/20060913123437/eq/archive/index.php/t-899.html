That'll be a nice way to collect pelts for padding and level at the same time.  Hang in there.</div></div><hr />

i have been playing around with my log for a bit now, and while i am trying to find/make a program that does exactly this it seems, from my bests estimates, that i have spent over 30k getting to 195.  Ill try and get an exact number when i can sort out what needs sorting.  Keep in mind that this does not take into any account the non-merchant buying i have done.  When i do cultural armor i give the money to the enchanter who then buys and enchants the blocks, therefore, these numbers don't show up in my log.  So my log only works up untill 188 when fp goes triv.  These numbers are not completely acurate for you as you will have difrent cha, difrent luck with the vendors and more importantly you will be doing your skill up pre-&quot;the big patch&quot; that lowerd all the trivs and added new recipies.  I can see it becomeing cheeper for certain reasons (skill ups easier to get now) and more exspensive (i never delt with any ornate chain, only FP after banded)  also i have not added in my deductions from selling items to pcs or to npcs.  So lets assume I made back 2/3rds of what i spent.  Therefore i only realy spent 10k getting to 188.  Consider the gear i curently wear that i made, you can buy it all for less then 10k in the bazaar.<br />
Yes my evidence has many holes in it and should only be taken as a rough idea of what to expect, the important peice of evidence is the 20,044 (probably higher as i am missing a couple days of logs) combines i have attempted.  Yes these were not all smithing, some of them were brewing (200) so i could make tempers and other items, yes i do more tradeskills then just the two, but the majority of my time and effort has been placed on smithing, so at least half of those combines are for smithing.  10,000+ combines is a long time to put infront of the forge. <br />
Therefore my advice to you is run away.  You will ding faster, have more plat and better gear if you just ignored smithing all together.  If you are realy die-hard and want to do some tradeskill pick something easy (in other words, not smithing and not tailoring).   Your a shaman, potions just got nerfed, they may be viable now as a tradeskill.  However if you do go for smithing then you better love it because it rarely loves you back.  Oh, and pre-grats on 250 then.<br />

I don't know about you, but I never did 10,000+ combines in front of the forge in one session  ;) <br />

I usually gather supplies in a lost hour or something and slowly increase my stock, or buy some supplies (usually trying at an opportunity) in the Bazaar. Once I have enough for say 30 attempts, I hit the Forge and combine away.<br />

The brunt of my playtime is still in exp groups  :)</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure if I understood you correctly, but 10,000 non-trivial combines should have you at 250 long ago.  The worst logs I've seen are on the order of 3k combines. <br />
