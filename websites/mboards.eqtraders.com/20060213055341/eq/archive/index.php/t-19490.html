<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khaarq</div><div class="date">12-04-2004, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently seeking to have the following combines attempted:<br />
<br />
Ice Cream Churn (For personal use. I have 3 Boot Gaskets and 1 Icy Gelidran Hide. I will purchase the NPC items prior to the combines)<br />
<br />
Yellow Diamond of Valor (For a gift*. I have the Metallic Liquid and will purchase or donate for a Raw Diamond)<br />
<br />
White Diamond of Justice (For a gift*. I have the Alkaline Etched Stone and will purchase or donate for a Raw Diamond)<br />
<br />
Various research combines (For future skill/final product may be sold to recover costs or further my skills. I have a small assortment of pieces to make swatches for cultural tailoring)<br />
<br />
I can be contacted here or in game. Best bet is that I'll be on Khaarq or Korane, but all my chars join the channel.<br />
<br />
* - I have an intended recipient, whom I haven't seen recently. My intention is to use this item as a gift for that friend. If I can't find him or can verify that he is no longer playing, I would put the item up for sale in the bazaar. That being said, I am willing to make a reasonable donation to the caster. I do not wish to take advantage of my fellow tradeskillers to turn a profit in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />
