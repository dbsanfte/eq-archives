<br />
<br />

<br />
i am officalyl quitting EQ , and ive played sense march of 1999.<br />
<br />
that was the most  uncalled for  thing in a game EVER.<br />

I assume you did not have a trade skill over 200, or if so that you trained the AA to take another trade over 200?  I did kinda the same thing.  I had the 3AA, and I started working on pottery.  I was already through most of a stack w/o a combine before I realized that I had not trained the AA yet.  Just my 2 copper pieces worth.  :&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>zurrvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">im levle 65  with max AA , except for the new Gates of discrod ones. <br />
<br />
i am over 200 in all skills  and at 200 in smithing<br />
<br />
thus is spent 3 months getting supplies for  the 460 combines i did, and got  ZERO skill ups,  i petitioned for a gm ,  nto even a gm will respond  and its been 17 hours now.<br />
<br />
this is  BEYONd uncalled for.  <br />
<br />
PS ;  yes i  waited till today to do the 460 combines, becouse i wanted to use the new ui system.   <br />
<br />
obvisouly ITS BROKEN !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Your AAs, level and stats other then the highest of STR/INT/WIS are irrelevant.  I would advise you to watch the attitude, as you won't get any sympathy from this crowd.  We've all been there.  We've all had long dry patches of no skill ups.  It's normal.  It sucks, but it's normal.  If this is driving you to quit EQ, I'd advise quitting tradeskills now, as it doesn't get any easier.</div></div><hr />

You think what you just said  , does not  deserve a post<br />
<br />
THE UI OR THE SMITHING ITSELF IS BROKEN:<br />
<br />
<br />
Your a fool if you think 460 attempts with no skill up is normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think something is broken, but it certainly isn't the new UI.  I did smithing last night, got 1 skill up, using the new UI.  I did smithing the night before last and got 1 skill up, using the new UI.  I now own 20 more mistletoe sickles, would you like to buy them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>zurrvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">GM , finnaly just contacted me in game,   he said the Smithing and pottery  tradeskills are broken .<br />

No attacking or insulting other players (and calling them stupid is an insult!!!!!)<br />

NO more warnings.<br />

I know you are upset right now, but we still expect you to behave.<br />
<br />
This goes for EVERYONE!!!!! no more warnings!!!!  Next insult I see on these boards the person is banned... long time user or new user.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Zurrvan, chill out or you will most likely find yourself banned here.  Expressing your frustration is fine.  Insulting others is strictly against EQTraders rules.<br />
<br />
As to your streak ... let's check the obvious.  Did you invest an additional 3AA into NTCM?  You should now have 6 levels total if you did.  I know you said max AA, but this is worth double-checking; it's far too easy to miss.<br />
<br />
Other than that, it's luck.  There was one guy not too long ago who had over 1200 (!) combines without a skillup.  Bad luck happens.  Put the mouse down, walk away from the PC, and calm down.  You're just going to give yourself a heart attack at this rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wow, it's hard to give advise to somebody so angry but here goes.<br />
<br />
The RNG is very fickle. if you have had all those other skills maxed out then you know this. As for longest streak without a skill-up? Longest I personally have had was 1034 trying to get from 200 to 201 in a skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">how are smithing and pottery broken?  what did the gm say. <br />
<br />
go  :fishin: you'll feel better.  someplace like cs where you can chill.  i've had a 200 stretch.  its not often but it does happen.  one guy went 673 combines on wyven and took it better than you are.<br />
<br />
oh and this should be in primal scream.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>zurrvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">He said, Smithing and pottery are not giving people skill ups. <br />
<br />
They posted this on EQlive website now,  along with the  casino and  tribute system npcs  taking out of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>zurrvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Most i eve went was 202 combines before a skill up,  460 was  outrageous,  for other people to have even more than that , well i dont belive you, but i dont disbeleive you now .<br />
<br />
However with the gm's comments  a short while ago,  i will stick to my guns and say 460 combines with no skill up is  no way correct.. <br />
<br />
i would never have gotten all my  other tradeskills maxed if that was the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">didn't get any smithing skill ups on a stack the other day but got to 135 pottery last night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">it's broken but i've gotten 2 smithing skill ups, using the new UI, in the past two days, on two stacks of sickles.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bregalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Try Enchanted Velium Bits.  (2 pieces of velium + voldain velium temper + enchant velium spell scroll) - they triv at 222, and I had the most remarkable luck skilling up on them.<br />
Also, I found that doing short sessions here and there is WAY better than long streaks.<br />
<br />
From memory, my recent smithing runs, doing EVBs:<br />
25 combines: 214,215,216<br />
9 combines: 213<br />
8 combines: 211,212<br />
18 combines: 210<br />
12 combines: 209<br />
<br />
That is 8 skillups on last 72 combines.  I went 198-207 on EVBs as well, averaging one skillup per ~15 combines.<br />
<br />
Essentially, having some free time, I'd go to Crystal caves, and slaughter orcs.  Any gems, vendorbait and velium weapons, I stash too, and sell them at in-zone dorftown as space grows short.  In about an hour, I'll usually have enough velium for 10-15 combines - and have made enough cash to cover temper and scroll costs.  So essentially, it's a no-cost skillup route for me.  Unfortunately, after another 6 skillups, I'll have to switch to something else.<br />
<br />
For the record, at 207, I made a sweep through bazaar, buying up all LDoN temper components costing less than 30pp, ending up with enough for 60 combines - and did all 60 at once.  That stint cost me over 2kpp, and earned me one lousy skillup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">link please.  looked at eqlive and couldn't find it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Whatch the insults people!!! (see my edit above)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sulkano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Dang, you broke my record of 418 combines with no skill ups :p <br />
Btw...skill up rate on shadowscream has always been bad, I finished 230-250 with sickles/ tae ew, though that was before LDON</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Still have a ways to go to top the record for non trivial smithing combines without a skill up.  Got 3 more on 3 stacks of LDoN tempers last night, not broken at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Thicket Tundrabog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I got 5 skillups on 100 Shadowscream combines (234 - 239) using the new tradeskill interface a few hours after GoD went live. Maybe smithing is broken now, but it certainly wasn't broken then.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Abazagaroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Funny, I see no notice anywhere on eqlive site regarding tradeskills being broken, and people in this thread mention getting skill ups in those very skills.<br />
<br />
I had one 360 or so smithing dry spell once, 200+ dryspells are common, and I know someone personally that had a 1240+ dry spell in brewing once. Suck it up and move on. Insulting people sure won't change things.<br />
<br />
Oh, and please link us the place where they say skill ups on those tradeskills are broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well...<br />
<br />
I received a skill-up while doing some Shadowscream Gauntlets.<br />
<br />
Made the first one to &quot;learn&quot; the recipie, then got the skill-up on the third combine after.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Madrel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Zurrvan,<br />
<br />
My personal &quot;best&quot; as far as dry spells is 632 combines with no skillups, going from 214 to 215 in smithing. It happens, and it SUCKS.<br />
<br />
It is frustrating; I feel your pain. Given that other people are reporting skillups in those tradeskills, my guess is that you had an extremely bad run with the RNG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Rissenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I did 25 combines yesterday of Enchanted Velium..2 skill-ups from 193 to 195...Comp has been on and nothing has been downloaded since patch. <br />
<br />
Smithing is not broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I didnt' read all this, but I wanted to say that I've skilled up from 204 to 214 in the past week...<br />
<br />
Smithing is quite obviously giving skill ups... 3 of those points were in the last 3 days...<br />
<br />
Smithing not broken *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I'm sure it's not broken, but a run of 500 combines without a skill up would drive me mad! You have my extreme sympathy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Bigtoxic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">if you cant scream  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>TheGiantOne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Hmm...<br />
<br />
Been there and done that.  My worst was in smithing in shadowscream a while back 786 combines and no skillups.   After that I said goodbye to that path and chose another path to do the skillups.  So we have all in whatever skills been there and suffered.  No reason to quit the entire game.<br />
<br />
Go and kill something BIG out there.  That will kill the frustration I know you are feeling.<br />
<br />
The RNG has worse odds than Vegas.  It will never give you 98.1% in skillups.  You are lucky if its 5% success ratio using the RNG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He can scream and did so.<br />
<br />
But he reported something as &quot;broken&quot; which seems to not be, that is all we really object to :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>baody</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I'm having a terrible, terrible time getting a tailoring skill up past 238. I haven't been keeping track of numbers, but I've done at least 100 of them. I agree that is is very depressing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Anaxo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Seriously, if you are going that long without skillups, take a break and walk around. When I start hitting 100 with no raises, I will move my character around and get away from the keyboard a short while, to 'break' the RNG out of its streak. It probably doesn't work, being just tradeskill superstition, but it sure makes me feel better. ;)</div></div><hr />
