<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rumblebore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have read through many posts and the FAQ’s here at EQTraders and also The Economical Guide to Smithing Ver 6.0 and think I have an answer to my question.  I would like to post it here and answer it myself, and get feedback as to if I figured it out correctly.<br />
<br />
Statement followed by The Question: I have Smithing Skill 189, Brewing 194 and am GM Jewelcraft (250; w/Eyeglass Trophy) but have not yet purchased the AA to allow myself to proceed past 200 in Smithing.  In order to produce my first piece of Ornate Equipment for my Level 62 Paladin, I wanted to try combines to produce the Ethereal Temper (Trivial 212) so that I could then combine for Ethereal Sheet Metal (Trivial 212). I am using a Geerlok Hammer. However, I was blocked from combining with a message saying I am too low to attempt such combines.  The Question: Is it because I am not able to proceed past skill 200 that I am blocked from combining?<br />
<br />
Answer: Yes. <br />
<br />
Ethereal rings are interesting because they trivial at level 212, but you cannot even make them until your smithing skill is level 220. This would seem like a silly thing to try to skill on, but if you have a geerlok or other 5% skill enhancement item, the forge will allow you to make these items when you are actually level 210. It counts modified skill level for the purposes of<br />
manufacture.<br />
(If you are lucky enough to have a 10% skill enhancing item, you can make ethereal rings from<br />
200 to 212. If you have 15%, you can start making them as early as level 192).  <br />
<br />
(Source - The Economical Guide to Smithing Ver 6.0)<br />
<br />
Based on this info, it is a combination of this ‘limitation’ to be able to craft such items until my Smithing skill rises to 220 (without enhancement item) as well as not having the AA to cross the 200 barrier for the tradeskill Blacksmithing.<br />
<br />
Please advise if I am at least close to correct and any links to posts here or elsewhere that specifically outline this.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds to me that you got it right.  Geerloks are cheap though, so I would consider the skill of 210 the magic level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taushar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As far as I can tell, you can combine these if your modified skills is 220 or above, has nothing to do with your AA abilities. There is a hammer that drops that gives 15% modification and I have known people below 200 who can combine these using that hammer (I believe with 15% you can start combining at 192). So I think the simple answer is that as long as you have modified skills above 220, you can make those.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did you know that since the sheets are droppable, you can buy them in the bazaar and still do the final combine?  :D</div></div><hr />

You know, I was about to mention that.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I know I can buy them at the bazaar (and as of today - I did).  My hope and intent is always to be a bit more self sufficient and not reliant on others to create the items I need when my skills are close enough to make the attempt.  Sure, buying is probably cheaper in the long run, what with failed combines, but it isn't as fun as watching a successful combine (or even a failure) net me that coveted skill point up.  You never know when the random will fall in your favor.<br />
<br />
 ;) <br />
<br />
Oh well - back to Torden to work on AA's again *sigh*<br />
