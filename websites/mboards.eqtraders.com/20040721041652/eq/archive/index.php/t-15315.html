Unless youre a chanter, do you REALLY need the 50CHA?<br />
<br />
An Idol of the Wavecrasher is probably far cheaper and has far more important stats.<br />
And the 25 CHA mugs are cheap as dirt.<br />
<br />
Trophy = worthless.<br />
<br />
And yes, i have one myself (got in on the first try, nyeah) so i can call it worthless if i want to.</div></div><hr />

Unless youre a chanter, do you REALLY need the 50CHA?Yes, because I'm lazy, and only having to switch out 1 item makes my life a surprisingly large amount easier/simpler. (the 2-mug thing isn't *that* many more clicks, but I for some reason find it really annoying.  And if you mess it up while interchanging with a 2hander, can add a few more steps while you figure out what you did wrong while you come out of auto-pilot).<br />
<br />
Sure, I could make a case for 50cha for Pacify resist aggro (which I actually do use the trophy for on occasion, when I *really* can't chance it going wrong) or for Divine Intervention being more likely to go off, but those are just &quot;little perks&quot; and not what *I* primarily use the 50cha for, so I'd feel wrong trying to sell them as worthwhile (I know some people who do value the trophy for those two cases, though).<br />
<br />
For me:<br />
#1 reason for trophy was the satisfaction of having it.<br />
#2 the convience (woohoo, 50cha!)<br />
#3 bag (permanent 100WR [at the time, only had handmade + rallic + EE and usually ran just under weight limit, so this was a BIG help.  I've grown to love it as a &quot;disposable&quot; bag, that I can destroy without any monetary loss, and only costing the time to get to/from the bazaar.  Useful for making room for quest &amp; tradeskill containers], plus finally an ability to summon temporary bags for certain circumstances).<br />
#4 the stats (10str 10wis was a LOT for me back then)<br />
<br />
I got mine on my 3rd try (~10kpp, overall), so I really don't have anything to complain about.  Definitely feel ... pity? sorrow? what's the proper word?  for those with so many failures on the trophy :(  The trophies can mean a lot to people (for various reasons), and they cost a big chunk of cash (for many people, at least - to some, 3k/attempt is cheap/chumpchange).<br />
<br />
Goodluck with #10, B_Delacroix!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nitpaac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ah, tough luck, Baptismo.<br />
<br />
But still, you helped me with this post.<br />
Failed 5 in a row yesterday and thought this was horrible.<br />
But then, there's always someone to top you in EQ :)<br />
<br />
Good luck to anyone out there doing their trophies.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

P.S: Yes, it may be not the best item for that price, but hey, it's the Trophy . Tradeskilling isn't reasonable most times, why should the trophy be?<br />
<br />
[Edit: Prepared four more artisan's seals with my last money, and made it first try. There is hope out there :) ]</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Psst...  I made my Smithing Trophy on the first try at skill 242 (+Geerlok to hit the max).&quot;<br />
<br />
*Angelsyn starts to sneak out again, then stops and looks back.*<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, and Keyne made her Baking Trophy on the first try too.&quot;<br />
<br />
*Angelsyn winks, then gates the heck outta there!*</div></div><hr />
