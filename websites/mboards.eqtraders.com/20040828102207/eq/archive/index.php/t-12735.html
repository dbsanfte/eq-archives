<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Edit: Well, I'm still angry, but less so, seeing as how finishing up my finals has relieved a heck of a lot of stress. The Computer &quot;Service&quot; people have been angering me since Thanksgiving, so the strength of this rant has been a good three weeks in the making. I'll tone down the unnecessary frills, but I do want to know... does it get better when I start dealing with 'real' people? <br />
<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Alright, I'm freaking fed up. These morons down in Computer Disservices have poked me one too many times, and the penguin is about to expload again. <br />
<br />
When I get OUT of this coffin called college, and get a 'real' Internet Service Provider, can I expect them to provice better service than this?? I get disconnected, at the least, once inside a given 24 hours, with no way to know when and plan accordingly, nor control it. Attempting to log-out and re-sign-in does NOTHING; I will still be unexpectedly and unpredictably disconnected. Service will drop for half a day with no warning and no explaination. Often I will disconnect every 30-45 min for 4+ hours. Sometimes even every 10-15 min. They are nearly uncontact-able, or if I ever do, I get a 'we/they are working on it,' BS response. <br />
<br />
And I thought SOE had communication issues: at least they tell us what THEY think we should know. These assmunches don't even do that. <br />
<br />
The actual question I do want an answer to, in the middle of all this is: <br />
<br />
When I start paying a REAL company to give me REAL service, can I expect honest-to-freaking-Pete REAL SERVICE?  Can I expect to have a phone number that I can call and get someone who at least knows KINDA what's going on? Maybe even be able to tell me what the REAL problem is, and give me an honest ETA? And if they don't know, have the balls to say they don't know?? <br />
<br />
<br />
Or have I been living in a dream world for too long? /grrrrr<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(And you know what's just too hilarious for any swear word, ever? I was disconnected while typing this. /grrrrrrrr.) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lyron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To a certain extent, ISP accountability does exist in the real world, for the simple reason that if you are not treated fairly, you can take your little red wagon to another ISP.<br />
<br />
Of course, this doesn't always work.  My cable broadband access (the only broadband at te time) was VERY shoddy until DSL moved into my neighborhood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">To answer your question... no.<br />
<br />
I went through a two month period when every time my wife went on a raid, I'd get a denial of service attack launched against me.  My ISP verified that someone was shoving a half a megabit per second at me, but wouldn't tell me who since it wasn't their problem. After upgrading our router and installing a log daemon on one of our PCs, we had it narrowed down to several ISPs who we thought it could be.  Calls to technical support for attempts to track this from their end were met with nothing since it wasn't their problem. REPEATED requests to our ISP to have our IP reset were ignored since they couldn't do that (the person launching the attacks was the MB admin for wife's old guild and got our address for wife's posts).  It was even escalated twice so more senior people could tell us they wouldn't help.<br />
<br />
Despite the fact that someone was OBVIOUSLY watching my wife's character (the attacks would start as soon as she zoned into raid zones and stopped as soon as she went LD) Sony refused to do anything about it.  Even though we supplied the guild that was probably instigating this and offered to supply a range of IP addresses to see if anyone from that guild was logged in from that range - we personally didn't give a **** who it was we just wanted it to stop, they refused to help because it wasn't their problem.<br />
<br />
So for two months I couldn't play, and no one would help because it wasn't their problem.<br />
<br />
We ended up upgrading our line speed and getting more static addresses (new ones, huzzah), as well as paying for anonymizer to hide the new addresses.  We suspected the guy doing to attacks worked at tech support at an ISP, we found out our suspects real name, called tech support, verified he worked there then told the manager of tech support what his techs did in their spare time.  The suspect then posted his retirement from EQ and how he was &quot;pursuing another work opportunity&quot; and wouldn't have time to play as much.<br />
<br />
When I say we, my wife did most of the leg work and learned more about internet security and firewalls than she really ever wanted to know.<br />
<br />
But yea, it doesn't get any better.  I used to do phone support and call a lot of phone support.  It's nasty work from both ends of the phone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">While ge3tting a person that knows something is *NOT* likely...<br />
<br />
What you can (often) get is a refund for the day for the drop in service :)<br />
<br />
So...  there is something you can do at least :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nepper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Unfortunately, beeing an ex-tech for a major DSL ISP, I can tell you that there is no guarantee of good service.  While I worked the floor of said ISP for a few years at various levels, at any given time there were 150+ &quot;techs&quot; there, and only about 15-20 of which could solve any REAL problems (other than the usual monkey-type troubleshooting for grandma who thinks turning the monitor on and off is re-booting the PC.  Yes, it happens more than you would believe)<br />
The amount of service/accountability/levels of techs (junior/senior/I know enough not to want my MCSE/etc) depends on the company, and price is a factor.<br />
The people you are talking to are usually not technically trained, and are following pre-written troubleshooting for the most common problems (95%) of the call volume.  This keeps their overall cost to employ techs down = more techs on the floor = less whining about wait times for techs on the phone.  If they hired actuall, knowledgeable techs, they would not be able to have enough people to answer the phones within a decent amount of time (and at 150-250 during normal periods, adn 500+ during peak, that can still be a 45+ min. wait)  unless they jacked teh price up considerably!  Don't expect to get a good tech for an off-the-wall problem unless you're lucky.  But hey, they are out there.<br />
My suggestion, find a DSL provider that works on a dynamic IP basis (to avoid problems such as the one above) with an infrastructure that's been around long enough to be stable, or go BB and get a decent firewall/router/ip maskarading software to handle any problems you encounter, and pick up a book.  Remember, if the lights aren't on on your modem, check the power supply before calling tech support.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you!</div></div><hr />

If you have trouble... and call them, they tell you there is nothing they can do right now but they'll be happy to send a tech out next week.<br />
<br />
Of course if you're not having that problem next week, YOU get charged for a service call.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rhisk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">LOL, Mediacom cable took lessons from Comcast/AT&amp;T...<br />
<br />
What is even funnier is that Mediacom leases lines from AT&amp;T for the long hauls.  <br />
<br />
But seriously, ISP Techs in general (there are exceptions to this statement) know nothing.  Like its been pointed out, they have scripts.<br />
<br />
If you go dial up, you can usually get better service from the small, local providers, but then you are stuck with dial up.  ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZz<br />
<br />
Basically all the Broadband companies are part of Bigger Companies...  So, instead of getting local service from local people that understand local issues, you get Joe from Timbuktu reading from the same script that the 30000 other techs in the big room are all reading from.  Heaven forbid your problem isn't covered by the script.  <br />
<br />
And yes, quite often, if you have a REAL problem (one that doesn't fall into the script) you often get told that it will be a week before a tech can come out.<br />
<br />
However, every once in a great while, the tech that answers the phone actually knows what they are talking about... don't worry, they won't be there the next week, they never are.  Those techs are like a breath of fresh air.  Don't get used to them, don't ever expect them, but you will learn to appreciate them when they do answer the phone.<br />
<br />
I have dealt with broadband companies in Chicago, New York, Daytona Florida, Las Vegas, Reno, and all over California.  Doesn't matter, they are all the same, wouldn't suprise me if all the tech lines ring in the same place, regardless of company, because I swear they are ALL reading from the same script.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unplug the Modem from power.&quot;<br />
<br />
OK<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait about 30 seconds&quot;<br />
<br />
........OK<br />
<br />
&quot;Plug it back in&quot;<br />
<br />
OK<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you get lock?&quot;<br />
<br />
No<br />

&quot;Oh, well, we can have a tech out there January of 2006, are you going to be home??&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
*sigh*   I love people who bad mouth the techs.   When we give you the troubleshooting steps that solve a good 70% of people's problems,  we get the &quot;That wont help!&quot;   &quot;I can't do that&quot;.   &quot;It's your job to fix it, I'm not troubleshooting&quot;.<br />
<br />
And when it comes time, and people demand that we send a truck, they give us a 2 hour a month timeframe in which they're home.    They call in at 11pm, not realizing that our drivers have their orders for tomorrow, and they want someone out there  by midnight.    And tells us that Any time between 7am-11pm Monday through Saturday is impossible, because everyone in their family is working.  <br />
<br />
Trust me,  you customers have just as many knuckleheads as we techs do.  And no, we don't normally read from a script.   I've worked in half a dozen call centers, and we have a general checklist of things we need to check, to make sure we've covered all the bases.   Most of us develop a standard procedure, because we deal with 40-100 calls a day.    I challenge you to do an irritating process with someone who fights you all the way , 50 times a day and not find a way to make it as routine and painless as possible.<br />

If you have trouble... and call [Comcast], they tell you there is nothing they can do right now but they'll be happy to send a tech out next week. <br />
<br />
While the Comcast call centers have been utterly useless (other than the occasional automated &quot;We know the system's down&quot; message before they ask you if you really want to talk to a tech, so I know the problem's not on my end), the tech's they've sent out have been quite useful.<br />
<br />
They've wound up redoing a large number of the coaxial connectors in the house, work on the telephone pole where our line splits off, modifying the attributes of our account, and who-knows-what else, but whenever a tech actually comes out here, problems go away for a few weeks ;)<br />
<br />
Sure, inevitably problems arise again (often the same ones ...), but at least there is benefit to the techs.<br />
<br />
I just wish Comcast would be a bit more reliable - the number of outages we've had in the past year and a half has gotten rather frustrating - if any of it is &quot;scheduled&quot; they definitely haven't provided a means to find out.  Losing the net for a few hours, or more often 12-24 hours, a few times a month gets really irritating.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Is there an issue with paying someone to provide you with internet access now, for when the college service doesn't work? Or simply to use all the time? I have cable service for most of the time, and a dialup account for when I'm away from home with the lappy, or the 2-3 times a quarter that cable goes down for an hour or two.<br />
<br />
Free is worth what it costs.<br />
<br />
Oh..and just a note, the cable company here requires their techs to go through basic troubleshooting before scheduling a truck roll. So even if the tech knows straight off that a roll is needed, they still have to ask you 5-10 questions and go through a basic step or two with you. Even if it only saves 1 truck roll out of 500 when they miss an easy solution, that's quite a bit of savings. <br />
<br />
Basically all the Broadband companies are part of Bigger Companies... So, instead of getting local service from local people that understand local issues, you get Joe from Timbuktu reading from the same script that the 30000 other techs in the big room are all reading from. <br />
<br />
And surely only a &quot;local person&quot; can understand your local Linksys router; no one who didn't grow up in California knows where San Diego is; and if you don't live in Texas, you've never heard of a Dell computer.  And just how many ways do you want people to say &quot;have you powered down the computer completely and turned it back on since the problem began&quot; anyhow? <br />
<br />
So what is it with people complaining about &quot;scripts&quot; in tech support? Do you complain that every darn time you go to the doctor for your heart, that son of a gun wants to take your blood pressure like it's part of a script? How about the grocery store, they always tell you the total and then ask for the payment, not vice versa! It's a script too!  Seriously-- most of the common problems have a common thread of diagnosis and solution, and after asking the same questions 1000 times a month for X months, someone may actually sound like this isn't the very first time in the world that they've ever asked the question.<br />
<br />
Your tech problems are not unique, any more than you are the sickest person in the world or your children are the cutest ever. While you can expect sympathy or appreciation in appropriate amounts-- your problems are not unique and you don't deserve the Medal of Honor for putting up with them.  You do deserve assistance from someone who is courteous and knowledgeable, but you aren't allowed to insist on an all-new way for the technician to tell you &quot;Let's do X, like I did with the previous 200 people who had this problem, and for 104 of them, it fixed it.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
Nhinx &quot;the lag meter's conning red again&quot; Aphsion<br />
&quot;For me to assist you with this problem, right now I need to give the instructions and you need to go through them with me, okay?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
most likely they are forbidden from having the access through anyone other than the college. Dialup would probably work, if it's her own phone line, but having a Cable/DSL provider come out to your dorm (assumation...) is probably a big no-no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rhisk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lilosh, <br />
<br />
I didn't mean for anyone to take that personally.  <br />
<br />
I have worked a call center, I have done on site tech calls.<br />
<br />
I know the whole story.  I know all about stupid customers (yes, the power cords not being plugged in, power strips being turned off, monitors not turned on, every dumb problem you could imagine).  And boy do I know the people who complain you can't have a tech there 20 minutes ago. <br />
<br />
However, now I am a customer, and as a general rule I think that big company call centers/service leaves a lot to be desired.<br />
<br />
OK, no scripts, but what are checklists but scripts that allow minimal variation.  And yes, it becomes a dull droll routine.   But when I am having problems, the LAST THING I want is the guy I am talking to for support sounds like he would rather be watching Mtv.  <br />
<br />
And if my service is completely down (I never get small problems) I do fully expect a tech to be there as soon as possible.  And yes, since I am unable to use their product at all I would think that my problem would rate higher up the scale than someone who has a slow connection issue.  And yes, when I call on a Thursday and say they can't possibly get a tech out their until Next Friday I think its ridiculous, however Monday isn't an unreasonable hope.  If the company takes that long to service a paying customer then they need to hire more techs, simple as that.<br />
<br />
And to totally honest, I don't blame the support people for being bored with their jobs, it is.  I also don't blame the support people or the techs for scheduling problems.  Nothing can be done to make phone support more exciting, its wait for POed customers to call and scream at you, fun fun fun.  However, the scheduling thing is entirely the big companies fault. <br />
<br />
If anyone wants to read my rant about big businesses and poor customer service, it will be on my website sometime in January (my current rant is seasonal, so I have to wait until after the holidays to change it).    <br />
<br />
So again, I say that IN MY EXPERIENCE, the Broadband companies that I personally have delt with have just blown at customer service, specifically poor phone support and timeliness of scheduled on-site service.   And I point out that if I have never delt with you or a company you work with, then don't sweat my stories because obviously they don't apply to you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No worries.  Your post was kind of provoking to read, but it was more the imagined attitude behind it that set me off.    It seemed that you were implying that 99% of techs were reading from a book instead of &quot;fixing MY problem!&quot;.    It's a common enough attitude that I used to see.  <br />
<br />
   Every customer is convinced that there is some EASY, Simple solution to their problem (Their problem being unique and something we've NEVER heard of before..  You know , like losing a connection, or something) that we are just REFUSING to do, and insist on wasting their time with all of this &quot;Troubleshooting&quot; that we enjoy doing to confuse them.  <br />
<br />
    Trust me, if 1,2, or 3 experiences is what make people (not you,  as you're more experienced than most) think that all technicians are lazy, stupid, and lord knows what,  I'd LOVE to see what 4 years in tech Support on the other side of the phones would do to people.<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
    As something of a  related side note:  <br />
<br />
<br />
   Tech Support is on my list of &quot;In a fair world, everyone would be forced to have this job for 6-12 months&quot;.    Right along with Retail, Fast Food, and Customer Service for a bank.  I think it would be a wide-open eye opener for folks to realize that what takes up 5-10 minutes of their day is significantly more difficult and riddled with innane rules, complicated restrctrictions, and annoying people than they know.  It's suprising how difficult it can be to &quot;Just get me through this line&quot;   &quot; Just bring me my food&quot; or &quot;Just tell me my balance&quot; can be than most would believe.<br />
<br />
    I've timed it, and most people's morale, and theories about &quot;Treating people like unique and color snowflakes, explaining every problem until the customer understands it, and treat every problem as an opportunity&quot; last somewhere between 1-3 months before people start getting frustrated and regress into &quot;I'm going to get this call done efficiently, quickly, and with the least effort possible&quot; after being yelled at for 15 minutes straight by a Pointy Headed boss and your 8th straight customer of the morning.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry to derail, but It's early and my thoughts flow in an odd pattern, I suppose.<br />

I used to have them, they went downhill after Excite went under.  Their typical troubleshooting:<br />

2) Unplug the modem for 6 minutes<br />
3) Check the network settings (OK, an actual real troubleshooting step!)<br />
4) Reboot the computer (again)<br />

Most outages lasted less than 10 minutes, so 99% of the time that *seemed* to fix it (even though it was a coincidence).<br />

I'll never bad mouth techs in general.  In fact, I'll praise (and write letters) about good techs.<br />

I'll probably have loopy dreams too... I swear last night, I had a dream about how the Paladin became a Shadowknight (and of course it was highly influenced by LOTR:ROTK which is an incredible movie btw). The one question I have, from the dream, is... why was I the Cleric?? o_0  Silly Paladin goes oor of cheal and gets bitten by Evil and becomes a Shadowknight... serves him right. /nod. ^_^ (And of course Evil comes after the Cleric next, heh.) <br />

/hugs for everyone for being kind when I need a bit of kindness.  And, er, beware of me if for some odd reason you see me on the boards or in game today...

Loopy drugs are fun, especially when they take blood, raising the concentration of loopiness higher.  Plus it's LEGAL!!!<br />

And all this comes after they a) lied about which dorms were going to be offline during their 'upgrade' over Thanksgiving, <br />

Was it posible they made a mistake... you know mistakes...  or even a comunications breakdown within their ranks?<br />
b) they lied about when service was going to be back (If it's going to be Sunday evening, just SAY that, not 'by Saturday noon'),  <br />
And this is similar... maybe they ran into problems that they did not anticipate during the upgrade?  Maybee the tech that made the upgrade plan did not anticipate something... or was more highly skilled than the person that did the upgrade?<br />
<br />
For timing issues like this... I truely doubt they &quot;lied&quot;  Stuff happens that causes delays.  They made an estimate (I won't say it is their best estimate... just an estimate) and they were WRONG... as simple as that... I truly doubt they purposelly LIED.<br />
<br />
Now part C does suck :)  It should be better not worse after an upgrade! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">YAY ME. They did not have to take blood. Maybe in a month, but not today. /WHEW. This also means no loopy medicine today. SOOO Happy. And thanks for the /hugs ^_^ muuuuchly appreciated. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And Ngreth Sir: Yes, they did lie about which dorms were going to be affected. The official-type release-statement as linked on the email page in large red letters originally stated that my dorm (and others around) would not be cut. LATER, they reneged. Without telling anyone beforehand. Like me. <br />
<br />
If they would have told me in the FIRST place that they would be cutting the net service, I could have made plans to move my computer to someplace where I had internet and could have gotten something USEful done over the break, like research for the dance paper. Why I had to write a paper for Dance 1003 I still don't know. /shrug. But anyway, they did lie, they made no efforts to re-inform, nor do they ever bother to tell us what is going on. <br />
<br />
THAT is what gets me: Lack of (honest) communication. It always happens. My uni refuses to communicate on their own, like telling me/us what's going on, or in some departments, they WILL outright lie and screw students over in the name of money. IE, never ask my bf about his ordeal with Housing. I am paying these people... for what? To deal with red tape, wool, and deception. It just kinda makes me mad, not to mention depressed about dealing with real life. Are real life people as aggrivating as this? Do they lie, cheat, steal? Because that's what I'm seeing so far. <br />
<br />
<br />
I dunno. At the moment I am neither at the dorm nor on loopydrugs and minus some blood, so I'm pretty happy. But I will have to deal with these morons for another 2-3 semesters, so that's kind of a dampener. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone ^_^ /hugs are nice. /hugs to all, they fix everything. I hope. ^_^<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Nhin Impious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Cubwynn is right, the dorm does not allow me to 'outsource' my isp. Thus, they get to jack us around and not feel like they have to tell us things. <br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but exactly...how do they keep you from signing up for a dialup account? Do they not have phone jacks in the walls?<br />
<br />
If you can't tell me, that's okay. And I'm not suggesting you switch entirely to dialup, just that I have a dialup account as a backup for when cable isn't working, because this household does depend on its internet connection.<br />
<br />
But when I am having problems, the LAST THING I want is the guy I am talking to for support sounds like he would rather be watching Mtv. <br />
<br />
No, when I'm having problems, the last thing I want is a tech who doesn't know their stuff.  Unfortunately for the world, not everyone with good troubleshooting ability has good phone voice and the ability to sound excited and pleasant on every single call, even after 49 calls of the day have been completed. Like everyone else, we get upset when yelled at, sound tired when tired, or maybe even sound like we don't want to be there because we have no choice but to come in or get fired (position at one of the jobs I've had was like that, after a few absences.)<br />
<br />
You want pleasant-sounding techs? Support companies that treat their employees like human beings, for one; that'll fix 90% of the problem. And for the rest, understand that sometimes people do have bad days. Life isn't about getting cheerfully pleasant people to interact with you in every single situation; it's about working with the folks you can to get done what you need to.<br />
<br />
Maybe your words hit a little close to home because tonight, I have to work (medical support, not tech; I'm one of two people that can do my job, and the other one works another shift and is there already.) There's no one who can cover my shift and it HAS to be done. I know I won't sound great, and there may be times when I may sound like I don't want to be there. But it's not because I'd &quot;rather be watching MTv.&quot; It's because my beloved grandmother passed away last night, I've been crying off and on all day, and I'm pretty tired (and hoarse).  Sometimes the people you talk to don't lead perfect lives, and you (generic) really have got to recognize that we're human beings, with events above and beyond what we do with the headset on.  <br />
<br />
I hope that the people I talk to tonight share my views, and not yours.  I would hate for them to think that I sound less than happy to be there because of THEM, because that's not it at all.  I don't want you to think that, either.  You've done the job, and maybe you've had to go to work in the middle of being sick, or upset-- just give people the benefit of the doubt, ok?<br />

I don't mean everything is fine. I'm sad, I'm grieving, but... this was her favorite time of the year. She certainly wouldn't mind that in between the waves of tears, there are times of laughing and remembering all the good times we've had.<br />
<br />
She had all her holiday shopping done, so in less than a week I get to see what she got me, and the kidlet.. I'm sorry that she's going to miss out on my present, but my grandfather should enjoy it, at least.  And as a final gift-- her services are on Tuesday, so I'm actually off work for three days-- this is the first Christmas I've ever had off to spend with my family.<br />
<br />
And one final more-on-topic thing... after working as an insurance agent for many many years and doing a lot of business over the phone, my grandmother retired to run a bookstore with no phone. When asked by customers, &quot;Why don't you have a phone?&quot; she would answer, with a smile, <br />
<br />
&quot;Because you'd call me. And then I'd have to answer it, and who said I wanted to talk to you?&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Aandaie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I've been happy with cox for cable internet.<br />
<br />
Its quite good for the most part, with 99.9 percent uptime or more. Once every few weeks there may be an outage for a bit but its around 3 am usually, maintenence stuff I think. There is a number to call at such times where the person tells you this, easy to get through at that time ;)<br />
<br />
Even on a day of a horrible ice storm here, regular cable was only out for an hour or so off and on with internet a bit more.<br />

KIZTENT:<br />
<br />
Ahaha what a sad story. A person actually took the time to flood your wife, how sad. Its like flashing back to 1990 or something.<br />
<br />
Just wondering, do you have something like zone alarm installed? I thought by default it would stop all such things, in connection with upgrading your software tcp etc with windows update.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Stuff like ZoneAlarm wouldn't really help in Kiztent's case.  <br />
<br />
ZoneAlarm (and most other firewalls on the market for home use, whether software or hardware based) are designed to block and filter out the odd incoming attack message, or at least undesirable ones.  In the normal course of using the Internet, this will be a tiny fraction of 1% of all the data you send and receive.<br />
<br />
What Kiz had happen is called a denial of service attack.  Basically, the attacker floods so much garbage data into your connection that that the &quot;real&quot; data (EQ messages, in this case) just can't get through.  This can only be stopped at the ISP level by reprogramming their firewall or router.<br />
<br />
In a case like this, particularly when it's ongoing for months, I would have done two things.  First, I'd have called the police.  Second, I would have had a lawyer send the concerned ISPs a letter.  Getting an inquiry from the police about why one of their clients is getting &quot;hacked&quot; -- the police may not get the techincal intricacies, but they know &quot;hacking&quot; is a Bad Thing(tm) and a crime that under current statutes could well be interpreted as a terrorist act, with its attendant penalties -- followed by the threat of a civil suit for damages from the lawyer, would have gotten the ISP's to correct the problem within 24 hours, and probably landed your attacker in jail to boot.<br />
<br />
Edit: Heck, they could probably arrest the guy on stalking charges if they could show he was specifically targetting you with malicious intent.  That basically eliminates the vagueness of the &quot;hack&quot; attack and puts it squarely in the jurisdiction of your local police department.</div></div><hr />
