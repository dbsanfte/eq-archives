<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PeatMoss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The Alchemy FAQ says there is not an invisibility potion.  This is not true anymore as of the last expansion.<br />
<br />
Although, with the prices bring charged for Swamp Vine (one of the ingredients), its cheaper to buy the vender versions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nuked that bit, thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It is too bad they made our invisibility potion such an inviable option. Requiring uncommmon/rare foraged components, and costing well above the cost of the vendor bought ones, what is the point, no one is going to pay 5, let alone 10x the amount so their potions can stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lushissx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Where and who sells the invis potions?  Can shaman make the vendor potions in to a stack?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azirux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No,  the vendor purchased potions cannot be stacked. There are 2 types: A Cloudy Potion that costs about 13p (Sold in all starting cities, PoK, etc.), and a Potion of Invisibility that is sold in Abysmal Sea for less than 3p (I think).<br />
<br />
The Shaman version is Essence Of Concealment. Not counting the Swamp Vine (Which is a forage in LDoN Guk), it costs about  26p to make. The only benefit seems to be that Essence Of Concealment is a fixed 10 minute duration (Not verified 100%).</div></div><hr />

<br />
If that is indeed the case, that is actually a huge benefit.  There are places where you really just don't want invis to drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Unfortunately, the Essence of Concealment is not fixed duration.  The rumors are false.  Stackability is the only advantage you get for costing 9x more and requiring a foraged component.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ZealSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">stackable charges can be gotten much easier with tinkered items. fixed or extended duration would be the only reason to buy these, or if they were more effective in some way than 10pp instacast potions sold in almost every city zone.<br />
<br />
the potions I usually buy are the greater null potions, the SoW potions, and some situational ones like ant potions and the skin of flame ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asahel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Which Vendor?<br />
<br />
I have searched through the Abysmal Sea and cant locate this potion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azirux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok, this is really odd. I'm sure I bought them from the General Supplies Merchant right next to the bank. He doesn't have the Potion of Invisibility anymore. Nor do any of the other merchants I checked. Someone posted on Alla's that they were sold on the Alchemy Merchants, but they don't have them either...<br />
<br />
I wonder if these were in place for beta testing, and were accidently left in when the expansion went live and have now been removed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>KanadWinterstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Potion of Invisibility is an uncommon drop off the Muglwump in the Warrens, it is likely that you purchased one someone had sold to an abysmal merchant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Azirux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Umm, no Kanad, we are talking 100s. I personally got 20 for alts. I kinda doubt an uncomming drop of a level 20ish mob in the Warrens ended up in large quantities on the merchants in Abyssmal Sea.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
The General Merchants in the  Abyssmal Sea now carry &quot;Cloudy Potions&quot;. I guess the &quot;Potions of Invisibility&quot; were either errors, or beta stuff accidentally left in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wystie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It was there in Abysmal Sea on the vendors.  I saw it too, and even linked it to my guild because I was surprised at the low price.  It's gone now.</div></div><hr />
