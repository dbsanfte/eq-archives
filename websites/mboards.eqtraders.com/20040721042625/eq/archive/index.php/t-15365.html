<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>syrinne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heyoo!  I took a break (one of many) from EQ months ago - almost a year ago? - with the idea that I'd be coming back to EQ2.  HA!  With the earlier release date for EQ2 come and gone months ago, I decided to rejoin EQ1 until it does arrive.  So hello!<br />
<br />
But now that I've returned, of course there's a ton of new tradeskill items, about which I've no clue.  What IS this thing, I ask?  What's it for?  Back in the day, when PoP first came out, I had made a listing of the new components which were dropping and what they were for (this was before the info boxes so nicely told us &quot;This item is used in tradeskills&quot;).  And so I figured I'd ask: is there such a listing - or database capable of making such - that has every tradeskill component followed by all the recipes in which it's used?  I've searched the site, but haven't seen one; sorry if it's somewhere and I've missed it.  I can get Magelo to give me a listing of over 3k combinable objects (of course, this includes non-tradeskill quest items as well) which one can then follow individually to Allakhazam's entries, which often do a good job of linking the relevant recipe/s (I'm really impressed with those additions). But ideally I'd like to have a list, printable, which simply goes like...<br />
<br />
Component: Tradeskill: Item<br />
<br />
i.e. - Drop of Pure Rain: Brewing: Hurricane Temper<br />
<br />
Basically, as compact as can be.  The idea being that when I come across an item professing usefulness in tradeskills, that I can know to keep it for a skill I'm doing, or maybe give it to say, a favorite tradeskilling fiend.  Er, friend.  Or hey, even sell it, with at least having an idea of how useful or desirable it might be (or not be).<br />
<br />
Yay/nay?  If the latter, should I try assembling such a massive listing myself?  Or is there something along those lines already?<br />
<br />
Thanks all!<br />

Check the search box on the eqtraders main page.  Such a database exists. Yes, do a search for the item and then click the &quot;Find recipes that use this item&quot; link.  Very useful.</div></div><hr />
