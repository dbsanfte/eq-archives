I would love to see a list of zones appropriate to farm gems for each level range to still get exp. We all know how expensive jewelcraft is, and many of us also need gems for spell components (mages, clerics, etc.) so this could help us not lose as much time running around buying components, and spending plat on probably the most expensive tradeskill there is.<br />
<br />
If you know of a good zone to get mob dropped gems, please name the zone, level range, and mob name(s) that you've gotten gems off of. Thanks! Here's what I could think of off the top of my head:<br />
<br />
Levels 12- 20 (for exp) <br />
Lavastorm:[/B] minor gems<br />
<br />
Levels 20-40  (for exp)<br />
Mistmoore Castle all gem types, from minor to higher cost gems<br />
Mobs Any and all dark elf NPCs<br />
<br />
Levels 40-60 (for exp) <br />
Gunthak and Dulak:  higher cost gems such as star rubies, diamonds, etc.<br />
Mobs:  anything that's a typical playable race drops gems, sometimes even the undead &amp; I think maybe the luggalds, too. <br />
Advice  Don't solo in Dulak unless you're close to 60. You can solo if you're in Gunthak, but get to know the zone with a group before you ever try to solo, and not all races can solo in either zone.<br />
<br />
Levels 45-60  (for exp)<br />
Acrylia Caverns mostly major gems<br />
Mobs Grimlings of all sorts. I don't have specific mob names to give you. The harder the mob (such as necro or chanter) the more likely you are to get a gem drop. <br />
Advice DO NOT go solo unless you are at least 60th level. Try to have at least one partner who can heal if you're under 60. If you've never been there before, go there with at LEAST two partners. This is a great zone to farm for both acrylia and gems, pages and runes, so bring lots of empty bags. You will need them. Everthing except the weapons sell very nicely if you aren't going to use them yourself.<br />
<br />
It's not an easy zone to get to as the mobs in the cave near its entrance can see through invis. See invis is worth having on for the first half of the run through the caves. If you're not a fast runner, or you're closer to 40 than you are 50+, have a SoW, or bard with you, or convince a mage friend who knows the way to go there and then summon you. If you can't gate yourself out, try to have a wizzie or druid to port you out (most servers have a port chat channel, so type /join port when you want to get out. Be prepared to pay a large sum to make it worth the porter's time if they are coming from outside of AC). If you can't port out, then get to know the layout of Grimling Forest very well so you know where the closest zone lines are, and you don't run straight through a camp because you will have every mob on your tail from the caves near the AC entrance by the time you leave the cave.<br />

On average, when I would be there with 2 other people at level 48, in three hours each of us, after selling, would have 600 plat each. We had one person loot everything and we sold everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bregalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We recently went to revamped Hole to get a couple epic drops.   It is raining gems there, especially if you get down into the city.  Word of caution though:  the place is harder.   many unmezzable mobs that mitigate slow, and everything is VERY resistant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Add Gorge of King Xorbb to the 20-30 range.  Evil Eyes tend to drop low to mid-level gems with a decent frequency.  Plus you can get the occasional Polished Bone Bracelet to sell off for a little chunk of change to make the trip worth it.</div></div><hr />
