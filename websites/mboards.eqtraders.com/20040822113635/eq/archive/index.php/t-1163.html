<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dragnet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK can anyone tell me where to fish in Sebilis?<br />
<br />
I have tried fishing from the bridge by the bugs but no luck there (I guess I am too high up.) Has anyone found a safe spot?<br />
<br />
I can easy enough get a group to get me down there - but I don't want to have a group protecting me on my search for those elusive Kunzar Koi.</div></div><hr />

You can fish UNDER the bridge... There is a dry spot under the bridge going to the crypt (the second bridge when you come from the entrance)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank you for this information Thorme!!  I had my level 43 druid at that spot for like 3 hours last night.  Fished up 4 stacks of kunzar koi.  <br />
<br />
I now have enough kunzar koi and heavy clay to do 2 stacks pottery combines for the crucibles of escape thanks to this excellent advice (and zero deaths).<br />
<br />
I know this is the wrong forum, but since the only reason I can think of to fish in seb is to make crucibles, you guys probably also know the answer to this question:<br />
<br />
Where do I get Sarcosypha Fungus?  And how long will it take to farm 2 stacks of it?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
S'hrooms in Upper Guk or the S'hrooms around Guk's entrance.  Not sure on the amount of time it will take to get 2 stacks, but I will tell you this...It is a PITA.  I gave up after getting a total of 3 in the 5 or so hours I was trying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mystnife</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">came here looking for help with seb fishing also, thanks :)<br />
<br />
i read somewhere in teh eqtraders site that the fungus apparently also drops off the jack'o'lanterns in unrest.. if that's the case it may be easier to farm them than shrooms in guk?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ChaseFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not necessarily safe, but the last few times my guild headed down to party with Broog, several of our casters broke out their poles between pops. Just wanted to provide an alternative if you're heading in with a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you're a gater, just jump off the bridge and sit on a rock.</div></div><hr />

Head to Gukta. Newbies there are finding it and selling to vendors as it's not used in the newbie quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>liliputt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aye if u are after the fungus just make a froggie or place someone how is ok to frogs at the vendor outside of Gukta. My frog in the last week has now got 91 fungus from here  :D  - costs about 1pp 2gold per stack. Gotta love newbies havent ya  :D <br />
<br />
And thx for info on fish - was wondering where I had to go. BTW do u need to have a certain skill in fishing to get them?</div></div><hr />
