<br />
This is gonna be 3 parts, the good, the bad, and the ugly of love...<br />
<br />
<br />
It ain't first time I've fallen in love, but it is the first time it's lasted this long without going &quot;Boom&quot;, so this is for my girl...<br />
<br />
For those falling or in love, again, for the first time, whatever...<br />
<br />
<br />
First Love<br />
Written by Kit Hain<br />
Sung by Kristy McNichol and Christopher Atkins<br />
<br />
<br />
Fred:<br />
When will I find I love?<br />
Where will she be,<br />
And if she's out there will she wait for me?<br />
<br />
Mabel:<br />
How will he know me?<br />
Will I know him?<br />
Is there no end to all my questioning?<br />
<br />
Fred:<br />
Can I believe what I am seeing, what I am feeling<br />
Something so rare, watching her there<br />
She makes my heart stop.<br />
<br />
Mabel:<br />
Can I believe what I'm feeling, my head is reeling,<br />
He just looked my way, from the start I can say<br />
I will give him everything.<br />
Strange emotions wash over me<br />
Like the motion of the deepest sea,<br />
And I feel<br />
<br />
Chorus:<br />
Both:<br />
First love (I need nobody but you),<br />
You're all I'm dreamed of (I will be constant and true),<br />
Love moves me inside like the moon moves the tide.<br />
My first love.<br />
<br />
Fred:<br />
Can it be true? Can this be real love?<br />
Am I worthy of a vision so pure<br />
Oh lovely one, she's what I waited for.<br />
<br />
Mabel:<br />
Can it be true, or am I dreaming?<br />
He makes my heart sing<br />
Watching his eyes, a look that warms me like the sunrise.<br />
Strange emotions are calling me,<br />
I am falling, falling helplessly in<br />
<br />
Chorus<br />
<br />
Both:<br />
Some kind of miracle brought your here<br />
Just when I'd given up hoping.<br />
From the moment when you first appeared,<br />
I could feel my whole life opening in<br />
<br />
Chorus<br />
<br />
And I promise to be true to you<br />
My first love.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
However, since I know all too well how it is to be single today, here's a song dedicated to the people who are wearing black, drinking, and cursing about today.  (Which is how I've spent the last several Valentine's Day.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Love Stinks <br />
The J. Geils Band<br />
<br />
You love her <br />
But she loves him <br />
And he loves somebody else <br />
You just can't win <br />
And so it goes <br />
Till the day you die <br />
This thing they call love <br />
It's gonna make you cry <br />
I've had the blues <br />
The reds and the pinks <br />
One thing for sure <br />
<br />
(Love stinks) <br />
Love stinks yeah yeah <br />
(Love stinks) <br />
Love stinks yeah yeah <br />
(Love stinks) <br />
Love stinks yeah yeah <br />
(Love stinks) <br />
Love stinks yeah yeah <br />
<br />
Two by two and side by side <br />
Love's gonna find you yes it is <br />
You just can't hide <br />
You'll hear it call <br />
Your heart will fall <br />
Then love will fly <br />
It's gonna soar <br />
I don't care for any casanova thing <br />
All I can say is <br />
Love stinks <br />
<br />
(Love stinks) <br />
Love stinks yeah yeah <br />
(Love stinks) <br />
Love stinks yeah yeah <br />
(Love stinks) <br />
Love stinks yeah yeah <br />
(Love stinks) <br />
Love stinks yeah yeah <br />
<br />
I've been through diamonds <br />
I've been through minks <br />
I've been through it all <br />
Love stinks <br />
<br />
(Love stinks) <br />
Love stinks yeah yeah <br />
(Love stinks) <br />
Love stinks yeah yeah <br />
(Love stinks) <br />
Love stinks yeah yeah <br />
(Love stinks) <br />
Love stinks yeah yeah <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And for when things turn REALLY ugly?  Well... there's always THIS song...<br />
<br />
And yes, this is a hint to NOT pick up the first good looking thing in the bar.  Especially if you've been drinking...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dude (Looks Like a Lady)<br />
Aerosmith<br />
<br />
Cruised into a bar on the shore<br />
Her picture graced the grime on the door<br />
She a long lost love at first bite<br />
Baby maybe you're wrong but you know that's alright<br />
That's right<br />
Backstage we're havin the time<br />
Of our lives until somebody say<br />
Forgive me if I seem out of line<br />
Then she whipped out her gun<br />
Tried to blow me away<br />
<br />
Dude looks like a lady<br />
Dude looks like a lady<br />
Dude looks like a lady<br />
Dude looks like a lady<br />
<br />
So never judge a book by its cover<br />
Or who you gonna love by your lover<br />
Love put me wise to her love in disguise<br />
She had the body of a venus<br />
Lord, imagine my surprise<br />
<br />
Dude looks like a lady<br />
Dude looks like a lady<br />
Dude looks like a lady<br />
Dude looks like a lady<br />
<br />
Baby let me follow you down<br />

Baby let me follow you down<br />
Do me, do me, do me, all night<br />
Baby let me follow you down<br />
Turn the other cheek dear<br />

Do me, do me, do me, sue me<br />

<br />
I was in tears when they were done. No one has ever done something so nice for me before nevermind embarassing.<br />
<br />
They all had red sweaters and white pants on and came by in a red Pt cruiser. They had a carnation and a card from my man for me. There was a 5th person there with them taking pictures of me while I had tears running down my face. She also took a group picture with the choir girls and myself in the middle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Stupid, invented, sappy, over-hyped, commercialized hullabaloo.<br />
<br />
Everyone running around with their Giant novelty cards, and flowers, and decorating everything with hearts. Talk of &quot;Love&quot;, and wistful sighs, and vapid people in the office sighing, saying &quot;Awww that's so sweeeet&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's all poo.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
/give Lilosh a cookie</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like St. Valentine's Day.   My sweetie and I got to spend some time togther and exchange tokens.   The card really was nice. <br />
<br />
But then, a few years ago, I used to dred the holiday.  Mostly because people were all sappy around me, and I was lonely. <br />
<br />
It's not about the gifts, or even being sappy.  It's about the connection between you and someone special. <br />
<br />
So hang in the Lilosh.  If Valentine's Day can be good for &lt;b&gt;me&lt;/b&gt; then it can be good for you too. <br />
