<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just an update for those of you wondering about my wife's status since the cerclage was put in, and for those of you who read about it, but don't really care one way or another ;) <br />
<br />
Anyway,  She had the stitches removed last Tuesday.  My theory was that they needed to put the stitches in to keep the cervix shut, and, once removed, it would open up and shortly after, we would be having the baby.  Well, as things stand, my theory has been shot to heck.  She is till pregnant, 38 weeks tomorrow, and, unfortunately, in quite a bit of pain.  Bedrest, and the pelvic speration thing that happens to preggo women, has not been her friend.<br />
<br />
On a positive note, she finally took her first steps in Norath the other day.  :D <br />
<br />
<br />
I'll let you all know when the baby is born.</div></div><hr />

I had a pretty bad pregnancy with pain and nausea myself and you do honestly forget all about it when you see your child.  The last couple weeks of my pregnancy, Sam decided to sit on my nerve.  Not just any nerve, but one that prevented me from walking without extreme pain.  Was tons of fun /nod /nod.  But now that I have my little miracle, I would go through twice as much pain to have him.  He is so worth it.<br />
<br />
And to Rewde, I'm sure your wife will get through her aches and pains and you will soon have your own little miracle of your own.  Treasure each day with your baby.  My baby is now 13 months and I look at his &quot;baby&quot; pics all the time to remember those amazing first days/months.  I hope you have a very healthy baby.  I would hope for pain free, but we all know that won't happen!  :D   As long as the baby and mom are healthy and safe in the end, all is well, and that is my wish for you.  :angel:</div></div><hr />

2 weeks to go! Only 2 weeks! *cheer*<br />
<br />
Good to hear...I'd considered PMing to ask, but thought &quot;for pity's sake, ya nosy little cleric wench you, he'll tell if he feels like it&quot;...so thanks for posting!<br />
<br />
Nhinx &quot;whenever I want kids, I act like one&quot; Aphsion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, &quot;only&quot; 2 weeks to go.  But, those 2 weeks are going to seem like an eternity.  At the moment, well it has been for a while now, she is in almost constant pain.  Her hips hurt, her back hurts, and with the pelvis seperation thing going on, that hurts her too.  I would like the baby to come just so that it may ease some of the pain she is having.  <br />
<br />
Hopefully, once little Charlie is born, I will figure out how to post a pic for you all to see too.</div></div><hr />
