<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nex Alacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you are a Karana Worshipper, you have to do steel arrowheads for this level range.   So easy to do, and costs so little.  I got tired of using LDoN tempers to make chain, so I just jumped right into Steel Arrowheads.  Boy, I couldn't be happier.  I couldn't tell you how many combines exactly, but I ended up with 27 stacks of arrowheads.  So it had to have been somewhere around 300 combines.  Not bad for 33 skill points :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>FeroceFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you're on FV, find a Karana ranger.  Make him these arrowheads.  He'll love you, you'll get cheap skillups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Niran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am a karana druid but only have 137 skill, do you think I could use this method before getting to 155 first without having a horrible skill up rate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaaba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah I was working on the shawl with my Karana halfling druid over the weekend and she had a skill of 131 so I gated to Jaggedpine with around 2k pp and about an hour later she had 187 skill, and around 300 arrowheads saved up for when my Karana ranger starts the steel fletching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nex Alacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would imagine you could get a good success rate even at 137.  I was amazed at how little I actually failed when I started at 155.  I did not use a geerlok either.  If you get a geerlok, even more arrowheads for you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Happyhardcore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">howdy peeps,<br />
<br />
Hopefully u will be able to help me with this. <br />
<br />
i have been reading about these steel arrow heads.<br />
<br />
unfortunantly i am unabel to find the recipe either that or my barbarian character has got into my head and i have become stupid ( pretty sure i was stupid to start with lol). Is there any chance of some1 putting the recipe up so i know how to make it as im doing fine plate and costs a bomb to do plus i know a few frangers who can always do with arrow heads.<br />
<br />
cheers<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kaaba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As per mentioned in this thread you need to be a Karana worshipper to make these arrowheads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I went from 163 to 188 in about 500pp (163 is when fier'dal fletchnig kits finished).  I made fine plate stuff.  Successes sold back to the vendor for about what the ingredients cost.  The one caveat is that you must farm  your own leather padding.  Otherwise the price goes up significantly.  <br />
<br />
This was without a geerlok.  I had a nice STR item in that slot instead.  I was more interested in skill ups than successes (though I had tons of successes.)  I would imagine the cost would have been a bit less if I used the geerlok.<br />
<br />
If money is a problem, then you should consider this route instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaaba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The 2k spent does not include selling back the arrowheads made which probably would haver recouped a lot of the cost.  Instead I saved them for skilling up purposes on arrows.</div></div><hr />
