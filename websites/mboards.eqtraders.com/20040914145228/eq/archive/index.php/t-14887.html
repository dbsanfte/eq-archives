Im currenty at 191 tailoring and am looking toward the arctic wyvren hide route to 250. Im wondering what the drop rate is for the hides, like how many can I expect per  hour?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arghargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't have an exact number, but it seems like 1 in 8 will drop one.  My experience so far is I can farm pp and buy them at 100pp faster than I can farm them.  Maybe a bigger issue is if you have two or more people quad kiting them, there just aren't enough to kill to make it worth your while.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Perly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I tried farming these myself and just ended up buying them in bazaar for between 100 and 150 plat each. I went late one night when CS was empty and AE'd wyverns for about 2 hours and only managed about 18 hides.  Killing these was trivial to me but not worth my time.<br />
<br />
Fortunately I had cash to burn and there are always plenty selling in bazaar. If you don't have the plat I agree its probably much easier to farm the plat and buy them. There is almost always a large supply of these in bazaar on Terris. Unless you're a class lucky enough to solo there and appropriate level to get experience I don't suggest farming them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>raargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">whats a good place where farm pps ?</div></div><hr />

Hi folks! Im currenty at 191 tailoring and am looking toward the arctic wyvren hide route to 250. Im wondering what the drop rate is for the hides, like how many can I expect per  hour?  <br />
If, however, you are of a level and class that's right for farming wyverns, then I encourage you to farm them yourself. It's rare that you are at the right level and class for the trivial recipe you are working that you can get xp for farming it - so, live it up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>crystilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My husband's a mage and in 5 hours of clearing (with no competition from druids/wizards) gets around 40-50 hides.<br />
<br />
When I solo for them (cleric), I end up with about 1 every 6-8th mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>raargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">im a lv65 EQ warrior<br />
<br />
i was planning to clear Lguk mobs (2pp each ~ )<br />
<br />
any other good place? heard netherbian lair is good<br />
<br />
is that true ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Yandros</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For me just cranking out LDoN adventures has been very good.  The mix of exp for AA's, Adventure Points so I can round out my gear, and the PP for buying tradeskill items has been great.<br />
<br />
I know its not the best place for anyone of those three but overall I've been quite pleased.<br />
<br />
Plus, there are some tradeskill drops in there as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">When I was in my 50’s way back in the day I use to quad Wyvern for hours on end I’m so glad I kept the hides. It’s a great zone to PP farm in, everything that drops or you forage sells well, particularly the quest gems, whether you decide to sell them in the bazaar or to a merchant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The drop rate may have been hammered. Right now, I'd love to see a 1 in 10 drop rate, but it's been more like 15 or 20.<br />
<br />
Odds are the RNG is playing footsie with me, but that's been my experience for the last couple of weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Solarax_Manastorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">im an EP 300+ aa wizzy and since i live in japan i can farm when none else are on so get a kei and a po9 and a fast lizard and you can literaly farm them faster than they can pop if your gear is good or fast enough if not ( i clear the entire zone including the tower just as the first is about to repop)<br />
<br />
i also do drakes but thier drop is around 5% for me so farover the past month.<br />
<br />
if you have a wizzy friend or 2 just ask them to clear the place. i also make a couple k on gems too per hour and buy the hides in baz for 30-100 pp each from the gem sales</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Inien of Vazaelle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Don't forget the otter merchats too!  Sometimes see them on the 2 otters for about 15p each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Suva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I did my fishing in the zone and kept buying the hides off the quad kiters.  I could usually get a good deal by throwing in some buffs and buying right away so they didn't have to go to the bazaar to sell.  Find the people thatfarm there regularly and have them save up hides for when you aren't in the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tradeskiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well on my server CS is pretty much camped 24/7 along with CC from people farming Velium. So I decided to go the Solstice Robe route, got about 1600 swatches in bank now that i need to turn into sacred tunare silks. Im hopeing that will get me at or near 220, at 191 right now. I dread the hours its gonna take me to make them into tunare silks I have to pay some people in PoK to imbue 200 for me at a time. Allthough I can run thru about 400 cel essences by the time they are through but everyone hates doing them! :P Thanks for the info everyone! Just need those tailoring skill ups and hopefully no failures on the gimel tailoring part, already have the fletching and baking part done, im so close I cant stand it lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Solarax_Manastorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i actualy twinked a druid and pld up to lvl 29 so i could imbue the emeralds my self and while waiting to med made the CE because they are no fail<br />
so also get baking up to 15 free pretty much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Lynxi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">no way u are going to 220 with only 1600 swatches. i had over 2k swatches banked and managed it from 188 to 209. another 130 combines (= about 400 swatches) gave me additional 3 points (so i'm at 214 now with the ethereal swatch skill ups between solstice skill ups). it's hard, painfull and expensive...<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />
