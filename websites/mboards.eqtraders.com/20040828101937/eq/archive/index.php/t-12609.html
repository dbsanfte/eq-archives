Anyhoo.... To get to 250. I'm not sure weather I want to make champagne or Kaladim const.<br />
<br />
The champagne seems like a pain cause I will have to get an Enchanter friend of mine to make me a couple of stacks of Champagne Magnums. Now, is the corking device returned on failure and success?<br />
<br />
Also..... The Kaladim const. Says needs dark fungus AND underfoot mushrooms?<br />
<br />
Checked my bazaar last night, and NOONE sells these. So they are foraged right? Looks like my only choice is champagne as I cannot forage.<br />
<br />
How many magnums should I get my Enchanter buddy to make me? I.e how many stacks should it take to get the last two points?<br />
<br />
Cheers!<br />

<br />
a few posts down but you didn't even have to search.  the main site has the groudspawn of both in north kaladim.  many threads already have the locs of the mushrooms.<br />
<br />
the corker is returned in all recipes but the artisan's seal.  anywhere between 2 and 1480 tries for last too points.  might be more than 1480 but i hope not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stabi VanHouten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1480 COMBINES?!!?!?<br />
<br />
Are you NUTS!<br />
<br />
/tradeskilling OFF<br />

This has turned out a HUGE waste of time. LOL Back to XP leveling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">lol.  most i remeber was something like 700 combines before a skillup.  so for the last too points 1480 hehe.  most ppl get them in a stack or three.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stabi VanHouten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ooohhhhhh phew!<br />
<br />
LOL<br />
<br />
I've done my share of 600 combines and no skillups. I'm all set with that. I think those kind of numbers are only associated with brewing because MHB components are all vendor bought.<br />
<br />
I can't imagine having a run like that in tinkering or tailoring. If that EVER happened doing one of those, I would quit.<br />
<br />
My Baking seemed to NEVER go more than 20 combines for 1 skillup. MAYBE 30-40 combines, but it would right itself the next stack giving me two or three in a row.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>solithan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hehe be prepared to quit then because bad luck can and will happen in all the skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i have been averaging 40 combines per skillup with 255 int in baking from 193 to 212.  at least 140 without a skillup before.  3 skillups in 200.  first 3 stacks had 2 skillups and second to last had one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Quikpick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">80 attempts at constitutionals should be enough to get those last two points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Barli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">With just a 150 Wisdom, I got my last 2 points to 250 in about 90 combines on Kaladim Constitutionals.   Got (249) on the 1st attempt and 89 attempts later got 250.  Go figure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My wizard, with 255 INT, got from 248 to 250 in 30 combines. I also failed my first trophy combine at 250 + Geerlok.<br />
<br />
Most people will get those last two fairly quickly. There are horror stories of course, but MOST should get em quickly. :)<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Stabi VanHouten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just would like to say, on my second try, got my GM cork tonight! WOOT!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Now, to just get those LAST two points :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the help guys, this site RULES!<br />
<br />
Say, I couldn't find the thread talking about the fungus ground spawns....for the kaladim const. Can anyone point me int he right direction?<br />
<br />
Cheers!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Marinoni Oakenshield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I personally did the Kaladim Constitutional route. They are a ground spawn in North Kaladim, on a 6 minute timer. There are 7 of one type, 10 of the other type (forget which is which). I put together all the needed ingredients before heading to Kaladim, sat in the garden and collected enough for 20 combines, then went into the house which is beside the garden, which has a brew barrel. Whipped up the 20 combines, and when I was done the mushrooms had respawned. Rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
Skill 249 took 50 combines.<br />
Skill 250 took 63 combines.<br />
