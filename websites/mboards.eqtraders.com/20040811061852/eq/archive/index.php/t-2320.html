<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not realizing that the fish I needed for the fishing companion quest came from PoV and not PoJ (don't ask) I decided to go after some of the ones in PoN the other night.  I managed 8 and about half a stack of crawdads with 3 stacks of bait, and decided that was enough for the night.<br />
<br />
But, would I leave?  <br />
<br />
I stepped about 15 paces to my right, to admire the graphic of the falls.  The next thing I knew, &quot;Loading, please wait...&quot;  I was standing in a withered treant's spawn spot.  Remem'ed my spells, including res, went back in, got about half way to my corpse and &quot;Loading, please wait...&quot;  I stumbled across a rather nasty arachnid.  <br />
<br />
A kind soul gave me a tell, I consented, and he pulled both corpses to the GY.  I memmed my spells, including res, popped in, ressed my first corpse, meditated enough to res the second corpse, and sat down to wait out the res effects.  &quot;Loading, please wait...&quot;  There I looked down, my corpse lying on a freshly dug grave.  Someone pulled a spider through the GY, right across my weakened head.<br />
<br />
Rememmed my spells, zoned in, pulled my corpse to the zone out point, cast res, looted and ported the heck out of there.  Sat down to heal and med, and went to clean out the cat box.<br />
<br />
Sheesh, all that for that.  Anyone have any Valor fish they'd like to trade for some Nightmare fish?<br />
<br />
I had already pretty much given up on the idea of fishing in Sebelis for the Koi I need to glaze my unfired crucibles of escape (anybody want some of them?  I think I have 8 left.)<br />
<br />
So, I decided it was time for some nice, safe fishing.  I have about 5 stacks of wyvern hides, and no cod.  Decided rather that loading down with bait and paying for a port, I'd take Euell in, since he could pop in and out at will.  What I didn't consider is that darn near everything in the zone is ready to attack him -- he has not spent much time working on his CoV faction.  <br />
<br />
Invis, lev, head for the othmir vendors, and fish from there.  Several hours on Tuesday night, 3 cod.  Lots of skill-ups.  Several hours Wednesday night, master status achieved plus, and 11 more cod.  Only about 80 to go...<br />
<br />
[Anyone have any cod or cod oil they want to sell?  Saw some the other night in the bazaar at 75p each and about choked on my iced tea.  Broke out Sprowt, whipped up some tinkered poles and bait and headed in.]<br />
<br />
Spent a LOT of time invised on Wednesday night while fishing.  One guy got trained by sirens, two by wyvern kiters, one by drakes.  I should bring Zabu in merely to sit and res for hire.  <br />
<br />
[Holds up a sign, &quot;Will res for hides, any hides!&quot;]</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can highly recommend tagging along on a Kael raid just for faction.  Gwenae did this for the one reason of not being KoS to CoV so she could fish in peace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Got tired of the &quot;folks&quot; that kept pulling the haunted sea chest, only to find out they didn't have a prayer, and consequently, training him on Euell, and switched over to Zabu.  He is amiable to CoV, so of course, he killed a wyvern on the way down :) <br />
<br />
One evening and the following morning later, 5 stacks of cod, plus one.  The epic of tailoring :)  As it turned out, it wasn't near enough.  I need about 3 more stacks, and am having my gnome make up some poles and bait for the next go around. <br />
<br />
Fishing(198) -- soon....soon...<br />
<br />
All the while, doing resses, checking the merchants, tutoring a 60 wiz who is just getting into tradeskills (for shawls and PoTC earring,) and auctioning for pelts.  Several hundred stacks (or so it seemed) of celestial essence.  Coldain heaters.  Velium tempers.  <br />
<br />
One stack of velium tempers combined with a small brick for one very expensive boning.<br />
<br />
More celestial essence.  More coldain heaters.  More velium tempers.  Velium studs.  The quest for clear mana.  Drake egg oil.  Silver thread, patterns, coldain tanning kit.  Gem studded chains, needle, Tunarean silks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yep, I think I've got it.  KEI for 255 wis, current skill 173.<br />
<br />
24 attempts at a solstice robe, 12 othmir cap attempts, 4 drake belt attempts, 60 wyvern mask attempts.<br />
<br />
Results: 5 wyvern masks, 3 othmir caps, 1 solstice robe, and 12 points!!!<br />
<br />
Oh, yeah, and an acrylia studded cloak.  I had a spare hopper hide.<br />
<br />
A busy but profitable weekend!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Congratulations :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Needless to say, I'm staying away from the RNG for a week or so, lest it try to exact revenge.<br />
<br />
Now, who and where to level...</div></div><hr />
