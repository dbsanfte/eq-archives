Looking to purchase the services of a 250 or near to it brewer.  Will need 80 Ethereal Curing Agents -- paying for the combines.  Will either provide all of the nescessary components for a reduced combine fee, or pay for delivery of goods with no hellish celestial essence combining on my part :) You make the call! Send a tell in game to either Llilli or Qween (my roomie -- so make sure to tell her what you are talking about lol) or post here.<br />

Gnomes need not apply ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Carmaris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Holidays have me pretty much out of the game for the next week and a half--I'll be on but not much time for brewing--if you still need help the Monday after Christmas, let me know.  If I have to gather the compenents myself, it'll be 18pp per agent--I don't do celestial elixirs, I only buy them, so the price has to absorb buying them.  If you provide CE's, it'll be 5pp per agent...if you provide all components, it'll be a flat 200pp for 80 combines.</div></div><hr />

<br />
my 250 brewer, Olut, is stationed in PoK, so making them should not be a problem.  <br />
<br />
Feel free to send me a tell- you can find me on as Taaxi, rezzi, Jackmoove, or Platemerch (my bazaar guy).</div></div><hr />
