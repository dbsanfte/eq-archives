<br />
I just wanted to say that I kind of liked your previous organization of the site better (I have a printout from 3/18/03 for example). I thought it was really nice how u go into halfling cultural tailoring section, and it gives u the brewing and poisonmaking (celestial essence), pottery (bd powder), and smithing, not to mention of course the tailoring recipes themselves. This was all on one page, and organized really logically. Now, however, u have just one page for the tailoring stuff only, and it seems a bit more difficult for me to have to click on all the links to see all the subcombines, such as how to make infused vale boning, for example. Obviously, this site is still irreplaceable for the EQ community, but hope this is useful feedback to you, and hope i put it in the right section of the forum.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The old way was done Manually, by hand, and took about 60 hours a week to maintain.<br />
<br />
The new site is database driven, and MUCH easier to maintain, but custom pages do not come as easilly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The database was a little funky to get used to at first, but I'm all for easier maintenance. I think you'll find that the more you use the database and the tree style display of recipes, the more you'll like it waaaaay better. For me, I find it sooo much easier to use.<br />
<br />
Again, big kudos guys. =D</div></div><hr />
