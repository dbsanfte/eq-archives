 <br />
If you see anything that needs to be updates, just reply and I'll make any necessary corrections.<br />
 <br />
Enjoy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">menssia01</div><div class="date">10-31-2005, 05:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Set up looks great, only hassle I can see is the colours make it hard to read.<br />
<br />
Great work!!<br />
<br />
little things you might want to edit.. Recipe uses Purifed mana not clear, and count I got from when I did my list (For tradeskill guild guide on our guild boards )for gnomish heat sources was 888. Other thing I noticed was you listed 'small brick of refined high quality ore as 380, small should be listed as 2.<br />
There is no large Bricks of refined high quality ore listed. ( count for that is 126)<br />
Total I got was a bit over 18k.<br />
<br />
And yes, those shadowmane pelts are the hardest to get for the AAAA.<br />
<br />
Next in line is Gargoyle dust and sporali skin ( used in other items for augments)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wurliben</div><div class="date">11-01-2005, 02:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, looked things over, and made a few corrections. Also changed the color scheme to something a little more familiar since it has proven to be much more easier on the eyes.<br />
 <br />
As for the Heat Sources, and the Small and Large bricks, I think I found the problem. Someone had bought out all the large bricks from the vendor I went to, so I was bought what he had left (small bricks) and made my calculations from that. Was a tad bit more expensive. To correct the issue, I just did the Unrefined Ore quest.<br />
 <br />
Anyways, enjoy the updated list!</div></div><hr />

<br />

I did most of the subcombines for our friendly guild gnomie and had no idear i blew that much cash:-) I must have gotten really lucky to find one shadowmane pelt.Don't forget you need TWO of em to make the holepoker:-(<br />
Wish i could make gnomish heat sources for cheep ! I'd be RICH:-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaliaila</div><div class="date">11-04-2005, 06:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only thing I could see that needs modified is that you've got a price on the Corathus Entrails, not sure about other servers but I haven't seen anywhere that you can actually buy them and know that none of the overpricing simpletons in the bazaar on my server have them horribly overpriced.  So I would add that to the ones that aren't included in the price seeing as since it's used in tailoring it's way overpriced in the bazaar, and rarely sold to vendors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wurliben</div><div class="date">11-04-2005, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's the price I've found them for a number of times on the clockwork merchants in Corathus Creep</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MedailMeadmezzer-eci</div><div class="date">11-07-2005, 01:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">update pottery to the new skill, its like 42 tirval to make the base mold for the holepoker now, god thats such a {disappointing change}</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redi</div><div class="date">11-07-2005, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eh, 252 triv for a clay + water + (piece you get returned) pottery recipe was a little too easy.<br />
<br />
Not like this quest needs more high trivial stuff :p I'm already concerned enough about losing the time and plat of the subcombines on one of the tinkering combines.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">menssia01</div><div class="date">11-27-2005, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From making/selling these. not only with getting the pelts hold you up but getting the bolts will too.. The drop rate on there are slow.. given you need 5 per AAAA ( if no fails). Just not a balanced drop rate IMHO to other items. I suggest you keep and eye out in baz for these too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drtyaty</div><div class="date">03-20-2006, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very nice work; it will save a lot of us a whole bunch of time and enerty. <br />
<br />
Thank you.  <br />
<br />
It would sort of be nice to have a list of items that are dropped instead of vendor purchased.</div></div><hr />
