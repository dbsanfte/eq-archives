<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amii</div><div class="date">02-22-2006, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bout time I decided to make use of the time I have spent, so will offer my services.<br />
First I want to put down two ground rules.<br />
1) I am an active member of a guild and oft demanded by friends. This may mean that I am unable to get to you straight away as I may be indisposed.<br />
2) You need to provide ingredients for the combine. While I will do all subcombines as necessary, I dont want to dig into my stash and use up materials I may need.<br />
<br />
In spite of this, my services are totally FREE, whether successful or failure (does happen). For a full list of my abilities, see the list below. I will try stuff &quot;over my head&quot; if asked, but please dont blame me for failing :(  I am only barbarian.<br />
<br />
So... get in touch if you need me (Amii), on Saryrn/Mithaniel Marr, and if I am not on, and your problem is not urgent, send an ingame email.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, you want the skill list :D .<br />
Alchemy 275 (Mastery 3)<br />
Baking 300<br />
Blacksmithing 231 (Is in progress)<br />

<br />
Thanks for reading :) <br />

&quot;I used to do tradeskills for the fun of it, then it got expensive and needed farming.&quot;</div></div><hr />
