Do they currently have at least 1 aug slot? (Type 4)<br />
<br />
Are the 2handers berserker-useable? Slashing, blunt and piercing?<br />
<br />
Also, /rude SOE for not implementing 2handed axes or scimitars.  Some druids have been using slashing since early on, and don't want to change, and the dearth of axe-modeled weapons for berserkers is really irking those of us who are trying to play the new class.</div></div><hr />

no scimitars unfortunately.   My druid prefers 1hs also.  honestly though it'd be easier to get a runed falchion or something and it'd have better stats then the lower end GoD smithed items.  Also by the time you'll see shimmering ore drops and nihilite you'll be 65 and most likely have something better than your druid epic.   Some God smithed, tailored, JC, or tinkering weapons/items like many parts of GoD was not implemented well or based on normal risk/reward.<br />
<br />
Don't worry about not having GoD axes for your zerker.   None of the 2HS or 2HB weapons are zerker usable as of this post anyways.   Dunno what level your zerker is, but I bet the lack of axes in GoD would be the least of your worries :)  That class needs some serious help and fixing  :irked: Berserkers can use the 2HP weapons which are tagged correctly from the get go.   Still though the stats are abysmal and you'd do better with a 50pp centi spear.<br />
<br />
good luck and have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bocote</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the god smithed items may be fixed (aug slots and ber added) with the patch tonight.   I'll keep ya posted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dannbu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The Gemmed Velium Swords have thier slots back :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bocote</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">velium great sword is now BER usable.   aug slots are type 4 and 7.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>windeliane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just did a Velium gemmed morningstar last night, i was sooooo disappointed by the graphic  :( <br />
<br />
It's just like an acrylia or VT mace, nothing new. Since the stats are not better than any bazaar buyable weapon, it's just a waste of time...<br />
<br />
I had fun gathering stuff and doing it, but the result spoils all that fun; they should rather not even add any new recipe if it's to do something like that, it would save us some time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bocote</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yep..  not to be negative, but almost all of the god items are lacking.  There are a ton of new weapon recipes, but are dissapointing.    <br />
<br />
by the time you can get shimmering ore/nihilite you'll have far better weapon drops from PoP or even velious dragons which pretty much makes all of the tradeskill content useless in GoD.<br />
<br />
have fun</div></div><hr />
