<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aoladari Raveynfyre</div><div class="date">03-21-2003, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know, maybe I'm prone to having bad things happen medically.<br />
<br />
Surgery on my left knee after an accident at Chilis<br />
Surgery to remove Tonsils which the specialist said should have been removed 2 yrs prior.<br />
Constant infetions including one Kidney infection that I nearly lost a kidney with.<br />
Skin disease that makes me look rashy at best, like a snake with scales on my legs, and an old woman on my hands.<br />
Feminine surgeries to remove &quot;suspicious&quot; growths that looked like cancer.<br />
Recurring Bronchitis<br />
Asthma<br />
Sinus problems<br />
<br />
The list goes on, but I'll stop here.<br />
<br />
Now I have a swelling behind my ear. This started on Mar 10th and the Doc gave me antibiotics. I went back 3 days later and they told me that they suspected an infected bone in my ear (Mastoid?), they thumped on it, and after seeing that it was still painful, they gave me MORE antibiotics. 2500 Milg. per day of Amoxicillin and Augmentin combined.<br />
<br />
The swelling had all but dissappeared until yesterday afternoon. The damn thing started to swell up again and throb occasionally. My friends have said that nothing should be growing within 3 miles of me after all the antibiotics that I'm on, but here it is. Growing yet again.<br />
<br />
I paniced and went to my doctors office as soon as I could (7am this morning) and he told me that it could be one of 3 things. Mastoiditis(sp?) Cistoiditis(sp?) or my lymph node is swollen. He wants to send me for an MRI to see what is going on, and he put me on EVEN more antibiotics. I think he upped it to 2700 or 2800 milg. per day of a combination of the 2 antibiotics again.<br />
<br />
If this turns out to be Mastoiditis(sp?) it's entirely possible that I will need surgery for it, and once every few years after. (This sounds like the problem because it happened once before 2 years ago and the doctor I had then thought that it was shingles......  :?: ) &amp;lt;--- My doctor knows about this as well.<br />
<br />
So here I am waiting for work to let me go home early so I can pick up my meds and my cat from the vet and wondering, why me?<br />
<br />
P.S. sorry if this sounds like a &quot;poor me, pity me&quot; post but I need someplace to vent and maybe (if I'm lucky) I can get further advice here.</div></div><hr />
