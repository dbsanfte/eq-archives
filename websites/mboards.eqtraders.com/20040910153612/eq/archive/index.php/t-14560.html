<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>drtyaty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know nothing about these or how they are used.  Are there any threads out there that discuss the matter as far as tailors are concerned?<br />
<br />
I performed a search but more or less came up empty.  There was a thread in the smithing forum, but was unable to locate anything here. <br />
<br />
Does erudite cultural give tribute points?  If so, how much?  Who do I turn the armor into?  What do tribute points give me?<br />
<br />
I guess I am out of the loop &amp; any help would be much appreciated.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Install GoD<br />
<br />
go to your home city<br />
<br />
Press the FIND button<br />
<br />
Follow the yellow path<br />
<br />
Right Click the Tribute guy, like you would a vendor.<br />
<br />
Click on stuff in your inventory and he will tell you how many tribute points he will give you for them.<br />
<br />
Not to sure about costs of the buffs, i think they charge per set amount of time, then charge again for next amount of time.  untill you click them off..... i guess!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>drtyaty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What are the tribute points used to buy or for?<br />
<br />
Will the path lead me right to the tribute guy?<br />
<br />
I guess I am totally ignorant as to this whole tribute thing.  <br />
<br />
Could someone direct me to a good post regarding the use of tribute points and the tribute system?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

Trust me.    Seeing it for yourself  &gt;  being handed the answers.  It's easy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You get buffs in exchange for tribute points. Check it out in game. Its kinda cool, but it also gives people buffs that are on the ceramic items thus hurting the market on some of thses items :( Anyway check it out it is nice :) Gave me something to so with all those velious tailoring combines!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>drtyaty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Great, and I just sold an enormous amount of arctic wyvern and acrylia masks to merchants for approximately 5pp or less / mask.<br />
<br />
Ayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />
<br />
:mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Those masks have very little tribute value anyway. I think my store of old acrylic masks gave like 7 points each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Anaxo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Acrylia Reinforced Mask - 12 tribute<br />
Acrylia Studded Mask - 7 tribute<br />
Arctic Wyvern Mask - 18 tribute<br />
<br />
You might as well just get the plat for them, really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ChaseFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">LoY cultural robes with silver ribbon = 60 points<br />
LoY cultural robes with gold ribbon = 180 points (!)<br />
<br />
(For those of you wondering just exactly how a half-elf knows anything about cultural robe values - the robe patterns are tradeable on FV, and therefore anyone of any race can craft the robes of any other, so long as they can find someone to get robe patterns for them).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Took a pair of Stormreaper's Sleeves over to check - they offered me 1786 for 'em. Not enough for me, considering they cost two infused bonings, one HQ brute hide, an acorn oil, and an imbued pebble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Britneyy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I find this tribute to be total crap, good idea added into the game but not worth while so i took some crap loot and stuff rotting in the bank and got me a 4k trib points i got some HP buffs wasn't too bad an extra 150HP will help anyone! But i noticed it lasts for 10 bloody minuites! Thats like the time it would take for me to find a group or maybe get 1 mob killed before it poofs away. So so far i find this a complete waste of gettin points maybe if they re-do this with extended buff times it would work out better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Maisie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I get 180 tribute for a black patherskin mask....yet only 18 for arctic wyvern? <br />
<br />
Bug?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Heartsong_Steelsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Britneyy, this is not a rant forum.  If you feel you need to complain, take it to the Primal Scream Room.  If you want something to actually change, I suggest giving feedback to the developers instead, either in game or through email.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Deedolith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Time to clear some things about the tribute system.<br />
<br />
- You can hand any tradable item to the tribute master in your home town (right click on him / her to open the favor window), he / she will reward you with favor pts.<br />
- You can spend your pts to get various boosts (stats / focus / effects ... , up to 5 running at time.<br />
- Each boost is tier restricted, the tier you have access to depend on your lvl.<br />
- To get the desired boost, you need to upgrade it untill it is as high as you want (to get FT5, you need to upgrade Aura of Clarity 5 times)<br />
- You can only get the boosts from the tribute master<br />
- You can stop any boost at any time (hit alt + u)<br />
- Every 10 mins, the amount of pts used by the boosts (active cost)  is deducted from your total of pts, untill you remove them all.<br />
<br />
- The tribute master will refuse any NO DROP / summoned items, as well as some junks (to prevent abuse).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>drtyaty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">the total time your buffs will last depends on the amount of tribute you have given and the points you receive from the tribute?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>eqNichola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yes. Although you can *down*grade your level of tribute-buffs 'in the field', ie without going to see the tribute master.<br />
<br />
SO what you do is this:<br />
<br />
- (whenever) give items in tribute to the tribute master, to acquire tribute points (a kind of bank, if you will)<br />
<br />
- just before going out to hunt / raid / whatever you want some nice buffage for, go to the tribute master and upgrade the buffs you want.<br />
<br />
- you will now use X points every ten minutes, depending on which tribute-buffs you have running<br />
<br />
- when you have finished hunting / raiding / whatever you wanted the buffs for, bring up the 'current tribute buffs' window by pressing alt-u, and downgrade everything to 0. You are now no longer spending points. Note you do NOT have to visit the tribute master to DOWNgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Feldaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just one more addition to this.  All tribute buffs count as items, therefore they also count against all the current item cap limitations (15 worn mana regen, 35 worn hp regen, and 250 worn atk).  So don't upgrade yourself beyond these caps as it just won't help. :)</div></div><hr />
