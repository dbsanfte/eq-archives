<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dummaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since we can only achieve Grandmaster status in one tradeskill, should it be alchemy for the shaman?<br />
<br />
The temptation is to believe &quot;no&quot; but I'm open to discussion.<br />
<br />
Dumm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Alchemy is not a Tradeskill that you can take above 200... To 200 yes... but not over. And even if you could, it wouldn't count, because it is not one of the 7 PRIME tradeskills (since it is restricted to Shamans only).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dummaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So, one can aspire to grandmaster status in alchemy and one of the 7??  or do I just not understand, which is quite possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Alchemy Maxes at 200.  The best you can be is 200 + any apropriate enhancing item.  <br />
<br />
Alchemy, because it does NOT go above 200 does not count as your one free 200+ skill.  <br />
<br />
Grandmastered Alchemy = 200</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">With PoP, you can spend AA points in New Tanaan Crafting Mastery on the general page of your AA window, and become a grandmaster in all 7 tradeskills.<br />
<br />
There are also high end quests in PoKnowledge where the NPC wont talk to you about the next step of the quest until you have at least 220 skill in the tradeskill used for that step of the quest.<br />
<br />
Class skills, such as alchemy, do not count against your tradeskill count. So yes, you can take Alchemy to 200, and still GM in a tradeskill. And do this before you spend any AA points like I mentioned above. Poison Making for rogues, Tinkering for gnomes, and probably others also do not apply to your tradeskill count.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimlach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Can get a 50% reduce in fails via aa points fer 18aa.  Combine that with yer +5% trophy and yer failing the hard ones a lot less.<br />
Alchemy mastery aa points:<br />
3points -&gt; 10%<br />
6more -&gt; 25%<br />
9more -&gt; 50%<br />
<br />
I have yet to fail a straight up gate potion at 200 skill with gm trophy and 10% reduce fail aa.  I may get a little deeper into alchemy one day, but for right now gate potions and quint of knowledge are just about the only things I make.</div></div><hr />
