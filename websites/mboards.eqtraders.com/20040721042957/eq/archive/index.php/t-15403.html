<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Namini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I posted this in the Concert Hall but thought I'd post it over here where people &amp; possibly devs involved in TSing might see it and post some feedback :) (&quot;We&quot; and &quot;our&quot; refer to Bards, as I posted this first on the bard board :D)<br />
<br />
You know, I remember a long time ago in a mystical age before instruments had tags when we were told that items like the box of lute strings and unfinished brass mouthpiece et al were intended for the skill-in-progress of Instrument Crafting.<br />
<br />
Whatever happened to this? Shamen got Alchemy, Rogues got Make Poison (and if you live in a world where these skills have always been around, you're too young to remember) but we never got our promised crafting abilities. With a little bit of creativity and some elbow grease, the implementation of this skill could go a long way towards easing our epic growing pains and our chronically bad itemization.<br />
<br />
Lute Body + Diamond + Box of Lute Strings + 2x Bar of Gold = Gaudy Mandolin (2.1 string, Primary CHA 7) Trivial 58<br />
Artic Wyvern Hide + Skinning Knife + Enchanted Tannin = Stretched, Runed Drum Skin, Trivial 67<br />
Stretched, Runed Drum Skin + Vial of Cloudy Mana + Bongo Body = Mystical Bongos of Rhythmic Torture (3.0 perc, Pri/Sec, ac15 sta15 hp25 svall5) Trivial 200<br />
Fine Plate Greaves + Diamond Auger + Aqua Diamond of Water + Vial of Purified Mana + Runed Sea Shell = Fluted Greaves of the Reef (2.0 wind, 2.0 brass, Legs, ac41 sta10 cha14 hp70 mana70 svfire18 effect: Enduring Breath) Trivial 348 (Returns Auger on fail)<br />
<br />
And of course...<br />
Artisan's Seal + Student's Mandolin = Grandmaster Luthier's Violin (All Instruments 1.4, pri/sec/range/ammo, Instrument Crafting +5% CHA50 int/wis10 Effect: Grandmaster's Satchel) Trivial 450</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>FeroceFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">While the particular items mentioned aren't quite what I reckon the original creators had in mind, I whole-heartedly agree that it would be very nice indeed to be able to craft one's instruments.<br />
<br />
Probably not gonna happen, but it would indeed be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cantatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If I recall, instrument crafting got scrapped for lack of time (and tradeskills were left unfinished).</div></div><hr />

Hey, you got some problem with ceramic bola weights?!?  &quot;It's like a rock, but it's ceramic and it takes a lot more work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe you have a point....<br />
