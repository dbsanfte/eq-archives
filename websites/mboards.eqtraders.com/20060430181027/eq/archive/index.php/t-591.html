I have hear Yelloweyes in PC, but do the owlbears in HS drop it as well?  It is no drop? stackable?   I have a stack of shrieking substances, however, can't seem to have any luck with the wailing.  <br />
Thanks for your help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nizanko</div><div class="date">12-08-2002, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The grimy owlbear cubs in Paludal will drop these.  Also, in Hollowshade, if owlbears have taken over the grimling (south) camp, the owlbears in that area will drop wailing substances.  (If sonic wolves have taken over the south camp, those will drop shrieking substances, saving you a trip to Tenebrous if you happen not to like that zone.)<br />
<br />
Both wailing and shrieking substances are stackable and no-drop.</div></div><hr />

About 4 spawn here and none seem to camp this spot you get a drop rate of about 1 in 3 so happy hunting to you</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enter Paludal Caverns from Shadowhaven.  Go through the bandit camp, then go to your right and follow the path up the ledge.  Eventually you will see a stone 'bridge' that goes over the chasm.  Take the bridge and head left.  Very soon you will see a tunnel on your right, take it.  Take the next right and you will enter a short dead-end cave with two owlbear cub spawns.  <br />
<br />
My experience on Wailing Substances has been around 1 in 4 drop rate.<br />

Good luck to you!<br />

<br />
However, PC is a great place to farm now.<br />
<br />
I come in, hit the 2 cub cave, then run to the 4 cub cave; clear that out, and by the time I make it back to the 2 cub cave, they have, or are about to respawn.  Rinse, repeat.<br />
<br />
I haven't timed it yet, but I think they are on a 6 min timer. :)<br />
<br />
Now if only I can find a static spawn points with reliable drops for the sheriking substance I'd be one happy man.. err... elf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koutarou</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its actually like an 8 minute 30 second timer I think.<br />
<br />
You can actually farm all 3 spawns (2spawn, 4spawn, yelloweyes  in that order) before a full cycle if you can kill the 4spawn quick enough.</div></div><hr />

By some strange twist of fate, the owlbears had Hollowshade before the patch so I was farming there like a mad man.</div></div><hr />

They're stuck owning the zone, and I'll be ****ed if anyone but owls live on that island after Thursday's patch~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">B_Delacroix</div><div class="date">12-19-2002, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">True, the dogs rarely have the south islands even on Karana.  However, I have a theory as to why.<br />
<br />
Owlbears don't seem to drop wailing substance much.  They seem to have a great supply when they own the islands.  IF the owlbears are not at the islands, I rarely if ever see a wailing substance.  So your left with paludal caverns and there are few owlbears there.<br />
<br />
However, the shrieking substance drops a good deal from the sonic wolves in Tenebrous mountains.  So, I suspect people are more inclined to set up the hollowshade war to place owlbears on the islands rather than dogs because there is a fair source for shrieking substances other than the war.<br />
<br />
That being said, I'd like to try out the dogs at south islands just to see how much more substance I might find that way.<br />
<br />
Either way, get rid of those stupid worthless grimlings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BrindalayShadowlace</div><div class="date">12-19-2002, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know exactly how it works or if one race can normally take over a camp without help.  But once when i had found the wolves up in the south before i got much farming at all done the owlbears came in with no attack message and took over without any help. <br />
<br />
 Not sure if that has anything to do with the wolves not being up down there if they're easily defeated by either race attacking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tomojo</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If nobody is running the war, it seems that the first clan to get wiped is out of luck until the war is ended, or the zone is reset.<br />
If there are only Grimlings &amp; bears, you might as well go do something else unless you can finish the war cycle yourself.<br />
<br />
Random luck or not, my observation is that the Grimlings tend to be the first to go.  When there are just 2 clans, they tend to be the wolves and bears, and their ownership of the Grimling Camp seems to be fairly random. It is also my observation that the bears are almost never the single clan to be wiped out leaving the wolves and grimlings to fight it out.<br />
<br />
Whenever there is someone doing the war, they tend to be after the Eye of the Owlbear Mother, or whatever it is called, that has Flowing Thought to increase mana regen.  Not always, but that is generally the case. And this means that they actually want the bears to own the islands and will do everything in their power to see that it happens.<br />
<br />
This means that more often than not, the bears will control the grimling camp.</div></div><hr />

They aren't difficult unless you try up front melee, but they have under 1600 hitpoints so are easy for DoT classes or wizards who like to AE/quad. <br />
<br />
I've tried it as both my bard and my wizard, and I've found that using a 51 wizard and two casts of Supernova is the most effective. I round up as many mobs as I can, ae snare a few times till I get them all, round them up once and time supernova to go off right when they arrive in range. It helps to have regrowth or something to help gain back hp, I usually lost about 400 hp per AE from hits.</div></div><hr />

I think you meant Shreaking substances as Wailing substances drop off of owlbears.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Metra</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I generally do is invite a friendly wizard or druid along to my Hollowshade farming sessions. Have them mem a PBAoE (point blank area of effect) nuke, which unlike the targeted nukes can affect an unlimited number of targets.<br />
<br />
First we set the war so that the wolves or bears have taken over the south.<br />
<br />
Then I go aggro about 30 of the owlbears (or wolves). I start by putting on my best defensive buffs and Spirit of Eagle. Then I just turn on auto-attack, and then run around targeting as many mobs as I can (use F8 or click in rabid succession), hitting them quickly and then switching to the next mob. Getting every last mob on the island mad at me is a bit of a challenge.<br />
<br />
Once I have enough mobs, I drag them over to the druid, who then casts the AoE nuke.<br />
<br />
Boom! 30 dead mobs. (One nuke from a 65 druid generally kills the whole bunch, although occasionally a second nuke is needed to finish off the few stragglers.) Then the time consuming part begins - looting up and destroying all the junk. :)<br />
<br />
By the time the looting is finished, the islands will have respawned and I can go get another batch.<br />
<br />
I generally get about, oh I'd say 60 wailing substances per hour this way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If all the races are in their starting place, then you need to kill the grimling chieftan in the south islands. In my experience, if you kill the grimling chieftan, the owlbears will ALWAYS attack the south island... My 52 cleric could kill the chieftan, and his cronies by himself, however, the grimling defenders proved WAY to much for him. The grimling defenders are wh00p azz, and the owlbear attackers always died. I brought my 55 warrior in, and he could kill the chieftain, his cronies, and all the defenders without even needing a heal. *shrug* No defenders = the owlbears take over. Log back to the cleric, and let the AE Owlbear farming begin. :)<br />
<br />
The wolves are not as agressive as the owls, so it takes a fair amount of work to get them to take the south island. It can be done, killing the named owlbear that spawns where the grimling chieftan does, but more often than not, the wolves will attack the north instead of coming south. *grumble* It was really annoying, and tedious to get the wolves to attack the south.<br />
<br />
If anyone can come up with a quick and reliable way to make the wolves take over the south at will, I'd love to hear it. I farmed up 205 of each substance, so will soon be making another smithing run. Just gotta finish farming swirling shadows now... *sigh*</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">StPatrick</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 04:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was ruling the war yesterday on Stromm server.. I guess that was a one bad luck day for me. Like 3 hours of war, south island is constantly cleared by me with either Sonic wolves or bears controlling it and result - only 5 wailing substances! That's all :(<br />
Ruling the war is pretty easy if you don't much care who wins. Just continue killing the static guardians near chief spawn place and that's enough to enother side to win</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wobble</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Virgin poster but i really heavily farmed this so here's my advice.<br />
<br />
1)There's 3 factions of armies, they generally attack only whoever is anti-clockwise of their base, i can't remember them attacking in a clockwise direction.<br />
<br />
2) Only the South Island camp thing will drop wailing or shrieking substances.<br />
<br />
3) To instigate an attack you kill the 'bosses' and 'defenders' at a certain camp then wait, whoever is clockwise of here should attack soon. Sometimes tho, like 1 in 5, the camp you've forgotten about may attack the camp you're trying to make take over the one you're at. If this happens rush over and kill their attackers.<br />
<br />
4) When they attack the one you're in just make sure they win, and weeee, the island will go how you want it.<br />
<br />
5) Now you're probably farming, but you still can't slack off. Whoever has south island will probably have another camp too, this means they could be likely to attack the remaining camp, if they do this and win the scripted war thing starts and you gotta reset it all after you kill whoever wins the war.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wizard spell - Winds of Gelid ( lvl 60? ) will wipe out anything you pull. With a puller and 1 wiz you can destroy the entire south island population in a couple of pulls ( don't just get the village stuff, get the turtle shepherds and what not too), and you get a *lot* of substances - be it wolf or owl. Respawn time is 7 minutes or so, i believe, so basically you're going to be killing 40+ substance dropping mobs every 7 minutes which means after an hour or so you generally have at least a bag of substances if not two.<br />
<br />
I don't recommend doing this alone, not because it's difficult but because 1 other person of the appropiate class will triple your yield. Also,it shouldn't be hard to find either a wizard friend or someone to pull for you if you plan to do the AEing because it's always fun having huge trains and obliterating them in seconds. If you ask a wizard if he wants to join an AE group he'll bite your hand off, once he realises it's green mobs he may lose some enthusiasm but the carnage usually leashes them for a fair while =)<br />
<br />
Don't know if this all been posted before but after getting so much information off this site i figured i should post something i did quite well with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qaladar Bragollach</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The war will NEVER run to completion without player intervention.  When the side with 2 camps attacks the side with 1 camp they ALWAYS fail.  When the side with 1 camp attacks the side with 2 camps they ALWAYS win.  Unless you intervene and either kill the defenders or attackers of the side you want to lose, they will just swap camps around randomly and endlessly.<br />
<br />
Incidently, this is frequently how people leave the war when they exit the zone.  When you come in if the war hasn't been initiated.  Kill the grimling boss and bears will attack next always.  Kill the grimling defenders and they are eliminated.  After that just ignore the war.  You need both bears and wolves at south camp.  Left without intervention they will just swap camps around endlessly.<br />
<br />
Sometimes you'll have bears in south, sometimes wolves, but it doesn't matter as you need large quantities of both.<br />
<br />
Occasionally someone will alter this static state to make owlbears win.  This is because the owlbear boss drops a range slot FT1 item, and many casters can solo the whole process.<br />
<br />
If that happens, the war will reset when they kill the owlbear boss in the vah shir camp and the war will reset.  Simply kill the grimling boss again and continue as before.<br />
<br />
Leaving it in this state (grimlings up and bears/wolves endlessly fighting) is considered the polite thing to do.</div></div><hr />
