<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Silvarri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, after a few hundred ( or million or so) Misty's I am at 250, and have my spoon.<br />
<br />
Not without my share of annoyances...  I finished my last run of 200 picnics ending with a total skill of 249.  Of course the RNG couldn't give me that 1 extra point.   I did two runs of 200 combines in a row where I only got 2 skillups each batch... ouch. (what the?! I sacrificed a gnome, did a chant, sprinkled the oven with magic skilling water and the whole bit!) But luckily I had 1 brownie part left in the dark recesses of my bank vault.. and got that extra point (in the wee hours of the morning)<br />
<br />
So I stumbled into the bazaar, bought a seal.. closed my eyes, combined.  Opened them to see an empty cursor.  *sigh* go back to the bazaar.  Pray to whatever tradeskilling god and deity would listen (again, closing my eyes) and I got my spoon on the second try :D <br />
<br />
I've been waiting to see what it would looked like equipped.  So I replace my shield.. and woah, thats one mighty spoon!  Its the size and shape of a mace!  Thats not a spoon, its a meat tenderizer!! <br />
<br />
So.. thats my (long.. sorry) story..<br />
*spoon in hand walks over to the pottery wheel* time for the next one!<br />

At least you were able to afford to buy pre-made seals :p <br />
<br />
I had to spend time auctioning to buy the gems and make it myself.  They (the seals) run 10-12K on Quellious.:eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Silvarri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sithehenn, Ouch.. yeah.  I *tried* searching for Jacinth and Black Sapphires, but they are no where to be seen.  And with all the work involved, I was able to find them in the bazaar on V. for 5.5k and 6k.  Server economy.. its interesting.<br />
