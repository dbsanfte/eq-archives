<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tricsun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have the best zone to forage stuff for the ribbon recipes?  I'm just looking for the skill ups so wanting the zone where i can get the needed stuff the most.  Went to Dagnor's cauldron for Cauldron Praun and it seemed to be a very rare forage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nex Alacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually, if you do a search, you may find a thread where someone had parsed the forage rates.  He found DC to have the highest forage rates.  I found the same when I went there the first time.  But the last couple times, I've gotten more prawns from Gobos than from foraging.<br />
<br />
I got tired of the gloominess of DC and headed to Stonebrunt.  I killed every panda I could track as well as foraged, and got a nice collection of the ultra rare bamboo shoot :) .  Best part is the pandas dropped all sorts of nice gems such as sapphires, jade rings, and pearl rings.  Overall, I made about 350pp and picked up a stack of Bamboo Shoots.  Apparently I could have even done the Wazikashi of the Frozen Skies quest with some of the stuff I looted, but I didnt really care enough to follow that up.<br />
<br />
I also find that Nedaria's Landing has a nice rate of Plant Shoots, so I like to head there and wait for the boat to abysmal, mashing on my forage key :) .  Good luck with these forages, can drive ya crazy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The only problem with Nedaria is all the no-drop quest junk that you have to destroy. It's far too common.... I wouldn't say plant shoots were common there at all - about the same rate as Jaggedpine imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nex Alacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, they aren't really common per se, but at least it's a zone that kinda has a use.  That's really what I hate about the foraging, its all places that I would NEVER go if not for needing to forage this crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Benthair Dunthat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Steamfont Springs has been my most successful area. Besides a decent forage rate, there is a 3 camp group of kobolds of very low lvl that can be farmed for the water drops at the same time as foraging. I can usually get a stack of Steamfont Spring water in about an hour. GL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Normbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Since I started my run at ribbons, these Steamfont and Nedaria's Landing have been my two favorite spots for foraging.<br />
<br />
Steamfont is good because, as mentioned before, you can also get the Water from killing Kobolds.  My experience is that I get roughly an equal amount from each activity.  The only hassle is if there are newbies in the area trying to get exp.  Not nice to go kill all their mobs.<br />
<br />
Nedaria's Landing is great if you also want to get pelts.  The forage rate of plant shoots is much lower (but ultimately, I'll just need them for 183-187).  Also, along one wall there's a cave with 8 Cavern Grizzly/Magnificent Grizzly spawns.  By the time I've killed the last spawn, the first one has respawned.  I recently recorded the results from roughly three times through the cave.<br />
<br />
In 31 minutes, I killed 31 grizzlies and got 7 Low, 5 Medium and 5 High Quality Bear pelts.  There are also roaming Majestic Grizzlies that drop pelts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>maedie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lesser Faydark is also a good zone. You can forage both Morning Dew and Sylvan Berries there. The Steamfont entrance area seems to be a safe spot to park  a forager.  I've sat there for a couple hours and gotten equal numbers of Dews and Sylvan berries.  (a stack of each every few hours.)<br />
<br />
Morning Dew is used for cultural smithing, tailoring and fletching, thus sells fairly well in the bazaar. They sell at least as well as ribbon forages, so you can go to bazaar or auction and &quot;trade&quot; them for more ribbon dye by selling the dews. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Isembold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Lfay also has 4 orc camps that will drop Sylvan Berries. They are roughly lined up east-west and I usually get 2-4 drops per cycle. Respawn is fast enough that camp 1 has respawned before I gwt back from camp 4. Faction could be a consideration here though, as you loose indigo brotherhood faction and there is a WE ranger camp between camp 2 and 3 that will agro if you are evil.</div></div><hr />
