I've made only about 15 attempts to date w/ no skill rises. I'm a 56 magician soon to be 57 and I'll be headed to CS to hunt Othmirs. My question is if I should just save the othmir furs till later or just make them as I get them? Also, as the title of the post states, is Acrylia faster than Velious. Thanks for reading. I look forward to some insightful responses.<br />

Since I am a Thief, I have no capability to track nor do I have a pet to help me.  I am at the whims of my wits and luck when it comes to finding the mobs needed for working on skillups.  This is why I choose Acrylia over Velious.  Acrylia camps are relatively easy to find, as well as Rockhopper camps, so I do not have to worry about running around trying to find a roaming mob, whereas the CS/WW armor route would make it harder for me to gather components.<br />
<br />
It's more a choice of what you have available at your fingertips to use for gathering components, to me anyway, that will send  you in a specific direction moreso than deciding on what you want to make.<br />

Anything that would give me a chance at a skill-up was free game, studded acrylia, reinforced acrylia, othmir caps, Cobalt drake, Wyvern, even Haze panther and black panther.  I combined anything I got my hands on.<br />
<br />
Of all the hides I find wyvern on vendors all the time if you have the pp to buy or the patience for the tempers that seems to be the easiest to get the pelts for.  Farming velium for studs in CC is boring but fairly simple if you are high enough.<br />
<br />
I didn't think I wanted to save the pelts for months until I trivialized studded acrylia at 188.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taraddar</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;take what you can get&quot; approach seems to be good in the short term but doesn't really pay off in the long run. This is especially true of acrylia studded and reinforced. You can't control the size of acrylia bricks your getting or the quality of pelt you will get. Yes you can file down the acrylia and I think scale down the quality of the pelt and it will get you more combines initially but once studded trivs at 188 you won't be able to do them anymore for skill ups. You can combine up the acrylia but it isn't very efficient and you definitely can't increase the quality of the pelts.<br />
<br />
I'd say stock pile the pelts and make the acrylia bricks into boning so it stacks and just save em till 188 skill. Then pull out your piles and do combines for skill. In the short term your skill will go up slower but in the long run you will be using your resources more effectively and end up with less camping of parts that you can't use for skill ups anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chenier</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice idea, but then how are you gonna get to 188? I think most folks, including myself, just combined whatever you can get your hands on - because it still won't be enough. Yes, after you hit 188, make your acrylia into boning so it takes less room and your velium into studs and bonings.<br />
<br />
I used to have 2 mules that I would fill up completely with velium bricks before combining into bonings.<br />
<br />
Ugh, just writing this makes me think about how much tailoring is so hard...=P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pockets FullOfGold</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just as a reference, you cannot use a skinning knife and lower the quality of either Flawless or Superb Rockhopper hides (I've tried).  Superbs are required for Acrylia Studded and Flawless are required for Acrylia Reinforced so your attempts at skill ups are solely based upon how many Superbs or Flawless hides you currently have.</div></div><hr />

How patient are you?<br />
How rich are you?<br />
How Erudite are you?<br />
<br />
I'm not a rich tailor.  I couldn't afford to throw away money on making Wyvern masks.  So, I mainly did Halfling Cultural (still couldn't sell them, but at least it didn't cost me too much).  I banked the small pieces of velium and wyvern/tigeraptor hides I got.<br />
<br />
When Acrylia was brought in, I was 180-ish, so farmed acrylia and rockhoppers.  For the most part, I banked the flawless/boning until I got to 188, then did Acrylia Reinforced/Vale until 230-ish, then started in on the Velious stuff again.<br />
<br />
I know of someone on my server who spent &gt;50kpp to go from 225-240 (approx) by making and throwing away whatever she could get her hands on.  Ended up completely broke.  My progress is a lot slower, but I'm not broke. :)<br />
<br />
With the advent of The Bazaar, I rarely farm my own components.  What really changed the way I do things was my ability to get to 255 Wisdom without Insight Potions/Buff.  Now, I will often combine a couple things, whereas before, I would wait and for huge combining sessions.<br />
<br />
Edit: I forgot to mention the 100 or so Othmir Furs I have banked for a big push once I am trivial for Acrylia Reinforced.  They don't sell for anything on my server, anyway.</div></div><hr />
