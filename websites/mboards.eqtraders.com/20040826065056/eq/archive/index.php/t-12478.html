Hi- I know you guys are crazy busy trying to retreive data, so this is just a post to let you know.  There is an error in the recipe for A Bottle of Desert Dry Ale (LDoN brewing).  In the list of components, malt is listed, and this is incorrect- the rest of the recipe is fine; just subtract the malt.<br />
<br />
Hope you guys are doing well and happy holidays!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">go to the database update forum.  they dont let krazick out much and he will see it there sooner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey... I resent that... I keep good control of my keys... I can get out whenever I feel like.<br />
<br />
As for the recipe being out of whack... I have fixed it..<br />
<br />
But what about the trivial on it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/em screams and gates from scaley kitty.<br />
/tell krazick  well with a whole forum just for updates and the fact that you obviously read there more than other places cause your the database kitty. i kinda figured it was a more appropriate place in the future and wanted him to know.<br />
<br />
and yes i do send big long tells in game a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">no offense taken...<br />
<br />
I do respond in the DB Updates more than elsewhere... but I do read the topics of all the forums.<br />
<br />
But you are correct, this thread more belongs in the updates than here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Laurelai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, I'm working on the triv :)  Right now I am only at 200 brewing and it is still not trivial, however I did have a very good success rate- only 1 failure in 20 combines, so I am not likely far from the triv.</div></div><hr />
