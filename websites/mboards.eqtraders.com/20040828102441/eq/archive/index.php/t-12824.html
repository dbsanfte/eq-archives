<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hassun_Bagguns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am putting this here because i think it is relevent to any trader in the bazaar, which is how i sell my tradeskill stuff.<br />
<br />
this is not a rant but i am upset.<br />
<br />
when the bazaar started up i did what most peeps did and made a level one merchant, but becausei wanted tio stand out i leveled him to 20 for a last name, im on QUELLIOUS and Sollomon Grundie is my trader, much to my suprise and delight i have seen that fact stand out as i have found people talking about him once in a while.<br />
<br />
Bazaar went live july 18, 2002 or within 12 hours of there. so i have had his last name for almost 18 months. now in the last week i have lost not one but TWO last names from seperate characters, Sollomon being one of them. the other character i was told she violated the naming policy and i accepted that  because she is a new character and it reminded people of a certian female singer, but Sollomon has been around a while and i didnt not even see it till tonight, which is the first time i logged him on in a week doe to work. has anyone else suddenly had this trouble? is everyone that puts in walmart, kaymart, any other name like that getting thiers changed??? or are the GMs just angry cause they cant get people that are causing real troubles like the plat macros last week and just need someone to pick on????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I could just be obtuse, but I don't see why Sollomon Grundie would be an objectionable name.  Is it a reference to a real life store or something?<br />
<br />
As for GM's being angry and picking on people ... I seriously doubt that.  GM's are people too.  It would take a truly cruel GM to actively go about seeking to cause trouble, and to date, I have not encountered such a GM.  Granted, I've had some who were neither particularly helpful nor forthcoming, but I've always seen them as being hobbled by policy rather than actively seeking to thwart players' petitions.<br />
<br />
At any rate, I can't comment direcly on your situation as I don't understand why the GM's objected.  Be that as it may, it is ultimately Sony's game, played by Sony's rules.  My advice would be not to stress too much over it.  Pick a new name, similar enough for folks to recognize but different enough not to annoy the GM's, and go with that.  Remember that your trader hasn't been substantially changed; your first name is the same, so folks can still find you or send you tells as before.  <br />
<br />
I understand the loss of prestige that may come with losing a badge of honor like your trader's surname ... but it's not worth the stress.  Just take a deep breath, set it aside, and move on.  It's a game. ... At least, I keep trying to convince myself of that. :boggled: <br />
<br />
Oh, and on a related note, expect this to get punted to the Primal Scream room in just a bit. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>thandrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The name is very similar to the one used in the following rhyme:<br />
<br />
<br />
Solomon Grundy, <br />
Born on Monday, <br />
Christened on Tuesday, <br />
Married on Wednesday,  <br />
Took ill on Thursday, <br />
Worse on Friday, <br />
Died on Saturday, <br />
Buried on Sunday, <br />
This is the end,<br />
Of Solomon Grundy. <br />
<br />
<br />
It was also used in some of the Marvel comics according to a quick Google and is therefore likely to be copyrighted or trademarked. Personally as its not offensive I dont really see its a problem but it is close enough for the GM's to change it due to the naming policy. I can only assume you either got petitioned by some one or managed to spawn the uber rare GM with time on his hands.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Solomon Grundy is a member of the Legion of doom.  As such your name is in violation of the naming policy.<br />
<br />
http://www.seanbaby.com/superfriends/grundy.htm<br />
<br />
Generally GMs won't enforce the policy unless someone petitions, but once it's petitioned, you can lose the name.  Even if you've had the name for 4 years, which just happened to a monk in our guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I never understood why people get mad over getting their name changed when they were violating policy.  SOE posts their naming policy on their website for all to read.  If you decided you wanted a name violation anyway, be prepared to lose it.  And when you lose it, don't get mad.  <br />
<br />
Link to the Naming Policy (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/customer_service/cs_naming_policy.jsp) which states:<br />
<br />
Character names in EverQuest should reflect the genre of the game. Original, high-fantasy names are desired. These guidelines apply both to first names and to surnames, and also to the combination of first name and surname.<br />
<br />
The following types of names are inappropriate:.<br />
<br />
1. Vile, profane, rude, or racist names including common swear words, anatomical references, racial slurs, and homonyms of these words. <br />
2. Combinations of words that produce an offensive result (e.g. Hugeaz, Tug Mcgroin). <br />
3. Names of religious, occult, or significant historic origin (e.g. Jesus, Allah, Satan, Stalin, Angel, Devil, Demon). <br />
4. Trademarked names of products, services, or concepts (e.g. , Marlboro, Sony, Band-Aid). <br />
5. Non-fantasy oriented names from popular media. These names can be either fictional (e.g. Rambo, Darthvader) or non-fictional (e.g. Garth Brooks, Pierce Brosnan, Ronald Reagan, Michael Jordan). <br />
6. Common words and phrases that would not be found in the place and time setting of the game (e.g. Switchblade, Phaser, Toaster, Sloegin, Anyone). This includes references to drug substances or drug related paraphernalia. (e.g. Ecstacy, Cannibis) <br />
7. Proper names from EverQuest (e.g. Rathe, Karana). This also includes the first or last name of any significant EverQuest NPC (e.g. Dorn, Trumpy, Karn). <br />
8. Names chosen with the intent or possessed with the effect of harming the reputation of or used to impersonate a Customer or representative of Sony Online Entertainment. <br />
9. Names containing titles within them, such as, but not limited to: The, Lord, Lady, Master, King, Knight, Sir, Father (e.g. Sirtallon, Lordeagle, Mothermaggy, Darksister). <br />
10. Fantasy-oriented names that are easily recognized from popular existing media (e.g. Merlin, Gandalf, Belgarath, Drizzt, Tanis). <br />
11. Names where the combination of the first and last name violate a previous rule. <br />
<br />
For all of the above, misspellings and alternative spellings of the word or words are also unacceptable.<br />
<br />
If a name is found to be in violation of any of the above polices, a member of the Customer Service Team will then use the following process:<br />
<br />
For category 1 or 2 offenses, a member of the Customer Service Team will change the name of the character as soon as it is discovered. You may be notified of this name change either in-game or by email. Depending on the nature of the offensive name, the account may also be subject to disciplinary action including suspension or banning. A GM will contact you to inform you if disciplinary action is taken. <br />
<br />
For categories 3 through 11, the member of the Customer Service Team will contact you either in game or via email to notify you of the character's name change. After your name is changed, any corpses currently in the world will no longer be accessible. Please inform a Customer Service Team member if you have a current corpse prior to the name change.<br />
<br />
Conditions for Name Changes:<br />
<br />
First names are generally not changed unless they violate the Naming Policy. <br />
<br />
Surname Policy:<br />
<br />
Surnames may not contain spaces <br />
Surnames may contain double capitals provided that the capital letters do not violate any of the prior policies. <br />
Surnames may contain an accent ( ` ) provided that the division created does not violate any of the prior policies. This accent is the only non-alpha character that is allowed in surnames. <br />
Any number of Customers may have the same surname. Customers wishing to use a surname that's rejected by the name filter need only request in-game assistance using the /petition command.<br />
<br />
Conditions for Surname Changes:<br />
<br />
Customer Service will change a Character's last name at his or her request, provided that the Character is level 20+ and either the requested surname, or the requested combination of the first name and surname do not violate the Naming Policy. Upon approval, this change may either result in the Customer receiving a new surname or the removal of the surname altogether.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I started off the game with an offensive name which a GM ended up changing to &quot;Fluffyfoo&quot; as punishment.  They let me choose a new name, which was supposed to be my normal &quot;Stugein&quot; but they misspelled it and left off the &quot;i&quot; (Stugen).  They wouldn't let me fix it without paying the name-change fee (which I won't do just to fix their typo).  That's why I ended up making my character's surname &quot;Damiddle&quot;.<br />
<br />
So don't violate the naming policy.  Otherwise you get a stupid name which is then misspelled when changed and you are forced to do a stupid play on words with your last name to make it make sense. :)<br />
<br />
Everyday I wish someone would report &quot;Stugen Damiddle&quot; as not being &quot;fantasy enough&quot; or something, just so I can get their stupid typo fixed.  (Hey, if you see me running around on Fennin - report me!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hassun_Bagguns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok, i have never heard of the poem that was in the second post, but it sounded cool.<br />
<br />
as far as the justice league thing i was mabey 15 when it was on i think and didnt really watch it so i dont remember the character.<br />
<br />
O well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oualawouzou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Good news, Stugen!<br />
<br />
&quot;Damiddle&quot; violates the naming policy because it is like a title (&quot;da&quot; beind obviously used to mean &quot;the&quot;).  So it's even easier to petition! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm a bit torn on the issue.  I want someone to report me so that I can have my name fixed, however since I had been originally reported for the offensive name which resulted in the misspelling when it was changed, I am afraid that a second report would result in undesirable disciplinary action.  So while I could just have a friend of mine in-game report me, the result could end up not being as I desire.  The way I see it, I could end up with any of the following:<br />
<br />
1 - Surname removed and first name change to &quot;Stugein&quot; as it was supposed to be from the get-go.  This is the hoped for fix.<br />
<br />
2 - Surname removed and first name left as &quot;Stugen&quot; which would still be just as idiotic as &quot;Stugen&quot; doesn't mean anything, especially without the stupid surname.<br />
<br />
3 - Suspension/banning for the &quot;repeat&quot; violation.<br />
<br />
Any chance that someone &quot;in the know&quot; could wager a guess on what would happen if I had someone report me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Marteeny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bad news is they will just delete your surname. Your first name will remain the same.:chef:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Itek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's odd the way little names and things will stick in your mind. You probably forgot where you got the name from.<br />
<br />
There are a couple of &quot;unposted&quot; caveats to the naming policy enforcement.<br />
<br />
1) Characters over level 35 have &quot;reputation&quot; and their names are not generally changed unless it's a SERIOUS violation.<br />
<br />
2) Guides and GMs hate naming policy violations. Because Guides can't do anything about it except report it to Senior Guides and GMs for action. (Seniors can change names, regular Guides can't)<br />
<br />
3) Except for VERY serious violations name changes have to be done &quot;in person&quot; so that the offender can have a chance to pick a new name.<br />
<br />
Now pause a moment and think about just HOW MANY people have naming violations on their traders. My rough guess would be at least 100 traders on any given server at any given time violate policy and are under level 35.<br />
<br />
Do you think they want to spend the rest of their LIVES walking up and down the Bazaar sending /tells to people about their names? :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Couple of true stories of Naming Policy Hades. I was personally present for all of them.<br />
<br />
Enter our friend Itek's little druid alt. I thought Runsfaster would be a cool name for a druid. (Runsfaster does NOT violate the naming policy.)<br />
<br />
While waiting to be admitted to the guide program I got him to level 20 and picked the surname Thanyew. (Thanyew does NOT violate the naming policy.)<br />
<br />
Some passing bard saw &quot;Runsfaster Thanyew&quot; and got offended. He petitioned. Suddenly Apprentice Guide Itek is talking to a Guide about his alt's name.<br />
<br />
Guide: Is your name Runsfaster?<br />
Runsfaster: Yes... Runsfaster Thanyew.<br />
Guide: Hmm... neither of those names violates the policy. I'll let it slide.<br />
Runsfaster: I think the petition is about it being a phrase. Runs Faster Than You.<br />
Guide: Oh, yeah, that's a problem.<br />
<br />
Solution = I chose a new first name, gave up the last name, and later decided to use the same last name as my main. My name wasn't bad, but it technically violated the policy.<br />
<br />
As a Guide I came across &quot;Jokeysmurf.&quot; Took a few minutes for me to convince the Senior Guide that Jokey Smurf was a fairly well known cartoon character. Good-bye JokeySmurf. (Guy also had the bad habbit of charming skeletons in West Freeport, buffing and equiping them and then camping. i.e. very nasty surprise for some poor newbie. a.k.a. griefing to cause exp loss, since this was well before the &quot;soft newbie&quot; rules.) <br />
<br />
Itek's Guide: Greetings Jokeysmurf. You are receiving warnings for zone disruption and naming policy violations. Please send a tell to Senior Guide Veronica when you have a new name picked out. Please also note that you have received two account warnings. A third account warning will require you to talk to the Server-GM.<br />
Jokeysmurf: What zone disruption? What naming violation? U r ghey.<br />
Itek: buffing skeletons so they kill newbies is zone disruption. I saw you do it. I logged you doing it. I have another witness. Do you care to deny it? The naming policy violation is clear. Jokey Smurf is a copyrighted cartoon character name, as I am sure you are aware. Have you picked out a new name yet?<br />
Jokeysmurf: Opps. Have to log out now.<br />
Itek: No problem. I've soulmarked your account. If we haven't heard from you in a week expect Server GM Linous to change your characters name offline for you. And if Server GM Linous, in the process of changing Jokeysmurf's name, finds other characters on your account that violate naming policy you can expect a one week suspension for multiple violations of the naming policy. Have a great day and enjoy your travels in Norrath.<br />
<br />
ThePope: /shout can someone give me 10 plat<br />
/who thepope<br />
(Level 6 paladin) ThePope (east commons) (prior to luclin/bazaar)<br />
<br />
Itek: Greetings, this is Guide Itek. Your name has religious connotations. You will need to contact Server GM Linous during his &quot;office hours&quot; to have it changed. You will be allowed to choose a new name. You can consider this a verbal, rather than account, warning on naming policy.<br />
ThePope: (note, not the real name, name change to protect the guilty) I don't believe this name is a violation.<br />
Itek: I have personal knowledge that your name is a religious reference. It will have to be changed.<br />
ThePope: You can't make me change it, prove to me where this is a religious name. Prove to me the naming policy which says I can't have a religious name.<br />
(Note: He's changing his story, and he's playing a paladin. He's very much aware of the religious nature of the name he's attempted to mispell.)<br />
Itek: Here's the address of the policy. Ignorance is no defense. You can look the name up in your local copy of the Bible. (the actual name appears in the Bible twice as often as Methesula or however it's spelled)<br />
ThePope: I've worked very hard to level up this character and you don't have the right to tell me to change it.<br />
(remember, he's level -6- and begging for plat in /shout)<br />
<br />
Well the conversation went downhill from there. <br />
<br />
Solution = ThePope gets a new name. Itek gets a permanent vacation from the Guide Program. (Yes, I got kicked out of the Guide Program for enforcing the rules.)<br />
<br />
Wakkyweed Pipesmoker walks by Itek.<br />
/who wakky<br />
(Level 40 druid) Wakkyweed (Known Griefers Guild)<br />
/report Wakkyweed<br />
/petition I just /report'ed Wakkyweed so you can look up their account info even if they log off. Wakkyweed has the surname Pipesmoker. This is a clear violation of naming policy.<br />
<br />
Wakkyweed (no surname) walks by Itek.<br />
/petition Wakkyweed had their surname Pipesmoker removed but their name STILL violates policy.<br />
<br />
Wakky (Known Griefers Guild) walks by Itek.<br />
*sigh*<br />
<br />
Wakky (no guild) walks by Itek. (funny, haven't seen anyone with a Known Griefers tag in months... perhaps petitioning 10 different naming and policy violations and petitioning the guild as a whole had something to do with that....)<br />

Marteeny is exactly correct, presuming you are over level 35. Under NO circumstances except a type 1 or type 2 violation will Names (not surnames) be changed on characters over level 35 due to &quot;reputation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your best bet, to avoid a warning for naming violation, is to /petition yourself for a surname change. Get married or join a group of friends who all have the same last name. Or just admit you didn't know your surname would violate policy when you took it and would like to volunteer to comply. Guides HATE giving out warnings. It's a bunch of paperwork, it's time consuming, it leaves a bad taste in their mouth, and it makes their superiors do even MORE paperwork. Which makes the superiors begin to dislike the Guide.<br />
<br />
Pet: I've messed up my surname, can you help me fix it?<br />
Guide: I'd love to what's the problem?<br />
<br />
-or-<br />
<br />
Guide: Sorry your name violates policy, I'll just give you a verbal warning. Do you have a new name in mind for when the Senior / GM arrives to change it for you?<br />
<br />
If you were the Guide, given a choice which conversation would you rather have?</div></div><hr />

We had a level 65 with 190 AA get a name change for a type 9 Itek.  So... no.  Maybe it's just SH, but I doubt it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If there is no chance at getting the first name changed, there really isn't a point in having the surname removed/fixed.  Surname or not, &quot;Stugein&quot; means something.  &quot;Stugen&quot; does not.<br />
<br />
Now that I think back a bit, I don't think making the name &quot;Stugen&quot; wa a typo on their part.  I think it was that &quot;Stugein&quot; was locked because of me, and they just gave me &quot;Stugen&quot; cause it was close.  It's been a lot of years, but I think it went down like this:<br />
<br />
1 - Li'l ol me finds this game called Everquest.  Starts a L1 WAR named &quot;Stugein&quot;.<br />
<br />
2 - After playing for a couple days, I decide that the WAR isn't for me.  I delete 'Stugein the WAR' and go to create my Shadowknight.<br />
<br />
3 - Even though I deleted the WAR, the game will not let me choose &quot;Stugein&quot; for the name of my SK.  I guess that it has been locked by the system or something.  Oh well.  Since I don't care for any other serious name I choose *offensive name that got me reported*, thinking I was funny.  Yeah, it was stupid.<br />
<br />
4 - I get reported.  GM asks for new name.  I say, &quot;Stugein&quot;.  Name changes to &quot;Stugen&quot;.  I have always assumed typo, but thinking back, it could've been that the requested name was &quot;locked&quot;.<br />
<br />
5 - I petition that the name change was spelled incorrectly.  No responses.<br />
<br />
6 - Long time passes.  I had since quit the game.  Upon reactivating my account and finding my character still intact, I go about trying to get the name fixed.  In a chat with cust serv I am told that it has been too long to correct it for being a typo, that I would have to pay the name change fee.  Resign myself to name stupidity and make surname &quot;Damiddle&quot;.<br />
<br />
7 - Posts story that most don't care about to EQTraders.  :D<br />
<br />
It's been awhile, but I believe that was how it all went down.  Can anyone confirm the name locking theory?  Like, if you delete a character can you then create a new character with the old character's name, or is that name locked out for good?  I would test it myself (create L1 char, delete it, create another L1 char with same name to see if it works), but I am at work.</div></div><hr />

That might be the modern policy, or the normal policy, which would be good, but its definitely not always the policy :worried:<br />
<br />
Friend of mine got her name changed at lvl 51, for violating the &quot;Three words&quot; rule.  It isn't part of the naming policy anymore, but a name could not be composed of 3 or more words, regardless of whether they formed a phrase/made sense or not. Still bitter about that one :grumpy:</div></div><hr />

Oddly enough, I knew the rhyme but not the comic reference. My own main's name is, coincidentally, the stock abbreviation for Nations Funds Trust High Income Portfolio (which is, obviously, not the reason I have that name).  My other two characters' names come up with no hits on Google at all. My last name is one letter off of a large company's name, but again...wasn't chosen for similarities.<br />
<br />
Either I'm just plain weird (shush, Phabos) or it's pretty easy to come up with a name that doesn't violate the naming policy, do a quick Google, and go with it (Nhin is apparently a Vietnamese word that means, among other things, &quot;to look at&quot; or &quot;to save&quot;).<br />

Ahaha cute.<br />
<br />
In regard to the original poster's question about &quot;walmart&quot; etc violations, essentially I've seen so many of those that its a case of people actually bothering to petition them and someone getting around to changing them. <br />
<br />
Yours being changed seems to just be the luck of the draw. GMS are notoriously underpaid and notoriously busy, with no one who is only paid for doing name finding. So its more or less if they feel like it when they get a petition, probably, or notice it in passing... or the most often way I've heard of a name getting changed is when YOU (the person with the rule breaking name) petitions. That is a good way to draw GM attention to it. At that point you are waving the violation in their face.<br />
<br />
It would be fun to be a GM in the bazaar and just go &quot;BOOM BOOM BOOM&quot; and when people wake up their &quot;walmart&quot; characters were changed to things like , &quot;Snookumpoo&quot;, &quot;Wigumpuss&quot;, &quot;Goober&quot; and such.</div></div><hr />

So kinda of the spirit of &quot;Treebadbarrel&quot;, although those are related terms ('barrel' often being a form of a 'tree', and 'bad' could be considered commentary on that change in form although direction is unclear).<br />
<br />
Glowringzero can be parsed as well - its very hard not to make /some/ sort of phrase with the format of [verb form of adjective] [noun] [number] - but the resulting concept (e.x. a glowing ring, numbered zero) isn't of much meaning.  Reinterpretting it as a misspelling (e.x. glowering zero, glowing zero, glow wings or oh, etc) has many more possibilities, but that removes it (for the most part) from the &quot;three word&quot; realm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was I booted from the Guide program over 2 years ago?<br />
<br />
Basicly I haven't released any &quot;classified&quot; information, nor &quot;told tales out of school&quot; without changing the names to protect the innocent. (Wakky got delt with in response to petitions I made well after leaving the guide program. As a player I'm allowed to post character names of people to avoid.)

I avoid getting banned from EQTraders, and from EQ, because I pretty much have only one hobby. EQ.<br />

Plus when I was released only 1 or perhaps 2 of the Senior Guides had a problem with me. The server GM (no longer with the GM crew) loved me and my fellow guides on the server loved me. (Certain guides from other servers didn't like me, because I have a habit of not pulling punches on bboards.) Since my release I have REPEATEDLY been encouraged to re-apply. I have also encouraged everyone who meets the requirements to apply to reduce the CRUSHING lack of Guides available.<br />
<br />
I've told some nice stories and cautionary tales. But I haven't said anything I should not have. *flips open old guide notebook* For instance I -could- post old Jokeysmurf's PID number. Wouldn't do any NON-guide/GM any good. And it would be a serious violation of the rules for Guides.

<br />
You might be ahead to get all the technicalities ironed out before you publish.<br />
<br />
Word is that RA Salvatore plays EQ, and they wouldn't let *him* call his character Drizzt (or however it's spelled).<br />
<br />
Wish I could recall where I read that, so I could link it for you.  :irked: <br />
<br />
Anyhow, though it *should* be possible to use your own character names in both places, depending on how the contracts are set up it may not be legal.  :worried: <br />
<br />
Best wishes for good results on your writing efforts though. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends on whether Sony keeps copyright on &quot;game content&quot; to include character names.  If they don't, it could be a headache and a half. Like, let's say that I name my character Nhinx Aphsion; and then I win some contest and they name some gear after me. &quot;Nhinx's Pants of Tanking (STR +5, DEX +10, effect: Circle of Ro).&quot; Now last week I've sent my previously-written manuscript into Big Name Publisher, and they decide to publish my amazing work involving heroine Nhinx, where a major plot element hinges on her habit of always wearing cargo pants.  <br />
<br />
Can Sony be sued for using in THEIR game an item which seems derived from MY character? Or, rather, can Sony sue ME for publishing a work with an element derived from THEIR game? (In the time line above, my book character was created first, but it's ambiguous whether my pants or theirs came first.) Even let's say that we decide to live and let live amicably with the two characters (mine in my book, and the one I play on their servers) and the two pants-- let's say that Author #2 writes a work starring Nhinnix and HER &quot;amazing pants&quot;-- so which of us takes him or her to court for copyright violations? Who owns the character?<br />
<br />
You might want to check with a copyright specialist, but if you intend to publish your work soon, I'd highly recommend coughing up to change your characters' names, and not have the EQ characters exist concurrently with your published work.  This isn't just Sony's viewpoint I'm taking, it's the point of-- you go to publish and they ask if you've previously published your work anywhere. Sure, a couple character names are nothing, but if you role-play your characters and they have battle songs, common sayings, etc... you could be running into some issues where &quot;your&quot; characters have been &quot;publishing&quot; themselves in Sony's space for a while.<br />
<br />
I am NOT a lawyer. Please consult an attorney who is familiar with copyright law in your jurisdiction rather than taking my advice verbatim. Your skillups may vary, void where prohibited by mathematical law.<br />

When my DE enchanter, Anarchy made it to level 20 I went to the Arena to have my surname added. I asked the GM for the surname N`Despair, but he turned it down because Anarchy N`Despair violated the phrase naming rules. Months later I had a different character hit level 20 and it was time for another surname. Correct or not, I had heard that some of the naming rules had be dropped/altered and some things that were not originally acceptable were now ok.<br />
<br />
This being the case I asked a GM for my surname (I had to ask because it had a ` in it.) and they granted it. The full name created a phrase, but since a GM had to be the one to approve the name, I felt it was not a violation. After reading this thread I hope I do not find myself looking at a changed surname someday. If it does someday have to be altered I hope they at least give me the option of picking it so I can make it the same as some of my other &quot;related&quot; characters.

No, they don't play favorites. They just don't have the authority to do &quot;offline changes&quot; except for EXTREME violations. And most Guides can't even do online changes. Think back to all the times you've seen &quot;Senior Guide SoAndSo&quot; online. If there's a shortage of guides (and there is) the shortage of Seniors and GMs is much worse.<br />
<br />
I doubt there's a &quot;bazaar mule&quot; exception. But, as someone pointed out, if they started doing bazaar mules with naming violations several GMs would have a new &quot;life task&quot; set before them. (How do you do a online name change when the person is AFK a minute after they log in and might not be back for 6+ hours?)<br />

Yes, permanent things DO happen if you are caught with a naming violation. It's permanently marked on your account record. If you have more than a couple of them at the GMs discretion they can give you a week to a month &quot;suspension&quot; and if it's a serious pattern of repeated offenses they CAN and DO ban accounts. Naming violation isn't a parking ticket. It's a speeding ticket in a state that tracks &quot;points&quot; on your license.</div></div><hr />
