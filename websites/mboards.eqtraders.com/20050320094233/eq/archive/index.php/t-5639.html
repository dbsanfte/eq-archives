<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verdandi</div><div class="date">04-02-2003, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone know of any spells that are No Drop, are only available as drops (not vendors, quests, or research), and only drop in zones that require a key and a large raid (or a similarly formidable hurdle)?  So far all I know of is Primal Avatar, the shaman spell that drops in Sleeper's Tomb (or Kerafyrm's Lair, whatever you wanna call it), is no drop, and cannot be researched.  Don't count Ancient spells, I know we all have those.  They all start with Ancient in the name so they're easy to count out.  And I don't mean just rare drops, or off of rare mobs, I mean spells that are completely impossible to reach without a large uberguild raiding force.  Anyone know of any besides those?  <br />
<br />
I'm not going to elaborate on why I want to know just yet, because doing so elsewhere only gathered criticism of my motives, argument over whether a guild that can get into ST necessarily qualifies as an &quot;uberguild&quot;, etc....  It's not worth that much fuss and that's all irrelevant to the question!  I just want the facts!  <br />
<br />
So if you know of such a spell, or know that a particular class definitely, absolutely, positively does not have any such spells, please speak up. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pojodan</div><div class="date">04-02-2003, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Beastlords do not have any such spells, though our Spirit of Snow and Spirit of Flame are horribly rare drops off boss type MoBs in Luclin.  However, those are the only two spells Beastlords have that arn't vendor bought or procured through parchments, so it sorta evens out (Annoyingly, a lot of the vendor bought spells drop in higher level dungeons as well making people price them rediculously thinking they're drop only)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Speed of the Brood was finally put on a drop table.. months after SoL came out, thanks to the pestering of chanters saying it wasn't dropping (odd.. it wasn't)...  and Illusion Scaled Wolf does not have a scroll, even though it's live (/boggle)...  neither of them qualify.  KEI is boss mobs, Dementing Visions is NToV named.. most other chanter spells are a dime a dozen, if that spendy.</div></div><hr />
