<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cigarskunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I've given up trying to destroy my yard - I've salted it, I've used defolients on it, I've scraped off the top soil, I even sowed copper sulfate into it - the freakin grass loves everything and anything I do and comes back twice as thick and healthy as before.<br />
<br />
So if you can't beat 'em, join 'em - this spring I want to cover the entire yard with some kind of low maintence flower that will come back every year on it's own - I'm thinking marigolds (my mom planted some one year and they were invincible), but wouldn't mind some other stuff to make it a bit more interesting then a solid carpet of yellow.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions and planting advice would be appreciated - I know as much about growing and planting stuff as my troll SK knows about elvish culture and literature. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">leave it alone.  you are dealing with demon crab grass.  try cutting it on a really really hot day in the summer and then putting a bit of water on it.  not much but a little does more harm than good during the heat of the day. <br />
<br />
that is some tuff grass.<br />
<br />
find any native flowering weed type plant.  they are adapted to it and will prolly live better than nearly anything else.</div></div><hr />

If you're still interested in plants, send me a PM with the general area of the world/state/etc you live in and I'd be willing to help.  My senior thesis in college was on sustainable urban horticulture (basically, how to green up cities and so forth and reduce energy needs through the use of plants in urban environments).  For urban environments you need plants that can REALLY stand the abuse and poor soil conditions ... and after reading the wholesale destruction you've wreaked upon your soil, I'm willing to believe that your yard now falls in the category of &quot;poor soil conditions&quot; :)<br />
<br />
Right off the bat, I can tell you that marigolds won't work for what you want.  They are annuals, meaning that you have to replant them every year.  If you are looking at plant catalogues, you want to look in the &quot;perennial&quot; section.  Perennials come up every year.  My mom taught me how to remember the difference - she said to always remember the phrase &quot;Perennial as the grass&quot;......<br />
<br />
<br />
.... on the other hand, that's what you're trying to forget ... so maybe that isn't such a good suggestion for you.  :)<br />
<br />
In any case yes, for a short answer you want native perennials.  You can usually get around grumpy neighbors by planting them in clumps and labelling them.  &quot;Those aren't weeds, that's my garden!&quot;</div></div><hr />

 I was about to suggest the same thing.:D :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Inyidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you're concerned about appearances, you can do like they do in Phoenix.  Lay down a bed of gravel and paint it grass green.<br />

No maintenance lawn!</div></div><hr />

Broken beaks! *ouch*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aandaie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">After doing those first things you mention, simply put down some of the plastic made for that purpose and then put lava rocks/gravel or some other kind of decorative stuff over it.<br />
The plastic underneath the gravel assures that nothing grows.<br />
<br />
I guess it would take a lot of it if the yard is large, though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ancarett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We've converted part of our yard to wildflowers. They're zone-specific so they're used to our kind of weather (killer winters, hot summers). They look pretty most of the summer long since there's a variety of flowers. The only drawback is that they can grow knee-high (or gnome-high) so if you're looking for short and sweet, that won't do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you drink tea, I'd suggest planting some Lemon Balm close to the house. It grows like a weed, comes back every year, and is good for adding to tea as a flavoring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Teedyo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">First thing that came to my mind was Morning Glory.  How could you go wrong having a 'glorious' yard. ;-)  I think it's considered a creeping vine and the real neat thing is; if you don't think it's spreading fast enough; plow it up.  It'll spread twice as fast.  I don't know what your climatic conditions are but, it's native to MT plains with 90's summers, frigid winters and 10 - 13 in. annual rainfall.<br />
Pretty flower with no other redeeming qualities.  At least you can make wine with dandelions. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lemon balm and anything in the mint family would be a good choice because of their tenacity for living. If you live in a hot climate, however, I would suggest the low-growing, creeper Chamomile. It's not uncommon to see this grown as a ground cover in hotter climates because it will survive mowing. I'd take advantage of the list-buddies here who can send you info on species native to your area, though. :)</div></div><hr />

Roundup and Crossbow and Liberty. nuff said.  <br />
<br />
ACK!  Crossbow kills blackberry creepers.  If it kills them, I'll bet it'll kill dang near anything!  Roundup's great on the run-of-the-mill stuff, but that Crossbow would wilt the Emerald Jungle from my personal experience.  Nasty chemically stuff, tho.<br />
<br />
Mint family plants are usually exceptionally hardy and there are varieties native/friendly to nearly every area of the planet.  Not as pretty as morning glories, but easier to control. <br />
