<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Millay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I noticed that the recipe says there's a turn in quest to get the recipe to convert raw nihilite to pale nihilite, but I can't find any info on this website regarding it. Can anyone tell me how to do it, or even whom to begin talking to?<br />
<br />
Also, where does nihilite and aligned ore drop?<br />
<br />
thank you,<br />

&quot;...What he needs for questing is pale nihilite, which is obtained by giving the other jewelcraft vendor, Bansama, raw pale nihilite.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drops from GoD mobs in a number of zones. I've gotten all mine in Natimbi - The Broken Shores.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Which mobs dropped them for you?  I've killed a bunch of turtles, and a couple hynids, but the only tradeskill item I've seen drop (other than research stuff) was one piece of raw dark matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eumerin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can either:<br />
<br />
1.) Do one of the series of quests/combines provided by the jewelcrafting NPCs on the Queen of Thorns (this will provide you with the ability to convert raw nihilite gems into useable ones), or<br />
<br />
2.) You can hand the raw gem in to one of the jewelcrafting NPCs (talk to them to find out which one) and get the refined piece back.<br />
<br />
All of the tradeskills in Gates have one or two items that drop in the expansion and need to be refined in one of the above fashions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azirux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've gotten Raw Pale Nihilite in Natimbi from  A Furious Cragwalker, Kyv Heartpiercer, and A Reef Crustacean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Was teh reef crustacean a named mob?  The other two you list here are named . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grimwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Raw Pale Nihilite is also a useful subcombine goody for Blacksmithing, so I've spent maybe six hours so far in Natimbi looking for that and the Aligned Ore.  Managed to bag four RPNs and three to five of the Aligned Ores.  The fierce cragwalker did drop an RPN for me.  The other ore and nihilite drops came off random land mobs.. tureptas, stonemites and hynids mainly.  <br />
<br />
Depending on your level and class, a small area of Natimbi is soloable.  The flat area with its hillside across from Wayfarers, and the narrow strip of land north of Wayfarers, are both reasonable.  Elsewhere the mobs are dense-packed, and of course about a third of the zone is a no-go for less than raid-size groups when the Cragbeast Queen is up. <br />
<br />
Not really a good zone for farming imho.  Slow spawn rates in the open flat areas and the low drop rates people have commented on, mixed with lots of high-levels who aren't about to move to more difficult zones... you won't be coming away with a full stack of anything.  Every time I had my Dire Charmed turtle at 100% health, one to three people tried to pull him even though I was standing right beside him.  (Arrows whizzing by?  Ranger this time, hmmm, hope he figures it out faster than that Bard did... ) But we tradeskillers persevere :-).<br />
<br />
You should be getting the occasional ore or nihilite, tea leaf, wheat, hynid mane, or other useable tradeskill drop off random mobs.  Maybe one or two an hour (of one kind or another, not necessarily of &quot;all&quot; kinds) is my experience. no doubt better if you're higher level and have the zone to yourself.  Also expect the most unbelievable collection of oddball No Drop junk imaginable... you'll need extra pack space til you get it home where you can figure out what the heck it all is, lol.<br />
<br />
One final note:  Once you do the Quest on the ship city and have jumped through the hoops enough that you can convert Raw Pale Nihilite to Pale Nihilite in your own normal Jewelry Kit, you still can't actually -work- with the Pale Nihilite til you have a &quot;Reinforced Jewelry Kit&quot;.  It's another Quest, from the male Jewelry NPC, and requires a No Drop Turepta Shell plus some NPC purchaseable stuff.  There &quot;should&quot; be a way to &quot;reinforce&quot; a Collapsible Jewelry Kit, but that may require the /Feedback approach;  my collapsible kept saying DNC. <br />
<br />
 May the RNG be with you :-).<br />
