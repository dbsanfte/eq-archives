<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've psoted this in the LDoN holding tank but I have confirmed the following<br />
<br />
Rough Sedgewood Compound (Linen):  213&lt;Linen&lt;=215<br />
Rough Sedgewood Compound (Hemp):  212&lt;Hemp&lt;=215<br />
Rough Sedgewood Compound (Silk):  214&lt;Silk<br />
<br />
(need one more branch to nail down Silk).<br />
<br />
My gut, after doing hundred of these is that they will all be trivial at 215, the same as the carved and shaped, making the rough the skill-up path of choice, i think.<br />
<br />
Having said that, even with tinkered cams, I am not sure these are more economical to 215 than Darkwood.   When you succeed on the Dark, you lose 40pp.  When you succeed on these, even if you treat the Sedge branch as free (which is bad economics),  you lose about 30pp on two tinkered cams.  But the sedge branch is not free, someone will pay you at least 25pp on my server, so the only question is whether you vendor the sedgewood bows (at 4.5pp) or can sell them to players at a better price.  I'v sold about 5 of these since LDoN cam eout, at 90-100pp but not in the last week.  I think, ultimately, these will be a nice option for heavy LDoN foragers who don't like to sell stuff in the bazaar, for whom the value of the sedge branches is low IF they have access to a gnome.  Pay retail (39.5pp) for a cam and you are much better off doing Darkwood + Hemp all the way to 215.</div></div><hr />
