<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dlrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone.  I am starting out and am trying to find out where I can buy enchanted bars.  I found a vendor in Ak'anon which sold enchanted bars, but he only had about 10.  Are there other vendors which sell them too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Roerif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think enchanted bars are sold by a vendor in his default stock.  Those were probably sold to the vendor by some enchanter. <br />
<br />
Check out the bazaar for enchanted bars.  Or become friends with an Enchanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mewkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Enchanted bars are not sold by NPC vendors unless someone sold some to them. While skilling up, people use enchanted bars to help offset the costs since enchanted jewelry sells back to vendors for more plat than unenchanted. If you're trying to skill up, it probably only makes sense to either have a friend enchant some for you, or take the price hit by selling back unenchanted jewelry. The amount of exra plat made by selling back to vendors probably wont cover the extra time and cost by buying supplies from vendors in the bazaar (at least until you start dealing with some of the more expensive gems since the price difference is based on a percentage rather than a flat amount).</div></div><hr />
