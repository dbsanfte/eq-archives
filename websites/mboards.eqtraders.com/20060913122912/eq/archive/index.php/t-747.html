I read that from the last fan faire report or something that dex may be used as a skillup trait for Tailoring. Has anyone else heard of this? I am waiting for this to come true to attempt tailoring =) Thaaaanks!</div></div><hr />

I get about 1 skill up / 5 attempts with a 255+ DEX. My INT and WIS are abysmal (around 85-105), so it can't be those. Is 1/5 standard (I'm around 115 skill) or is DEX playing a roll?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahlig</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have found that at lower levels, you tend to get skill-ups faster.  At my 168 skill, I tend to get more skill ups (6 in 12 attempts on acrylia studded masks the other day) moreso than my friend that is a 213 tailor.  The lower the skill level, the more prevalent the skill-up from what I have noticed.  I do not think DEX is necessarily a component.<br />

I had a Smithing Skill of 47 and was finally fed up with losing more than 1/2 of my Acrylia after all breakdowns to make Acrylia Studs (Trivial 45), so I decided to increase my skill in Smithing.  I went and bought enough Lockpick components to make 60 of them.  With a Str of approx. 150, Wis of approx. 145 and an Int approx. 110, I managed to increase my Smithing skill to 77.  That's 30 Skill ups in 60 attemps.  1 skillup for every 2 combines.<br />
<br />
I have yet to see how my new skill of 77 will affect my combines when making Acrylia Studs since I'm hunting Rockhoppers currently, but if it's still bad, I will increase my skill some more.<br />
<br />
I tend to agree with the others here.  I do not believe that your Wis/Int/Str/Dex is all that important when your skill is so low.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Treebender</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In all of my thousands and thousands of combines, I have noticed that getting wis/int over 240 gave me the best skill up %,  Although folks don't claim that dex is a stat, I have viewed and proved to myself that if my dex is under 150 I will fail alot more often then if my dex is over 240.  And again VI seems to never want to come out and give anyone any pure facts for some reason, but IMO if you are attempting a high end item, it is more than worth the effort to hunt down a shammy/enchanter and get your dex stat to max.  I was 248 skill before the nerf patch so all of my info was in the old set up.  But even know the Dex max still proves true and I was 60% more successful on combines with dex maxed then with dex at 95......this is over the last 4 weeks making velious combines.  One other note, I have increased my max wis with AA and lvls to 275 now and it has not seemed to matter at all from when it was at 255. <br />

<br />
your rate of learning is based off of your dex/int whichever is higher<br />
<br />
doesn't help you succeed</div></div><hr />

Unless the devs are lying at fan fairs they have said numerous times that dex does not effect tailoring.</div></div><hr />
