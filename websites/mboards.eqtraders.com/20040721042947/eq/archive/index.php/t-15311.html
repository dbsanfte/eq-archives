<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ziggyholiday</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering how much of a possiblility it would be for me to try and make the firestrand silk armour.  My guild is not yet in PoFire, we lack RZtW and Sol Ro but I've been able to buy everything but the sap and very resonable prices(I've not spent more than 100pp per item).  So really the only thing holding me back from making the fire emblems(sp) is the sap.  I only ever see them being sold for 17k+ on my server and after lurking around here I'm thinking that is b/c people are using it to make the earring quest item?  Any info would be helpfull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Using obsidianwood saps on anything besides firesilk undergarment makes baby jesus cry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Iilane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sad but true, obsidianwood saps are often worth more pp than the final product. <br />
<br />
On my server, 3 Obsidianwood saps sold in 70k packages are snapped up almost immediately. Robe of Eternal Fire sells for roughly 70k too, however you risk failing the combine and end up with nothing for sale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Leafrat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Obsidianwood Saps are expensive because they are rare.<br />
<br />
Yes, AG has something to do with it, but take it from someone who has been farming all his own saps--they are rare buggers, and the pricerange of 15k-25k is pretty high--but its not entirely unreasonable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ziggyholiday</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thanks for the responses, the reason why I was thinking pofire silk tailoring was 1) b/c as far as I've seen, no one is making/selling the armour on tholuxe and 2) my guild will be in fire soon as long as we're killing the mobs I'm fairly certain I can get the majority of the sap if any drops.  Have thought of selling pieces like the pants for 20kish and that would be a hell of a return for th time I've spent on tailoring.  As far as failures, I've got shei shears so I guess that makes me ahead of the game a little in that respect?<br />
<br />
Just a few random, I've been working all freaking night thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KanadWinterstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I made a post in primal screams about what mobs the guild does/doesn't kill in fire, and suffice to say we've gotten a grand total of two sap from 4+ months in fire. Don't get your hopes up about it unless your guild pullers are really bad indeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">To be honest, with the AG earring causing any rare saps to drop to be sold in the Bazaar at enormous prices and with the better drop rate of stonewood saps, I would recommend looking into an earth robe instead of fire. Silk from any elemental zone is throw away...hang out in PoTranq for a while, auctioning to buy it for 25pp each and you'll get some (sells to vendors for 17pp each). Mephit blood (needed for the elemental diamond) also drops frequently enough in both zones. The saps are always the super rare bit.<br />
<br />
So, check out stonewood saps. At least on the Rathe, I've seen their price range from 9k to 30k each - but 9k is a great price.<br />
<br />
Obsidianwood never dips before 20-25k..and I wouldn't expect it to.<br />
<br />
With that said, however, depending on your class, you can solo for saps in Fire which you can not in Earth (or Water or Air* for that matter).<br />
<br />
*Tried grouping in Air once. Silly notion!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Iilane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Btw, regardless if you have shei shears or grandmaster tailor's needles or geerlok sewing contraptions tailoring maxes out at 252. At 252 skill, you still have a 50% chance of failing any elemental tailoring combine. <br />
<br />
I wish it was otherwise, but its yet another sad but true fact :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>munwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have to agree with the making PoEarth silk instead of PoFire. the Obsidianwood Saps are outrageously priced (60k+ each) while the Stonewood Saps are easier to get and MUCH cheeper (2k-5k each). So do your casters a favor, start making Earthweave pantaloons for them and give them 100hp they never expected.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ziggyholiday</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Originally posted by Iilane <br />
Btw, regardless if you have shei shears or grandmaster tailor's needles or geerlok sewing contraptions tailoring maxes out at 252. At 252 skill, you still have a 50% chance of failing any elemental tailoring combine. <br />
(  <br />
<br />
I'm confused about that statement, is that 252 unmodified or max of 252 even with mod?  If the later is the case how is eqtraders quoting trivials above 300?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The raw skill cap is 250. The modified skill cap is 252 (regardless if you have raw skill of 250 and the shei shears vs. a geerlok).<br />
<br />
So, you could have the raw skill of 242 and a geerlok or trophy and hit the 252 modified cap or the raw skill of 220 and have the modified cap of 252.<br />
<br />
The new tradeskill UI now actually shows the trivial levels for all recipes. We knew before that the &quot;super difficult&quot; recipes had very high trivial levels (thus, a 250/252 skilled person would have a 50/50 success rate). The new UI confirms it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ziggyholiday</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ahhh, so when someone makes a few successfull combines on an item like firestand, the new tradeskill UI says blah blah blah trival of 349.<br />
<br />
And that whole 252 max mod skill is really bumming me out :irked:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Be glad we have +% devices at all! There was a time when none existed...(and tradeskillers had to trudge up the hill both ways in the snow...)<br />

(&quot;omg punch cards!&quot;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vilantra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">All the sap drops off of single group / soloable mobs.  On Vazaelle, 3 guilds got fire access within a month or so of each other.  The price of obsidianwood sap then dropped to about 5k because people would farm field one hoping for named to pop, and a bunch of people started soloing in field one for xp.  If you really want the high mana items from fire, it might be a good idea to wait till a new guild gets fire access and the zone becomes more popular to xp'ers.</div></div><hr />
