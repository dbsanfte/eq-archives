<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was in the bazaar the other day and decided that I was going to see if anyone currently had a pair of boots of flowing slime up for sale, and any other items with FT on them.  I finally have a serious lump of pp in the bank and can afford to buy them, and still have a good chunk of change left over.  Anyway, instead of typing in boots of flowing slime in the search, I used the drop down search, the one at the bottom, and lo-and-behold, it was no longer in there.  Has anyone else noticed this, or have any inkling as to why it was removed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The Haste category is missing now too.  <br />
<br />
Wanted to get my tracking bot a nice reward for his help with Black Dire but  I'm not up on ranger gear so I had trouble finding anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Those items aren't listed under effects anymore, they're listed under stats. <br />
<br />
And Flowing Thought is now listed as Mana Regeneration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From the March 10 patch:We have replaced the spell-like effects on items which produced the following effects: Attack, HP Regen, Mana Regen, Haste and Damage Shield with actual statistics.  The effects on the item have not changed they are just set up in a new way that we hope will allow for more item functionality in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Woooot.  You 2 rock.  Thanks for the info.  Evidently I missed it.  Of course, I do miss almost all patch messages, for some reason they no longer pop up on the big screen for me, and with autoplay enabled, 5 seconds is too short to read patch notes <br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">eqnews.txt in your EQ directory always contains the latest patch message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tricsun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I really wished they would stop the dumbing down of the game.  I personally liked the focus effects.  I mean, Aura of Battle sounds so much better than &quot;Attack: +10  Regen: +2&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm mixed.  It nukes the RP and &quot;fun&quot; value, but ups the &quot;accessability&quot; factor and decreases the amount of out-of-game &quot;research&quot; required to mechanically understand your environment.  Given the trends of EQ, RP-value seems to be a very low priority, and accessability and in-game info seem to be high priorities.<br />
<br />
I'm mixed about how I feel personally.  I miss the old names - &quot;Flowing Thought&quot; and &quot;Aura of Battle&quot; and such did give a nice flavor to everything.  But it is nice not having to check Lucy every time to be reminded &quot;how many hp/tick is Regeneration? (5)&quot;, etc.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
And thank you Lothay :)  Had noticed that the Haste &amp; FT had been removed from the &quot;Effects&quot; listing, but didn't think to check the stats listing, heh.  That will take some getting used to, regens &amp; atk as a &quot;stat&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The real redason is not &quot;dumbing down&quot;<br />
<br />
The real reason is not to make it easier on the players...<br />
<br />
The real reason was to make it easier on the developers.<br />
<br />
If they wanted an effect that was +2 mana regen, +4 HP regen and 10% haste... they would have to create a new spell.<br />
<br />
Then when they wanted to add +3 mana regen, +4 HP regen, and 12% haste...  They would have to create a new spell.<br />
<br />
you get the idea.<br />
<br />
Creating an item is easier for them than creating a spell.  (though balancing an item is another matter entirely but not part of why they did this...)<br />
<br />
This allows them to play more with what effects are on an item, without having to create a new spell for the focus effect.  It still does not cure them from that, but it allows them more flexability without creating a new spell.<br />
<br />
they could even make a new mana robe &quot;Acursed Mana robe&quot; it does not have the effect of +30 mana -60 hp instant with a recast...  instead... it is  +10 Mana regen -20 HP regen which comes out about the same without the clicking :)  (or make the HP part worse say -30 HP regen to make up for the fact you don't ahve to click)<br />
<br />
basically it gives them more freedom.</div></div><hr />
