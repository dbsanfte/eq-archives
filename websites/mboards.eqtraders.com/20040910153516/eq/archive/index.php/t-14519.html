I recently started working on my Baking skill and to help things out, I had been saving the spiderling legs that I collected. Buying some frosting, I tried to join the two to create Wooly Spider Crunchies, but it told me I was not able to combine the items together.<br />
<br />
However, when I bought the bat wings, it had no problem letting me try to combine them.<br />
<br />
Anyone know if the recipe is no longer valid?<br />
<br />
Thanks..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Serenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think it's the one that is spider legs rather then spiderling.....  I know I invariably had the wrong one whenever I tried to combine anyway, and would have to go get the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Traydex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ah...guess I should have realized that spider and spiderling were not interchangable.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the heads up, so I will sell the spiderling legs for extra cash to get the bat wings.</div></div><hr />
