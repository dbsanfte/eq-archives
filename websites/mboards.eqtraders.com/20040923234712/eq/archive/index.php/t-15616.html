<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Archangel Beth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did check the FAQs, and I don't thiiiink it was in there (but I've lost an hour of sleep to Daylight Slavings Time, so I could be brainfried)...<br />
<br />
I found something which Bazaar tests suggest is combinable -- possibly tradeskill, possibly &quot;put in a special quest container&quot;?  Would it be appropriate to ask if anyone else knows anything about it, and if so, on this forum?<br />
<br />
(The item was a Shiny Black Pebble, dropped by a Grimling Runt in Shar Vahl.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Anything that can be combined in a container has a tradeskill tag attached to it. <br />
<br />
My first place to check would be EQtraders.com using the Search function, this I have done for you and it returned Nothing.<br />
<br />
Next I went to Allakhazam's They have the item listed but no applicable data.<br />
<br />
Lastly I would do a search on the Boards here... That also turned up only your post.<br />
<br />
So the question is does this item have a tradeskill tag on it? If not it may be one of the many Vendor fodder items that you can get in the Newbie zones.</div></div><hr />

So the question is does this item have a tradeskill tag on it?  <br />
<br />
Here's where I do the Stoopid Noob thing: how do I tell if it has a tradeskill tag? :confused: I'm on the Mac server, Al'Kabor, which has only gone up as far as PoP, I think. I don't &lt;I&gt;think&lt;/I&gt; there's any easy User Interface thing to click to find that out.<br />
<br />
The technique I tried was to go into the Baazar, offer it for sale, and then search for ... something that I was told would show me combinable items. And it was one of them.<br />
<br />
It does &lt;I&gt;not&lt;/I&gt; combine with a simple silver bar in a jeweler's kit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When someone refers to the TradeSkill Tag, that means when you look at the item's attributes (Right click for PC users, no clue for Mac), there will be a line that states &quot;This item is used in tradeskills&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When you are looking at an item, you can rightclick+hold and youll get a box with the info on it.<br />
<br />
If you see 'This item can be used in tradeskills'... well its kinda obvious.<br />
<br />
If you dot, it *may* be used in quests where a combiner is involved.<br />
<br />
The best place to go for 'whats this used for' questions is <br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/<br />
<br />
On the left, scroll down to 'Equipment' and 'Item Lookup'</div></div><hr />

I have a feeling that that doesn't appear in the default Mac item info format. I've _never_ seen that line on things like clay, fruit, zombie skins, etc.<br />
<br />
I wanted to triple-check this, but the server is down (sisatex_connect failed or something like that), so I have to rely on memory. Grarh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes it is, and it seems that no, we don't.</div></div><hr />

I have a feeling that that doesn't appear in the default Mac item info format. I've _never_ seen that line on things like clay, fruit, zombie skins, etc. The Tradeskill tag is a &quot;relatively&quot; recent addition to the Windows-client servers.  I forget roughly when it was added, but it could be a feature that was added after the mac-client code split :/</div></div><hr />

Well, that may not be possible, since many Macintosh mice don't have two buttons.  Any Al`Kaboreans that can let us know how you pull up the info screen, and if the tradeskill tag is implemented there?<br />
<br />
Silverfish</div></div><hr />

 [/B] <br />
<br />
Ha, this time I can log in to triple-check.<br />
<br />
Right-click and hold, or control-click and hold (depending on if you have a two-button mouse or not), or option-click.<br />
<br />
Bat Wings have no tradeskill tag.<br />
Woven Spider Silk has no tradeskill tag.<br />
Water Flasks say, &quot;This is a drink,&quot; but no tradeskill tag.<br />
Spiderling silk has no tradeskill tag.<br />
<br />
I think the tradeskill tag is not implemented on the Mac. *sigh*<br />
<br />
:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Archangel Beth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Go to the Bazaar, get your trader's satchel, and put your Thing into it. Set a price, set yourself trading.<br />
<br />
Type  /bazaar, and &quot;Select by Type&quot; for &quot;Combinable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Type in the name of your Thing.<br />
<br />
If it pops up, it should be a combinable Thing.<br />
<br />
I just did this, minus the Put Your Thing In Your Trader's Satchel part, for &quot;hide&quot; and have various Rockhopper hides showing. (High Quality ones going for 25p and 40p, and Flawless ones going for 50p, 150p, and 175p. If anyone cares.)<br />
<br />
Searching on &quot;combinable&quot; silk gets me shade silk cords, threads, and swatches. Also Silk Swatch and Woven Spider Silk.<br />
<br />
Combinable pebble = Plains Pebble<br />
<br />
Combinable &quot;de&quot; gets me things like Deadbone Barley, Jade, etc.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that's what I did with my Shiny Black Pebble, and it came back as Combinable.<br />
<br />
When I get my pottery skill up more, I'm planning to try to use it instead of an Imbued Gem in an idol, and then in a stein. My jeweler friend will try lacquering it.<br />
<br />
If anyone on a PC wants to smite grimling runts in the Shar Vahl pit and try to get one, maybe it will have a tradeskill tag there. :worried:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I thought bazaar-search &quot;Combinable&quot; just ment what is commonly called &quot;stackable&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Combinable in the Bazaar means can be combined in some type of container. Since this is combinable and we have never seen it here I would venture that there is a quest out there that uses this. <br />
<br />
To test this theory and prove that combinable does not equal stackable make a humming orb (Used in smithing and does not stack) and put it up for sale on a trade and search for combinables named humming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Etched Acrylia runes (grimling form of plat) have NO use whatsoever in game (not combineable, no quest, nothing except for selling to vendors) also come up as 'Combinable' when in traders satchels.<br />
<br />
'A Lucid shard' is dropable on Firiona Vie and comes up as 1 hand slashing.<br />
<br />
So does 'A lock of Tangled Banshee hair' So do 'Luggald Parts'<br />
<br />
Theres a block of data in the information for every single item in the game which indicates what category that part falls under, and the /bazaar featire searches for that block of data. <br />
<br />
If they have info in there wrong, the /bazaar feature doesnt care whether its correct or not, it still shows it as whatever category that bit of data says it is.<br />
<br />
'A Shrunken Skull' has a tradeskill tag, but shows up under '1 Hand Slash' and NOT under 'Combinable'<br />
<br />
Ignore what you see. It could be wrong.<br />
<br />
If it falls under the 'Combinable' category, it only means that a developer/programmer marked it with that bit of data, and does NOT mean absolutely it can be used in any tradeskill or quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mendatenrognabs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I would suggest lucy.allakhazam.com to see if an item has a tradeskill flag.  However, just because an item has a tradeskill flag does not mean it is used in tradeskills, there are inevitably database errors when you consider the number of item entries EQ has.

<br />
True -- but since the Shiny Black Pebble that they've got reported to them almost certainly came from the Al'Kabor server, that means we're back to square one about whether the flags on it mean anything or not. Oh, well.  Maybe someone on a different server will find one and remember the thread.<br />
<br />
Thanks, all! :angel:</div></div><hr />
