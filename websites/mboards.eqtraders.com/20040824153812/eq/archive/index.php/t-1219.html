<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Buchalter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am interested in commissioning a few pieces from the Stormreapers Chain set - Sleeves, Legs, Coif, Skirt and Cape.<br />
<br />
I will do as much of the material gathering/farming/purchasing as I can for you so you only need to do the combines.  If you are capable of doing these Cultural Items please send me a tell in game and we can arrange a price.  I'm usually online weeknights after 8pm EST.  Weekend playing hours vary.<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Farnyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Im slowly working my way up the Tailoring chain, but as of now, im only 169 and would most likely fail badly if i tried an attempt. On the other hand, Cuin is a 250 Halfling tailor, but I havent seen if hes active lately, you may want to contact him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gelaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cuin is around. Some friends and I helped him get an epic piece from Kedge a week or so ago and we had him make some Halfling cultural for my wife's Druid alt last night. He's also a nice guy.</div></div><hr />
