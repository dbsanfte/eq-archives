Looks like a Samuri Iksar. But who knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KyrosKrane</div><div class="date">04-14-2003, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's almost certainly a preview of an Everquest RTS (real-time strategy game -- think Warcraft or Command and Conquer).<br />
<br />
Here's the overview pic that the Iksar image is taken from (link taken from the Paladins of Norrath message board):<br />

<br />
<br />
*Dubbing over begins, mouths dont move, but sound come out*<br />
<br />
&quot;Todays special ingredient is once again, gnome...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Scalytail is a 212 Iksar baker. He will going to be preparing fried gnome in a bloodwind sauce with a side of thorny succulent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs. Furryfeet is a 250 Halfling baker. Today she will be making gnome cookies with winter white chocolate chips, and will be using her GM baking spoon to mix up the batter. No tinkered mixing bowls for her, she sticks strictly with old fashioned techniques.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. errr...Mrs....Err....Grung is a 0 Ogre baker, and it looks like instead of preparing a dish using gnome, Grung is actually just eatting the gnome instead....yes, there it goes, and, the gnome is gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
So who knows? EQ Iron Chef sounds about right.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Fukui-San, I believe we have a possible disqualification. Iron Chef Iksar Venomfang Mottledscales is trying to shove the challenger into the ice cream maker!&quot;<br />

Theres a Dark Elf on a Drogmor, an Orge, Troll, Dwarf and  :?: , which i think might be a Erudite. Anywa, its pretty obvious that the pictures are for the new RTS.</div></div><hr />

Might be why not many responded, they already had their laugh a month ago....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morani</div><div class="date">04-15-2003, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks KyrosKrane.  Hmm... I LOVE RTS games so I'll definitely be looking forward to this one.  &amp;lt;taps foot impatiently while waiting&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quinner Sparrowhawk</div><div class="date">04-15-2003, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">RTS - There is no such beast. Strategy indicates longterm global planning. Not a single one of these so called &quot;Real Time Strategy&quot; games incorporates this. There is no time for strategizing during the game, only before playing. Sure, you can hit the pause button but then it's not real time anymore, is it?<br />
<br />
What each game boils down to is a tactical exercise to be solved. Once a solution is discovered, it always works if implemented correctly. These games would be more accurately labelled RTT or Real Time Tactics.<br />
<br />
I am a oldtime Grognard of Avalon Hill games and other REAL strategy games. The really cool things about these games were that REAL people sat across the table from you! And they even would bring soda and chips!<br />
I have hated the RTS category ever since the first one came out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morani</div><div class="date">04-15-2003, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Um, Quinner; it's called head-head or multi-player mode. And, by your own explanation, until you figure out just what &quot;tactics&quot; DO work all the time then it IS strategy. As for there not being enough time, speak for yourself please.<br />
<br />
Regardless, it's a moot point since RTS is a label to let people know what one is talking about. If I referred to a particular type of music as the modern take-off of the more African rhythms of East Coast Jazz VERY few people would have a clue that I was talking about Hip-Hop. The label would be accurate but not very helpful to the reader.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delfontes</div><div class="date">04-15-2003, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chess is an RTS.<br />
<br />
That's all I have to say about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quinner Sparrowhawk</div><div class="date">04-16-2003, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I will admit to the source of my discontent. I really like turn-based strategy games. I have always been a big fan of the Civ games and some of the old fashion board game conversions. The RTS rush almost killed the genre. Not all games translate into well RTS, just look at Star Wars Rebellion and you will know what I mean.<br />
<br />
I find that most RTS games boil down to the same set of tactics and end up being the same game, different box. I have played C&amp;C, Age of Empires, and Star Wars Battlegrounds and don't see much difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moonlilly</div><div class="date">04-16-2003, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">strat·e·gy <br />
Function: noun<br />
Inflected Form(s): plural -gies<br />
Etymology: Greek stratEgia generalship, from stratEgos<br />
Date: 1810<br />
1 a (1) : the science and art of employing the political, economic, psychological, and military forces of a nation or group of nations to afford the maximum support to adopted policies in peace or war (2) : the science and art of military command exercised to meet the enemy in combat under advantageous conditions b : a variety of or instance of the use of strategy<br />
2 a : a careful plan or method : a clever stratagem b : the art of devising or employing plans or stratagems toward a goal<br />
3 : an adaptation or complex of adaptations (as of behavior, metabolism, or structure) that serves or appears to serve an important function in achieving evolutionary success &amp;lt;foraging strategies of insects&gt; <br />
<br />
tac·tics<br />
Function: noun plural but singular or plural in construction<br />
Etymology: New Latin tactica, plural, from Greek taktika, from neuter plural of taktikos of order, of tactics, fit for arranging, from tassein to arrange, place in battle formation<br />
Date: 1626<br />
1 a : the science and art of disposing and maneuvering forces in combat b : the art or skill of employing available means to accomplish an end<br />
2 : a system or mode of procedure<br />
3 : the study of the grammatical relations within a language including morphology and syntax <br />
<br />
Strategy and Tactics are similar in nature but are two different animals completely.  Strategy deals with &quot;The Big Picture&quot;.  In other words you make a plan based on your best information.  Once you engage the enemy you have entered the realm of combat tactics.  While you attempt to follow the strategic plan, tactics can (and more often than not WILL) require you to make split second changes to the plan to accomplish your goals.<br />
<br />
The best game example of how Strategy and Tactics work together, that I have seen, is the Rainbow Six games.  Before entering a mission you pick your teams, decide how they are split, plan their route based on the info yo know.  Once you enter the mission you can then take control of your soldiers and ignore your plan completely if need be.<br />
<br />
I have yet to see a strategy game that is worth a damn that wasn't turn based.  And from what they have show of this new EQ version it won't be any different.<br />
<br />
P.S. Chess is actually turn-based Delf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morani</div><div class="date">04-16-2003, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quinner, I can agree with you on the last post.  :)  I like both but you're right; there is a distinct lack of &quot;advancement&quot; on the turn based games. My only REAL problem with the turn based is that is hard to tell when that turn is over; &quot;I'm going to bed at the end of the turn.&quot;  2 hours later...<br />
<br />
As for the RTS style I've found that the different platform style tend to have different strategies/tactics that work best and sometime they are different against different opponents with different &quot;races&quot;. Starcraft is a good example. What works for the Terrans doesn't for the Protos and the Zerg and Visa Versa. It's not a &quot;fix&quot; but at least you get more for your money. <br />
<br />
Still, there is a lot of repetition (as you stated). That's why I like playing with/against other people on those types of games. The computer is limited by it's programming; people are not.</div></div><hr />
