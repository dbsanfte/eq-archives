<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Diania</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably by now, some of you have noticed that Brewmistress has been absent for quite some time now.  This is why.  Around the beginning of April, my computer had a problem, the motherboard blew, and took the video card with it, and it'll be another 2-4 weeks till I'm able to get back online.  So, whoever is warming my spot in the bazaar, I'll be wanting it back when I get everything fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koori</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm just curious where all the Misty Thicket picnics went ... more then once this week I was the only one selling ... so I priced them at 15pp each and sold over 200, I've seen them as low as 5pp each earlier when working on earrings.  No worry about me screwing up the prices, I sold out today and baking is not my skill ... friends were giving them to me for doing all the earlier combines needed on picnics. - Need More Picnics!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Diania</div><div class="date">06-01-2003, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, thanks to a friend of mine, I'll be back sooner than I originally thought, although it'll still be about 2 more weeks till I can afford to play again.  It's just good to be online again after 2 months without the computer working.</div></div><hr />
