<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jazzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hey all- first post here. I have recently started playing again with a friend and im looking for ways to help make us some money...i have heard people talking about selling certain fish to tradeskillers for decent profits and i was wondering if anyone could list a few commonly needed and where i should go as well as a ballpark for prices. I have a 58 cleric with about 60 fishing skill now but i would be willing to work that up to fish wherever.<br />
Many thanks all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you can fish safely in Cobalt Scar, I've made about 100 plat each from Cobalt Cod selling it to players in the Bazaar. It sounds like GoD has introduced some new possibilities, but I know that one works. They sell faster than I can catch 'em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Melinia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you have GoD you can go to Abysmal to fish. You can a) sell the fish to vendors as-is for 1-5pp each or b) you can make them more stackable by putting your 1 catch into a mixing bowl and hitting &quot;Combine&quot;. after you have stacks and stacks of these you can sell to vendors for the equivalent of the original catch.<br />
Hope that makes sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ravinred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you are patient, Storm Salmon, fished in PoStorms, sell for 50pp each on Vazaelle.  The aren't terribly common to catch though.  Eight stacks of bait will get me 30 Storm Salmon, 3-4 stacks of Fresh Fish, a couple stacks of fish scales, and the usually daggers and sandals.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I can make 500-700pp vendoring what I catch with eight stacks of bait in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ravinred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Cancel that, as of 3/10 they completely nerfed the wonderful resale prices on Saltwater Crab and Saltwater Tuna.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drubear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">However, based on the original poster's question, it's likely (? possible?) that these fish can be caught and sold to people wanting to raise baking. Check the baz and AS/Natimbi for pricing comparisons and see if there's a price point that will make it worth your while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Raolinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd probally pay 1 plat a lb on a good day. (maybe) for the tuna. Just because they are items in a 240ish baking recipie. Then again I'd probally save my money and fish them myself. (if safe to. Just returned from OIF and have missed the last three expansions. ) soon as I get my fishing at a decent level I will Buy GoD and go fishing for tuna my self.<br />
<br />
Then again If they do sell I may get extra myself</div></div><hr />
