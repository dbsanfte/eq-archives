<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>hyelaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know what Globs of Slush water can be used for?  I'm 90% sure they have a tradeskill tag, (will reconfirm tonight when I log in) but I see no recipes on the main site.  Has it not yet been discovered, or was it lost in the database crash?  Can anyone shed light on the subject? :confused: <br />
<br />
I just saw this under the smilies :dedhorse: <br />
<br />
too funny!</div></div><hr />

Brackish Water the drinkable forage from Cobalt Scar can be used in some Othmir related brewing recipes.</div></div><hr />

Doh, you are right.  /bonk For some reason I thought it did have the tag.  Good to know about the brackish water though.  For some reason, I've never seen those recipes before.  Now I have something to make with all those mussels I forage too!</div></div><hr />
