<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Enchanted Gold Bar and Golem Eye Stone in Planar JC kit, Reinforced JC kit, and normal JC kit all were DNC (238 skill, and I did the refinement quest thing, so I doubt those are a problem).<br />
<br />
Also, the Golem Eye Stone is wt: 0.0, class/race: NONE, and size: TINY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brannayvenaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/nod <br />
<br />
I got the same DNC problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I updated the Golem eye... but I ahve no new information on the combine... my sugestion is try other metals...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brannayvenaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Enchanted Gold Bar and Golem Eye Stone = dnc<br />
Enchanted Electrum Bar and Golem Eye Stone = dnc<br />
Enchanted Platinum Bar and Golem Eye Stone = dnc<br />
Enchanted Bar of Valorium and Golem Eye Stone = dnc<br />
<br />
These were all tried in reinforced Jewelcrafters Kit AND Planar Jewelry Kit<br />
<br />
I didn't test silver cuz, well I didn't see much point</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gnormy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm not gonna say the information above is wrong but this is what i have in my possession:<br />
<br />
Golem Eye Stone<br />
This item can be used in tradeskills.<br />
Wt 1.0 Size: Small<br />
Class: None<br />
Race: None<br />
Item Lore: Solid ovoid of stone.<br />
stackable<br />
<br />
speculation - the discrepency in  stats previously posted and the fact that it has &quot;item lore&quot; leads me to suspect there may be multiple types of this item with the same name (similar to &quot;a chant stone&quot;).  This may also account for the DNC issues encountered.<br />
<br />
attempted combine Golem Eye Stone + Enchanted Gold in many containers - all DNC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Lucy only lists a single item with the text &quot;golem eye&quot;.  In fact, there is only one item listed with both the words &quot;golem&quot; and &quot;eye&quot; in the name.<br />
<br />
Edit: The item info matches what Gnormy posted.  Here is the Lucy link:<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=58261<br />
<br />
Edit 2: Just for kicks and giggles, try it in a different container?  Forge, for example?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gnormy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tried the combine in all standard containers - DNC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For the record, Magelo also only has one item with &quot;golem eye&quot; in the name.  It also matches the stats Gnormy gave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bobwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If this combine is similar to the Polished Stone Luck Piece then you may need to use unenchanted metal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>gnormy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No this seems to part of a series.  Examining existing database entries I found the following:<br />
Iridescent Scale Headdress = Iridescent Scale (Kod'taz) + Enchanted Platnium Bar (DNC)<br />
Golem Eye Headband = Golem Eye(??) + Enchanted Gold Bar (DNC)<br />
???????????????????? = ????????? + Enchanted Electrum Bar<br />
Shrunken Skull Necklace = A Shrunken Skull (Riwwi)+ Enchanted Silver Bar<br />
<br />
my next best guess is that these might be &quot;flag restricted&quot; combines - similiar to AG quest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty sure the combines in AG aren't flag restricted, it's just that you can't get the component from him until you have the flag...in this case the component(s) are dropped and bought, so unless the recipe is wrong I don't think it has anything to do with flags. Good thought though  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>principessa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I even tried handing in the Golem Stone to the jewelry NPCs just in case it needed to be refined or something, but they just handed it back to me, saying they didn't need it.<br />
 <br />
Think I will try to combine it with the GoD ores next.</div></div><hr />
