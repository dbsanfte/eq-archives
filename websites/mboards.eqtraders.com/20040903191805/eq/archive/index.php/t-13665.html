<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Adjantis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just wondering if anyone could suggest a decent spot to farm windstones.  I have tried Tenebrous and twilight but both seem to be lacking.<br />
<br />
Adjantis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Silound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bazaar? Seriously, they just don't drop anywhere frequently enough to be called a farm spot. On various raids in Akheva, Umbral, and Griegs, I've seen an average of about 4-5 per raid drop. Not a whole lot when you're looking at 2 per temper iirc. Best bet is to farm cash and buy them at reasonable prices, because odds are you aren't going to farm tehm faster than you will the cash to buy them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aberum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, I have had really good luck farming them in Grimling Forest at the cave entrance. One great up side is that the runes that drop can earn you a nice chunk of change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mivio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have heard of a druid being able to farm 20+ in Grim forest, in about 4 hours.<br />
<br />
I have never tested this thou.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xanafeldier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I heard of an enchanter farming 400 windstones in around a week.<br />
<br />
Of course I was talking to myself at the time. Killing that many grimlings will do... things... to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>zurrvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">GRimling forest :    if you obliterate 30% of the cave area or outside.  the cave area etc..  you can get up to 50 windstones in  3 hours.. <br />
<br />
ive done it  9 times. and i averaged  45 stones every 3 hours.<br />
<br />
But i did take out about 50% of the entire cave  regularly that entire time.<br />
<br />
Estimate 2 people could probably  clear the entire cave and  get even more.</div></div><hr />
