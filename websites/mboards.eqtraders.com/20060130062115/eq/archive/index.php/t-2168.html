<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleem</div><div class="date">01-11-2003, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've bought most of the items needed for the PotC earring quests but was waiting to make the sickles myself.  However, after farming solo for days collecting the items necissary for a run of 100 shadowscream combines and only getting two skill ups, I'm a bit discouraged.  My smithing is at 194 which is still too low to really go for sickles myself.  I was wondering if I could do all the sub combines and some kind fellow smith could do the final combine for me.  I'm trying to get them for 2 close friends also, so I'm looking to get 5 made (my wife is a druid so she could use the two earrings and has been wanting a 1hs with wis on it also)<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you can help me out with this and how many of the sub-components I would need to bring.  Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would bring enough for 20 combines of each, even with 243 modded i make 1/3 or so.</div></div><hr />
