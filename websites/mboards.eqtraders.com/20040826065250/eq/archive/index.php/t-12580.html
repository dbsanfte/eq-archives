<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Look, there is one and one recipe only that stands high above all the rest as the cheapest route to trivial 187<br />
<br />
Shar Vahl Essence.<br />
<br />
The consituants are 1 Payala Fruit and 1 Water Flask. Total cost per attempt just 5c.<br />
<br />
Payala Fruit is probably the most plentiful and predicatable ground spawn I've come across. In a 3 to 4 hours period I have managed to harvest 100 Payala Fruit.<br />
<br />
To find them you go to the easy side of Shadeweavers thicket and look for the smaller pale barked trees with bright blue leaves. At the base of each of them spawn a fruit looking just like a small bright blue toadstool on the ground and a bunch of purple grapes in you inventory. Just keep going round and round the 30 or so trees in this area dn you will soon gather up enough supplies for a mondo brewing session.<br />
<br />
While there it's a good idea to waste any Hoppers and Silkworms you see as they provide good supplies for basic tailoring. The PoK book, a banker and two merchants all in the same area make this a very good tradeskill hunting area for starting out on brewing and tailoring.<br />
<br />
OK, so you've spent a while in Shadeweavers Thicket gathering fuit and no your standing in front of the brew barrel in PoK. What now?<br />
<br />
Well, given Shar Vahl Essence trivials at 187 there is only a slim to near non-existent chance you will be successful. But, WHO CARES. The exercise isn't to make Shar Vahl Essence, it's to skillup brewing and so long as you get the skillups at the lowest cost it doesn't matter that you won't be succesfull for a while.<br />
<br />
So long as you max out your dominant stat before training you will skill-up and rapidly. Over a 100 fruit batch with a INT of 137 my chanter averaged adding 15 to 20 skill points to brewing. That means at 5c per water you should get to the trivial at 187 for around 5 to 6 pp even if you never succeed once in making the essence. Tell that to a smith and watch them go green with envy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Faster way would be fetid essense to 100 or so as the grubs and water are merchant purchased in PoK so you can do far more combines in a shorter period of time.  Costs a few copper more per combine.<br />
<br />
tell a smith you can get to 100 brewing on 25 plat with a cha of about 50 and wis about 70 and watch him turn from green to purple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">122 with fetid esscense in pok.  its enough quicker you wont stop and switch to something else before hitting 187.  running around for the first 122 skill points would get old quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've run many a loop through Shadeweaver's Thicket picking up the blue fruit that drops under the blue leafed trees.  I thought this was going to be an ez way to get some skill-ups.   Think again.  If you do a full loop of the zone you can pick up a stack of these in about 5 minutes or less (with SoW on).  The spawn rate on these is about 8-10 minutes and I was always done with the loop before they spawned again.<br />
<br />
After an hour - you may have enough for about 6 stacks.  And as luck would have it and depending on your WIS/INT stat, you will get probably about 6 skill-ups for an hours worth of running around.   <br />
<br />
Not worth it in my opinion if you feel that time = plat.  Better to buy store bought items and crank em out.   If you are worried about the cost of this just remember that brewing is one of the cheapest tradeskills to get to 250 on. (Just wait - the trophy combines will make up for that).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No fooling... brewing can be GM'd for under 1kpp, but each trophy requires a corking device worth about 1kpp each plus the rest of the trophy pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey, I never said it was easy or fast, only that it was the cheapest. =)<br />
<br />
Lets face it - if it was easy, fast AND cheap and SOE got to hear about it then the thunderous sound of the Nerf Fairy would be heard over the thicket in double quick time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ignoring the time is money factor, the stacks of Essence of Shar Val sell back to the merchants for over 4p per stack.  Your storebought supplies are only the cost of water, so your skillups actually pay - a little.  But I was never able to collect more than 3 stacks of fruit before terminal boredom set in - you earn that money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bordaaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">With less that 3pp per stack of combines I see no reason looking any further........let me say I am coming from the smithing side which I could only dream of costs like these there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hi bord.  its the 9 item combine that hurts.  the pp is wonderful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My wizard spent less than 550 Plat to GM smithing to 250. <br />
<br />
That's not counting the corking device of course, or the 2 tries to get a brewing trophy.<br />
<br />
That  550 plat included 4 kei's totally 170pp, so honestly, there's no reason someone with a 255 INT/WIS or higher without a kei should spend more than 400 pp getting to 250. Again, not counting the corking device. If you know a nice tinker, you can get the corker for about 300pp, if they do the combine for free (like my friend did. :))<br />
<br />
EDIT: Forgot to mention! My wizzy did Fetid essence to 122 as well, 1 fishing grub, 1 water. Less than 1sp per combine. Picking up ground spawns in Shadeweavers may be cheaper, but not by much, and Fetid Essence is SOOO much faster to 122!<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please to explain evey detail of how that is even possible</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>lonewylfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think he meant brewing, not smithing...<br />
<br />
As to the payalas, they look like mushrooms with blue tops, and spawn under the blue leafed trees...<br />
there's one cluster near that random high elf in the rocks, one kinda in the middle of the zone, one near the eastern side bandits, one near the southern most cave entrance, and one right near the merchants/banker. All of these are on the easter side of the mountain ridge. There's actually one cluster of trees I've found that has no payalas.<br />
They can also be foraged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i think he meant smithing too but if you did the farming for hq ore yourself and the chain then did shadow scream instead of fine plate since it uses banded molds you might could do alright.  farming the ore yourself you actually turn a profit on the chain stage.  shadowscream uses banded molds.  would only be possible for a wizard or another ae class though.  even then i dont think i would want to try it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zeralenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It IS possible to do smithing that cheaply, if you are willing to do MONTHS of farming yourself. <br />
<br />
I've always argued, however, that that has its own opportunity costs -- the opportunities you could have making plat by farming it rather than farming smithing materials. But it's all how you like to spend your time.<br />
<br />
...Zera</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">OMG :eek: I'm sorry, I had smithing on the brain that day. LOL<br />
<br />
This IS the brewing forum, and yes, I meant brewing. :eek: <br />
<br />
Please note, my EDIT: in the first post did mention making fetid essence to 122... ;) <br />
<br />
Sorry bout that. LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">actually when i get to 49 and get supternova i am going to try and talk some friend into aeing permafrost.  the gobling drop ore and you can get it pretty quick aeing.  at 60 winds of gellid (i a wizard not sure on other classes) will let you farm sola.  just pull a massive train and spend a few minutes looting up.  its what i do to get silks in shar vhal.  cause lag from the corpses.  :)  i was so proud.  i doubt it would take very long doing that.<br />
<br />
oh and no i didn't want to skip the fine plate stage.  :eek:</div></div><hr />
