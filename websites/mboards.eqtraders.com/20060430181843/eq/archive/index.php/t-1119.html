<br />
I have 2 toons I'm considering starting smithing with.  The idea is to pick one with the best cultural smithing so I can have some fun with that. <br />
<br />
So.... I have a dwarf cleric, and a high elf enchanter.<br />
<br />
Which would you chose? and why?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crickette</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 09:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Either would have a good market for sales, if plat is what you are after. I think, at least on my server, that high elf does have a larger market than dwarf, but both would still be good.<br />
<br />
I think I would go with the one I could get the smithing stats (wis, int, or str) the highest on, to help get skill raises faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArrakeenNaedShoj</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 06:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would go with the high elf enchanter, Provided he/she is one you play for experience as well. The reason being, that it is EXTREMELY difficult to find an enchanter to enchant metals for you and if you are going to be playing your own you will have a much easier time using the old cultural as a skillup option.<br />
<br />
Of course nowt that I think about it, the dwarf can used old Imbued sans enchant to skill up on without any help as well(provided you level him/her to 29). And you could always use your enchanter to enchant stuff for you anyways....<br />
<br />
<br />
HMMMMM...<br />
<br />
That's it, go with the high elf, we are prettier.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArrakeenNaedShoj</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After re-thinking the situation, Kellrin's right. Unless you already have a high-level forager go with the ugly dwarfs. The cleric would be able to work his/her own way up to 242 without any outside help provided you can farm the temper components/cash for gems and work your brewing up to 150ish to make the tempers with max success rates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kuronekosama</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">High elf gets you all the tunare cleric sales, Dwarf gets you all the lil people warrior/pally/sk sales.  Check out what the going rates on armor is on your server and also try to find out how many GMs there are of each race.  If there is 1 Dwarf GM and 15 High Elf GMs then by all means do dwarven smithing and vice versa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zopharr</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go for the dwarf! <br />
<br />
Besides the fact that dwarves aren't arrogant the way most elves are (not to mention the fact that their build resembles mine more than I would care to admit), a dwarf in full red Underfoot Plate is *very* distinctive.<br />
<br />
Seriously, though - I'd first off go with the one you plan to play/level more. I enjoy wearing a set of the stuff I make on both my characters. Sure, I could improve stats a bit if I swapped out a couple items, but it's been neat on raids to have people say &quot;follow the red dwarf&quot; or &quot;MGB at the ogre in red.&quot; <br />
<br />
Getting components will be a hassle for both characters . As people level up past 60 in PoP, and the end of the cleric epic backlog that had people hunting in SF, there will be fewer lava rocks on the market for dwarf armor. Elves have the morning dew issue. Either way you'll have to deal with scarcity of components; either way you'll find a solution, whether guildies looking out for you, encouraging people to level in the appropriate area and buying from them, or hunting/foraging yourself.<br />
<br />
If all you want to do is get a level 1 character to 230+ smithing to make armor for cash, look at the competition on your server. If you plan on playing one of the characters, though, smith the one you want to play.<br />
<br />
If you plan on playing both, though, it's simple - go with the dorf.  ;) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenedien</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From a High Elf smith, go with the Dwarf! Unless of course, there are 10 GM Dwarf smiths and 0 GM High Elf smiths, but even then, I would probably go with the Dwarf. Because of:<br />
<br />
<br />
MORNING DEW<br />
<br />
My friend (with max foraging) was brewing some tempers up in Kelethin and everytime forage popped up he hit it. In about one hour he got 3 morning dew. Yay! That's enough for ... 1/3 of a Breastplate.<br />
<br />
Again, MORNING DEW<br />
<br />
Now with the Dwarf, you don't have to rely on the inferior races to help, you can do everything (except enchant of course) yourself. And you can even fix that problem by levelling (ok, how do you spell that?) the Enchanter and just smithing with the Dwarf.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion of course.<br />
<br />
Not sure if I mentioned it yet, but MORNING DEW<br />

Of course, I seem to have forgotten which, and have no proof.  :(<br />

UH where did you hear that? and what mobs? and was it LFAY GFAY or both? and does it drop uber rarely? <br />

It drops in both GFay and LFay now, off of brownies, faeries, and maybe some other stuff.  I think it is semi-rare though.<br />
