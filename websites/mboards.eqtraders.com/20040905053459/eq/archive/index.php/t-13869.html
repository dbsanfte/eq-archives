<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i plan on doing vials and saving a bit of money at lest until lined.  i wonder though if doing cassserole dishes might be faster.  with the new ui in place i think i could bang out the lining in short order.  before i wouldn't have dreamed of it hehe.  wanted feedback on how viable a path you more experienced potters might think it was and when to switch.  i'm not doing the advanced vials.  a look at the recipe made me go :eek:.<br />
trying to get to 199 for the shawl.  will be many levels and a lot of aa before i can take it higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would choose casseroles, because of two things.  First, you're right that the new UI will make pounding out ceramic linings manageable (don't forget that finished linings stack, but unfired ones don't, so have a lot of bag space to work with!), and second, you don't need to farm for casseroles.  Since you're hard-charging for a particular thing, it'll be faster if you can buy everything.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thanks.  a freind is giving me the zombie skins he hunts for xp in exchange for the iron oxide i get farming greyhoppers in marus seru.  (no greyhoppers don't drop them but stonegrabbers do.)<br />
<br />
just taking it slow for a bit.  once i get closer and it starts taking more combines per point though i will do that.  while i can go slow atm i'll be ok.  i thought about it and since i have above trivial for step 4 of shawl i should be good but have lots of time with the 5th i'm thinking hehe.  <br />
<br />
also i will probably take your advice the next time i get the skillup itch and finish fletching and then pound out these.  thank you so much for the fired linings stack.  :eek:   i would have missed that for a bit i know it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>scharazade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There is a lot of zombie at the beach in Gukta and innothule swamp. So normally I was checking if those vendor were having some. I was lucky one time to be able to buy 5 stack of zombie skin from a vendor in gukta.  If you have the skin it is faster to skill up. But if you have to hunt I will go the dish way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">found out i prefer trading, farming, and vednor diving to get zombie skins instead of making ceramic linings.<br />
<br />
thanks for the tip on places to check.  i think i should have ok frog faction.  never checked before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Definitely get the zombie skins and do vials until you have to switch to casserole dishes.  The ceramic linings are nice since that are now stackable, but, they unfortunately don't stack until they are fired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zudelvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Helloo there :&gt;<br />
<br />
Another overlooked skin you can use is Black Wolf Skin.  i used to check the merchants around EC and also Rivervale for BWS.  And if you do a little bit of searching with the new TS UI, I believe some type of gnoll pelt can also be used.  Just my 2 Copper pieces worth.  :&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nanndas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm doing casseroles. I run to WFP and buy a bag of quality firing sheets. In NFP I get clay, water and sketches. I stand between the kiln and pottery wheel in NFP. I turn left, open the wheel and my last bag and then combine till full. Turn right and fire them in the Kiln. Rince and repeat.<br />
<br />
Then off to WFP in the pottery shop with a stack of water (after all these years, still no water in WFP but plenty of booze). My Druid is bound in JPF and the shared bank has a bag of sketches. Combine in pottery wheel and turn around and sell to vendor. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>momo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Everything you need for casserole dishes is within a few feet of eachother in abysmal sea.<br />
<br />
I got about 30 skillups in 2 hours, 12 to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Abazagaroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Can use puma skins too, and can run around killing cats in EF or Nro that drop them while LFG for ldon adventures =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Barli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you have the GoD expansion you don't need to farm for skins at all.  I was told to buy stacks of Crow's Special Brew in the vendor area on the Abysmal boat and use that in place of a skin.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, I tried this and made the unfired vials using the CSB.  For some reason, with the new UI it tells you that you  learned the recipe for the vial but it thinks you are using the Mist Wolf Pelt version of the recipe.  <br />
<br />
So in this case, may be bugged not sure, but a Crow's Special Brew = Mist Wolf Pelt and can be used for making poison vials.  The CSB costs only 1 silver plus change so it is well worth buying that in stacks rather than farming skins any day!   Don't pay 2-10pp per skin any more!<br />
<br />
I got my Pottery skill up to around 170 now and plan to do more with the Crows Special Brew soon.</div></div><hr />
