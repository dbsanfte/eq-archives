<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Antix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It is listed as &lt;=102 on this site.  Does that seem to be accurate?  I would sure hate to fail on this one =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nimphe Wildwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That would be correct.  Good luck on making it.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sine the minimum 5% failure rate has been reduced, these should be a lot easier to make than they used to be.  Obviously the higher your skill the greater your chance, but there were a lot of people with 250 skill and a geerlok that were failing multiple times in a row, some of these were while firing it.  Now the likely hood of a failed combine while firing the seal should be especially low, as the firing trivial is usually significantly lower than creating the item in the first place.  It could still fail, but the odds are stacked a little more in your favor now.<br />
<br />
Best of luck to you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it is less than 102 for Unfired Artisans Seal, as I posted above<br />
it has a trivial level less than 80 since I got the notice I couldn't gain any skill by doing the combine and my pottery level is at 80.</div></div><hr />
