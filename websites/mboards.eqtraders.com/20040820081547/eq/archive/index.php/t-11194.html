<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>diverdwn030</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has there been any mention of a portable brew barrel?  I'd love to have one of those!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I see this question every month or two... and I have to give the same answer.<br />
<br />
Sorry, there is no portable brew barrel. And to the best of my knowledge Sony has never said there would be one.<br />
<br />
I have added this question and response to the General FAQ Page... maybe it will come up less often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A point mentioned in Verdandi's post to the Fanfaire Update thread (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=11041) :<br />
&quot;Portable stills for brewing are a possibility.&quot;<br />
<br />
Who said this during the tradeskills panel and what kind of weight they may carry wasn't mentioned, but if true than some time in the future we may see a portable brewing container.  But yeah, right now like Krazick says, one does not currently exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nimphe Wildwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Technically there is a *portable* although No Drop Brew Barrel (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9411&amp;menustr=035000000000).  Obtaining one of these comes at a very, very dear price and not all can/will be able to get one of these.  <br />
<br />
Best bet is to either wait and see if SOE will make a new brew container or seek out the less populated stationary barrels.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kandrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">According to Alla's, the brew barrel can only be used for one specific combine and once that's done it disappears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've not done AG yet, but many others have stated you can use the portable brew barrel for other combines, although use is limited due to 4 slot restriction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nimphe Wildwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kandrak - to answer your statement, the Brew Barrel *does not* poof when you do the Aid Grimel Brewing combine, but you do need it to turn it in and receive the Clay Signet.  Since you just handed Aid the barrel, you can ask for another one by saying &quot;I am a skilled brewer&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Tinile is correct.  But it doesn't poof, it stays with a person until they destroy it.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>curyllic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What about the Blackburrow casks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nimphe Wildwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Originally posted by curyllic <br />
What about the Blackburrow casks? <br />
<br />
That is a *one time* use for Blackburrow Swig *only*.  It is also used for the Rogue's Burning Rapier and Druid's Jaggedpine quests.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's also possible that a Collapsed Brew Barrel is in the game and Tinkerer's just haven't dicovered it yet. Pretty much everything else is, so it makes sense that it would be there regardless of what SOE is officially saying.<br />
<br />
Just a guess, as usual :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's also worth noting that a recipe for a tinkered portable brewing barrel exists in the EQ RPG books. It's apparently not live-side, but at least one brewing item (palatable mana) has made it over from paper to EQ videogame.</div></div><hr />
