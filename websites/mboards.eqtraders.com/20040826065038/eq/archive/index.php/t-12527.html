<br />
Well - I have been collecting bits and pieces to make an attmpt at one of the elemental bows for quite some time. I have a guildie friend who Tinkers the cams - and until Very recently - these were all skillup opps for them! I knew that certain parts would be near-impossible to find.<br />
<br />
About 2 months ago I found a Stonewood bow staff on a PC Bazaar merchant for a reasonable price - and snapped it up.<br />
<br />
Then - late last night - as I was setting up trader - I found someone selling vegerog vines. Two of them. For a Really good price!<br />
<br />
I bought them both - knowing that the string combine (one that I would have to find someone to do for me) would likley fail.<br />
<br />
Tonight - We had a raid cancelled due to overcrowding in the desired raid zone. So - I asked a guildie about the string combine. I'm not even 100% sure he knew what he was trying to make. There was a long pause after I gave him the vines and wax. I figured it was a no-go. Oh well - I will have other attempts - and I still have the Bow staff and the cams!<br />
<br />
But then - the trade window pops up - and that little yellow message across the bottom - &quot;Xyz is offering you a Vegeron Vine String.&quot; WOW!<br />
<br />
I was nervous now. Worse than the raid to a place I had never been to before.<br />
<br />
So - i re-geared to up my dex. I placed my dex at 255 - with 2-3 points 'lost' as that is my cap.<br />
<br />
Geerlok in primary.<br />
<br />
2 bow cams, bow staff, string, and planing tool in the fletching kit.<br />
<br />
I held the cursor over combine.<br />
<br />
I shut my eyes.<br />
<br />
Click.<br />
<br />
And there - on my cursor - a brand new - Stonewood Compound Bow!<br />
<br />
Now - all I need to do is level a little to actually EQUIP it!<br />
<br />
Lets just say - I am Very happy!<br />

<br />
What was your fletching skill at the time?<br />
<br />
Oh, and i always group with someone when i do combines for them, so they can see my combine success/failure. Everyone in the group gets a message when someone does a tradeskill combine.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aerinha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wow! Congrats!<br />
Now if only I could get all the ingredients for an attempt as well. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Berusa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Cheapest Bow staff i saw on trader the past days on Antonius Bayle was 70k per staff.. so holding on that combine for a few :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ranger_Lahru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Grats on your new bow!<br />
Personally the more I see the going rates on the items for this wonderful bow (My main is a ranger.)  The Luckier I feel.  I was able to aquire all the parts I needed for less than 5K total.  Now I see the Stave going for 10k, the Vines for near that +/- a few K , and the bricks of Immaculate steel for nearly 700 ea.  found a tinker that takes donations rather than sets prices.  So for about 4600pp and me with a Fletching of 230 + Trophy I succeeded the 1st try, failed the 2nd, and just need some more Vines for another shot.  Hopefully I can make it since I'm much in need of some Plat to GM Fletching and get my other Trades to 200.</div></div><hr />

Thanks all! :)<br />
<br />
Splunge - you had asked my skill - I am a 250 Fletcher! :)<br />
<br />
I am not sure if I would have waited all the way to 250 had I found all the components sooner.....<br />
<br />
GL all others on your quest to make 250!<br />
