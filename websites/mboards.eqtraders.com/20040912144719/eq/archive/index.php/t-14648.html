<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Atlantean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First time poster with what I am sure a common question.<br />
Smithing at 188 and have started Enchanted velium bits but I am wondering as they are lore items do you destroy them on each successful combine??<br />
Seems an awful waste of pp as each one costs about 150pp??<br />
Any help would be apreciated, and btw I am a Druid of the 56th level....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just keep an EVB in inventory if you succeed, and any later combines will just give lore message and poof (you can still get skill ups normally off them even though they poof)<br />
<br />
edit: plus they only cost about 25pp each if you farm your own velium.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, it's only 19pp now if you farm your own Velium.  The spell is under 13pp, and the CVT is under 6pp, for a total under 19pp.<br />
<br />
Also consider doing LDoN armors.  If you can sell some of those in the bazaar or on a commission basis, you may well break even or make a profit.<br />
<br />
Finally, look into your cultural armors.  Some races have culturals that make nice skillup paths.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep LDON or Cultural is a good route or do the Shadow Scream Armor if you do not mind the mindless farming for the essences.</div></div><hr />
