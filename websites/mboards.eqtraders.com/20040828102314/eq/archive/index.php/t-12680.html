<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dazma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was looking for the recipes for some of the top bows.  However; I only found Featherwood, Primordeal, Stonewood, Obsidian, and Nightmare.  I didnt know if the server crash is keeping from accessing more recipes or not.  Can someone list recipes for more of the top bows (if they are out there)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Those are the 5 fletched PoP bows.<br />
<br />
The other &quot;top&quot; bows are either dropped, or, in the case of the diety bows, fletched by a wood elf or a Karana worshipper.  The wood elf bows are listed in the cultural for wood elves; not sure wher ethe Karana stuff is on the main site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dazma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yea, the deity bows are listed.  Im trying to get my fletching up for Eternal Tempest bow (30dam/38 dly).  But its listed as the 33 best bow.  Ive got a &quot;shopping list&quot; of the 5 bows listed just didnt know if the others could be made or not.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Quite honestly, I do not know why the best diety bows would be so low on a BotB list.  33?  Sheesh.  That BotB list probably only looked at DPS and stat point totals; something like a 30 38 bow with 200 int would be ranked fairly high simply because of the amount of int . . . and if that was the only stat, it'd be a VERY poor ranger bow.<br />
<br />
For a ranger, there's a very short list of bows that I'd recommend people go for.  <br />
<br />
It starts with the diety bows.  BFT/ETCB, depending on diety.  This should really be the first stat bow, though the lesser diety bows are worthwhile if you're a new player.  Aim for the BFT (or Karana thing) however; this is the bow that'll last you quite some time.<br />
<br />
Once you get EQ and some level of AM, get a Twisted Longbow.   Don't bother with a nightmare, its not that good from a rangerly perspective.<br />
<br />
Once you've got EQ and AM3, start looking for a bow better than a Twisted.  Considering current market prices, you might have to loot one . . . typically, it is at this point that you'll start looking for elemental bows, though the bone carved short bow (38 40 IIRC) is a decent intermediary.<br />
<br />
Once you have an elemental bow, you've got essentially one of the best bows in the game.  Last BotB list I looked at showed them all very near the top, in terms of DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're right thats what the list went by; however, the 2 cultural/diety bows are only: (Strength +5, Dexterity +5, Agility +5, Wisdom +5, Mana +50, HitPoints +50 Save Fire +10, Save Cold +10, Save Magic +10)<br />
<br />
Not bad but not as good as some of the other ones.<br />
