<br />
<br />
Others that want bags, let me know, because of the fluxations in the BD market, I no longer accept them in trade.  Instead, I'm charging a flat 6000 for the bags, with discounts for tufts of dire wolf fur.  However, since the tufts are the sticky point, I can't guarantee turn around time.  At least people have started getting it into their heads that people want them, now we just need to explain to them I am NOT paying 100pp per tuft when I need 36 per bag...<br />
<br />
<br />
*Edit* Oh, and if any of you are curious how I came to 6k, <br />
<br />
756pp = 12 combines of tufts @ 20pp per tuft = 60pp * 12.6 ( 5% failure)<br />
  37pp = 4 patch combines @ 5% failure<br />
2,835pp = 3 BD Powders @ 5% failure<br />
   141pp = 3 celestial essence @ 5% failure<br />
    936pp = 3 infused platinum threads @ 5% failure<br />
<br />
Cost per bag (with failure included on final combine):  5,175pp</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It may, depending on my needs at that time.  Best way to get a conclusive price if you have things to offer is to talk to me in game.</div></div><hr />
