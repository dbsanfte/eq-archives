Hi there ____, care to buy me a drink? If you buy me my favorite, I will tell you a secret.<br />
<br />
Now, it's ( Nov 5 ) :<br />
<br />
Hi there ____, care to bring me a drink? If you bring me my favorite, I will tell you a secret.<br />
<br />
Now, I know it isn't much, but it's a change. I think we all figured out that the drink couldn't be purchased already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cool, verification!  I mentioned this in chat and nobody was certian if I was correct or just imagining it.  I look at it this way, if they took the time to change her text entry, it means *someone* has put some time into her, and possibly the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Time to go hail all the other NPCs in SH again, and see if there's another clue or two floating around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Curiously, Lewena had additional text if you asked her, &quot;What secret?&quot; -- she would basically say, &quot;Never mind that now, just get my drink&quot; -- I forget the exact words.  That seems to have been removed.<br />
<br />
Has anyone been able to make Lewena say anything else with other prompts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaenyelMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have never heard Lewena say anything other than the hail text quoted despite having read mention of something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Now that's wierd, because just now I talked to her and she just gave me the same ol' line and wouldn't talk further.  Mebbe it's a faction related problem. I've got my Amulet of the Haven and all, but they're still not too keen on having an Iksar roam their streets.</div></div><hr />
