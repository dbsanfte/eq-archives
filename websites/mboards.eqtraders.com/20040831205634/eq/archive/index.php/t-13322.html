<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone have information on spawn times or respawn timers for the ground spawned permafrost crystals?  I'd love to show up, fight in, gather them up and then go kill mammoths for meat while I wait for another cycle, but is that reasonable?  Is it an hour, or a day, or more?<br />

/auction WTS A clue, since I can't seem to equip it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I don't know what the spawn timer is on the ground spawns, but I do know that you can go in invis and pick them all up and remain invisible.  Much faster then fighting silly gobbies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">droped like rain if you kill gobs fast enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Noni DeeCups</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gobbie genocide is much faster. I can get a stack in an hour if I remember correctly. It has been a while.<br />
<br />
That is of course if there is no one else in the zone...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Me and my trusty pet go in there from time to time to harvest the crystals, I kill gobies all the way, and snag all the groundspawns as well.  No clue on the respawn time however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cloudwlker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I get the ground spawns twice a day...I think the respawn is about 10hours...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Taushar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually the respawn time on those are about 3-5 hours from what I was told. Not very consistent from what I understand. I heard as low as 2 hours but I haven't tested that theory. I would say 4 hours is a safe bet for respawn, although it could be earlier.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cubwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">the respawn is less than 2 hours.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mistress_Tiatiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I thought the respawn time was something like 10-30 minutes.  I always went in there, started with the first ground spawn, killed gobbies all the way to the back ground spawns then killed my way back to the first ground spawn to start all over again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>StarrsongEverlost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I believe it is right about 2 hours.  I've camped in the little closet-like room where one spawns sans gobby and come back sooner than 2 hours and it wasn't there.  I used to just run in invised and pick up the ground spawns - but when I kill my way thru, I can usually leave with almost a full stack, which saves me a few trips.</div></div><hr />
