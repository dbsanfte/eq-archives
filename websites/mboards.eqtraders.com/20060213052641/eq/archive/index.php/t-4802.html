There were 5 traders in bazaar selling Misty thicket picnics on an agreed upon price and he started selling for 2pp less, he started selling blessed fishing rods for 100pp under everyone else, lucky cabbage half the price of other traders that came to a comfortable price, same with lotus pies and mana vials. When ppl try to pricewar with him, he buys them out of stock and doubles his price once he's the only merchant of that item.<br />
<br />
I can appreciate people coming in and being competitive, but {gosh}, someone that comes in and tries to take over the entire bazaar tradeskill market by undercutting to the point of making people not want to keep their traders on.....<br />
<br />
I'd like to find out if anyone knows who he is so I can try to talk to his main and have him quit undercutting ppl and maybe try to work it out.<br />

edit: keeping it family-friendly, tks</div></div><hr />

As long as it doesn't get used to harass or flame anyone about their prices.  I dislike undercutting as much as the next person, but they have the right to price goods anyway they like, even ifit is short-sighted of them.<br />
<br />
However, I suspect not everyone will feel comfortable posting that info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ilona</div><div class="date">03-18-2003, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">However, I suspect not everyone will feel comfortable posting that info.<br />
<br />
I imagine most people that don't feel comfortable posting that info will be those that do the &quot;continually undercut by a small amount to annoy everyone else&quot; type of thing.<br />
<br />
I agree people have the right to set their prices as they see fit.  They should also expect others to get annoyed when they undercut by a tiny amount, and continue to do so when their price is matched.<br />
<br />
Deciding on a price that's different from other people's and sticking to it when your price is matched is a different story altogether, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Also note that there are many people who would usually price-match that get annoyed at the &quot;continually undercut by a small amount&quot; approach, and start to play games (this is usually people with maxxed or max effective skill).  If you decide a price is too high and put a considerably lower price up, though, they will just match and move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veldin Darkfire</div><div class="date">03-18-2003, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have to agree Illona some good points there.  Everyone does have the right to set whatever price they feel like but the constant undercutting by a small amount of plat constantly is irritating.<br />
<br />
Price setting. I was one of the first to start selling and /auc the folded bags.  I remembered that once upon a time the original bearskin pot bags sold for 150p and finally dropped to 50p.  So I looked at cost of materials and figured 250 for a medicine and 350 for a bearskin was a good price and I knock off 100p if they buy both at once.  This is what I sell them for when afk also.  Others have settled on 300p for each bag.  I don't price match them and they have not tried to undercut the medicine bags I sell so I'm fine with that...the other sellers also don't seem to have an issue with my selling at that price either.<br />

Don't you see?  He doesn't like tradeskills at all, he just wants to ruin everyone else's enjoyment of them.<br />
I'd like to find out if anyone knows who he is so I can try to talk to his main and have him quit undercutting ppl and maybe try to work it out.<br />
He'll probably end up bad-mouthing you, saying you were &quot;harrassing&quot; him, and getting his friends to make your life as difficult as possible. :(</div></div><hr />

I will feel comfortable posting that info - but then again, my trader is named Zabumule.  Kinda hard to figure out who he belongs to.   :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
No issues.  The more bags that get sold, the more the alchemists will come looking for them.   :D  Besides, price wars don't help anyone but the buyers.<br />
<br />
When I first put some up for sale on my trader, I was the only one who had any showing.  Ebina (? I think that was it) and I were both /auc them at the time; one of us was at 350, the other at 250, so we split the difference.  I try to remember to check the &quot;going rate&quot; from time to time, but lately all I have checked is the price of ribbons and dye, then I run off to forage something.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, both of my tailors carries a full set and extra ribbons/pelts.  I /auc them (when I think of it) at 300 each, both for 500, and have sold a bunch that way.  <br />
<br />
Net profit is the same as with the 350/250 pricing, and since I almost never sell &quot;singles,&quot; there shouldn't be an issue.  But I'm flexible, and will be happy to scale up or down to eliminate the possibility of bargain shoppers buying one from you, one from me, rather than grabbing a pair from whichever one of us is available at the time.  (Or whoever else gets in the rotation.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veldin Darkfire</div><div class="date">03-18-2003, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Zabu thats cool. <br />
<br />
This is how i came up with my pricing...<br />
<br />
I remember selling the first bearskin bags at 150p so I started this as my basis.<br />
<br />
The trivial of these is not terribly high  but is near the easy skillups route (wu's) so has some time invested to get there.<br />
<br />
Medicine bags are much cheaper to make requiring only a silver ribbon and the hide.  Total cost in bazaar/gunthak is about 50p a bag. Triv 136.  I also felt that this market would be a little smaller because the medicine bag has less slots if someone wants to buy for making a bag on the spot kind of thing. Also I figured that prices would be cut by half at least in long run. So price = 250p<br />
<br />
(45p hide, 15p ribbon)<br />
<br />
Bearskin bags have use for others outside of alchemy as instant 10 slot small bags and for potion combines. They have a higher trivial 162ish and take more expensive components, including silk cords.  So I added 100p to the medicine bag price for the added cost and triv level. So price =350p<br />
<br />
(31p ribbon, 15p hide, 30p for cord)<br />
<br />
As incentive I offered a 100p discount in any /auc of 100p off if they bought both.<br />
<br />
I figure in a month bags will bottom out at about 100p for medicine and 150p for bearskin<br />
<br />
Just my thought process.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maevenniia</div><div class="date">03-18-2003, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, my trader is Kasea, I sell pottery stuff and misc items from vendor-mining, farming, or drops I’ve acquired.  I try to match prices with others, for the most part.  <br />
<br />
Sometimes I’m not sure what to sell something for (I’ve always had problems on figuring out what certain items are worth in EQ) so if you ever see my trader on with prices that seem too low, send me a tell or PM me here and I’ll review the price.  I may have a good reason to set a low price (ex: need cash in a hurry) or I may have been especially clueless that day :D<br />
<br />
I will say I usually sell the Ruby encrusted steins for no more than 500pp (I boggle at the same guy Stuffrus? who always has one at 1999pp, but if he can sell it at that price good for him);  sadly, I usually have to price match with idiots selling the steins as low as 150pp these days…<br />
<br />
Speaking of steins, why will no one buy the Planar Peridot Steins? I /auction that they are used in the beginner’s stealth manual quest, a good range item that can be improved upon with subsequent quests, and no one will buy them… and the thing is, you can do the quest at level 25 and get good exp.  Someone posted they get 14% xp at lev 25, that’s nothing to sneeze at for one turn-in!  And it’s repeatable, with a bit of leg-work (have to re-do Planar Traveller’s manual quest)<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />

Excellent, I will have to look you up.  I'm stockpiling stuff now for when I can skill up Sprowt a bit more.  Several stacks of coiled springs, ball bearings, drops of grease, silicorrosive grease, etc. from the PoP drops, and now partial stacks of the LoY components.  All compliments of the merchants.  <br />
<br />
I wonder if I can GM his tinkering without ever getting beyond level 16 (and without going bankrupt in the process?) :roll:</div></div><hr />

Works for me!  I'll be making the adjustments when I get home tonight.  <br />
<br />
I figure in a month bags will bottom out at about 100p for medicine and 150p for bearskin.<br />
<br />
Yep, too true.  But even then there is a profit to be had, albeit a smaller one.  I can live with it, provided it stays steady.  After all, I really only planned on making one set for Hoogos for his 25th birthday  :)<br />
<br />
If sales keep up, I might recoup some of my losses in the ribbon market.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Three more tailoring points to go, and Amarantha only needs one more piece of her cultural armour too..... methinks I'll have spare EQ time on my hands very soon to pour into tinkering...<br />

I like making my own geerloks, and I haven't got collapsible containers yet because I want to make my own :D</div></div><hr />

My trader is Durak and all he usually has on him is Kaladim Constitutionals.  I've noticed a huge influx of traders selling these lately.  I don't really mind people trying to undercut my prices, I'm a patient person and don't mind sharing a semi-lucrative market.  The only thing that irks me are the people that undercut my pice by 5gp!  At least go a whole plat so it's easier to match you.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GunnyBurlfoot</div><div class="date">04-16-2003, 07:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like this thread, though it is non sensical, as the greatest offenders will never read the boards,  or post on this thread<br />
<br />
My traders are Shimo, and Cape<br />
<br />
I love setting a price and keeping it there, but alas, that is not to be. Especially with Black Pantherskin and Ceremonial Robes . Yeesh.<br />
<br />
Every single time I try to reestablish the prices by putting the prices back up to a reasonable amount, either Nucer or Fumstise undercuts me to below cost of the pieces (assuming you buy your materials in bazaar)<br />
<br />
Example, Black Panther<br />
BP skin ~150p + Yew Leaf ~100-200p + Velium Bonings 75p-300p) x 50% failure rate at 250 + GM needle =<br />
150p<br />
100p<br />
225p (legs)<br />
----<br />
500 circa<br />
x  2 50% failure<br />
----<br />
1000p cost to make. Reasonable % profit 20-30% 1200-1400p.<br />
Prices I see them selling for in bazaar? between 900-1000p, basically cost, maybe 150p profit if you farm your own BP skins. I don't even bother opening my sewing kit for 100p profit. Same thing with ceremonial robes. When they are selling for less than the cost of a Gem Studded Chain in bazaar, then something is amiss.<br />
<br />
Too bad you can't form guilds like the *real* medieval guilds did. Back when they were setting prices anyone who didn't go along at first, was made to see how going along with the price structure was to their advantage.<br />
<br />
I don't even mind price matching, as long as you set a price and keep it there, I'll probably come down to whatever it is, eventually. But when I play the lowering game two or three times, it becomes ridiculous to me to even try to tailor. The PoP stuff. Gah! Lowest I've seen drops of pure rain is 2k! For one drop. <br />
<br />
People should quit trying to make a fast buck and look a little bit longer view, and quit ruining everyone else's chances.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, BP &quot;should&quot; sell for 1500 apiece, the studded velious for even more (more CVT's used up) say 1800-2k each, the ceremonial robes &quot;should&quot; sell for 1600-1900. In my dream world only, I guess  :?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean competition is fine, but this guy had Tae Ew shields up for 5k one day. Now, mind you, that was just dumb, as I bought them for 5k, traded one for a jade reaver, and sold the other for 12k  :D <br />
<br />
Now he has them at 8k, which is a sucking low price, but not low enough for me to buy him out.<br />

Unfortunately, this same guy is also driving sickle prices down, as well as several other items.</div></div><hr />
