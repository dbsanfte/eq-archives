<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tanker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys.<br />
<br />
I just got back from my first Fan Faire (and a couple of extra days in Vegas with my wife celebrating our anniversary), and thought I'd share some of my experiences.  Note, no new info here about skillups, etc.; just my thoughts.<br />
<br />
I was very happy to finally meet Niami and Ngreth.  I visited this site many a time even before I joined the EQ team over 2 years ago, and was glad I could finally show my appreciation for all the hard work that goes on here.<br />
<br />
The Karaoke was astounding.  How do you spell Smed doing Guns 'n Roses?  U-N-R-E-A-L.  In fact, it seemed a lot of you had absolutely no trouble extroverting in front of a couple thousand other people.  Good job, all who sang.  (no, I wasn't one of them.  It's a good excuse, but the line was over 2 hours long by the time I got there, and I had no idea I'd be staying that long).<br />
<br />
The panels were interesting to watch, and fun to participate in.  If you didn't see Pfister's Graphics Engine panel, then book your plane tickets for the next FF ASAP, you missed something special.  As for the Tradeskill panels, I was surprised and happy at how well-mannered the players were (hope some of you were there besides the obvious).  I had been given warnings about backlash and all, but it never showed.  I hope that's partially due to our presence here in the past few months.<br />
<br />
The parties.  Well, what little I remember of the Beach party (ok, so I wasn't quite that drunk) was a blast.  It would shock me to learn they made much off us that night, as the booze was flowing pretty fast.  Dancing at the Hilton's little Disco was fun on Thursday night, as well.  I probably drank more this weekend than in the last 2 years total (I'm a relatively new father, and that cuts into my party time, :) ).<br />
<br />
Gambling.  Don't talk to me about gambling.  For someone with a computer science degree and two math majors for parents, I sure suck at card games. :steamed: <br />
<br />
So, all in all, I had a great time.  I hope you all did, too.  I don't know how often I can get away from the wife and kids for 3-4 days, but I'll certainly try to see you all at the next one, too.  Of course, I don't really have any more secrets to hand out, so maybe there won't need to be a Tradeskill panel :hyper:.   Yeah, right.<br />

[edit] Spelling/grammar.  This is what I get for wanting to hurry out a post before I wake up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Congrats on the anniversary man!  I just celebrted my tenth and it sure is a lot of work, but worth every minute.  :)  <br />
<br />
Also, I'd bet that the lack of backlash was due in large part to the fact that you guys are actually part of the community these days rather than the folks behind the curtains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaysha Soulsinger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Congrats to you and your love :).<br />
<br />
I concur, on the point of backlash and being present. People have been able to get things brought up, with active feedback from you guys - and it shows. I think a lot of players respect you for the efforts you take to communicate with the group who's posting here regularly.<br />
<br />
I do hope you will be able to keep up with that, or even improve it, because it is appreciated a great deal. Unfortunately this can't be said for all dev's (especially regarding the class forums) and you see there indeed that there's a lot of negative criticism building up. Active communication does help :).<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input in our community :).</div></div><hr />

:eek: <br />
<br />
<br />
Hehehe... c'mon... someone had to say it! May as well be a halfling!<br />
<br />
Sounds like Vegas was a blast, unfortunatly I'm stuck here in Canada and have no hope of going to a fan faire unless you bring one here....... (c'mon... Vancuver BC is a nice place... no really!)<br />
<br />
I have heard horror stories of fan faires where the players get very 'uptight' with the devs on the pannels, but as already explained, your presence here, interacting, listening, and helping out when you can greatly reduces the chances that you will have an angry mob with pitchforks at your table.<br />
<br />
I just wanted to throw in my support for devs coming by and trolling.... errr..... posting on these boards!<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />

Flaming pitchforks.  It's like a torch and a farming implement rolled into one!<br />

<br />
Yes, but only able to be made by SolRo-worshipping bards with 250 smithing, wearing full sets of BD imbued cultural armor.</div></div><hr />

So you knew the odds and played anyway? :angel:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tanker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Did I not say DON'T talk to me about gambling?!?<br />

*grumble* *grumble* &quot;You knew the odds..&quot; *grumble* *gripe*<br />

:hug:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heheh. Grats on the anniversary AND the kid. And yes, many thanks for being seen; it's much more appreciated than we even say. <br />
<br />
<br />
And... where/when IS the next FF? I have a certain Marr Coalition to drag/beg/plead/promise-favors-to into going.... : P : P : P<br />
not to mention I have to work and save some money this summer for my own pass ^_^.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tanker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Heh, they don't tell me these things ahead of time.  We got notified exactly what hotel FF would be in Vegas (the Rio was the current rumor) the day before it went on the web-site.  Sorry, marketing  keeps it pretty close until they announce publicly.   Glad I got my hotel room in Vegas the very first day.<br />
<br />
Just noticed I made your sig-quote list. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Raolinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm sure you guys here this alot now but...Tanker, Absor, Maddoc You guys are great. Brings a tear to me eye to see Folks at Sony actually listen and respond to us.<br />
This isn't ment to be sarcastic or snide. I really mean it. There are so many boards out there saying no one ever listens to the players. I guess since tradeskills on the most part are not class specific and tradskilling in general is not for the faint harted. That this site atracts some of the more, dare I say it, mature players. <br />
Not only do you guys take time to comment on these boards and that these boards exist at all in the way they do (no pages of flamage or nonsense on every page) Is one of the main reasons I am still playing EQ today. (not that I don't have my gripes but thats for a different discussion  :D ) <br />
The comunity of players on certain boards and the fact that I like trolling thru EQ is what makes it the only game I play. (me time. to relax)  I am a causual player with 2 toons I play. <br />
<br />
Basically to some it all up I just wanted to say Thanks for having an intreset in the TS comunity. Weather it's just posting upcoming changes or answering some questions. <br />

<br />
Don't make me get all misty here!  :)<br />
<br />
It's mostly because you lot are frightfully level-headed and willing to take no for an answer.  As you said, this is a mature and well moderated forum where we can pop in and say something stupid and you don't yell at us for not addressing the concern of the moment.  You just yell at us for saying something stupid.  :)<br />
<br />
A</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wyloc Wormwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Absor, you saying something stupid? no hahahahaha well i guess ya can *type* with a foot in your mouth.<br />
<br />
just kidding. glad you guys stop by.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You sure that's not a high level brewing recipe?  :D  *flips through brewing recipe books and hangover cures*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">THAT'S what we need :) Some new drinks (shots) with really wacky names!! Though come to think of it, a flaming pitchfork does sound like something that SHOULD exist.<br />
<br />
If it doesn't, I'll have to make it. Something with cinnamon schnapps in it... *wanders off*<br />
<br />
oops, got so sidetracked by looking up drink names that I forgot what I was doing here in the first place! Grats on the anniversary, Tanker :)<br />
<br />
And yes, it was VERY hard to get up in front of people and sing LOL I had a couple friends practically drag me up, and then sway (out of time) behind me, trying to make me laugh :) It was a blast though.. Welcome to the Jungle was just unreal :)</div></div><hr />
