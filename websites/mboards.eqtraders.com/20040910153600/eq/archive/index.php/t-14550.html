<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tokensmoke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Y is it Rogues are so overlooked when it comes to tradeskills..?  Seems like we always get the short end of the stick when it comes to new recipes with expansions (with the exception of PoP).  For me, I personally hate skillin.  Its a little easier with the new UI granted, but still, the one skill most rogues will work up seems to be neglected.  Guess i should take up smithing or somethin like that.  I always used to look forward to new cool poisons that you could make with new expansions, but lately, I have given up.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Turlo Lomon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think your comments are a bit premature.  There are already 8 new recipes I can think of off the top of my head, plus the refined materials.  Just because they haven't been discovered yet, doesn't mean they don't exist.<br />
<br />
Give it time.  Experiment.  Shoot, maybe you will be the one to discover the new recipes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Interesting, LoYT gave me a new skillup path with poisons.<br />
<br />
And as Turlo said, only 8 have been *discovered* so far, I'm sure more will pop up, people are still discovering LDoN poisons.<br />
<br />
and if you hate skilling up, just spend the PP and skill Poisonmaking up with a guildmaster, I bought 170-182 yesterday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not only that, I feel lucky.<br />
<br />
Who else can get this before the MOB gets a chance to retaliate?<br />
<br />
400 point backstab<br />
2 pokes for 70<br />
2 slices for 70<br />
115 proc on the dagger<br />
63 proc from a Nematocyst Poison ( http://www.eqtraders.com/search/reverse_recipe_search.php?item=8090&amp;menustr=035000000000 )<br />
213 poison from Visionistic Pain ( http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=7180&amp;menustr= )<br />
<br />
That's what,<br />
<br />
400+70+70+70+70+115+63+213 = 1071 points in the first strike?<br />
<br />
All melee?<br />
<br />
And at level 53..<br />
<br />
Just imagine what I'll be able to do at 65!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tokensmoke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1071 huh...?  In the first swing..?  Sounds like U are tankin the rest of the fight..!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tokensmoke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And on 1 more note, I have been 250.  Been 250 since before PoP came out.  So no need to train skill for me.</div></div><hr />

Not if our first evade is successful. If you time it right the mob won't even take a single swing at you.</div></div><hr />

I'd never do that!<br />

Start a fight, then let someone else in the goup take the agro?  :angel:</div></div><hr />
