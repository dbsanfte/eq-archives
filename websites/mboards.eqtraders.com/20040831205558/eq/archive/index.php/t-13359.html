<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bigtoxic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">being a not so bright troll warrior i decided to start the Aid Grimil quest.  With a shot of that KEI stuff and after spending 25k on INT gear in bazaar i can get my int to 235.  Well im somewhat lazy as well so i used the 300k i had to buy any/everything i could to get all my other skills up and now down to about 75k.<br />
<br />
My tailoring skill is now at 188 and i find myself wondering just what my next option is considering i have no cultrial and there is only so much i can farm. I am an elemental warrior so i can solo/farm some items just not as fast as you wiggilers/<br />
<br />
So please help a poor troll with suggestions of what i might consider to further myself in this skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Acrylia reinforced will get you to the 240s. (Flawless hopper hides and acrylia for boning) Then you're looking at velious tailoring or solstice robes. <br />
<br />
I'd imagine an elemental warrior could farm quite well :D , better with a shaman helping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">did you do ribbons to 187 or did you buy acrylia and stuff in the bazaar?  i imagine wyverns would be easier for you because you can fish but no forage of the velious stuff.  go kill in ds at the hopper caves maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mahlig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Othmir.  Easy and fairly cheap.  And you make money while hunting them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>drtyaty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well my overly large not-so-handsom troll warrior friend, the first thing I see wrong with what you are doing is that you are trying to buy your way to 250 tailoring, which is only going to increase your chances of becoming broke and not your tailoring skill.  The reason this is so is simple economics, mostly supply and demand.<br />
<br />
For example, if you begin buying up all the spider silks or any other material used in a tradeskill commonly found in the bazaar sellers become very aware of this and will start jacking up the price on you until you or others decide enough is enough.  For instance, this past week I couldn't find a spider silk for less than 15pp.  The reason is because someone similar to yourself was trying to buy their way to 250.  <br />
<br />
You have to set limits on what you are going to spend on certain items; you have to, or prices will never remain stable and will be high as hell.  For instance, I do not ordinarily spend more than 5pp for spider silks (I will make exceptions if I see someone with a large quantity for 6).  The same is true of runes and words used in my loy robe combines, small pieces of velium, artic wyvern hides, acrylia, acrylia boning, etc., etc.  If you do not do this you will end up broke and discouraged (particularly when the final component sells for far less than the material used to make it).  <br />
<br />
You must first realize that some of the tradeskills (primarily smithing and tailoring) take time to gm.  That is simply due to limited supplies of material in the bazaar and the cost of trying to buy your way to 250, as most cannot afford to do so.  Now, I honestly believe it is far more economic to buy most of my components in the bazaar than to farm them myself because I can easily make far more $ camping a rare or buying and selling in the bazaar in the amount of time I could spend killing greenies for components; but, you have to know when enough is enough, or you will drive prices through the roof.<br />
<br />
Another example is the price of velium recently on our server.  People were buying velium like crazy to smith enchanted velium bits.  It was not uncommon to see prices exceeding 100pp/piece.  Then SoE removed the coldain velium temper (CVT) and noone was willing to make it.  This combined with the fact that many who were considering gming smithing went ahead and did so or those who wanted to decided they were not paying more than a certain price caused prices to begin to drop again, and this weekend I saw over 100 small pieces priced at 60pp.  (On a side note, this will not likely last since someone either macro'd 1000+ CVTs or introduced some of the left over CVT from the exploit from a few weeks ago).  <br />
<br />
/soapbox off, but do not expect to gm tailoring through your piggy bank, or your piggy will end up busted.<br />
<br />
Good luck though.  Oh, and make sure you read up on the boards, because most of the answers to your questions lie here within these forums thanks to those who created and support this site, including the tradeskill community of Norrath.  BTW, thanks all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigtoxic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the answers and Yes  i know i will have to farm a lil  but if givin the option of planting a garden.....watching it grow....picking the garden.....cooking what i picked....or heading to taco bell......i choose taco bell  :)  Like many others i got to a point in my eq gaming where i really had no use for plat. Aid grimil and starting tradeskills full force( i had dabbeled in smithing for Seru banes and Brewing because im a bartender in Rl) was a good way to use this plat. My goal is to use what plat i have to hurry and get the earring and then slowly but surely farm, do all those mini subcombines to GM these skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>drtyaty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/point of my post was to tell you that you more than likely cannot buy your way to Grandmastering tailoring; particularly not on 300k.  <br />
<br />
You will either have to farm (eek, I hate doing it) or, you will have to be more selective in how much you pay for certain items, which will force you to have to take somet time to gm it.<br />
<br />
Understand?<br />
<br />
*** There, point of my post; what I originally meant to post. ***<br />
<br />
The point of this being your thread is a point well made.  Good point and good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bigtoxic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/point  i made the post so i think i know what i was asking<br />
 understand?<br />
<br />
But if you need me to spell it out for you i never once said....hey all tell me what i can do to get my skill up  by buying everything.<br />
 I made it perfectly clear in the first thread i was asking for options.  in 2 click of this button i can see just what my options are...but what i cant see is drop rates  ect....hence the reason for this post.<br />
<br />
oh yeah    Understand?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bearcaller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">tailoring is a pain to raise 188+<br />
<br />
From this point on it is both time consuming and expensive.  It took me 10 times as long to go from 188-250 as it did to get to 188.  <br />
<br />
Buying your way up isn't just a matter of pushing the prices of components sky high.  Its also a fact that the components just arent there.  Velious combines right now are HIDEOUSLY expensive right now due to the lack of buyable CVT and price of velium.  Not to mention that arctic wyvern requires cod (expensive/time consuming) and not many people hunt tigeraptors (you would have to farm them yourself).  Haze/black panther both require yew leaves which are prohibitively rare.<br />
<br />
With money to spare I would suggest doing solstice robes.  You won't kill any market that is already dead and spider silks are the only dropped component (and easily found in many places).  If you don't want to be bothered with components and subcombines (there are a lot) hire out a few lower levels to farm the spider silks and make the TONS of CE you will need.  Even doing this I would still guess that your final cost would be somewhere around 10-15k per skill point.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you choose to do some farming for yourself it will be cheaper of course, but as a warrior you are a little limited.  Wyverns will be next to impossible if your server is anything like solro, 2 or 3 wiz/dru can easily keep them all down.  Othmir too are in the same category.  If you are planning on going the velious route I would suggest the tigeraptors near the SS zone in WL.  Static spawns with a fast repop timer and a good chance of grabbing a roamer or two.  Hides drop around 1 in 3 or 4 kills for me (a little better than most other velious hides) and the drake eggs are easy enough to get in bazaar (I don't know why, they just always seem to be cheap and plentiful on solro).  Skip panthers, Yew leaves suck, plain and simple.  <br />
<br />
For spider silks EK is still the best.  You can also try the heart spiders in guk (never been there myself) and the drachnids outside the FV tunnel can be harvested as well.<br />
<br />
Either way you go it will take time.  There just is not enough material in the bazaar to buy more than 40 skill up attempts a night, YMMV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>drtyaty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bearcaller is absolutely correct about Upper Guk being a good place for spider silks.  However, I always took it one step further.  I would always kill the spiders in Upper Guk, and then head down to lower guk and kill the black widow spiders.  I would also then go kill a rare or a place holder, like Arch Mage (but I am a pally, so IVU came in very handy.  By the time I had completed my run in Lower Guk, the spiders in Upper were ready to respawn again.<br />
<br />
Not many people hunt spiders there (better hope noone on my server reads this so I don't have competition), and the drop rate hasn't been nerfed by bs newbie quests. <br />
<br />
I have never hunted for silks in E.K., but I have been hesitant to go there simply because I am not a tracker, and I believe a few trackers on our server go to E.K. for the sole purpose of farming silks.  If this is true, then I would suggest you avoid it as well.<br />
<br />
Definitely ribbons to 187 and solstice robes to 210; at least that's the best option I saw available.  Once you reach 210, you get your 2 free combines (not really, but far less expensive than anything else you will encounter) on ethereal silks, and then from 212 forward, I highly recommend wyvern armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I spent a lot of time in EK farming silks and pelts.  (and yes, I am a tracker.)  Once, there was one other person farming, but almost every other time, there was no one.  A couple nice bonuses was that I'd forage a tea leaves here and there, and find a hill giant to kill once in a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In my opinion, I would suggest either acrylia armor as it doesn't require any other class to help (no forage, no imbue, no enchant).<br />
<br />
If you've got an enchanter friend, then I'd go otter hats (enchanter friend to imbue mana vials, and you can slaughter the beach and fish for your own cods - bring a mule on a second account with you who can take the vendor fodder and sell it back to the otter merchants, which will help defray the cost of the threads and mana vials).<br />
<br />
If you hit your server's market just right (just the right supply and demand) and you have a crapton of money (gonna take more than 75kpp) and you have a enchanter friend with 250 jc and jcm3 and a tunarean cleric or druid friend who'll imbue emeralds FOREVER, you can do solstice robes. But i'm guessing that the supply of silks on your server will be low, which means the price will be high and the bazaar sell back of solstice robes across all the servers just sucks.<br />
<br />
soo...there's no fast way, nor is there &quot;one&quot; way to go to 240/250 without going insane.<br />
<br />
If I were you, I'd start working on both acrylia armors and otter hats...and good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tzaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hi  Bigtoxic,<br />
<br />
As a fellow melee (monk) I can empathise with the problems you face as a tradeskiller raising your int.<br />
<br />
Not everyone has the ability to raid for upgrades, or have the cash for bazaar trades. So I found other methods to enhance my int as it happened to be my highest stat. <br />
<br />
One of the better ways to increase stats was by buying cheap LDoN items, with or without int, and putting int augs into them. For an example as a warrior you could have an wrist slot with no int, so into it you could put a Ruj 48 points Agressor's Wrist Guard AC:13, CR:4, DR:4, type1,type2 and then add a mir 220 points Cracked Icy Shard of Research Notlore, Int:9 type 2.<br />
<br />
I see you ask about drop rates. I’m able to multibox, and I’m currently stock piling rockhoppers hides, acrylia, Othmir pelts, ice burrowers silk etc etc for the time I’m ready to start combining again. All I can say whichever one you chose the drop rates will make you cry, scream abuse and make you glad to be doing even backflagging to get away from killing yet another green. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">buy the ldon frosted armor.  has int.  if you are going with the last suggestion at least.  works for any chain or plate class.  sorry monks. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a fellow monk, may I suggest working on wisdom instead.  Maybe you don't raid a lot, maybe you don't get a lot of upgrades, but you do get them eventually, I'm guessing?  Being that you will eventually get upgrades of some kind, I'd like to mention that we share armors with Druids and Beastlords.  They're both Wis basesd casters and your normal gear will eventually be Wisdom heavy.  If you're going to invest time and energy into buying cheap LDoN items, I was just thinking it might be better to plan for the future of your normal gear upgrades in line with purchased LDoN gear/augs so you're not wasting valuable points on gear you can upgrade through normal channels and get a Wisdom increase in the process.  <br />
<br />
Your idea of using cheap LDoN gear/augs was a great one though and I might actually utilize it in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Leewei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The single best investment of cash you can make right now would be to get your INT or WIS to 280, or even 305.<br />
<br />
KEI is certainly great for this, as you know.  A stack of MT Picnics and Qeynos Afternoon Teas is pretty cheap and will likely get another +10 INT/WIS for you.<br />
<br />
I think Bards have a song to boost mental stats which will stack with KEI.<br />
<br />
With the sheer number of combines it will take you to hit 250, believe me, capping a mental stat is worth the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Velaraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Im raising all trades and doing AG atm too, im troll bst just hit 200 on tailoring waiting on a few aa to spare then will do more.  I did solstice robes after ribbons, bought everythign in bazaar. your pocket book may or may not allow that though, ive dumped lots of plat on it cuz i dont want to farm little things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Lixivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">if youre only trying to get to 220, just do solstice robes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tzaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">/bow Uroc<br />
<br />
Up until Christmas I used to raid, and was fortunate to DKP buy some items from VT and the Elemental planes along with getting other exp/quest drops. Then the guild imploded and I wasn’t inclined to reapply to the only other raid guild in my time zone, but rather stay with those who remained. (As a side note the other guild does not use DKP but has a system where the order to loot is given out, so who could say if my stats might ever go up in any out of class need area?) <br />
<br />
Wisdom based might have been the better starting goal? But at the time I decided to increase my int stats it was at least higher than my wisdom. <br />
<br />
LDoN provided me with exp and stone upgrades camps mostly outside of raid times. At the time there were a few LDoN Aug items I liked, but for the most part I had better ‘raid’ gear for my guild role than what was on offer from the LDoN shopkeepers. So for me buying items for a tradeskilling set of clothes made more sense than having the points just sitting there.<br />
<br />
Of course different classes, in different types of guilds will have varying degrees of opportunities and availability of gaining a stat (wis/int) improvement. <br />
<br />
The only other thing I did not mention was my use of a search engine like the one found in AllaKhazam. Picking a stat type would reveal what I might obtain, and what size of force needed, solo, boxed, group or raid. <br />
<br />
I do agree with everyone here, taking time to look up items then seeking them out to improve your stats is always a good step towards successful tradeskilling.</div></div><hr />
