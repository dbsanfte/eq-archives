<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beautiful_rain_childe</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello everyone!  Well, obviously, I'm quite new to this.  The big question that I have right now is about start up costs.  (I'm playing a character in my local larp who is a swordsmith, and I'd like to learn more about it)  First off, I was wondering if anyone knows about how much it would cost to set up a basic forge.  And if I can get supplies and equipment to make weapons for under $1500?  Thats the bing thing that I'm looking for right now...but I'd also love to know exactly how one goes about making a sword, step by step kind of thing.   :D  <br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br />
Thanks so much<br />
<br />
April</div></div><hr />

<br />
If this is true, I doubt you'll get much help here.  The black smithing we discuss in this forum is in the context of the online game Everquest and has nothing to do with real life smithing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beautiful_rain_childe</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well....I'm not actually looking to build one, because well, I just can't afford that.  But I would be interested, if anyone has an idea, of what kind of start up costs I'm looking at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niami DenMother</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Given that you're looking for, again, real life smithing costs, not anything having to do with the tradeskill blacksmithing withing the game EverQuest, I'm going to move this to the OOC Chat forum.  It's possible some of our hobbyists might know, but in this forum, you're only going to get in-game costs in platinum pieces for virtual items.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BuilderOfCastles</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First you are in the wrong place for advice on REAL knife and sword making.  Search yahoo for &quot;knife making&quot;.  But since I know a bit about the real art I will try to steer you on to the correct path.<br />
<br />
Second, we don't use forges anymore.<br />
A forge is a device for heating up metal so that it is plastic (mushy) enough to be bent by beating on it with a hammer.  There are so many things to know about like carbon content, alloy and case hardening, that only the most advanced sword makers delve in this area.<br />
<br />
REAL ADVICE<br />
Start off with a knife kit.<br />
For this you will need:<br />
1) knife kit (many catalogs for these)<br />
2) set of files.  Large files with good handles. (not micro files used for models)<br />
3) bench grinder (optional)<br />
4) sharpening stones.<br />
5) Bench Vise<br />
<br />
The knife kit will come with a blad that is already formed.<br />
All the crafting is in fitting the tange to the handle, getting the handle just right, fitting the pommel and filing and shaping everything just right.<br />
<br />
Capital outlay about $100-150 from home depot plus the knife kit.<br />
<br />
Then you will see if you actually like this.<br />
After that you can buy a sword kit and see how you do with that.<br />
Next is learning to grind a blade from a piece of metal. (Even if you forge your own blade, it still requires lots of clean up on the grinder)<br />
<br />
And now, if you are still interested.  You can buy a forge.<br />
Protective gear: leather gloves, apron, chaps.  face shield $500-1000<br />
Natural Gas or Propane fired Forge.  $1000-2000<br />
large anvil $250-500.  make sure to get one that rings true to you.<br />
Various hammers, tempers, etc. $1000-2000<br />
<br />
Not very expensive, but VERY hot sweaty, labor intensive work (or fun) and you will ruin the first blade you ever try to forge.  And maybe the second...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raolinx</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 11:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe Kinda a cool topic. Try making Onamental knives, swords, Ect. to start off. A BMFK can be made out most metal you have lying around. (i like leaf springs.) Cut it out grind it down. Polish it. Add a handle. Polish some more. Remeber a Bastrd sword didnt deal damage from cutting, rather the kenetic energy being stored in the blade as you swing and then being released all at one time along the edge. Same as a hammer only with a drasticly reduced surface area. So a sword (or any swong object realt) is a medium that stores kenetic energy. On the flip side Armor is a nergy abatment device. Just something to think about. You can make Something that looks like a sword alot easyer than a functional one. However A home made knife that functions is an achivment that you can be proud of. Alot of places have Classes that you can take to learn about. Try the web for information about such in your area. Some can even be a fun way to spend weekend [/b]</div></div><hr />

Thanks for all of the incredible help.  I'm really not interested in making any weapons for myself, I'm only doing research for my larp character.  :)  But it is fun to learn about.  In fact, I think I would make a horrible swordsmith, but you never know.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Psychosis</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seeing as how I have been interested in actually becomming a Metal Smith in RL I have done alot of research on this. To set up your own forge and get the basic tools (Once you have the basic tools you can make the others) it will cost you about $3,000.  But there is a few things you have to remember. <br />
<br />
A ) You cant set it up in the City Limits (Unless you are setting it up in a Industral Zone)<br />
B ) You have to have the building to put it in.<br />
C ) Time, Paitence, Strength of arm, Attention to detail.<br />
D ) Knowledge of Metals, Alloys, Chemstry, Physics, Temper, Honing, many many more.<br />
E  ) Did I mention time?</div></div><hr />

My question is if I spend $3k of real cash money to get a forge in my garage and practice enough to get good at banging out sword blades, what do I have to add to the blade to imbue it for Tunare?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dunthor Warsmith</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been doing a bit of research on armor making myself.  I only actually DO buntted chainmaille from precut rings at this point, but I hope to eventually move to doing more of the ring making process myself, as well as maybe some plate if I can get the materials &amp; tools (plate has a lot more upfront investment than chainmail).<br />
<br />
http://www.arador.com/ is a VERY good read and has a lot of good information for getting a feel of crafting many of these objects, as well as the tools used.  Not the best place for instructions on actually doing the weaving, but that's another matter :P  It mostly focuses on armor however, whereas you only mentioned swords ...<br />
<br />
Goodluck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sumamael</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very interesting. Actually my father showed me a few how-to's when I was a kid about melting and casting lead (he is a scientist with some field practice on metalworks) so I could probably make some metal blocks out of bricks in RL hehe. <br />
<br />
Now if only I had the time.....</div></div><hr />

I and my boyfriend were recently on a trip through England and Scotland - and we couldn't resist. We bought 2 gorgeous, HUGE, handmade swords in Edinburgh - a 5.5' 2-handed highland-claidmore style bastard (&quot;his&quot;) and a 4.75' 1.5 hand sword (&quot;hers&quot;). They're so gorgeous. And yes, I will get pictures up of them as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
I was really pleased that they were made by a local artist from recycled steel. And they are wonderful to hold and play with. Yes, the smaller is mine, dangit!</div></div><hr />
