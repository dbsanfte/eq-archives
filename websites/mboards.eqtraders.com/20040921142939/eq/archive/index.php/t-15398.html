<br />
Life has taken a new path for me, and I will find myself spending much less time in Norrath, so I will be laying down my toolbox for now. Should you catch me on (E'Ci), do say hello, and if you wish to keep in touch please use ecitinker@hotmail.com.<br />
<br />
Be well all and happy tinkering. ^-^<br />

The first famous EQer I ever met in Norrath itself, Kritta, no!<br />
<br />
Well, GL in RL, I'll miss your sage tinkering advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trepan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Kritta, thank you SO much for all you've given to the tinkering community over the years.   1/2 of us wouldn't have had the courage to clear a spot on the work bench without you!<br />

Keep your peg board full of tools!<br />

Your resources made it possible for me to become the tinkerer that I am. Thank you. I wish you the best in whatever you undertake in your life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kritta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Awww, you're getting me all misty here. *chuckle*<br />
<br />
Thanks all for your kind words. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">While I've already responded to the news over in the moderator's area, I wanted to post something here, as well.<br />
<br />
While I'll be sorry to see you go, I, of all people, can empathize with prioritizing, and RL definitely takes precedence.<br />
<br />
Know that you've been a boon to this community, and you're definitely welcome back to visit whenever time and inclination allows.  No, nix that.  You'd BETTER stop by the boards and visit now and then, dagnabit!!<br />

Best of luck Kritta! Leaving EQ the game does not mean leaving your EQTraders family here! /huuuug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tishalulle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I heard the legends about Kritta the tinkerer when I first started playing EQ years ago. In the bazaar, I realized one day that my gnome trader had her shop set up right next to Krittatoo. I bought my set of clockwork armor for my main gnome shadowknight from Krittatoo. Then one day, I actually saw Kritta run by me. Then, recently my shadowknight reached her 65th season, and I decided it was time for her to tinker, all because of the inspiration of Kritta. At the same time, I noticed it had been a while since I'd seen Kritta or Krittatoo. Now I know why, and I'm happy and sad.<br />
<br />
We'll miss you, Kritta, I hope you have fun out there. I'll be thinking of you with each gadget I tinker.<br />
