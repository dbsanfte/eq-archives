<br />
I am level 9, and still working on my newbie armour quest. I still have not seen anymore of those giant wood spiders in Misty thicket.  :? <br />
<br />
So, last night I was sitting by the wall medding(got in an extra night of playing cuase the wife was packing because she is going camping with friends and I'm working this weekend) and I get a tell from this level 24 warrior asking If I could come heal him at runnyeye.  I explain to him that I was medding and healing, and that I didn't know where runnyeye was.  He told me how to get there, and I found my way there.  I healed him, which took all of my mana, and sat down to med again.<br />
<br />
He then asked me if I wanted to be pled.  I declined, I really coudn't see how a warrior was going pl me.  Then he laughed and said that that was the first he had ever heard of anyone turning down being powere leveled.  I told him I was looking for giant wood spiders to kill for my armour quest.  He tells me he kills them all the time on his way to runnyeye, and then to wait there.<br />
<br />
So, I am sitting there medding, and he comes back with a giant spider, and he tells me to nuke it.  I cast my ignite spell 3 times, then I am out of mana, so I start whacking it.  He then tells me not to meele it, and I told him I was out of mana.  When it was dead, he asked me if I got good exp.  And I told him that I guessed so.<br />
<br />
He then did that 2 more times.  Then I told him thanks, but I had to go.  He said that that was ok that he had to go to PoK to fletch.<br />
<br />
I really did not enjoy that.  When someone says no or no thank you, doesn't it mean just that?</div></div><hr />

(And as a warrior, I'm not sure how a warrior could do it, other than killing the thing after you did half damage.)<br />

I suggest in the future ignoring people begging for heals.</div></div><hr />

As a druid, this is a Sad but Truth.<br />
<br />
When I see someone shouting for a heal, or port, or SoW, I normally ignore it.<br />
<br />
Unless they are standing in front of me, in which case I'll sow them.<br />
<br />
The only exception I sometimes make, is if someone shouts &quot;Please help me, I am diseased and am going to die.  I am at.....&quot;   (Normally heard in Shadow Haven.<br />
<br />
Then I will sometimes load up my Cure Disease, and help them out, Because I know how much it sucks to die from that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morani</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welcome to another &quot;third&quot; of the players on EQ. People like that don't offer to help because they want to be helpful, they do it because they want to feel important or hear someone express gratitude towards them. They are quite annoying but, fortunately, that's about the worst of it you'll get from them. <br />
<br />
If you FEEL like helping someone than have at it. If you don't than don't feel guilty. In case you are not aware of it, there is this wonderful thing called an ignore list. Type &quot;/i &quot; followed by the name of the person and, magically, you no longer hear them. :) Later on, you can take the name off the list if you want to since there is a limit of 100 names that you can put on it at a time. <br />
<br />
I also commend you on refusing the offer to be power leveled. Being PL'd would rob you of valuable learning time right now. The more familiar you are with the game and other character classes and all, the less important the first few levels are. <br />
<br />
<br />
On a COMPLETELY different note, you now have access to a WONDERFUL spell for having some fun: Treeform. Not only is the spell helpful for regenerating hit points (and I've heard it helps with manna to but I don't know) but its FUN too. Basically, when you cast the spell you turn into a tree; you look like one to others and you can't move. The restrictions are that you have to be outdoors and there has to be trees in the zone for the spell to work. You can have some good fun with people when using illusions like that (I'll leave it to you to figure out how and other people who've got some experience with it to relate how they've used it). At level 14 you'll get levitate and casting that on yourself before Treeform can  REALLY confuse people as they run past a floating, bobbing tree.  :D</div></div><hr />
