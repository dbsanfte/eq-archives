<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>archerphate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Prismic die cost about 20pp to make and some say it sells for round 50pp<br />
<br />
My question,  with my brewing round 150 will i get enough of a success rate to be able to sell in bazaar for profit??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, they actually cost about 30p to make each, with no failures.  You will also need some pottery skill.  I don't remember the trivials of the combines, but you can use the formula to determine your average success rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nanndas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I get my Druid to pick up the components. It costs a total of 589pp per stack. Since the last patch I seem to fail more often either in pottery or brewing. I make them in batches of 3 stacks (of finished vials) and have been ending up with 53-54 vials. Or around 33pp each. I haven't made them for a week as there are traders selling them at 40pp each with huge inventories..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A Vial of Prismatic Dye takes 3 combines to make - fire a dye vial, combine prismatic dye and combine the vial and the dye to create a Vial of Prismatic Dye.<br />
<br />
3 combines mean 3 chances to fail.  I would push my pottery to 150 and my brewing to 200 before I got into this market.  Parts are too expensive and competition is too brisk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I found 34 fired dye vials on a merchant last night...lucky me, I succeeded in making the dye and combining it with the vials...total cost ~18pp per   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ironic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">*sigh* I miss the first couple of weeks of LoY, when the dye sold faster than I could make it at 80pp-100pp each.<br />
<br />
-aye</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heh, back in the day...I remember being able to sell dye as fast as I could make it in PoK.  However, that doesn't mean I like the dyes exist  :steamed: <br />
<br />
I used to make the dyed fine plate for weddings and such, it sold well. I wish this dye would have done something like that, despite the amount of drag it would have put on the developers.  However, now that they added aug slots, they could add an aug slot for color for all armors...hmm. WTB a use for old world dyes lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arfyak Reflux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">To make the dye it cost 29p 4g 1s 7c (or 588p 3g 4s for a stack assuming no failures).  Indif faction/122 Cha.</div></div><hr />
