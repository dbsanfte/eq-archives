<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>elyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the jeweling trophy the description says +5% to jewelry.<br />
<br />
I have it at 250 skill, but with the trophy equipped, in the new tradeskill UI it says my skill is 252.<br />
<br />
<br />
It should be 262.5 ...no?<br />
<br />
Is this a bug or a skill cap?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tricsun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">252 is the max skill you can have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tale a little time to read some of the FAQs in the FAQ forum (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=12).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>elyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the answer Tricsun.<br />
<br />
As for Brody:<br />
20/20 hindsight is alway wonderful. When you can say what to do and when to do it, after it has already happened. <br />
Another words, if you know something, then it is easy, and obviously it is simple to you. But if you don't know something then even that simple thing becomes insurmountable.<br />
<br />
Now the fact that my question was already answered and yet you had to throw in your two cents after the fact, is what really irks me.<br />
<br />
<br />
The new tradeskill windows came out like only a month ago while that FAQ was posted 2 years ago. Anyone with common sense would not think, hey let me check old information for new features. On top of that, the titles of the articles don't match. Granted there are similarities, but if I'm searching for &quot;skill cap&quot; and the title is &quot;skill modifying items&quot;, it would not be my first choice to view that article when there are hundreds of them to look through in the forum.<br />
<br />
And speaking of searching, did you ever try to use the search feature? Think about it. Searching for the word &quot;skill&quot; on a tradeSKILL forum. Yeah OKaaaaay.  Try &quot;skill cap&quot; and you'll get<br />
&quot;The search term you specified (cap) is under the minimum word length (4) and therefore will not be found. Please make this term longer. &quot;<br />
In a perfect world searches actually work and you can find exactly what you're looking for on the very first try even if all you have are common words like &quot;the first one&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
And finally, the FAQ page doesn't tell me &quot;What's the fastest way to get from 0-250&quot;, maybe you should write one since you seem to have more than enough time. :steamed:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Flaming is bad mmmkay?<br />
<br />
It's customary to read the FAQ of a site before asking questions, it's common courtesy.  I'm not sure why you would assume they would be out of date, you can easily see the last edited date at the bottom of the post.  They are kept fairly up to date.  <br />
<br />
While doing a search for &quot;cap&quot; is too short a word, you can easily make that a 4 letter word by making it plural.  Search for &quot;skill&quot; and &quot;caps&quot;.  Voila~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Flaming is bad.  Even mildy. <br />
<br />
Which you would know if you'd read the FAQ and the Rules in the Visitor's Corner. <br />
<br />
Brody was neither rude, nor insulting.   You on the other hand, were both. <br />
<br />
Please understand that you could have found the answer yourself without having had to ask at all had you read the FAQs.  Not just in this forum, but in the FAQ Forum too.  All Brody did was point out that you should, in fact, read them. <br />
<br />
Since I work pretty hard to make sure the FAQs are complete and up-to-date, it only makes sense that I would want you to read them. <br />
<br />
Now, please check the anger with the green monster at the front door, settle in, and become part of the community.  If you'd rather hang on to anger, there are other sites which would welcome you.</div></div><hr />
