<br />
Allright, you're doing your shawl quests and discover that you're going to need some skill in fletching. Here's what you need to know to increase your skill quickly and cheaply.<br />
<br />
First, forget about making bows. They're much to expensive to skill up on. We will be making arrows.. CHEAP arrows.<br />
<br />
Now then, arrows are made with 4 basic parts. The point, the shaft, the fletching (vane), and the nock.<br />
<br />
The crucial thing to remember here is that the trivial of the arrow depends on the component which is hardest to work with. You can use the cheapest components available otherwise, in order to keep costs down.<br />
<br />
Here is the list of trivials for components.<br />
<br />
Trivial of 16 (note, these are your basic 4. Substitute one of these with a higher trivial component to raise skill)<br />
bundeled wooden arrow shafts<br />
field point arrowheads<br />
large groove nocks<br />
several round cut fletchings<br />
<br />
Trivial of 36<br />
medium groove nocks<br />
<br />
Trivial of 46<br />
several parabolic cut fletchings<br />
<br />
Trivial 56<br />
small groove nocks<br />
<br />
Trivial 68<br />
bundeled bone arrow shafts<br />
<br />
Trivial 82<br />
several shield cut fletchings<br />
<br />
Trivial 102<br />
hooked arrowheads<br />
<br />
Trivial 122<br />
set of wooden arrow vanes<br />
<br />
Trivial 135<br />
Bundled ceramic arrow shafts<br />
<br />
Trivial 162<br />
Set of bone arrow vanes<br />
<br />
<br />
The 7th shawl's highest Trivial is 168, since fletching is so cheap to improve, you'll probably want to raise your skill a bit higher than that. Be carefull you don't raise your skill over 200 if you're working with steel/ceramic as you will then have to spend 3 AA points to go over 200 in another skill.<br />
<br />
<br />
Trivial 182 ** Silver tips are VERY expensive, but return 10 arrows per combine. You may want to just move on to steel**<br />
silver tipped arrowheads<br />
<br />
Trivial 202 **Steel arrow shafts are cheaper than Ceramic arrow vanes, with the same trivial**<br />
bundled steel arrow shafts<br />
ceramic arrow vanes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">good and quick but check out the fletching fac guide.  i stil dont know if it is worth it to skill on silver tips.  double the amount of arrows to sell but more expensive than the stell shafts and ceramic vanes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zebedi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Good point, I made a couple of changes.<br />
<br />
This is intended to be put on the main fletching &quot;Learn a skill&quot; page. I was a little frustrated while raising the skill on my cleric for the 7th shawl, and this guide is the result (after carefully considering the ballpeen hammer and keyboard option)<br />
<br />
My warrior has 191 fletching from making my own arrows over the last few years. However, that forced me to look at fletching in a totally new way for my cleric, because the needs were different. I was looking to make quality arrows for my warrior because I was going to be using them. My cleric wanted to waste as little money as possible raising the skill.<br />
<br />
I don't care if it's MY guide on the &quot;Learn a skill&quot; page, but I feel a guide in this vein has merit. After all, a level 65 cleric is looking at fletching in a totally different way that a level 10 ranger is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ah. there is a tradeskill ui and guide forum.  not quite teh right name but close.  i posted my guide there.  what do you think of mine.  there is a big difference between my wizard main doing it cause he can and my ranger alt for actual arrows.</div></div><hr />
