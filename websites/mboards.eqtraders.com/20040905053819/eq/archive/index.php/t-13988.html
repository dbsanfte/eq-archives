<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kenamena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try fishing or killing in Natimbi. Also, last night I bought up over 600 fish, crab and cragmeats from the Magus there. Most were 6lbs or higher so I should have enough to GM out baking now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hynid and cragbeast meat are forages in Natimbi (and I think the other zones as well).  Tuna and crab are fished and I have fished them in Abysmal and Natimbi.  Bring your mixing bowl with ya - each of the 4 come in sizes between 1 and 15 pounds.  So if you are foraging and fishing and not converting the meat you will have 60 different stacks of stuff going (in addition to the other 10-15 forages in Natimbi).<br />
<br />
Hynid and Cragbeat meats also drop from mobs of the same name.  Crab can be found in the some of the crab traps that spawn on the floor of the Abysmal Ocean (way down in the dark deep murk).</div></div><hr />
