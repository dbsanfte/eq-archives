<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vile</div><div class="date">01-26-2003, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK Ill try not to be to be too boring here but I just have to post my last skill up run ;-)<br />
<br />
Ok starting skill was 236 and my intelligence was 207 ( yes dumb Ogre and too Lazy to get a KEI too ).<br />
<br />
OK I used the &quot;pull the dialog box off the edge of the screen&quot; method here - Silly games yes but it saves you looking for that elusive skill up after every combine ;-)<br />
<br />
55 Arctic Wyvern Masks<br />
12 Solstice robes - failed the first 4 and then made 8 in a row :(<br />
6 Cobalt drake belts.<br />
<br />
So thats 72 combines...I pulled my dialogue box back up and my skill was 243 !!! THE best run I`ve ever had.<br />
<br />
So does INT really have that much to do with it ? After getting 7 skill ups in 72 combines at 207 INT Im begining to doubt it.</div></div><hr />

I had wisdom of 254 with KEI a while back and got skill ups and successes like crazy. But my guildmate loaned me some stuff that put me well over 255wis with KEI and now i fail alot more and dont get skill ups, period.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sofaltis</div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the method of skill up determination is still unknown...<br />
<br />
Last night I went and did 25 wyvern masks = 1 skillsup<br />
<br />
then I followed up with 7 reinforced hopper masks  = 4 skillups<br />
(including 3 in a row!!!!! I nearly fainted)<br />
<br />
All at 280 wisdom<br />
<br />
So what that means I'm not sure other than I'm still going crazying working on tailoring  :D <br />
<br />
Keep the faith,<br />

Skill was 194, Wisdom 280. I did 116 combines (232 skins, plus mana vials (Bless you, Islaana!), silver wire and patterns).<br />
<br />
30 minutes later: Tailoring skill of 204!<br />
<br />
I never never never dreamed of getting roughly 1 skill up per 11 combines! I had told Islaana I'd be happy with 5 skillups from that attempt!<br />
<br />
I think The Tribunal must have been watching out for me that day :)<br />

<br />
Here's my data:<br />
<br />
Jan 4 .. 104 combines - 11 skill ups (178-189)<br />
Jan 5 .. 14 combines - 2 skill ups (190, 191)<br />
Jan 12 .. 5 combines - 2 skill ups (192, 193)<br />
Jan 12 .. 8 combines - 1 skill up (194)<br />
Jan 12 .. 20 combines - 3 skill ups (195, 196, 197)<br />
Jan 13 .. 24 combines - 2 skill ups (198, 199)<br />
Jan 14 .. 8 combines - 0 skill ups<br />
Jan 14 .. 18 combines - 1 skill up (200)<br />
Jan 14 .. 48 combines - 2 skill ups (201, 202)<br />
Jan 16 .. 20 combines - 1 skill up (203)<br />
Jan 17 .. 10 combines - 1 skill up (204)<br />
Jan 17 .. 28 combines - 0 skill ups<br />
Jan 18 .. 16 combines - 1 skill up (205)<br />
Jan 18 .. 56 combines - 1 skill up (206)<br />
Jan 20 .. 10 combines - 1 skill up (207)<br />
Jan 20 .. 40 combines - 1 skill up (208)<br />
Jan 21 .. 60 combines - 4 skill ups (209-212)<br />
<br />
512 Total Combines.<br />
478 Non-skill ups.<br />
34 Skill ups.<br />
<br />
Correct me if I am wrong on my math, but that's a skill up on every 15th attempt (or 7%).<br />
<br />
This makes me a firm believer in maxing out Wis (and/or Int) as much as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zandoff CK</div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">278 combines of Solstice Robes. Starting skill 215, ending skill 218.  3 skillups after 2 months of collecting materials. 255 wis 255 dex for those interested.<br />
<br />
someone put an arrow through my head before I do something stupid like continuing to tailor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*BANG BANG*<br />
*blows the smoke of her gun tip and mournes the loss of a tailor*<br />
<br />
That is the worst run Ive heard of on solstice robes and that skill level. <br />
My heart bleeds for you since Im an enchanter/tunare lovin druid and making all the pre combine bits needed myself is a big pain in the tush job not to mention a huge expense.<br />
I feel your pain spending 2 month collecting and Im assuming you bought alot of the items &gt;&amp;lt; <br />
Did you have a LOT of success on the actual robes? hence the low skill up?<br />
<br />
<br />
Chin up ..famous last words- It cant get any worse..can it?</div></div><hr />

I keep my wis maxxed, just supersticious /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galadon</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I heard somewhere that the closer to the trivial your skill is, the more likely you are to receive a skill up. Fact or fiction, I tend to believe it- as my skill ups came MUCH more frequently after about 235 skill or so (the 199-215 area was the WORST for me).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magnacor</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also had a great run last night in Tailoring.<br />
<br />
I attempted my first 20 combines on Acrylia studded armor.  Starting skill was 161 thanks to 3 skillups last week on Nightmare silk strings.<br />
<br />
I was successful on 14 acrylia masks and 3 cloaks, with an ending skill of 167 !!!   I could not believe it.  6 skill ups in 20 combines, hehe, reminded me of the old pottery days before they adjusted it  :) <br />
<br />
Maybe I was lucky, but hope the trend continues on my next 20 combines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eumerin</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah!<br />
I did 7 Wu's combines the other night and didn't get a single skill-up!<br />
You guys were stealing all my luck!<br />
 :evil: <br />
<br />
Okay, seriously, while that did happen, I've got enough experience to know it was just a fluke (although I can't help but wonder if it was somehow tied to the fact that the zone went down almost immediately after I did my combines), and the next time I attempt a number of combines, I'll probably have a lot more success.<br />
Grats on the skill-ups for the rest of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zandoff CK</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Out of the 278 combines I succeeded on 32 robes, so about 1 in 9 or 11%.  I used Geerlok until I was down to 200 swatches, then realized I would run out of chains so I equiped my mace again (robes are break even at 850plats on Karana so successful combines are irrelevant).  I did all the hunting/imbuing/combining thru various chars... all mine, thus the 2 months work (just imbuing 900 emeralds takes a LONG time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilantra</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe the difference between your skill and the trivial of the item definitely affects skill ups.  I get skill-ups most often between 10-20 points under the trivial.  This is much more visible at higher difficulties because skilling up is much easier at lower levels.  When GM'ing jc I found that doing combines 10-15 skills above my level, instead of doing the next one above my level, would raise my skill faster and give me slightly more failures.  I also found on Wu's that the closer I got to trivial, the less my skill would go up.  When I switched to a higher level piece, my skill ups would come faster for a little bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xaanru</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The data suggest that int/wis does help, however, for an INDIVIDUAL, the sample size is too small to draw conclusions for the above situation. <br />
<br />
In smithing, it took me 347 combines to go from 199-200 skill. With NO changes in gear, I then went from 200-205 in 40 or so combines.<br />
<br />
RNG= RANDOM number generator.<br />
<br />
A person with MAXXED stats, may still end up averaging 25 combines per skillup, while someone with a 200 wis, might end up with an average of 12.<br />
<br />
However, you are MORE LIKELY to get a skillup with the stat maxxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zandoff CK</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is hope.   Did 6 combines for a guild monk.  <br />
1 for 2 on Black Pantherskin Tunic<br />
1 for 1 on Black Pantherskin Legs<br />
1 for 1 on Black Pantherskin Arms (skillup 219)<br />
1 for 1 on Black Pantherskin Shoulder (skillup 220)<br />
1 for 1 on Black Pantherskin Tunic<br />
<br />
so after 4 skills in 278 combines, I get a 2 for 6.  I could not believe it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pojodan</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 03:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I decided to go for broke and sat down in North Kaladim (Most lagless zone I could get to quickly from PoK) and made the 19 Studded Acrylia masks I had components for (A couple weeks hunting casually in ML got me that and 35 Flawless).  3 skill ups!  I was happy.  Had 215 WIS, so it certainly wasn't maxed.<br />
<br />
I'm horribly hesitant to keep going until getting 10k is no big deal.</div></div><hr />
