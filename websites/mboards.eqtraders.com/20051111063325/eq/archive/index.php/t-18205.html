<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adelhardt</div><div class="date">09-18-2004, 11:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi guys... just completed the quest to allow me to begin the OoW epics. I did not have the original Beastlord epic, so had to do a subquest. Here are the details.<br />
<br />
Talk to Elder Animist Muada. He will (after some dialogue tell you to take your chunk of dense fungal padding, perfect acrylia ore, and (2) gem of the void to Weapons Master Rahoul. Give these items to Rahoul and he will give you some further dialogue. You must give Rahoul 2,000pp and he will give you an adornment (a totem of sorts). He will tell you how to make the totem to give to Muada. You need (2) Ukun Hides, (1) acid wash, the pattern Rahoul gives you, and a regular sewing kit. (Planar sewing kit DOES NOT WORK) Put the 2 ukun hides (unstacked) and the acid wash into a brew barrel and combine. you will get a tanned ukun leather (NO DROP - LORE - MAGIC) put the tanned hide and the pattern into the sewing kit and combine. You will receive tassels. Put the tassels and the adornment in the sewing kit and combine. Give the resulting &quot;Adornment of the Feral&quot; to Elder Animist Muada and he will respond to you as he does to Beastlord's that have the original epic.<br />
<br />
Again, this is a subquest only for those who do NOT have their original Beastlord epic. You do not need to do all of this if you already have the claws. Just hail Elder Animist Muada if you have your claws. :D <br />
<br />
I apologize if this has already been posted.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Leonar 65 Beastlord (Torvonnilous)<br />
<br />
EDIT ~~ Forgot to mention that I don't know what the trivials were, but for reference, my brewing is 250 and my tailoring was 193 at the time of the combines. From the dialogue, it appears that you should have at least 100 in tailoring because if I recall, it was mentioned that you should be a master Tailor (aka - 100+)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">asun nyday</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 10:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even for beastlords who do have the previous epic, there's a step that requires a minimum skill of 100 in tailoring. The combine itself appears to be trivial and nofail at that point, however. We haven't finished figuring out the 1.5 epic yet, so it's a bit early for a complete writeup. Here's a link to progress so far: http://www.beastlords.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=3711<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krokoq</div><div class="date">09-25-2004, 01:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got to Master Brewer in no time (20ish minutes) making this:<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=14691<br />
<br />
All store bought, cheap.  Nothing new to people here I am sure.<br />
<br />
My tailoring is 40ish.  What can I make that can get me to 100 with just store bought or common bazaar items?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
btw, epic 1.5 was solved today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niami DenMother</div><div class="date">09-25-2004, 02:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd love to get some of this onto the site.<br />
<br />
Would it be possible to get right-click information and full names on the various pieces that need tradeskill combines, and on the end results?<br />
<br />
And does anyone feel up to making some sort of writeup of the tradeskill portions for the site?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">asun nyday</div><div class="date">09-26-2004, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Beastlord epic 1.5 has been completed. For those who already have the 1.0 epic, this is the quest up to the only tradeskill bit:<br />
<br />
Shar Vahl - Talk to Elder Animist Muada (roof area of palace) to get the quest. Among other things, he will tell you &quot;you must be a master with your tailoring if you wish to succeed in making this item.&quot;<br />
<br />
Plane of Disease - Pick up small bag ground spawn Roaring Grass (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=57001). Located past locked door of castle in the far left hallway corner after Aramin the Spider. 3 hour respawn.<br />
<br />
Riwwi - Pick up small bag ground spawn Petrified Fangshrub (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=57002). Found in river right after entrance maze at -349, -29.<br />
<br />
Sirens Grotto - Loot Wildspirit Tear (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=57003) from an Ailing Walrus. Can spawn anywhere a walrus/manatee does.<br />
<br />
Gulf of Gunthak - Give 3 unstacked blue diamonds to Savage Lord Hunter (-2644 ,+918) to get Taut Leather Swatch (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=57004). Will eat diamonds if you haven't talked to Muada yet.<br />
<br />
Give all four items to Elder Spiritist Muada, he will hand you back a Plain Animist Helm (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=57005) and a Shiny Sewing Needle (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=57006). Multi-questing is not possible, as the give operation will fail if all four items are not given at once. (I like this new feature a lot better than having quest containers.)<br />
<br />
Combine both items in a sewing kit/loom. It will refuse to combine if you have less than 100 tailoring skill, otherwise appears to be a no-fail combine. The combine results in Helm of the Feral (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=57007), which is an early reward you get to keep. The needle is not returned.<br />
<br />
Tell Muada &quot;I am done&quot; to continue the quest, which is long and non-trivial, requiring a raid force before getting the 1.5 epic: Savage Lords Totem (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=52911).<br />
<br />
www.beastlords.org 1.5 epic forum (http://www.beastlords.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=36) to see more detailed information on all this.<br />
<br />
I hope this is helpful.  Someone else will have to document the 1.0 epic alternative steps, as I didn't do them. The actual 1.0 epic doesn't require tradeskills. Feel free to use this writeup or edit it as you wish.<br />
