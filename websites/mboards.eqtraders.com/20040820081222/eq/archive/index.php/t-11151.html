<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I got tired of all the mess, so I am going to consolidate all the information in the three pages of the DNC list here, probably taking up several posts in the process.  I have added in formatting to make it easier to read and split it into 4 posts so each one is under 10,000 character limit imposed apon this board.<br />
<br />
Please, this post is ONLY for the search for Brodder's Revenge and the DNC lists that are resulting from the search.  <br />
<br />
I figure that the search for Brodder's Revenge is seperate from the search for the Favorite Drink, though no less important. So, it deserves a whole new thread for all the things it ISN'T. SO, without further ado, is the list of things have been tried that haven't worked and how we came up with the ideas in the first place.<br />
<br />
The first reference is attributed to Brodder. I have snipped the parts that aren't about Brodder's Revenge because this post is long enough as it is, written by Kandrak:<br />
<br />
Surprising what you turn up when you google someone. Dunno if these are known or not, likely are. Come from a 3 year old post on EQClerics:<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
*SNIPPED FOR LENGTH (sorry)*<br />
<br />
Brodder's Revenge or Hair of the Dwarf that Bit ye!<br />
Mug Ale, shot scotch/whisky, veggies, snake egg<br />
cask. Good for what ails yah in dah morning. Secondary effect regurgitonic. (I know no effects with alcoholic beverages, maybe shaman could make the activateable one by adding a herb/root and rebottling it- a crossover trade skill requiring this brew)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There is much in the postings about the favorite drink, and another set of clues handed out that again don't really bear much on the recipie Brodder's Revenge. Then Brodder again posts:<br />
<br />
Congrats on confirming the Frothy Frostbite...gnomes everywhere that it's cold are rejoicing.<br />
<br />
What I write here is from my notes, my memory, and conversations I had with Dan Enright/Yakatizma.<br />
<br />
I'll leave it to your enterprising selves to discover what else is missing.<br />
But, working or not, I cannot come right out and say what's what and give out direct answers on many of these things.(by Request of the folks at SOE).<br />
What worked once , may get broken on a whim or an accident.<br />
But I hope in the posts I have sent in so far have provided enough clues.<br />
And yes I do RP heavily...that may cause some confusion, but hey! Isn't this fun?<br />
<br />
If Book II of the Brodder's Diaries were to surface, and the following volumes (SOE has them somewhere), more recipes would come to light that haven't been found yet.<br />
<br />
THOUGH I heavily doubt they went in due to time constraints or got lost.<br />
<br />
But some of SoL's quests are pretty much echos of all the ones I wrote up on request after SoV/RoK. And many I hardly recognize. Most were supposed to be GM events...but became hard coded in a form or another.<br />
<br />
-------- back to character-----<br />
<br />
IN his Iksar skinned over stuffed couch<br />
The Brewer relaxes, no other no matter how skilled bears that title.<br />
His hands itch for the familiar heft and weight of the old mithril battle mug, taken from him so long ago when dwarven ale was once again returned to Kaladim, and Tumpy fined for his actions.<br />
The diaries continue to sell well, and still the gnomes refuse to reprint them in any language but the gnomish they used to improve on his original works.<br />
Dozens and dozens of brewers curse and scream, shout for joy, and drink to oblivion in the worlds about him.<br />
All is right, and yet something is missing.<br />
His hands twitch again, and he absently rubs his nose then snaps his fingers, and reaches for a bowl of pretzels....<br />
The serving wench brings him a tankard flowing over with foam, which soon coats the dwarfs whiskers to either side of his mouth.<br />
With a content sigh, he settles back and watches all the young scions of the art of brewing get to work on one more mystery...<br />
<br />
In his mind he begins to juggle words and prose, though no bard he is, to offer the others a clue to their dilema...but how so can it be, when it is so obsvious, well to a dwarf anyways...some folks never look down except at the others.<br />
<br />
Brodder looks around his overstuffed chair and places his boots on the small table before him, dozens of empty bottles about him, would easily determine what it is he drank in the last couple of hours...was it a couple?<br />
Maybe a day... the piles of debris are quite large indeed.<br />
<br />
Munching a pretzel between swigs of the imported double brew double stout, he recounts all he's tasted, and enjoyed, and begins to wonder, what makes a person enjoy an ale to call it their favorite?<br />
<br />
Time passes, and soon the dwarf is snoring again, dreaming of new brews, of places to go and to test what's brewed there...his dreams are but shadows of what's passed and what's to come...<br />
<br />
I don't know if this is a hint on how to find his recipie or the favorite drink but I can't help but thinking that it has something to do with it. In particular, the DBDS reference might be a clue, is it tradeskill flagged by chance?<br />
<br />
To be continued...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When last we saw our intrepid heroes on &quot;As the Bottle Turns&quot;...<br />
<br />
KyrosKane posts some logical assumptions and observations, also listed is the reply, from the words of Brodder himself:<br />
<br />
Assumptions: <br />
ye know whut dey say bout sumptions doncha? <br />
<br />
Assumption 1: The recipe for Brodder's Revenge is live and in game. The fact that the drink exists (even if only in the emulator) is evidence to support the existence of a recipe -- though it's hardly conclusive. <br />
Yep dat'd be a good assumption.<br />
<br />
Assumption 2: The only relevant anagrams found so far are &quot;new ale&quot; for Lewena and &quot;Dain ale&quot; for Barmaid Adelina (or whatever her name is). All the other anagrams were too far-fetched or incorrectly spelled. <br />
no comment here <br />
<br />
To be continued with the DNC List Proper...<br />
Assumption 3: Brodder's Diaries were introduced in-game during the Velious era. I don't know the exact release date, so this may well be wrong. <br />
written during ROK (pre actually), added with tradeskill enhancement just prior to velious. <br />
<br />
Assumption 4: Assuming that all the recipes in the Diaries are correct, the implication is that they only use Velious-era or earlier ingredients. Thus, anything dropping exclusively from Luclin, PoP, or LoY zones is not part of the recipes. Note that this can easily be disproved if we find that Ice of Velious (used in the Frothy Frostbite) is exclusively a Luclin drop -- apparently it drops in Netherbian Lair, but I don't know if it drops in Velious zones. The name, however, suggests it should. <br />
go check diaries and known recipes on the board here...ye might be surprised. Also Ice of Velious was a Mage rune ingredient long before ROK/SOV. Probably still is. <br />
<br />
<br />
Observations: <br />
<br />
These are based on the assumptions above. <br />
<br />
Observation 1: Most of Brodder's recipes are fairly simple, and don't use really obscure components (Ice of Velious being an exception, but I believe the Frothy Frostbite is the first known drink to require ice of any sort as a component). Side observation: there is also an item called an &quot;Iceball&quot; in game that could conceivably be used in brewing. <br />
look at stormguard rootbeer float... <br />
<br />
Observation 2: Brodder knows the recipe works. Based on what he's said, I'm pretty sure he has tested the recipe. He just can't reveal it to us as it would break a trust with the developers. <br />
ding ! Okay Tom tell our player what he's won today! <br />
<br />
Observation 3: We don't have even a partial recipe for Brodder's Revenge, other than what Brodder himself has posted here. In his original posts, he just says his recipe may have been too risque as he envisioned it. <br />
not true, you've what's in the diaries, and in previous parts of this thread. Note it may be a pepper (hot), or a pepper sauce (tobasco) instead of spices since something similar came about in Luclin neh? Not saying it is, but there could be such a chance of it being true... <br />
<br />
<br />
Observation 4: Brodder has two purposes here. One is to help us solve Lewena's quest. The other is to discover his missing drinks! =) The two may or may not be related; the Frothy Frostbite apparently has nothing to do with the Lewena quest, other than that we found it as part of the search for the new ale. <br />
Maybe///  <br />
<br />
Observation 5: Brodder's Diaries, volume two, was never published in game -- or at least, it hasn't been found. It might be interesting to see if the item even exists in game via the emulator. <br />
I'd be interested too...but then I know things ye don't...sorry <br />
<br />
Observation 6: We now have multiple clues that point at a Velious based solution. This is a Velious era recipe (even if the quest is based in Luclin). We have an anagram of &quot;Dain ale.&quot; We have a hint that we need vodka, and there exists a drink called Kromrif spit vodka (not to mention plain old vodka). <br />
both hot and cold at same time...interesting ideas...might be worth exploring <br />
<br />
Observation 7: We can reasonably conclude, based on Lewena's name and Brodder's clues, that we're looking for a new ale. <br />
would I pull yer leg dat hard? <br />
<br />
Observation 8: We already have ales that use an ale as a component (double-stout double-brewed dwarven ale, or whatever it's called). <br />
ayup...dat wus me idea too <br />
<br />
Observation 9: There is a possible unsolved quest in Thurgadin regarding the souvenir mugs. Four of the bars in Thurg have a bartender who offers to sell you a souvenir mug if you give him cash (it's not bought in a vendor window). The fifth bar has no such mug on offer. The four known souvenir mugs have sequential item numbers (30145 to 30148). Items 30144 and 30149 are not mugs. Allakhazam's has the quest writeup and commentary here: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=929 <br />
interesting indeed <br />
<br />
Observation 10: There is, however, another item called a Nectar of Unity Mug (Item 30169) which identifies as &quot;an almost clean mug that smells of ale&quot; -- the exact same lore as Doogle's Signature Souvenir Mug (Item 30147). Allakhazam's had no information at all about this mug, but Magelo says it has been found in-game at least as early as Feb. 21, 2002. Googling on the name only produced the &quot;Nectar of Unity Brewery and Tavern&quot; in Katta Castellum, which suggests this may be completely irrelevant. However, if it is a Luclin item, that raises interesting questions about when it first appeared -- Luclin was only released in mid-2002, yet the item was live in February 2002. In addition, its item number is very close to the souvenir mugs, which suggests it's from the same era or expansion. <br />
Never heard of it...den again I'm in dah dark allot lately... <br />
<br />
Observation 11: Brodder hints that this quest will reward us with a &quot;mug&quot; when solved. <br />
maybe...dunno, who's got item dev? Ask him <br />
<br />
Observation 12: The only items I could find with &quot;choice&quot; in the name were &quot;Dain's Choice Porter&quot; and &quot;Gladiator Choice Ale&quot;. The only other brews I could find with &quot;dain&quot; in the name are &quot;Coldain Bone Brew&quot;, &quot;Coldain Ice Beer&quot;, and &quot;Flaming Coldain&quot;. None of these items has any lore text. (I checked both Magelo and Lucy for this bit.) <br />
might be simpler den dat matey...den again it is VI we talking bout neh? <br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusions and random ramblings: <br />
<br />
Is it possible we're to take Brodder's hints and apply them in a Velious context? There's a bar in Thurgadin that sells a Dain's Choice Ale (I think that's the name) and a Kromrif Spit Vodka. Could these be part of the solution? <br />
<br />
Could the &quot;mug&quot; that Lewena gives us be the missing souvenir mug from Thurgadin? Is it the Nectar of Unity Mug? If it is, what do we do with all five mugs? And if this is the case, why would the mug have been in-game some five months before Luclin's public release? <br />
<br />
Am I completely missing the mark on something here?<br />
_________________<br />
Hmm Do I have tah say more? Cause I can't... sorry . <br />
<br />
After that, he says only two more little hints for us to go by<br />
Maybe try again with hmm Aviak eggs? dunno...<br />
sigh reread my posts ladd thought it was clear -- NO JUMJUM.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rhyianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yes.  you were missed.  i love reading your information.. while i am still working up my brewing (224 and really really tired of mino heros, must go kill it a few more times so i can stomp on its corpse again), i love having the fun drinks (and food but thats another topic) to hand out on raids.<br />
<br />
besides, growing up next door to all those dwarves.... no wonder my first skill at 200 was AT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gilgam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Might sound a bit off, but Brodder posted in the Baking Forum for Hot Sauce.  Did anyone try a spit/oven for the Hot Sauce combines?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">SO, here are the suspected parts of the Brodder's Revenge:<br />
<br />
Aviak Eggs.  Foraged from Butcherblock Mountains where all the dwarves hang around in.<br />
<br />
Hot Sauce.  This is still undiscovered as yet, but it's widly suspected that this is part of it.<br />
<br />
An Ale.  Don't know exactly which ale it is yet, my guess would be DBDS or Dwarven Ale or something like that.<br />
<br />
Another type of beverage.  This one is suspected to be either Vodka, Kromrif Spirit Vodka, Whisky, or Melted Glacier Whisky.  From comments we've heard, it may be a Vellius era drink.<br />
<br />
Please, correct me if I am wrong, but I think we're getting close to finally discovering the recipie.  Once the Hot Sauce is discovered, we should be able to find Brodder's Revenge without too much difficulty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That sounds ballpark.  We're basically on hold here until we either turn up some in-game (hints, new NPC's, whatever), or someone makes Hot Sauce.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This screams out to me!<br />
<br />
I think we're on the right track with hotsauce, but I haven't seen much focus on the cold side. Perhaps the frothy frostbite, or ice of vellious is an important ingredient.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just registered.  I thought I was a long time ago, but here is my brainstorm.  Hot sauce try either lava rock or earthen temper.  I might not be on the right track, but something our fav limmerick dwarf said teed me off in this direction.  Something along the lines of the best is brewed by the Dwarves.  If I get any more, I will let yas know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Piikaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hmmn, Cultural Brewing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thoughts of cultural tradeskills, besides tailoring/smithing, were squashed at the fan faire, saying they wouldn't happen, at least any time soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>ironic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ok, so I was just looking at the Brodder's Revenge/Lewena's Favorite Drink überpost, and I noticed something in the first post there by Brodder...He said he had suggested the following drink:<br />
<br />
Brodder's Revenge or Hair of the Dwarf that Bit ye!<br />
Mug Ale, shot scotch/whisky, veggies, snake egg<br />
<br />
So, I went  and looked in the New and Improved DNC list for Brodder's Revenge, and I found a whole lot of combine attempts involving melted glacier whisky...but my brief perusal revealed none involving the various whiskys that are available on Luclin, and there's at least 3: Deep Cavern Bourbon, Curled Whisker Whisky, and Victory Toast Whisky.<br />
<br />
Now, if it were me, and if the servers were up (which they're not as I post this), I'd probably start with the Deep Cavern Bourbon, since most women I know who're whisky drinkers at all prefer bourbon to Scotch, Irish, or Canadian whisky, probably because it tends to have a sweeter finish.<br />
<br />
And the only reason I even bring this up, given that Brodder's original post which included the BR recipe predated the release of Luclin by many months, is that let's face it: There was no known use for the drink until Luclin...maybe they didn't put the recipe in until then.  Obviously, if there's data that we have that indicates that all of the ingredients were available during the Velious era, then my post is pointless and just generally a waste of bandwidth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Naeadiene Needsamap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Interesting... over in the hot sauce thread in the baking forum Brodder mentions curling a gnomes whiskers.<br />
<br />
Hmmmm.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If there's hot sauce and a garnish, it sounds like a bloody mary to me.  So a vodka or other clear spirit makes sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Ah've had a &quot;hot saucy gnome lass&quot; curl me whiskers afore har har har...<br />
<br />
 Umm err nevermind...beard humor probably beyond most ye baldies...<br />
<br />
 An Dragon fruit is not as literative as some of ye are taking me writs tah be.<br />
 I can get alliterative, but I'm wise, but not dat clever...cept wif drinks har har har...ohh and getting sumone else to foot dah bar tab fer a session in dah pub...<br />
<br />
  You do the linear break down, figure it out, den run off on tangents two posts later...and I don't mean two posts literally ye wankers...<br />
<br />
  NOW think a bit, make notes, read old posts and don't cull just what ye tink's important...<br />
 Dat original recipe and me hints are still proper...<br />
 Unitl that is, EQ devs alter them.<br />
 I'm sure dey aware of des thread and get a good chuckle outta me posts, but as of yet, I've heard naught from them on this.<br />
<br />
 And Den mum's hiding in some corner so getting her to poke at a dev to check the thread might be a wee bit much ATM...<br />
 I suggest you all peruse kaladim, dwarven haunts, bars all over, even perhaps the seller of my diaries for clues.<br />
 If Lewena has a secret, we all know drunks talk, and bar's are full of gossip, ask others about HER, her secret and a new ale...you might just get a new tale...and a clue.<br />
 Remember she's but a step in a lengthy quest/recipe aparently, and there are other's involved...and not a little detective work.<br />
<br />
 What I can post, I have, what I know, may be outdated, but still, until it's actually discovered, exacted, and confirmed I can't post the entirety of what I know on this...<br />
<br />
 I suspect though that some of my ideas and chats with devs infected some cases in tradeskills, and in others challenged devs to be as created, and in some cases too **** clever to get certain things done...<br />
<br />
 EQ's ever changing, and finding out something this old school is a task and a half...might drive one to drink you know...<br />
<br />
 So until you all start a feedback campaign for more clues, hints, and directionals (In game feedback, emails etc)- who's buying at the den mum's pub?<br />

* Brodder walks to the back of the room next to his overstuffed iksarleather bark-o-lounger, kicks out a pack of snoozing gnomes shooing them off to go &quot;Fix&quot; something, like improving on a screw.<br />
 As the gnomes rush off he pulls out a large leather sack and folds down the sides revealing a fur lined interior.<br />
 The bag now forms a bordered fur lined short fort next to his chair...into this he sprinkles a bottle of concentrated Sticky Cinamon bun scent and places a shiny object inside....<br />
<br />
 &quot;This should catch our Den Mum, yup yup...&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kelandra Kindheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The town crier's paper in Qeynos mentions two drunk dwarves attacked Barkeep Nug Rellash and made off with some ale. If you check out the Lion's Mane Tavern in Qeynos on a sign it has something like &quot;no dwarves allowed.&quot;<br />
<br />
I went to Kaladim and the paper there also has an article about the dwarfs which points the finger at Dirjadak Barbrawler (warrior guildmaster) and Brenthalion Aleslammer and says they were questioned by the King.<br />
<br />
I went around asking questions but couldn't find any new information. Maybe someone else will have better luck with this.<br />
<br />
Also in the first bar when you enter SH from the bazaar there is a NPC named Lolara. When you hail her she asks if you have seen Halorak. If you watch her long enough she will go into the 2nd room of the bar and talk to Halorak and say something about him sleeping in her bed. The only problem is Halorak isn't there and she is just talking to an empty room so I suspect he is bugged and not spawning or not in the game.<br />
<br />
In the first room off the bar there is a sleeping drunk named Slosean who asks if you have seen his short ale. I haven't been able to get him to say anything else and if you give him a short ale he just gives it back saying he doesn't want it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kenamena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Found an interesting thing:<br />
<br />
In the summary, Brodder is quoted as saying:<br />
<br />
Perhaps a mug on a shelf a clue?<br />
Near the lass it may be.<br />
<br />
Well inside Doogle's Drink in Thurgadin, you can clearly see a silver stein above the bar behind Doogle! Perhaps our clue giver is in here?<br />
<br />
spoke with Clifus in the bar:<br />
You say, 'Hail, Clifus'<br />
<br />
Clifus says 'Hey, what do ye think yer lookin' at, ugly? Yeah, that's right, I called ye ugly. You gonna make somethin of it, Dark Elf? Yeah, I didn't think ye would. The last guy that looked at me wrong took me fist right in his mouth, laid him out flat on the ground! He been drinkin' an' all but he woulda been laid out flat even if he hadna been.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'what is lewena's favorite drink?'<br />
<br />
Clifus says 'Oh, I don't know what he was drinkin' but I'm sure it were a woman's drink. Me, I like me a nice big barrel o' fish wine. It don't do much fer yer breath but it'll kick ya in the behind if ye're not careful. Hmmm, boy, I could sure go fer one right now. &lt;cough&gt;'<br />
<br />
Clifus happily accepts the drink and gulps it down. 'Thanks, lad! Ye know, I guess ye're all right'<br />
You gain experience!!<br />
<br />
<br />
There is also an NPC named Horasug that paths between here and The Holy Harbinger. He speaks about the finest Coldain ale in Doogles, but then goes to Holy Harbinger and touts the idea of sobriety and gets run out. He says he is going to go to the dain to tell him his vision from brell about sobriety being the only true path (cycle repeats)<br />
<br />
Horasug says 'Whew, that was a close one!'<br />
Doogle McBanick says 'Hello there Horasug! What brings ya here?'<br />
Horasug says 'I had a sacred vision from Brell himself!'<br />
Doogle McBanick says 'A vision you say? What exactly was this a vision of?'<br />
Horasug thinks for a moment, looking at the roomful of rugged patrons,<br />
Horasug says 'Heh, I saw meself here at Doogie's Drinks partaking of the finest Coldain ale in the land, of course!'<br />
Doogle McBanick says 'Well, you came to the right place, Horasug. A few of these ales will fill you with all the visions you can handle.'<br />
&lt;RUNS TO HOLY HARBINGER&gt;<br />
Horasug says 'My beloved bretheren! Hear me now, I have seen a sacred vision...'<br />
Rumagur says 'Hey Fronden, I want a double of whatever you've been serving him!'<br />
Horasug says 'In my vision, Brell himself spoke to me! He indicated that the path to true enlightenment could only be found through sobriety. Substances such as alcohol only serve to cloud the mind and keep us from our true destiny!'<br />
Saramor says 'Blasphemer!'<br />
Loremaster Fronden raises an eyebrow at Horasug.<br />
Horasug says 'Mock me if you will brothers, I am off to seek audience with the Dain where I will convince him of the evils of liquor. I am sure he will have our taverns serving only water and juice by day's end.'<br />
Saramor says 'Get him boys!'<br />
Jorumin says 'Over my dead body!'<br />
Saramor says 'Well, don't ya just keep us in suspense now. What in the world was it?'<br />
Loremaster Fronden says 'So I was polishing up the bar the other day when in hops this piece of rope and says, 'I'll take a bottle of Frostreaver's Frozen Vodka.' I look at him and I says, 'We don't serve no ropes here, now beat it!' Hehe. . .'<br />
Horasug says 'Uh oh'<br />

Missing it may be, but der it is...<br />
I'm sure it nuttin wif a fizz...   NO CORK/CASK?<br />
In name it was...Cold n Blue...   <br />
Gnomish antifreeze it could be too  FROSTBITE - Refered to by Brodder here: http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=8960 (Would look like a frosty bottle with a bluish tinted liquid in it-think cabilis<br />
pale ale, but not pink, but light bluish in same bottle)<br />
<br />
Spiced ale never seen?<br />
Brodder's Revenge?<br />
Test of Hate-elven delight?<br />
Quested too hard they say...<br />
Many groaned in dismay.<br />
<br />
Perhaps a mug on a shelf a clue?   THE MUG ABOVE DOOGLE?<br />
Near the lass it may be.<br />
Catnip tea and ale?<br />
Ah'd shiver hard let me tell you.<br />
<br />
Sumtin to warm the soul    COLDAIN HEATER?<br />
maybe...<br />
The clue in a name could be...<br />
The search maddens them all...<br />
But it's not far from that hall...<br />
<br />
My bags are full, and halflings distracted...<br />
Jumjum I'd never consume<br />
Nor the juice of a legume...<br />
But with vodka, and egg and spices concoted...   VODKA = Frostreaver's Frozen Vodka mentioned in Harbinger's? Eggs = Aviak Egg Oil, Spices = Hot Sauce (still unsolved)<br />
YOur revenge might be cured after all...<br />
<br />
I'll be watching and smiling, <br />
ever perservere.<br />
If ye hear a belch from below...<br />

I'm still thinking of more, tumpy tonics may be an important ingredient....tonic is also a medication so sort of fits into the whole purpose of Brodder's Revenge... this is pure speculation<br />

Assumption 3: Brodder's Diaries were introduced in-game during the Velious era. I don't know the exact release date, so this may well be wrong. <br />

Brodder's Response: written during ROK (pre actually), added with tradeskill enhancement just prior to velious. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Kenamena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">For the vodka Brodder is quoted:<br />
<br />
The Drakes of Steamfont tend to rest neat some fo the hotter steamvents in that land. There they shed their old skins, on this grows a lichen of properties unsurpassed in all of Norrath.<br />
Collecting this lichen, some water and a clay pot I joked that this would combine to make a potable alcohol of unusual flavots. It did indeed, and to Catbik's distaste proved much more palatable than his favored gnomish spirits, and nearly as smooth as some of the aged Vodkas I've tasted. To keep the Gnomes happy I named this Gnomish Cleaning Fluid recipe as it resulted in two fluids. The pot itself decanted and filtered into a bottle provided a small potable beverage that I enjoyed, but the remains in the pot proved, once aged, that it'd make a great stripper and cleanser.<br />
A LICHEN COVERED DRAKE SCALE found near steam vents, MEDIUM CLAY JAR, WATER FLASK, and a BOTTLE, result in SUPERIOR LICHEN SPIRITS, and a pot of cleaning paste.<br />
<br />
Perhaps Superior Lichen Spirits are used instead of vodka? So perhaps its Superior Lichen spirits, Avaiak Egg Oil and Spices?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Kenamena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Rather than randomly guessing at the recipie, I am following Brodder's comments about asking around the bars. Clifus in Doogle's mentions who ever he faught was drinking a woman's brew (lewenas??).<br />
<br />
Pythic Urson in the Velium Keg, when asked &quot;What ale?&quot; or &quot;What new Ale?&quot; responds:<br />
<br />
It's a fine Coldain ale. Good for quenchin yer thirst after a hard day of minin. The ales name doesn't matter cause ya wouldnt be able to hold it down anyways. har har<br />

UPDATE: spent more time talking to him, he eventually talks about there used to be a cleaning mixture to clean the crud off his boots - but they cant get it anymore since they dont have warriors to go to the far off places. Spoke of Velium Dust, Mud and other stuff lying around. Couldnt get em any furter.</div></div><hr />

 Hmm maybe a use for the Gnomish Cleaning paste part of the superior gnomish spirits??<br />

<br />
The pot itself decanted and filtered into a bottle provided a small potable beverage that I enjoyed, but the remains in the pot proved, once aged, that it'd make a great stripper and cleanser.<br />
<br />
<br />
Means the paste needs to be decanted and put into a bottle? perhaps the paste is not the end product. Any ideas on how to decant something?</div></div><hr />

There is a drovlarg in the bar - he is the only NPC that will respond to any kind of hail. He makes reference to his looks being deceiving. Not sure if there is anything there. <br />
<br />
Just sitting outside Kaladim reading the diaries again.<br />

Wonder if there is a quest in Ak'Anon or somewhere far away from Thurg that gets up a cleaning mixture the Velium Keg guy is after?</div></div><hr />

http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2054<br />
<br />
he says <br />
<br />
Gnomish Pirate Grog (Catbik Tinkerton's Cureall)- recipe may have been too funny and risque for EQ...think I made the devs I sent it to spew coffee and mt dew on their computers...<br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds to me perhaps the gnomes he refers to are the Pirates in Ice Clad.<br />
<br />
Not sure why, but he keeps referring to his mug  over and over again &quot;BUT I do know I want my Brell's battlemug back!!!&quot; and in his signature. Not sure if this is related to the souvenir mugs in Thurg or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>QuteCleric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Well it's not directly related to Brodder's Revenge and probably has little to do with it, after all, he did specifically say he didn't think it made it into the game...(btw there are gnomish pirates in gunthak etc as well)<br />

The battlemug is probably either flavor text or hinting at the possible reward *shrug*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Kenamena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Hmmm, interesting statement regarding the paste and cleaning mixture:<br />
<br />
Note- Gnomish beggars, and others of that ilk seem to be immune to the removal properties of Gnomish cleaning paste.<br />
But our laboratories are working on a proper combination of gnomish fireworks, telescopes, collapsing tubes, gnomsih cleaning paste and our super sekret HIgh Explosives...distilled by Brodder FoamyMugs and Catbik Tinkerton themselves... Dwarven Liquid Mining Juice won't be fore the Mines anymore...we hope the cleaning paste provides a more stable matrix for the DLMJ-12 produced in a back room of the mines of Kaladim.<br />

As seen here: http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2118<br />
