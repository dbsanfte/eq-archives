I saw this on a trader in the bazaar this morning for 300p.  I wasn't sure if you still needed it/needed it bad enough to pay that much for ONE word, so I left it be and came to work.   :( <br />
<br />
I've also got a handful of the words and runes from your list (and a few goodies for you, too, Mother).  Nothing earth shattering, mind you, but enough to make it worth giving me a shout next time you pass me in transit.</div></div><hr />

I failed the first combine at 199 with geerlock (rng was not nice) so I'll reupdate my list here....<br />

Went out and got L61 bought research to 200. The spells I'm researching are not trivial at 200.  <br />
<br />
I also have some more runes/words then are on that list for trade.<br />

Euell is carrying a nice assortment of goodies for you from the original list  - basically all robe swatch supplies, iirc.<br />
<br />
Will be taking a trip into LFay after I clear his slots to beat some more orcs into shape, so I should have a bunch of berries soon, as well.<br />
