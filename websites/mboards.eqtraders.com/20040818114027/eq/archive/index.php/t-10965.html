<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've seen many guides and posts indicating Ceramic Vanes cost 2.7pp per.  I finished the last of the storebought fletching this weekend and was paying closer to 3.2pp, even though I had indiff faction and 114 charisma when buying.<br />
<br />
Did they change the price?  Can anyone else confirm?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Have not looked to see what the price of these things is, not since they nerfed the sellbacks on fletching.  However, increasing the cost to buy the materials (such as the ceramic vane) would certainly be part and parcel of the process for making it impossible to gain plat while skilling.  Remember that the ceramic vanes, combines with the 5 copper other parts, were actually fairly profitable for the skiller, before the nerf.  Raising the cost to buy them, and lowering the sellback of arrows made with them would definately be in line with making it a plat sink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Healblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I noticed this as well.<br />
<br />
I put more information on what exactly I saw in a post in the &quot;Pricing Reporting&quot; forum (I hope that was the right place)<br />
<br />
~Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />

<br />
For example, Shar Vahl is usually a poor place to purchase, compared to other cities.<br />
<br />
It would be interesting to do a study sometime, and cross reference everything, but that is more work than this poor l'il rogue is willing to undertake...<br />
