My level 30 dwarf berserker is dressed mainly in small gothic ringmail.  Several of those pieces have 2 slots of the following types:<br />
<br />
Slot 1, type 7<br />
Slot 2, type 1<br />
<br />
I know the boots and mask are like this.<br />
Look familiar? (This has been recenty changed btw, they used to be reversed.) Anyhow, I recently got 2 dropped ldon augs , the kind that fit into all slots - nothing special, but all augs are nice, after all.  Unfortunately, they both still went in the type 1 slot, even though it's listed as Slot 2!  :eek: :mad: :steamed:. (Yes, I wasn't paying attention.)  I suspect that this is wrong with a LOT more pieces of equipment.  I have /bugged this, but we all know the great turnaround with bug reports :rolleyes:.  <br />
<br />
It's not a major deal for me; it's unlikely I'll buy/get lots of type 1 augs before I upgrade anyhow.  But it could be a major issue for someone with better augs that s/he really doesn't want to lose to a solvent - some of those +7 augs, for example.  So don't go auging your multiple slot stuff with those any slot augs unless you don't care where they land.<br />

I'm just glad I didn't try to aug my pants.</div></div><hr />
