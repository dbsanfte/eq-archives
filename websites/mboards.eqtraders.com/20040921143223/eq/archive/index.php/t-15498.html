<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Leto Eu`Acumen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know the subject has been beaten into the earth and I have searched the forums over and over and found some things but need to ask the question again myself.<br />
<br />
I am a level 65 Dwarven Cleric (Brell) at 215 Smithing Skill (without a % mod).   I have some plat I can put into the skill but it is very limited.   I felt that because I am generally broke all the time that Shadowscreem armor was an ideal path for me.<br />
<br />
So I spent 2 days gathering up 204 Shreiking Substances, 214 Wailing Substances and well over 400 Swirling Shadows....took some doing. ....So 204 combine attempts, should get some progress right?  Well I am averaging 1 skill imp per 100 attempts from it.  It took me days to get all that and I'm a little ticked off honestly, and a little at a loss as to what to do next.<br />
<br />
I am bound and determined to get 250 smithing skill but I cringe at the idea of spending 12 hours per day every day farming components for over a month just to get there 1 skill imp per 100 attempts.  That is plain rediculas.  (I was doing shadowscreem bracers btw trivial at 228 btw not boots trivial at 248)<br />
<br />
......................<br />
<br />
Anyway my situation is this....I am totally solo, I have no 2nd box and no one in their right mind wants to do hundreds of hours of tradeskill farming for someone else, so I am on my own.  Acrylia farming doesn't sound like a good idea and getting Earthen Tempers is incredable slow (for me at least) (Nevermind the blue diamonds or an Encahnter to enchant stacks of bricks for hours....) doesn't sound appealing at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any advice about what I should do at this point to advance?  Or am I just stuck with hundreds and hundreds of hours farming Shadowscreem at 100 attempts per skill imp.<br />
<br />
100 wailing substances, 100 shreiking substances and 200 swirling shadows solo farmed for one single skill imp is just unreasonable.<br />
<br />
I have been neglecting the grouping needs of some people in my guild to put the time into this and I can't keep that up forever.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Any help or advice is very very much appreciated....thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaysha Soulsinger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd say you have been very unlucky. The RNG seems to have gotten the better of you. My personal skillup rate was a lot better, around 1 skillup per 20 attempts. Sure, I had streaks of 40+ attempts per skillup, but I also had once or twice 3 skillups in 20 combines. It's a matter of luck, really.<br />
<br />
If anything, it will get better above 210-ish. My own hells have been in the 180-210 range and I have gotten 5 skills above 215 now, so I now what I am talking about. Of those, I have 3 at 250 and they all increased their skillup rate in the 215-250 range (smithing - using Shadowscream Steel - is one of them). I'd say that you're at the border of where it was hard; what's ahead is better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Enchanted Velium Bits: If you are farming SS ingredients, farm Plat and Velium. <br />
<br />
Cost: Piece of Velium (Free if farmed), Coldain Velium Temper (6pp ish), File (one off small cost if you don't have it already), Spell: Enchant Velium (12pp ish). <br />
<br />
so 18pp per combine but only one farmed ingredient.<br />
<br />
<br />
LDoN armour: Again farm plat and buy temper ingredients from bazaar or do LDoNs all day long. Slightly more expensive than EVB but you may be able to sell off your wares in Bazaar. <br />
<br />
<br />
Both of these go up to 222. <br />
<br />
From there, go back to SS. I'm doing a mix of Freeport armour (non BD cultral), Tae Ew, Qeynos BD Cultral and anything else I can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tower</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You dont need a file for EVB, only 2 velium pieces, CVT and the spell enchant velium</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Leto Eu`Acumen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is an LDoN Armor recipie that goes to 222 ?   Highest I found was for BP's that goes to 212.<br />
<br />
Is the RNG server side or client side?   if it's client side I'm going to throw this POS computer out the window :steamed:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">RNG is server side.<br />
<br />
You can either deal with farming shadowscream or quit smithing.<br />
<br />
Me, I quit smithing, but I brought it back up again to try and make some DPR bracers for a friend of mine.<br />
<br />
I've averaging better than 1/20 for skill ups (from 212 to 219) with 280 STR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aamdor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Leto,<br />
<br />
Reread your post I did not see your WIS/INT/STR stats.  At level 65 you should be able to get one of them to 355; have you done that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zolina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Try getting your Wis or Str maxed, you should get higher skill-up rate than 1 in 100.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The random number generator can certainly be a source of intense frustration. I usually make batches of 60 at a time. Twice I did 2 batches with zero skill ups (not in a row). Usually I get one or 2 skill ups. A couple of weeks ago I got 4 skill ups in 55 combines. So it does swing the other way.<br />
<br />
I make enchanted velium bits from 218 - 222. It was a nice break frmo shadowscream. At 222 I went back to Shadowscream though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh, as mentioned, at 65, you should be getting either STR or WIS or both up to 355 if possible!<br />
<br />
I had some rough skill levels myself (sitting at 221 and farming for SS also)<br />
<br />
It seemed that at about 217 my skill ups started coming faster, and almost everyone I've ever talked to said their skill up rate improved when they topped 220.<br />
<br />
Keep at it! Your skill up rate will improve! the RNG is terribly fickle, but you'll get there.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frerin the Smith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hit the merchants in Steamfont for Mercury and Lava rocks should be available cheap in the bazaar. <br />
<br />
Get a stack of earthen tempers made and then get a stack of rubies and imbue them.<br />
<br />
Forget the enchanter, just go to Kaladim and make a stack of folded sheets of brellium and a stack of brellium rings.<br />
<br />
Then go make imbued brellium collars since they trivial somewhere above 218.<br />
<br />
Rubies are a bit on the pricey side, but you can farm for cash for 2 hours and buy a stack easily.  A lot less frustrating than shadowscream and you don't need an enchanter.  Plus, depending on how much the imbued brellium vendors for, you might not be losing that much plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Since it has been (roughly) misstated twice in this thread, stat caps:<br />
<br />
255 - up to level 60<br />
+5 - each level over 60<br />
+5 - each level of planar power (2 aa each level - one rank can be purchased per level over 60)<br />
+10 - each level of Innate enlightenment (3 aa each level - one rank can be purchased per level over 60 - priests and int casters only)<br />
<br />
This gives caps as follows:<br />
level 61:<br />
260 (default)<br />
265 (1 level of planar power - cost 2AA)<br />
275 (1 level of planar power and innate enlightenment - cost 5 AA)<br />
<br />
level 65:<br />
280 (default)<br />
305 (5 levels of planar power - cost 10AA)<br />
355 (5 level of planar power and innate enlightenment - cost 25 AA)<br />
<br />
Of course, you also need to get the gear to get your stats capped once you buy the AA.</div></div><hr />

The RNG is a cruel mistress/master!<br />
<br />
I think you've gotten some excellent suggestions here so far, especially <br />
<br />
1)  the Enchanted velium bits - Trivial 222<br />
<br />
2 small pieces of velium + 1 Coldain Velium Temper + 1 spell: enchant velium = lore, no drop enchanted velium bit.<br />
<br />
You can buy CVT and the spell Enchant Velium in the same shop in Thurgadin.  If you're KoS, make a mule, have a friend escort it to Thurg, and use the shared bank slots.<br />
<br />
I would add this option, once you get to 220 and have the necessary flags.<br />
<br />
2)  Aid Grimel - Breastplate Cleansing - Trivial 227<br />
<br />
You need to have 220 skill, Bertoxxulous AND rescuing Mylik and Adier done in order to use this as a skill up path.  If you do this, you can do the cleansing step, and not the whole thing, and do it repeatedly.<br />
<br />
You do the quest part way, and then redo it again.  It involves running, but is relatively cheap, and perhaps less irritating than pharming.<br />
<br />
Start by telling Aid Grimel, &quot;I am well versed in the art of smithing.&quot;  He'll ask you to cleans a filthy bp he gives you and more.  You only need to worry about that step. <br />
<br />
Brew:  3 unstacked Celestial Essence + Jar of Acid = Acid Wash (stackable, not lore)<br />
<br />
Combine Adic Wash and the Filthy BP he gives you in a planar forge.  Rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
3)  After 227, you have the options others have already helpfully discussed.  <br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Leto Eu`Acumen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My apologies for leaving out my charicters stats....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Unbuffed I have 273 STR (I'm a cleric, cut me some slack) with any raid buffs that is 305 of course.<br />
<br />
My wisdom is capped at 355 of course....neverminding the wis cap I have like 587 wis buffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Samoht</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I hate the RNG!<br />
<br />
I got no skill up doing 120 combines of EVB at 213.<br />
Then I did 80 combines of SS and got 2 points.<br />
<br />
I cant wait to hit 240.  Then I can actually go xp! :P</div></div><hr />
