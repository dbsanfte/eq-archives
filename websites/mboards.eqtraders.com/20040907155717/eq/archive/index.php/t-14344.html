I know a lot of people including me after GoD launch could still see particle effects and target rings but spell effects vanished.  The settings on the Options/Display UI panel ingame did nothing.  I know I tried all I could think of, including making sure I had latest Dx and video drivers.  Some people could see spells, some couldn't, and we couldn't make sense of it.<br />
<br />
turns out that the obsolete command...<br />
<br />
/showspelleffects on<br />
<br />
was reset by GoD.  Execution of that command and they all came back on.   This simple fix...the person in my guild (Saandman) who suggested it got some serious wootage as about half my guild got their spell effects back.  That command was not even supposed to be needed with the new UI settings on the Options panel.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!  Didn't want to put it anywhere else since not tradeskill related.</div></div><hr />
