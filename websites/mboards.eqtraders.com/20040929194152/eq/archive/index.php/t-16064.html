<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SalTheBard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Idol of Erollisi Marr is the following combine:<br />
<br />
celestial essence, gold bar, idol sketch, imbued rose quartz, large block of magic clay, sculpting tools, vial of distilled mana, water flask<br />
<br />
Besides the imbuing is there some reason why these combines aren't done up to high level Pottery?  No item in this combine is very expensive, the most PITA part woudl be finding people to enchant everything and making the CE's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Obina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What you show is the golden idol.  The non golden ones are better still.  These are often used as a skill up path.  The difficulty as you point out is finding a cleric of E Marr.  Some of the other lower cost gems work out equally well. (for non golden idols)<br />
<br />
The golden idol of E Marr does not really make economic sense.  Note the distilled mana takes 2 sapphire so costs 210pp+. So with this basis. the extra cost of the emerald for Tunare is small and is easily made up via resale.<br />
<br />
The reason not use this path (regular idol of E Marr)is the full lack of resale.  I choose to use Golden Idol of Tunare and Star Ruby Encrusted Stein path.  On my server, I was able to make a profit as I skilled up in Pottery.  I still make these two items today. Although I am skilled in 4 trade skills plus fishing, I find pottery to be my most reliable and steady income.  Which is amazing considering that though the skill up path is fairly hard, the materials are all available without horrible farming.<br />
<br />
Net, if you want to skill up for pleasure or Aid Grimel and cant be bothered selling stuff in Bazaar, then regular idol of E Marr is super.  If you want to maximize profit as you go, GIoT and SRES may be better depending on your server.</div></div><hr />

I think Obina hit the nail on the head.  And you're talking about hundreds of combines, so the cost for the Distilled Mana and the time it takes to imbue hundreds of gems and do the distills is not trivial.<br />
<br />
I did my skillups on Steins because I had a JC'er who could do the encrusting, and at the time, they had a very reasonable resale value.  <br />
<br />
I agree with Obina that you are more likely going to see turnover on the GiT's because they are used in the Solstice Earring quest, and are a decent item for mid-level Wood Elf druids, of which there are plenty.  The market for the E.Marr idols is much more limited.  While you might sell a few, you definitely won't sell through your stock if you skill up on them the whole way.<br />
<br />
If you aren't concerned with plat at all, then this won't be an issue.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cubwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did the regular Idol of Errollisi Marr from 200-250, mostly for simplicity's sake. Of all the ingredients, the only really expensive part was the clear mana (emerald), which I enchanted myself. I also imbued the star rose quartz myself. Total cost was about 28k, with no resale, however. I recouped my cost in about 6 weeks selling various idols, port items, and steins.<br />
<br />
If I were to start another potter, I'd definitely do it again the same way. (though I loathe imbuing gems... and perish the thought of actually leveling my 32 imbue slave up to 45 for KEI!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SalTheBard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">picked the combine because it just happened to be the one I was looking at.  I never considered it for an actual skill up path, but thank you all very much for your input.  Pottery is the next skill I&quot;m going after to GM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaaba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you have a way to get plains pebbles (foraging = free), the unimbued karana idol is pretty cheap as a skill up path.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>papyscott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did this path as well from 222 to 245.  <br />
<br />
I did idol of rodcet nife since I could imbue my own gems (opals).  Yeah it added 10pp to the cost over emarr, but the simplicity of imbuing your own gems was worth it for me.<br />
<br />
clear mana and magic clay were readily available in the Vaz. Baz.<br />
