<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daegul Mistweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've hunted in several of the zones listed on the droplist above, but haven't had any luck finding them personally.  Any specific MOBs/camps that seem to have this?  Also, out of curiosity, is this the &quot;rare component&quot; of RGC or is Yaeth's 73R?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the drop list is what is known, and yes,  yae's 73 is rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daegul Mistweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, it is kown, but it it not specific; a zone is a rather large place to look for something like that, a specific camp or MOB is actually pretty helpfull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bregalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We got 2 Yaeth 73 rigft drops at planks in CT, but I am yet to see a single copy of Apparition anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>FeilynnRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">what the heck are the planks? The sewers? Sorry oldschool here never heard of that camp but til now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Daegul Mistweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Planks are the sewers; specifically the 1st room (round with wooden planks in a &quot;+&quot; shape above the water) where the swirling red mass can pop, is a good source of Yaeth's 73R.<br />
<br />
On Apparition, still no luck; just spent an evening clearing entry area MOBs and named in Hate with no sightings, and Hate is annother listed zone.  No vampire essence or decrepit hide, and the 4 named killed dropped wands...BLARGH!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>FeilynnRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't worry, you'll get it! Keep trying! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>finnlander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Looted Apparition in Veksar.  Can't remember the mob that dropped it though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Daegul Mistweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Veskar rumors have Apparition dropping in the Highborn area.  From what I've read this is the highest level portion of the zone.  <br />
<br />
Now, oddly, Yaeth's 73R drops from &quot;a pool of slime&quot;s in CT, which are not the highest level in the zone, being only level 57; however, out of the 2 common camps in the zone, slimes are the highest level.  Are the rarer pages such as Yaeth's 73R dropping more frequently from higher level MOBs in the zone, thus giving the perception that the specific rares drop from specific camps?<br />
Is it simply because the slimes are the most commonly camped and rarity of the page lessens as you kill higher level MOBs in the zone; as opposed to (in CT) the entry lizards which are probably the only other things in the zone regularly camped (even to the point of being camped moreso that the slimes)?  <br />
<br />
Theories?  Experiences?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sylphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yaeth's 73R is intended to be used to research a level 57 enchanter spell.  So it makes sense it would drop from level 57 mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rendael Brigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">LDON seems to have gimped RGC.<br />
<br />
There are now several copies of Apparition for sale in the bazaar right now for as little as 10k.<br />
<br />
There is the first copy of RGC I have ever seen for sale at 195k.<br />
<br />
I sold one copy before LDON at 200k.<br />
<br />
I then read that RGC would be adventure merchant buyable.<br />
<br />
Yet another &quot;progression&quot; path made simple by the developers.<br />
RGC was a hard to obtain spell, quite necessary for efficient Luclin and PoP kills.<br />
<br />
Not anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Wow... still 10k on your server?<br />
<br />
I hit LDoN the first few hours after release. Sold 3 copies of Apparition for 8k. Sold 2 more the next day for 2500. Now they are for sale in bazzar for under 500pp.<br />
<br />
They are that common.<br />
<br />
Also, yes RGC is available for purchase with adventure points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wandazula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Anyone see the yaeth's page dropping in ldon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grimlach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Negative, have not seen any yaeth 73 either side from ldon. Though, I have seen about 8 apparitions in normal difficulty lvl 65 party adventures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bregalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Apparition now drops in huge quantity - I often see 1-2 of them drop on almost every Takish mission.  Yaeth 73 right is still VERY rare.<br />
<br />
RGC is 800 points from Takish, which means 16 lvl 65 missions there.  I expect RGC to come down in price some in the future, as people rack up the points, but I think the spell is still gonna sell for a lot.   A lot of folks will rather save their points towards some nice gear or augment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Maximusfloyd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">At least 10 copies of Apparation on sale for 50p ea or less on MT server. 73 right still very rare. Only place I've seen it drop is VT and CT.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">* Research drops are pretty generic and not really zone-specific. Parts that drop off of a mob of a given level should drop off of mobs of that same level in other zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">That used to be true but not any longer.<br />
<br />
Some of the LoY components are very zone specific.<br />
I have never seen anyone get yaeth's 73r anywhere other than Cazic Thule in the sewers, or Vex Thal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ahh.. please send a note to the Dev at the tradeskill panel who just this last weekend specifically stated that's how it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yes and we all know how SOE always tells the perfect truth and NEVER gets ANYTHING wrong.<br />
<br />
I challenge you to find yaeth's 73R from anywhere other than the 2 listed locations.<br />
<br />
Go ahead... prove me wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Already done.. i've pulled one from ct entrance, and one from nadox.  Necro friend pulled one from veksars.  Another friend pulled one from chardok b.<br />

[edited for content]<br />
<br />
It's very simply.. when people come here asking for where this that or the other piece drops.. the answer is:<br />
<br />
* Research drops are pretty generic and not really zone-specific. Parts that drop off of a mob of a given level should drop off of mobs of that same level in other zones.<br />
<br />
This comes directly from the devs at sony, as many can attest..  Your opinion that they are wrong, lying, or have no knowledge of what they're doing is.. your opinion, not fact.  Most people here try to give people asking questions the best information possibly so as not to waste their time.  Answeres that come directly from the devs are seen as close to fact as possible, unless there is some obvious evidence to the contrary.  In this case, there is no evidence to the contrary.<br />
<br />
The arguement that &quot;it doesn't exist because i haven't seen it&quot; is a poor arguement.  You've never seen oxygen either, but you do breath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yaeth's 73r drops off mobs in CT sewers that con light blue to me.<br />
<br />
Why is it so rare then?  There must be thousands of mobs in tens of zones that are the same level but none of them drop it.<br />
<br />
Or are we all just horribly horribly unlucky?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Also explain how the same component can drop from light blue cons in one zone and much higher level mobs in another zone and still have the statement be true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Maybe you should ask a dev at the next fan fair.<br />
<br />
If you take 170 items, and have them drop 1 time in 50 (a very wishfull drop rate) or so mobs... in 8500 mobs you should (given you never duplicate a single drop), have each of those drop... assuming all the mobs drop the same items.<br />
<br />
Have you farmed 8500 (minimum) mobs from each camp spot, in every zone, where new research items drop?  And, have you logged and posted those drops?<br />
<br />
You started with &quot;only&quot; 2 spots that could drop that page... i added 4 more... your &quot;fact&quot;, has already been proven wrong.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what huge hostility you have for the devs, and while i admit they occasionaly have made mistakes, the fact they gave an open answer to try to help people out.. kinda makes me wonder.<br />
<br />
I would think, and yes it's my personal opinion, that each specific level of mob doesn't have an exclusive drop table... it would seem to me that gouping mobs in sections of 2-4 levels would take up a whole lot less room in their databases.<br />
<br />
It's also quite possible that the same item used to make a level 51 spell, and a level 59 spell may be on more than one table.<br />
<br />
The question was asked to the devs.. are they random, or do they drop in specific spots.... the devs responded.. if you want to belive they're all lying to you.. well, that's certainly your choice.  If someone new comes to these boards and asks, i'm going to tell them what the devs said... that is the best information we have, and their is no evidence that it's wrong.</div></div><hr />
