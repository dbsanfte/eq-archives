Any idea why the Crab Graphics in Abysmal Sea make the Crabs look like Fishing Grubs?<br />
I mean the Fishing Grubs look like real grubs......but why must the Crabs look identical to the Grubs?<br />
Sony can make graphics for Crabs to look like Crabs (ie-The hermit crabs you forage in Naddox).<br />
I mean they did a good job with Gunthak Mackeral and they have the markings of real Mackeral and you can distinguish the Mackeral from Fresh Fish.<br />
But why the horrendous Crab graphics?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well I don't know about you but the fishing grub graphics never looked like fishing grubs to me - they look like two shrimp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naeadiene Needsamap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hehe there are many graphics that make me say hmmm.<br />
<br />
I think grubs look like shrimp too.  Maybe the crab thing is just a data entry error, wrong code for the icon?  <br />
<br />
I really like being able to forage and fish so many fun treats though :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep...I love Fishing the best.....I mean standing on that landing platform on the boat in Abysmal Sea and pulling in one Tuna after the other is like working a tuna boat. The ocean graphics are nice making you feel like you really are in the middle of the ocean, i am quite pleased with that part.<br />
I wish the fish we caught looked like the dead fishing hanging on the line on the platform. Those look realistic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naedea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And this (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=14768) looks nothing like a hoof.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I sure am glad the graphic for most of the things foragers drop on the ground look like neat little bundles and not that.  Ewww.<br />
<br />
I already get kidded about my little druid droppings (so of course I switch to wolf form).</div></div><hr />
