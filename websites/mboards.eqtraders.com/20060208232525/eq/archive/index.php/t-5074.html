<br />
I've been working on putting together the components for Luminant Heraldic Armor.  I've talked with several GM Human Smiths hoping to strike a deal for the final combines, but I have encountered one of three things:<br />
<br />
1) Price of  roughly 5k per ring used to do the combine (ie 5k for a bracer, 10k for a girdle, 15k for a breastplate)<br />
<br />
2) Will do combines for rare smithing drops (usually Essence of Sunlight), whose values appoximate the above<br />
<br />
3) I don't do &quot;combine only.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, I understand the economies involved.  You do the combine for me cheaply, next thing you know I'm offering it for sale in the bazaar and undercutting you cause I don't have the value of having had to go thru the work to reach the status of GM Smith that you have.  Further, if you do it for me at a low combine cost, even if I use it, you're profit margin is substantially less than if you had made the subcomponents yourself.<br />
<br />
However, my question is, is there more of a medium somewhere?  The 15k plat for a breastplate combine basically is asking for the entire profit margin on a breastplate despite the fact that all of the prior work is done.  It also discounts the chances for those whose skill is not yet 250 to have a free chance at skill ups with no prior work done.  Literally fifteen minutes of work to have 13 chances at a skill up (I'm actually looking to complete an entire set of Lum. Heraldic).  <br />
<br />
So, all of that is a long winded way of asking if anyone would be willing to do a series of Luminant Heraldic combines for 1k per successful combine.  If so, post here, or shoot me a tell in game.  I'm on most weekday evenings from about 7pm to Midnight EST.<br />
<br />
Thank you,</div></div><hr />

I am willing to cut the prices some more if you have extra supplies which I can keep. It still will not be cheep, but if you are reasonably, I am sure we can work something out.<br />
