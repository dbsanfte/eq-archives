<br />
I will need in a few weeks/months (hehe, I like to be prepared)<br />
the Artisan's seal, depending of the advancement of my tradeskills in baking/brewing.  I was told that no one make them, too complicated.<br />
A friend has agreed to make an enchanter and practise jewelcraft, if i provide pp for it. Well, i don't have enough EQ time for tradeskills, hunting epic, so great  :D ! <br />
<br />
But his chanter is lvl 2 (hehe, i asked him a few hours ago, just made). So, if when the time comes, if his skills are not high enough for my need, is there any jewellers on my server that could make it? Please post the price also, cause if its to high, I will wait a bit more, hehe!<br />

I find them to be quite easy to make.  I keep a few on me at all times to sell in the bazaar.  I havent been on TP much lately but I have 2 in stock right now that I will sell for 5500pp each.  If you want them, I will put the trader up.</div></div><hr />

My brewing skill isnt even high enough at the moment to attempt the combine! But I will remembered both yours offers, Cal, Arcanum, cause I don't think I will have succes the first time! <br />

Thanks!<br />
