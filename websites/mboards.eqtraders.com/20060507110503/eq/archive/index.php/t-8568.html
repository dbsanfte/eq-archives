<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aandiin</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My name is Aandiin and I’m a high-elf mage on the Maelin Starpyre server.  If it is true that the gnome cultural Robe of Expertise is white in appearance when worn, and can be properly fitted to be worn by a high-elf mage, than I would really be interested in either buying one or doing everything possible to gather up all of the needed components for the robe.  I hope that some kindly gnome tailor can please help me out.  What happened was that once I had quested for all of my newbie armor I died them white, and the result was stunning.  I enjoyed the look tremendously, and my guild even began to refer to me as Aandiin, the white.  So, the look had become an intrinsic part of the role I played.  Unfortunately, when I upgraded my robe to better stats, the white tint on the new robes intrinsic blue color resulted in a light yellow robe.  Yes, to some I now this sounds funny, and I’ve heard all the jokes about never wash your whites with colors (HaHaHa….Not!), but truly this has taken some of the enjoyment out of my game play.  Plus, people who I have been grouping with for months run right bye because they do not recognize me.   Finally, no I’m not trying to be a Gandolf rip-off!  If anything, I was trying to emulate the “Drangonlance Chronicles” concept of white/good, red/neutral, black/evil.  I look forward to any help or advice and please feel free to send me a tell in game.  Also, if anyone knows of other robes that are white in appearance with comparable stats please let me know as I keep looking for various alternatives.<br />
