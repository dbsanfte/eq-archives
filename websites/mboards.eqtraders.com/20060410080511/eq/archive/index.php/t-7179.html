<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zeralenn</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just finished an extensive revision of the Economical Smith based on feedback I'd received. Here is a list of most of the changes I did between versions 3 and 4:<br />
<br />
The following corrections and clarifications were added between Editions 3 and 4:<br />
<br />
- Fixed omissions of Brell Serilis and Bertoxxulous in the Imbue Gems table<br />
- Added Shamans as able to imbue diamonds for Mithraniel Marr (frogloks)<br />
- Added Clerics as able to imbue amber for Cazic-Thule (erudites)<br />
- Clarified section on Smithing Races to make it better understood that cultural races have more skilling options, which is what makes them preferable.<br />
- Clarified description of medium quality ore vendors to point out that smiths should not buy ore from three specific vendors with no forge nearby.<br />
- Clarified and added information about morning dew foraging/looting<br />
- Added metal rings to the cost of making shadowscream.<br />
- Changed layout of shadowscream section to call out swirling shadows, wailing substance, and shrieking substance into their own sections.<br />
- Added hilt mold to the list of costs for making mistletoe cutting sickles (already included in the sum totals)<br />
- Corrected the name of Qeynos human cultural plate to full plate.<br />
- Corrected the name of the Velium Smithing Hammer.<br />
- Corrected the spelling of Master Barkhem’s name.<br />
- Corrected costs for Ornate Gold Coif.<br />
- Fixed a few minor grammatical errors.<br />
- Added information on deluxe toolboxes as another alternative for containers.<br />
- Removed Grobb from supply location lists (our sympathies to the trolls. Naughty frogs!).<br />
- Added Gukta to appropriate supply location lists.<br />
- Added information about needed Everquest® expansions for skilling.<br />
- Added rusty weapon supply vendors under Tarnished Weapons Conversion section.<br />
- Updated section about the Hollowshade War to reflect changes in a recent patch.<br />
<br />
New sections added:<br />
<br />
- Added section, &quot;Tips for Moving Ore&quot;, that gives a variety of tips on moving large quantities of ore, including the two-account “ore fetcher” method for those who cannot gate.<br />
- Added &quot;Richeldys’ Tips for the Super Cheap Smith&quot;. These are some tips I have gotten based on my experiences running a new smith on the Stromm newbie server.<br />
- Added a new section about Forges, explaining the types of forges and their uses.<br />
- Added Vale Sewing Kits as a halfling-only alternative for skilling to 162.<br />
- Added an explanation of why shears are not a good skilling alternative to ornate chain.<br />
<br />
It's all at the same location as before:<br />

I used your last guide to get me through fine plate and I know I’ll be using it again to reach 200 and eventually 250 skill.  For now I’m working up each trade skill to the point where it gets “hard.”  For smithing I stopped at 188.  Once I’ve worked all my trade skills to this point I’ll return to those, like smithing, that I still need to take to 200.  And perhaps by then you’ll have written a guide for tailoring too.  Nudge. Nudge. Wink. Wink.<br />

Seriously, your guide is the most incredible smithing resource I’ve had the pleasure of reading since discovering EQ Traders itself.  Thank you for sharing it with us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I found one other minor error for the Ornate Gold Tunic (found this out while smithing up to 155).   The trivial level on the Ornate Gold Tunic is 155 and NOT 156.  I accidently kept making the Gold Tunics once I made 155 and wondered why I wasn't getting the last skill-up to 156 - then I bothered to look at the message saying &quot;You cannot further advance...&quot;<br />
<br />
So... avoid trying to get to 156 on the Ornate Gold Tunics.<br />

<br />
English training coming into play here, ma'am... down on the lower half of your page, it reads...<br />
<br />
&quot;neither the guides nor the chart may not be distributed,&quot;<br />
<br />
Technically, as this is a double negative, fun things might occur if someone were to try to get all legal on you. May want to take out the 'not'. <br />
<br />
now, onto the real point.... <br />
<br />
this is an incredible piece of work. <br />
it is written with the uncommon-tradeskiller in mind (ie, laying everything out from square one), so at times, i found myself thinking, 'I know this, I need to skip to the next paragraph.' The Five Rules are very good to keep in mind, ty for explicitly stating them. <br />
<br />
The Embroidering/Cultural Needle thing (ie, sellback rate/profit) is a nice thing to know! I'm glad I was told that before I wasted and missed any plat at that level. <br />
<br />
everything is layed out clearly, explicetly, not always concicely but that's ok. <br />
<br />
If you are taking up smithing, having never looked at smithing before,  you need to read this. <br />
<br />
Kudos, applause, and many many thanks. I'm sorry I've not checked this out before; Adobe Reader and I... well, we have had a hate/hate-back relationship. But this guide is absolutely incredible. Thanks so much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as not being concise ... no one EVER accused me of being brief. However, I like things being explained to me and I assume others like it as well, and so far that seems to be borne out. If I go on a bit too much I apologize, but there is no law that says you have to read every word I say.<br />
<br />
I AM working on the tailoring guide and hope to have a perusal draft ready for that reasonably soon. I will need reviewers for that as well.<br />

I got lucky enough to decide I'll be getting into smithing 3 days before it became available. I had no intention of ever doing smithing but the Prayer Shawls convinced me otherwise. So, even though I'm pretty familiar with most of the other tradeskills, smithing was almost COMPLETELY a new thing for me. I really appreciated the detail put into the guide; I'm very detail oriented and like lots of explanation.  :)  As for not being brief; where it wasn't informative to me, it was entertaining. <br />
<br />
As for tailoring, I'm currently trying to that too. (At 39 or 40 right now.) If there is anything I can help with on information or logging, send me a PM and I'll be happy to contribute.  <br />

<br />
No, I know, but lately for some odd reason I've found it hard to skim-read as effectively as I have before. (Probably due to taking 2 German courses and Beginning Japanese in the same semester... when it's not your native language or even your native alphabet, skim-reading can be disastrous on tests, heh.) I've developed a propensity for needing white space, but I do suppose it's just me. <br />
<br />
Heh, the 'Truncated Economical Smith', 'for those who know what they're doing and just want a nice list.' Naw, I don't know, ignore me, I'm procrastinating on house work. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hobbun</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The guide is great, Zeralenn. But I'd like to make a suggestion for 5.0. You've done a good job of keeping track of how much money Otavis has spent, but I think a good idea is to keep how much time farming is spent to get to 250. As what was done in how much Otavis has spent in platinum at the end of each item made, keep track of how much time was spent farming. So beginning smiths will have a good idea what is in store for them if they go the &quot;economical&quot; route. <br />
<br />
Just an idea.   :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Troodon</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 05:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did find a minor error on page 82.  You don't need to be a cleric to make a fused dragon crystal (in fact, you don't even need to worship Veeshan!).<br />
<br />
Any potter (item only trivs at 31 pottery) can make this, you just combine a fire dragon crystal, ice dragon crystal, earth dragon crystal, and wind dragon crystal, directly in a kiln.  All of these crystals are foraged in Skyfire Mountains.  The potter doing the combine need not worship Veeshan.  No actual &quot;imbuing&quot; needs to be done to the fused dragon crystal; it comes out of the kiln ready to use.<br />
<br />
A bit annoying doing the foraging as all of the raw crystals have identical graphics and are not stackable (though the final result is stackable).  Bring lots of bags to collect them!<br />
<br />
Only use for this currently is in dragonkin heraldic armor.  Is made my human smiths in the Qeynos forge and is wearable by Veeshan-worshipping bards (human, half elf, and wood elf ones.  Vah shir can't wear human cultural, but is irrelevant on these items since vah shir can't worship Veeshan anyway).<br />
<br />
Also you omitted Solusek Ro, whose gem is fire opal, and can be imubed by Sol Ro worshipping wizards 29 and higher.  Though maybe this omission is deliberate since there is no armor currently that uses imbued fire opals.  Only wizards and bards can worship Solusek Ro anyway, but maybe some day Sol Ro worshipping bards can get imbued plate armor.  After all, they gave it to Veeshanites, hehe, it could happen.  Currently though only use for imbued fire opals is in jewelry and pottery.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Technically, as this is a double negative, fun things might occur if someone were to try to get all legal on you. May want to take out the 'not'. <br />
<br />
Actually the problem is the 'or' not the 'neither'.  'or' implies one or the other, or both.  'and' implies both.<br />
<br />
the 'neither... nor' formulation is proper for using 'or' with a negative, but it would be best to say:<br />
'the guides and chart may not be distributed'<br />
<br />
since people could argue that they distributed the guide but not the chart, meeting the test implied by 'or'.<br />
<br />
And full plate molds are sold in Qeynos as well as PoK (page 43) - they are used for human qeynos cultural as well as planar armour. Mar Sedder (downstairs, Tin Soldier, S. Qeynos) is also a vendor according to http://www.eqtraders.com/location/smithing.htm</div></div><hr />

Although it does use fine steel plate as an ingredient, gnome cultural armor is tinkered.  I think you might want to remove them from your list of good candidates for smithing characters on page 11.</div></div><hr />

Iksar can only wear medium armor, with rare exceptions.  Banded isn't one of those exceptions, hehe, my brother who played an iksar warrior for a while can attest to the fact that large banded does not fit iksar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can also buy these from Adinel Jailbar at the gnome pirate outpost in Iceclad Ocean.  However due to the inonvenience of getting here, even if you can port, people haven't often bothered to acquire them here since the release of PoP.  Before PoP though this was the only place you could get deluxe toolboxes.  Many new tinkering recpies that were launched with Velious required them, since they has more than 8 ingredients.<br />
<br />
Back then I did buy these as bankboxes, hehe.  Too heavy to be a good way of carrying stuff around (unless I needed giant capacity) but were a cheap way of increases my bank capacity.</div></div><hr />

Quote from EQTraders quest write-up:<br />
<br />
Then find Klok Ephmir in West Cabilis at Location 122, -117<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Klok Ephmir' <br />
Klok Ephmir stares at you with a wicked smirk. 'So you share the Brood's love of frogloks, do you? Alive, they provide much trouble. Dead, they provide much delight. I have found many uses for the frogloks. From fine meat to fine mats. Be sure to ask if you do not see something you desire.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'I need thinly sliced froglok' <br />
Klok Ephmir says 'I can provide thin sliced froglok meat, or rather, I used to. First, I need to [sharpen the dull cutting disk].' <br />
<br />
You say, 'I can sharpen the dull cutting disk' <br />
Klok Ephmir says 'That would be good. If you are a blacksmith, I am sure you can find a sharpening stone and bring life back to my disk. If you sharpen this I shall gladly provide you with some thin sliced froglok.' <br />
<br />
Recieve: Dull Cutting Disk, Lore, NoDrop, wt 0.5, size small, all/all, nonstackable <br />
<br />
Nearby you will find a forge and Klok Toren who sells the Sharpening Stones for 3cp.<br />
<br />
Combine in forge: Dull Cutting Disk + Sharpening Stone. On failure, the dull cutting disk is returned. Upon success you receive: Sharp Cutting Disk, Lore, NoDrop, wt 0.5, size small, all/all, nonstackable. Trivial for the combine is 26.<br />
<br />
Give Klok Ephmir the harp Cutting Disk<br />
<br />
Klok Ephmir takes the disk and attaches it to an odd device powered by a foot pedal. He takes a froglok leg and begins to slice it as chunks of gristle flies into your face. When he is done he hands you some thin sliced froglok. 'There you are. Run along.' <br />
<br />
Receive: Thin Sliced Froglok Meat, lore, no-drop, Meal, Wt 1.0, Size: Small, all/all, (appears stackable but its lore so can only have one)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This provides an endless supply of rusties to sharpen.  Granted 1-26 is already easy and cheap but 3cp per combine seems to fit well for the ultra frugal.</div></div><hr />

Sold in the middle shop in East Cabilis of the three shops that are between the bank and the monk guild.  Name of the vendor escapes me at the monent, but she sells smithing molds for cooking implements.<br />
<br />
If Lybar (the water seller) would set up shop in East Cabilis, hehe, Cabilis would be a perfect tradeskill city.  Major annoyance is while the forges, brew barrels, and pottery wheel are all in East Cabilis, the only place you can get water you need for smithing, pottery, and brewing, is in WEST Cabilis.<br />

Also on page 56, you can add Cabilis as a location that sells medium chainmail patterns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This requires that you have killed Bertoxxulous and received the appropriate flags, so most players cannot benefit from this technique.  For those who can, its easier to skill up on than it sounds (for gating classes).<br />
<br />
Prepare a large amount of Acid Wash (3 CE + Jar of Acid, Brewed).  I found 60 Acid runs were adequate.  Prepare a hotkey for the quest prompt (&quot;I am well versed in the art of smithing&quot;).  Ride the elevator to the top of the tower.  Click the button to send the elevator back down (this is best done at off-hours when no one else will use the elevator).  Bind at Aid Grimel.  Cast Levitation (or whatever means you have to float).  Hit the hotkey, drop the (Lore) Filthy BP into your inventory.  Levi down the shaft (pointing down and running a spiral around the shaft wall goes fastest).  Ramp up the outer wall of the library so you can fly over the inner city retaining wall and down to the main smithing building (the one with 3 or so forges - its closest).  Perform your combine.  Dispose of the Cleaned BP, if successful (and desired - otherwise, you'll just get duplicate Lore messages - but I didn't know if those affected skill rate).  Gate.  Repeat the above steps, beginning with hitting the hotkey, until you hit 227 or run out of Acid Wash.<br />
<br />
With 280 str/280 wis, it took me 120 or so combines over 2 sessions to run 220-227.  Time consuming?  Yes ... but not nearly so time consuming as farming Shadowscream Steel sploof.</div></div><hr />

Although it does use fine steel plate as an ingredient, gnome cultural armor is tinkered.  I think you might want to remove them from your list of good candidates for smithing characters on page 11.<br />
<br />
On page 58, you also mention the FP secondary market. <br />
<br />
I have a 250 tinkerbot. I need to make *SMALL* Fine steel plate for the high end tinkered armor. May want to mention in the next revision that before you start doing FS plate, talk to local tinkerers and see if they would be interested in buying (or trading for tinkered stuff) armor you are making.</div></div><hr />

i noticed a great way to carry all the heavy ore, this was month ago, but i never saw that it was fixed in a patch message. the trick is that it seem that our run speed is calculated with a formula like natural speed + selo's speed and not natural speed * selo's factor, i mean that when i m really encumbred (let say 5000 stone, agi 1) i can normaly no more move, but when i sing selo's i m still running faster than sow speed (even if i can no more strafe), sure if you're using a 5 bard mule he won't move so fast, but he'll still move. this said, that was long ago, so more testing should be a great idea before adding this. there s just 2 thing to note... the first is that i was note testing this in bazaar (for those wondering), and second is that you may want to tell people to avoid indoor zone.. being perma rooted s not cool...<br />
<br />
i noticed a little thing's missing, you're telling about cultural needle, i know i can find the info here on eqtraders, but adding what race can do them( or telling if it s not a race restricted combine).<br />
<br />
on the skilling path described i can't say much, i had raised my skill before the smithing change to 175 on banded armor, but the path described seem great.<br />

I make clockwork needles any time I find embroidery needles on a vendor and I&#8217;m playing a Vah Shir.  It&#8217;s not the fastest way to make money, as I still have to spend time fishing, but its easy money and I just can&#8217;t pass it up.</div></div><hr />

i also noticed an error on page hum.. 78 i think, it s under dark elf cultural, you forgot half-elf has potential wearer of dark elf armor...</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, on page one in the section &quot;How much smithing is &quot;enough&quot; for a tailor,&quot; I think you have a typo. <br />
<br />
You wrote, &quot;Some smiths will not even need to raise it any higher than the mid-80s. If you are planning to do cultural smithing, your needs will be greater.&quot;<br />
<br />
While I agree that your needs will be greater if you plan to do cultural smithing, I believe you meant tailoring. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, on page 34 in &quot;Advanced Smithing for Cultural Tailors&quot; in the description of leather padding, you write, &quot;You can also make leather padding from 1 low quality rockhopper pelt plus 1 shadeling silk thread.&quot; Unless this has changed recently (happy to check after today's patch), you can use either silk thread or shadeling silk thread with the rockhopper pelt, there is no need to go stocking up on shadeling if you've already stocked up on silk threads and happen to have found some rockhopper pelts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, I am not planning to make a revised PDF format guide at this time. Instead, I have secured a new domain name for my guides and will soon be making &quot;The Economical Smith&quot; and all the other guides (including a new one on tailoring I hope to have ready sometime before the end of summer) available as a website. <br />
<br />
This way, it will be easier to keep it updated.<br />
<br />
Right now, I have contracted out new artwork from EQDreams for the header, and as soon as that is ready I will be putting the next version of the Economical Smith up at its new address in web format.<br />

One comment:<br />
<br />
I am not sure if this has been mentioned before but in the section where you explain cultural you say that the Gnome culural option is not good becuase there is no bridge to the Clockwork Observers armor which trivials above 250 skill. I am pretty sure Clockwork Observer and Shadowalker Armor is tinkered not smithed.</div></div><hr />

I don't have the financial backing so the helpful hints on where to hunt for certain things are greatly appreciated. Where to cut the costs of smithing and how NOT spending a little time farming can be a huge difference between 100p and 1kp in materials.<br />
<br />
My only question is on page 12 under your 5 critical rules of smithing, rule #1 talks about saving any and all spiderling silks you can find, kill kill kill.  At the bottom you state.....See the discussion about Tailoring to follow for information on where to hunt for spiderlings. Minor detail in retrospect to what this guide lays out, but in the Tailoring section you mention where a good place is to hunt for pelts but no mention of silks. I have a ranger alt that can track but my main is apart of a raiding guild and don't get much time to &quot;farm&quot;, any good suggestions as to where to &quot;farm&quot; spiderlings?<br />
<br />
The guide is awesome, hope to be almost 200, as long as I can farm with my ranger and raid with my monk. Thanks again.<br />
