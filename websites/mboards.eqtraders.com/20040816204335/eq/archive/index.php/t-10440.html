<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have attempted 100 combines at 222 skill with 284 INT, on Star Ruby Encrusted Steins, and received 0 skill raises. Up until now the most combines I've ever had to do without an increase was 60. I was wondering if having to do 100 (or many more) is par from the course from here on in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>caena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've been helping a potter skill up.  We do runs of 100 idols.<br />
<br />
The best run of 100 so far has been 5 skillups.  She had one run where she got none, and several where she got one.<br />
<br />
So, yes, in my experience, around 1 skillup in 100 combines is fairly normal for high-skill pottery.<br />
<br />
You will hear of people who go 200 or more combines without a skillup.  And somewhere there's a screenshot--I believe it was five pottery skillups in seven combines in the 220s.  Something amazingly good and beautiful, anyway.  The RNG is a fickle mistress.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It probably took me at least 1000 combines to get from 222 to 230...I had several skillups in there that took me several hundred combines each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Many thanks for the information, guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh, one more question: You say it took so many to get from 222 to 230. Did it get any more rapid after 230?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can't remember perfectly as I don't keep track on purpose, but I think like after 235ish it started to pick up some.  But I'd also switched from star ruby steins to emarr old idols in there, which might have had something to do with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kokomo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I read in other thread that it took about 1600 - 1700 combines from 200 to 250, with a wis/int of 280.<br />
<br />
It tok me 1412 combines from 200 to 250, wis 315.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sabine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My notes on this are a few months old, but here they are:<br />
<br />
I did 192-222 with steins, so it cost about 9k. I lacquered the opals as I needed them, and had pre-enchanted 450 magic clays.<br />
<br />
(I averaged a skill up every 15 tries)<br />
<br />
I did 222-241 with idols. I pre-made the vials of clear mana (my 36 chanter took a lot longer to make these since the spell is a mana pig) and the peridots (my halfling cleric). I spent about 12k during these skillups.<br />
<br />
(Current math says this was about 25 attempts per skillup)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ripsnorter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Took 192 combines of white ceramic bands for me to go from 222 to 231 with 302 WIS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>DaariAyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I did, recently, some power skilling in pottery.  The combine I used was idol of the tribunal, because I've got a shaman who can imbue the gems, myself.  I'll report from 233 to 246 that's what I did the other day.  I'm trying to think of what I did from 222 to 233......think it was part, the star ruby enc. stiens that I attempted, got a couple there, and part just normal stocking of my mule with goldens idols that I sell.  It didn't take very long though, I'd say it was far under 500 combines.<br />
<br />
250, honestly, will probably take awhile for me, because I'm not dumping anymore money into ivory and emeralds...it'll be on golden idol of tunare and ceramic shield of valor, to finish those last points.<br />
<br />
Total cost of compents: 22p approx.  (which was total comsumption for unfired idol was destroyed)<br />
<br />
12,320pp.<br />
560 combines.<br />
13 increases.<br />
1 increase per 43 combines.<br />
<br />
buffs were C4, no modifiers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just to add, my opinion, star ruby encrusted stien is a terrible recipie to use, I've done upwards of 10 stacks of these things up to now and not only have I gotten less than 50 percent success rate, but increases are maybe 1 or 2 total.  It's just not a good recipie to use for skill ups.  Way to expensive. <br />
<br />
And I still believe that some recipies offer a better chance to increase than others, call me crazy, but I don't know why I can make 4 stacks worth of golden idols (or star ruby stien) and maybe, just maybe get 1 up... but I can do 4 stacks of plain idols and get 2 or 3 increases.<br />
<br />
Do white bands or idols......or if you're looking for something that will return your money you can do golden idols, that's about it though.  Can't get enough PoP stuff to actually sit down at it for practice, nor would anyone be crazy enough to do so hehe.  The gate idols don't seem to sell very well...but star ruby stiens are suicide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks a lot for your input. A Guildmate has also been trying to turn me to the ways of the Idol, so I'm definitley leaning that way now.<br />
<br />
Since I originally posted this topic, I've not yet plucked up the courage to combine my remaining 300 Star Ruby Stein component sets. I'm waiting until I can attain 305 INT (go go LDoN INT mods!) and then I'll do that. From then on, however, it's Steins all the way.<br />
<br />
Also, did all the posters here use Peridot idols? Because I've been told that the Cazic-Thule idol (with Amber) are the cheapest. If they offer a similar skillup rate to Peridots (Bristlebane?) idols then I'll do that, but if there's something special about the Peridot idol, I'll have to use it.</div></div><hr />
