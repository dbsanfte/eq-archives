<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ingridr Rubra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I answered a plea for imbued rose quartz in Shadowhaven one day. I logged on my cleric and began to imbue 107 (exactly) rose quartzes for someone. <br />
<br />
Whlie I was doing that, a DE necro wandered in. He proceeded to sit in the corner and watch me. He fed me mana and told me how beautiful I was, heheh. <br />
<br />
There's GOT to be more exciting things to do in EQ than watch someone imbue 107 rose quartzes!<br />
