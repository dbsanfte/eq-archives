<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tatanka7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The recipes for the 5 ceramic bands shows clear mana (uses emerald) used for the two with the lower trivials (black, blue), and cloudy mana (uses peridot) used for the three with the higher trivials (green, red, white).  Normally higher trivial items use more expensive components and spells to create them, not lower.  Are these recipes correct, or is one set or the other incorrect?  I just want to make sure before I go and create 500 mana vials!<br />

Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Having my Pottery at 216... and bought up 47 Cloudy Mana Vials, and worked my trivial up to 218, just this past weekend... at least the Green Ceramic Band is in the correct target of 222.<br />
<br />
These have been nailed, without question for a long time (unlike other recipe trivials). Take them as correct.<br />
<br />
But I strongly suggest that instead of making 500 Mana Vials in one sitting... make 20, or 40 or 100. Go for the lowest Trivial one first. And work up. Make more as needed.<br />
<br />
And please note... with all of the Ceramic Bands that:<br />
<br />
A. Players have rarely paid much for them. Their benefit is very limited. Don't make 100, stick them on a mule and hope to sell to recoup losses. You will be sadly disappointed.<br />
B. NPC Vendors will buy both the Fired AND the Unfired versions. And oddly enough, they pay more for the Unfired Versions.<br />
C. The Bands themselves do NOT stack... you will fill up available slots very quickly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the reply.  Yeah I was just gonna sell back to the vendors, don't want to mess around with selling them in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
As far as mana vials, it's way easier to mass produce them for me.  With the chanter on the second PC, and a manastone, it goes pretty quickly.  Although I may make a mix of cloudy and clear, so I have some to use towards the lower trivial items.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Assuming max effective charisma/faction, what do the bands sell back for? (fired or unfired)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't have any hard numbers for you... <br />
<br />
The general feeling about firing items and selling them to the vendor is that<br />
<br />
The cost of the Firing Sheets (based upon # needed, and the Quality of the sheet) is far MORE than the amount the vendor will pay for the fired item. <br />
<br />
Even if the unfired item costs you nothing, you would still lose money on the deal by firing them. Hence the sale of the unfired item to the vendor..<br />
<br />
Does that make econmic sense? NO<br />
Does it make sense from an EQ Economy persepective? Not to the Player...  But to Sony, they don't want money be generated via a single player interacting with NPCs. <br />
<br />
Sorry.<br />
<br />
But if you find that you can buy HQ Firing Sheets for say &quot;1 Plat&quot;... buy an unfired red ceramic band for 2 Plat... fire it... and resell the fired red ceramic band back to the vendor for 5 Plat... have at it. <br />
<br />
I just don't think you will find that scenario.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey, I'm used to the throwaways on unfired crucibles heh.<br />
<br />
I tried flogging the fired ones to my guild, but nobody wanted them for free, let alone for a price.  I don't think they'd sell in the bazaar for much either.<br />
<br />
23p per to 231 doesn't sound bad.  I was just wondering if there were -any- real return to merchants at all on the higher trivial bands.<br />
<br />
If you don't know, that's fine too... there's lots of stuff people don't know :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have sucky news and pretty joyous news on the sellback of the unfired white and red ceramic bands.<br />
<br />
White: resale to merchant 1s 1c.  Heh.<br />
<br />
Red: resale to merchant 27p 8g.  Omg.<br />
<br />
Now, for those who don't think resale is a big deal, that makes the per attempt cost on unfired red bands 35.5p per instead of 63.3p per.<br />
<br />
This makes unfired red ceramic bands the big winner from 236-242.  Leave the star ruby steins at approx. 65p per for 243+ :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>YurienStonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">for some reason i'm still stuck at 191 after hundreads of casserole dishes and poison vials. i don't know how viable this is for anyone but look at the planar steins. everythign can e store bought if you look around in pok.<br />
<br />
tainted planar essence 6.299p<br />
valor crystal                  5.249<br />
glaze lacquer                8.399<br />
tannan clay                 10.499<br />
ceramic sketch                .052<br />
water                              .011<br />
HQ firing sheet                .041<br />
                                    --------<br />
total of                        30.550p<br />
<br />
<br />
now if you are able to hunt in the planes then you can take away 19.947p or a total of 10.603 per attempt. the only draw back is the NPC won't buy fired or unfired steins. i've made roughly 2 backpacks worth and only got one left after about 3 months and i'm selling at cost. the peridot might be able to sell for the travel manuel but i ahven't seen that on Mith Marr</div></div><hr />
