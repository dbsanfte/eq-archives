<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KiTA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Quick question.  I feel like making a few guildmates and friends equipment.  I can make great plate (LDoN plate), but I can't seem to find any good weapons to make that don't require GoD drops.  Are there any good weapon combines that are available to me?<br />

I have like 178 smithing, and I'm a level 32 Berserker, so farming for Black Acrylia supplies is a bit hard for me. :)</div></div><hr />

Since  :<br />
<br />
1)   You're level 32.<br />
and<br />
2)  Your smithing is not 250.<br />

I have a quicker answer.<br />
<br />
No.<br />

Smithed weapons universally stink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tae Ew 2 handed swords are selling well for me.<br />
Black Acrylia is alright but too high a triv for my liking.<br />
<br />
But at your skill/ level you are not likely to make anything truely amazing. I can't think of any lower end weapons which are worth the effort getting the ingredients for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah, Coldheart is right.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tae Ew and Black Acrylia aren't bad.    But not at level 36 (unless he buys the parts) and not at 170 smithing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaaba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually I had pretty good success with Tae Ew stuff at 180+ skill.  I was like 4 for 8 on tunics when I got a stack of tae ew blood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">GoD smithing is relatively doable, and at 178+ geerlock, you should be able to do pale platinum with a reasonable success rate... it's only 1 Aligned Ore, and 1 Raw Pale Nihilite per attempt (considering you can find a Jewelcrafter to make the kits), which shouldn't be TOO expensive (depending on your servers bazaar)<br />
<br />
granted the ratios aren't great, but the stats, sv's, and overall risk vs reward is fairly decent.  Wis casters would like the 1hb's and int casters would like the piercers... the lack of hp/mana on them is probably their only downfall.<br />
<br />
As for the shimmering stuff... run... run like the wind... and never look back...</div></div><hr />
