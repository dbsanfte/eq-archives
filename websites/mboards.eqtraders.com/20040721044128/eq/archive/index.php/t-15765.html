Just finished a vendor mining run Sunday morning, came back with the usual sellables, earned 12 percent of level 58 from turn ins and ~1400pp from the rewards from said turn ins.<br />

I almost don't feel bad about wasting the cash to make the aligned spear.  It would've been worth it, if it didn't have such a terrible graphic.</div></div><hr />

OTOH, I got myself a new haste belt and 3 EB runed seashells yesterday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Binkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh, I've had some lucky finds.  Like the time I found 30k worth of lvl 63-64 wizard spells on the turn in guy in the Library.  They cost me 7pp each.  And the time I found several rare lvl 59 spells that sell for 10-20k each on my server, for 37pp each on a vendor.  Mmmm.  (I wasn't even looking for anything like that, I was vendor mining for low level research pages.)   :cool:</div></div><hr />
