<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brodder FoamyMugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">found two packs of Fila dough that are about to expire...defrosting them...got two pie shells...<br />
<br />
 Got some ground sirloin, two pounds of frozen mixed mushrooms (make tons and save for stews and steaks and sauces) already cooked with gravy...have two carrots two potatoes and three onions left in dehydrator in fridge...got some fresh parsely and black chopped olives in fridge too that can be added...<br />
<br />
 Think I'll make a MEAT PIE!!! or TWO!....<br />
<br />
 Lil trick I got- bought a wide nozzle sprayer and I pour 2 melted sticks margarine and 2 sticks butter into them  and use that to spread butter evenly on the fila dough layers...just need to keep bottle (glass pyrex) warm so it will spray... or drop nozzle in hot water then nuke bottle for 15 secs...to remelt it. (don't nuke plastic nozzle as there is a metal spring in there...bad bad meltdowns can occur).<br />
<br />
 Now do I make the pies or do I make individual empanada/ turnovers and freeze extras?<br />
<br />
 So meat Pies in extra crispy flaky layer crusts  or delicious Crunchy layered triangles full of Meaty shroomy goodness?<br />
<br />
 Decisions decisions???<br />
<br />

When making Baklava I use a clean paintbrush (bought and reserved for this use only) to butter the filo dough in lieu of a pastry brush, since speed is of the essence.  I also have my husband prepare and add each layer as I butter to speed things up a bit.  I like your idea though, I may have to give it a try next time. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am even worse than that - I spoon the melted butter on and use the back of the spoon or, um, my hand to smear the butter on as fast as possible when I am trying to make the phyllo version of strudel (as long as the phyllo hasn't dried too much it can withstand direct smearage).  Sigh, it has been far too long since I made strudel with the stretchy dough and a linen tablecloth.<br />
<br />
Go for turnovers - freeze some and have some tasty surprises waiting for you next time you clean the freezer out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brodder FoamyMugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One pie-  Was delicious. (I still can't believe an 89 lb woman can eat nearly half a pie by herself plus a salad! Imagine that appetite if she were pregnant!)<br />
<br />
 13 Turnovers (added pepperjack cheese inside too for more Yummy lubbins!).<br />
<br />
 The turnovers were drier fillings than the pie's. Instead of a regular pie crust topping I used the left over fillo dough to cover it. I sprinkled paprika black pepper and cumin on every other layer on top too...so when it flaked you'd get distinct flavorings!<br />
<br />
 Next I'm gonna try cajun butter when I make my &quot;HOT pockets&quot; adding 2 tbs spoons of fine ground cayenne to the butter before I spray it on, (making sure to shake it well first.)<br />
<br />
 I know it works for cinamon and vanilla butter. But it is better to use cinamon extract since it won't clog the spray up so much.<br />
<br />
<br />
  My best streudel mix.<br />
     2 Cups of brandy or rum soaked seedless raisins.<br />
     3 cups of sliced apples peeled (thin apples) Or heavy shredded apples (skins and all). Dress with lemon juice and mix with 1 cup of brown sugar.<br />
     1 cup oatmeal (raw and dry not the mush you eat for breakfast)<br />
     2 tspoons cinammon 1 tsp nutmeg<br />
     1/2 cup white sugar.<br />
<br />
     Mix all of the above and let sit cover to prevent too much browning of ingredients.<br />
<br />
<br />
     Make your fillo dough layers (10-15 minimum)<br />
<br />
    Turn lenghtwise.<br />
<br />
    Slather carefully the filling over the dough leaving 1&quot; gap from edges uncovered all the way around. filling should only be about 1/4 inch thick. Less is okay too if yer making two streudels.<br />
<br />
    Use linen to start the rolling process to prevent tearing. roll tightly, but not too forcibly.  Once rolled butter the edges and tock them into the roll sealing cylinder.<br />
<br />
   IMportant  CHILL the Roll for at least an hour in fridge COVERED.<br />
   If any spot appears too dry apply a little more butter.<br />
<br />
    Place on cookie sheet (don't need to butter it...trust me). Using a wet knife make insertion cuts down the length of the streuddel to the center of the roll to allow steam out.  (this means just stick knife down vertically down into the cylinder not cut horizontally). Should make at least 4 such insertins into it evenly down the length. More if it is a bigger streudel. (over 4 inch diameter is considered BIG). :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
   Bake till golden brown.( usually 350F 30-35 minutes Dough will have more listed- remember more filling the more it will need to heat up and steam out so starting at 425f then lowering to 350 for last 25 minutes is okay too- but go with recipe instructions for similar items as every oven is different.)  Remove just before finishing (about 3 minutes or so brush lightly with butter and cinamon and sprinkle white sugar over the top evenly. Return to oven for final 5 minutes. <br />
<br />
  Remove and let Cool for 30 minutes before even thinking about cutting it or Moving it of the cookie tray.<br />
<br />
 serve a slice with French vanilla icecream or a slice of sharp cheddar!<br />
<br />
<br />
 **** now I gotta go buy this and make it again... (checks freezer for other things to get rid of to make more room).:boggled:</div></div><hr />
