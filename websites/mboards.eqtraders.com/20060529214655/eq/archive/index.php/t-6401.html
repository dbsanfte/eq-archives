<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tibis</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's used to combine the four sketches you quest for into a single Master Sketch.  The sketches are used as a catalyst (ie influence the combine without being used up) in various PoP poison combines.<br />
<br />
If you want more details, go to the sticky at the top of this forum, and follow the link to Coinari's excellent Advanced Poisons guide, which includes details of all of the quests related to PoP poisoning.</div></div><hr />

Would take me forever to get that done..aww hell, Who am I fooling..!  My pathetic self is already workin on it..!</div></div><hr />

The Hate spear is easy enough, I still had mine banked.  The Burning Rapier quest and the assassination of Lon is really the only part that takes any time.  The fourth sketch is the combination of the poisons from the other three sketches.  <br />
<br />
They are well worth it IMO, if only for the feeling of accomplishment you get when it's all done and you bag the master sketch.<br />

<br />
I would say get the Grandmaster Assassin's Seal as your first quest - needed, in fact, to get the last sketch.  It also saves you a heck of a lot of cash on Advanced Vials (I've only ever needed 10).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tokensmoke</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, It would be Well Worth gettin the master sketch.  Just gotta find the time.  Im done with GM Seal except for the stupid dagger drop in Fear...Once i get Seal, Im gonna get another Vail (assuming that i can have both) which is 15% on top of my 250 skill...Once done, yes, I will get my master sketch.  And yes, from one old fart rogue to another, my BR still rottin in the bank 8)</div></div><hr />

All the literature I read before I went to kill him said he was blue to a 45.  I was 45 when I took him down and he was yellow.  He was also an undercon at that.  I had a group with me, a 53 monk a 47 warrior, 45 cleric and 50 ranger.  Monk got eaten and the cleric had to zone cause she managed to get aggro somehow.</div></div><hr />
