<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saraden</div><div class="date">12-29-2002, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is my run from 190-250 in tailoring including success rates.  I am posting this, as some others have, to in a small way give back to this community that helped me so much with trade-skills.  I hope the information below is helpful to some people in analysis of trade-skills or in deciding whether or not to pursue tailoring.  This was post-patch that “made skill-ups slightly easier.”  The runs are listed as I did them—I usually only did combines when I had a stack of combines to do.  Prior to this I used the following progression to skill-up: silk swatch to 15, patchwork armor to 26, raw silk to 36, cured silk to 82, tailored quivers to 115 (this was when that was the highest you could go in tailoring), crystalline silk to131, wu’s to 158, and then a combination of acrylia studded, acrylia reinforced, and basic vale tailoring to 190 (I forgot I got one skill-up on a fleeting quiver combine out of a few I did for people).  I was fortunate to be a halfling and have an extra option for combines but did not use it for most of my run as you will see as I had a good supply of other items for combines.  I had spent the mid 50’s xp-ing in cobalt scar as did two guildie friends so I had about 700 arctic wyvern hides and about 350 cobalt cod saved up.  I had only about 350 stackable velium however so I initially tried to farm these but found the drop rate far to low so I bought most of the velium in the bazaar.  I also experimented with making the coldain tempers and certainly a lot of money could be saved on these—to buy them at the vendor costs 525pp a stack at max faction/cha, to make them with store bought spell components costs about 200pp a stack and of course would be even cheaper if you were combining spell components as you got them as drops.  However, for me the amount of time spent to make them was far too long when I could be making most of the difference in pp back at the same time as xp-ing.  Tailoring is very expensive in one way or another—either plat to buy components or time to farm them.  The method I used was a combination of both and I had friends who helped out greatly.  More analysis and discussion of cost will follow below.  All combines were done at 252 wis with a geerlock (just what my particular set-up of equipment was with switching epic out for geerlock).<br />

Hard to analyze the significance of skill-ups on successes versus failures though I may look at this more in depth later.<br />
<br />
Summary of Costs:<br />
studded arctic wyvern masks<br />
--Hides got about 700 myself or from friends bought about 161 at 10pp each though going rate on Xegony is about 20pp in bazaar=1610pp<br />
--Velium (you need 6 stackable velium to make two studs) I was given or got about 350 stackable and bought the remaining 2233 at about 20pp each=44660pp (this is pretty close to accurate as I bought them at varying prices and kept loose track of pp spent on velium and had a figure of 42546 in my records)<br />
--Cod I either fished myself or got from friends but did buy some at about 20pp per oil=2500pp<br />
--Coldain Tempers I bought almost all of these at about 26pp each and each stud takes 2 tempers=44772pp<br />
Vale armor<br />
High quality brute hides bought at about 50pp each they used to be about 10pp each in the Dreadlands but when the high end tailoring was introduced for halflings these went up since they are used in those as well and are a small piece of the price=4300pp<br />
Misty acorns were collected by myself or bought from others initially at 5pp each but later at 10pp each for ease I will figure at 5ppp each (btw these are way too rare a forage and ground spawn)=430pp<br />
Ethereal silk swatches<br />
Strands of ether bought for 10pp each from players though going rate is often more and takes two per combine=180pp<br />
Ethereal curing agent bought from players as it is a high end brewed item at 35pp each though it goes for up to 50pp each=315pp<br />
Otter fur cap<br />
Otter fur bought from players for between 35pp and 60pp each and each combine takes two came to about=11400pp<br />
Silver thread=150pp<br />
Acrylia reinforced bracer<br />
Flawless rockhopper hides go for about 100-150pp most I was given be friends but bought some guessing=1500pp<br />
Small acrylia bricks go for about 70-100pp though again I was given most so I would guess=1000pp<br />
Reinforced cobalt drake belt<br />
Cobalt drake hides are about 100pp but I got these myself<br />
Small bricks of velium to make velium boning and each belt takes two at about 50pp each=1600pp<br />
Coldain tempers one for each boning=1612pp<br />
Studded tigeraptor cloak<br />
Tigeraptor hide was given to me but they go for about 100pp<br />
Velium for stud=60pp<br />
Coldain temper=52pp<br />
Ceremonial Solstice robe<br />
Gem studded chain three of these were for another person and one was mine can’t recall how much it cost me but I had it made for me though they sell in bazaar for about 1000pp but since I had it made=500pp<br />
Rest of components in this case were given to me though getting silks and imbued emeralds could certainly entail significant cost if you use this route to skill up<br />
Stormreaper steelweave bracer<br />
High quality brute hides=200pp<br />
Misty acorns=20pp<br />
Blue Diamonds go for 500-1000pp in bazaar but can easily be bought in the 500-600pp range=2200pp<br />
Total cost=119,061pp estimated for 190-250<br />
This cost analysis ignores failures on component combines (wow I hate the velium stud combine where you combine 3 velium bits to make two studs as if you fail you loose 6 stackable velium whereas the combines to make the velium bits you only loose 2 and with the tempers it is a costly failure.  I had 175 smithing for all of this but failed slightly more than I would have thought to be the 5% failure rate on velium studs).  So you could probably add 5% to total cost.  I also ignored small things like patterns or regular metal bonings for vale tailoring, etc.  If I had not saved up 700 arctic wyvern hides, 350 stackable velium, and 350 cobalt cod and if I hadn’t fished the other cod you could add a lot to this cost.  Obviously tailoring is a huge investment of time and money.  I hope that this information is helpful to some people out there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Liwsa</div><div class="date">12-30-2002, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow that is a lot of wyvern hides and velium studs.  I have saved around 300 wyvern hides as I leveled in CS from 49-60(not all leveling done on wyverns switched to otters at 57).  I dread collecting the velium to do them all.  My tailoring is now at 205 and am still quadding othmirs for their furs(gettting a few AA points too).  I have my 52 monk camped in Crystal Caverns as he can farm non-stop for velium faster and easier then my druid can.  I do not look forward to the making of studs(both cost and clicks) but it seems it is a necessary evil to get to that magic number 250.  Grats on reaching 250 and nice post.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rollopolo Rootntootn</div><div class="date">01-01-2003, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gratz on 250.I'm at 221 now and I've been goin at it a bit differently.I did a lot of wyvern  and acrylia to get to 200 from 160 or so.I also made a profit on the acrylia tailoring...enough to continually buy more supplies.I throw in the odd cobalt,haze black panther now as well.If you are a little more patient you can get skill ups at a much more reasonable cost.I work a 24 hour shift at the fire station every 4th day.I turn on my trader with all his acrylia and other stuff at the start of my shift and when i get home...voila...lots of items sold and money in the bank...bazaar is great.Good place to get cheap supplies if you keep your eyes open too.Bottom line is that tailoring is much more expensive if you wabnt to get to 250 very quickly.</div></div><hr />
