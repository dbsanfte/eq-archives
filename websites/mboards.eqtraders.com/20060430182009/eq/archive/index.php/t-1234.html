<br />
The Blue Diamonds are going to suck my bank dry, since I will be needing so many for the two bracers, mask, and possibly greaves that I want, so I *need* another option other than /bazaar for getting these follownig peices:<br />
<br />
Morning Dew<br />
Foraged in GFay; any idea what skill needed to forage (if any)? rate of finding? dropped anywhere?<br />
<br />
Swirling Mist<br />
I've heard this drops from air elementals...if this is true, which ones?<br />
<br />
Essence of Moonlight<br />
I know these drop (rarely) in MistMoore - do they drop anywhere else more frequently or off of easier mobs? (..easier than mistmoore hehe)<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!!</div></div><hr />

Well just kill either and you will find out, the Swirling Mist is an uncommon drop only, its not uber rare or anything...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArrakeenNaedShoj</div><div class="date">12-19-2002, 07:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The morning Dew is a SUPER rare forage. In three or four hours My 30ish druid forages maybe 5. It is more common to forage them in Lfay than Gfay(since there is less on the rare forage list) but If you choose to go with Gfay you can also Auction to the zone that you are looking to buy them, and possibly get them from newbies and other people at the same time. You do not have to have a minimum skill to forage them, but I did notice a marked increase in the frequency after breaking 100 skill. Of course I forage a lot more food now too so that may just be it. I have just heard that they now also drop off of some mobs in the area(like brownies) so I am going to check that out, but I have not confirmed it yet. Morning Dew by the way will be the bane of your existence, It is the hardest peice to find, and it's the one you need the most of.<br />
<br />
Swirling Mist drops in a lot of places, The easiest for me is Steamfont off the Steam elementals. Just hang out around the Mino caves and grab three or 4 mobs and AoE them to death. Or if melee just run around and one hit everything to death(its only level 10ish). Everything in that area is on same spawn table so you will have to kill everything to get the steamies to spawn. You can alternatively hunt in PoA of the air elemental, Twilight Sea from the water elementals, Najena from the Mist elementals, and Lguk liveside from the Giant Water Elemental near the king.<br />
<br />
Essence of Moonlight apparently now drops from various luclin mobs, but I still hunt them from mistmoore. They are no where near as rare as they used to be since they now drop from live and dead mobs both at night and during the day. I can easily solo the castle entrance as a 54 cleric(started at 51 with no probs), and usually get a stack or so in 3 hours, plus plenty of finesteel, bronze, plat, and other vendor junk to make it at least a mildly profitable camp cash wise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Swirling Mist, my necro (37) is in SteamFront and has been killing mainly the earth elementals...thanks for the pointer about killing everything. I am getting EXP here from the Hero and Watchman Halv if I'm bored :)<br />
NOTE: Should I kill the minos? Most of them are static I think so they shouldnt effect the steam elemental spawns should they?<br />
<br />
Essence of Moonlight - a stack in 3 hours off of entrance mobs? pledge and initiate familiars? Nice...I could clean that place up with Baadan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zacatac</div><div class="date">12-19-2002, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Castle entrance, not zone entrance.  Make sure you're in the right spot.  Basically you need to get past the graveyard and up towards the castle before you see essence drops.<br />
<br />
I don't mind farming MM, but I cant' forage morning dews.  :(<br />
<br />
The benefit of farming swirling mists is I often end up with an Iron oxide or 2 while doing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what kinda drop rates are there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crickette</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 05:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I usually end up with about 2-3 stacks of moonlight if I hang out in the castle for about 4 hours killing pretty much everything. The essence of moonlight can drop off of pretty much any DE near or inside the castle.<br />
<br />
I found swirling mist easier to get in Najena than in Steamfont. They just dropped a lot more frequently for me there. Here is an excellent walk-through for the elemental spawns in there that I got on a message board a long time ago. The percentages for the drop rate are much higher than mentioned. This was before they increased the drop rate.<br />
--<br />
<br />
There are 17 places where elementals can spawn. If a mist elemental spawns (approximately 30% of the time) it can drop a swirling mist (approximately 10% of the mist elementals).<br />
<br />
As you walk into Najena, and hug the left wall you will come to an opening with a door on your left, a door in front, and an opening to the front right. Four elementals spawn here.<br />
<br />
If you go through the door on the left, through the secret wall, and hug the wall to your right you will see three doors...go the the right most door and you'll see a torture room. Two elementals spawn here.<br />
<br />
If you instead go through the middle door and then hug the left wall, you'll enter what is called Trazdon's room. Two elementals spawn here.<br />
<br />
If you backtrack to the four spawn point and instead go through the opening forward and right you will enter a large cavern with an opening to the left and a larch archway labelled &quot;NAJENA&quot;. If you take the opening to the left and follow the passage way there you eventually get to a room. In the passageway is one elemental spawn.<br />
<br />
If you instead go to the archway, just before the gates of the archway, there are two elemental spawns. <br />
<br />
Passing through the gates you will turn a few times and the corridor will open up into a room. There are two elemental spawns here.<br />
<br />
Continuing straight through the room, ignoring an opening to the left, you'll come to a T intersection where you can go right or left. Go right, at the next T turn left, and you'll come to three doors--left, center, and right. If you take the center door and hug the right wall, you'll eventually get to a room with a big portrait of a old graphic dark elf. There are two elemental spawn in this room.<br />
<br />
In this room is also a opening on the right wall. FOllow that opening and hug the left wall and you'll eventually get to a locked door. Open the door with the key you get from killing the Ogre Guard and you enter a room with three magicians (or two magicians and a monk, depending on the spawn). To the left is another locked gate. Open that gate with the key you get off the undead froglock called Bone-something (Bone cracker?) to enter a dead end room called Rathyl's room because either he or a place holder spawns there. There is also an elemental spawn in this room.<br />
<br />
Lastly remember passing severed heads on short pikes before the first T to get down to portrait room? Go through those spikes, down the stair case, and head generally forwards until you see a pool of water. Dive in, swim through the passageway until you get to a locked door. You open this door with the key from Drezelna. Inside are two magicians spawns and the Najena spawn. Najena's place holder is the last elemental.<br />
<br />
Therefore there are 15 elementals you can reach w/o any keys, a 16th you can reach with two keys, and a 17th placeholder for Najena you can reach if you have collected all the keys.<br />
<br />
And yes, I typed that up completely from memory. I have spent FAR too long in Najena.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArrakeenNaedShoj</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't worry about the minotaurs, It's all the harpys, spiders, elementals, and rats that wander around all stupid in the field you should concentrate on. <br />
<br />
You should probably at least try Najena as well, There are many elven smiths(like crickette above) that swear by it. Najena though doesn't like me(I have NEVER gotten a swirling mist there after DAYS of camping the elementals) so I quit going. And there is even a decent solo spot in Najena for 30ish level characters if you are interested(went from 29-32 there with my cleric in a couple of days and that was with hell levels) in a cubby right next to the elementals is &quot;a skeleton&quot; that is a great boring spot to rake in xp and a little cash.<br />
<br />
And yes, I meant the CASTLE entrance, I have gotten a couple of essences from yard trash near the entrance, but they were EXCEEDINGLY rare. I have heard that the deeper you go the more plentiful the drop rates, but as a cleric I cannot manage to solo much farther than the casle entrance/drawbridge so I don't even bother. Since it's a profitable camp in other ways(money, faction, pearls for Wu's, even got an experience message or two at 52) I just deal with drawbridge and move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Awesome guide Crickette! I'll head to Najena when I log on :)<br />
<br />
Castle Ent would be soloable by a 52war wouldnt it? I have a iksar BP somewhere to swap out for regen if i need it, and a bandaid knife :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: note for necros in Najena...'a skeleton' as described above makes an AWESOME charmed pet. cons light blue at 37, hits for 58; hasted, this badboy can do anything you want it to, better than your normal pet - only catch is, its charmed, so be ready to root and recharm if needed b/c otherwise youll have a hasted 58 dmg hitting skeleton on your ass. I would guess it has about 800hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torm Of Quellious</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can solo pull in there easily, but I'd bring a healing friend just in case, alot of casters are in there and you cannot Bash or Stun kick yet so it might hurt. and with &quot;only&quot; 5hp/tick regen it might not be fast enough for your likings.<br />
<br />
Another route is Powerleveling friends in there, at 52 they only need to be level 34 or 35 to get exp while grouped with you. And they will get alot, trust me on that. So grab a friend's twink and plow em down :) you help him level, he helps you farm. perfect combo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArrakeenNaedShoj</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, I just realized you were on my server Baadan. If you can catch me on and I am not busy, I can show you how/where I solo as a cleric in Mistmoore and see if it works for you. I root/nuke, but what I am killing falls in 1-3 nukes so you should be able to outdamage it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">teamnoir</div><div class="date">12-23-2002, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A typical mistmoore raid will usually net a few stacks of moonlight.<br />
<br />
Swirling shadows now appear to drop from both air and water elementals in twilight sea, and they drop FAR more often than they do in najena, ec, or steamfont.  In a couple hours of killing, I walked off with about 14 swirling mist.  While this used to be the bottleneck, I think it's eased.<br />
<br />
Why or why does high elves!?  Does this annoy anyone else on a racial self sufficiency basis?<br />
