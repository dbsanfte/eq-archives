<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mewkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, here's the situation, I've got about 100 attempts at the LoY robe that trivials at 222 and about 500 attempts for the one that trivials at 232 collecting dust sitting in the bank while my skill is down in the mid 190s. I want to milk solstice robes for as long as I can before the sucess rate starts to make them too expensive. My plan is to keep doing solstice robes till a reach a magic point, then switch to the 222 robes, then to the 232 robes (plus the two 'freebies' from 210-212). I would like to ding 232 on my very last robe attempt, none ingredients left over and no need to collect more. My question is, when should I abondon solstice robes and start making the LoY ones? I know you can sometimes have streaks of 100+ w/o skill ups and sometimes you can get two in a row. I'm looking for something more around the average or typical skill rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kulyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most threads I see indicate that people find they get too many success rates on solstice robes from around 220ish skill. This increases the cost of skilling significantly, so it's probably worth swapping before that. <br />
<br />
I personally am doing solstice robes to 210, doing the free points, then continuing with reinforced acrylia + arctic wyvern hides past that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did robes to 216 (appart from free 2 skillups)<br />
<br />
Then went to 222 on a batch of 70something Flawless Hopper combines (that was a sweet run)<br />
<br />
I do have around 6+ stacks of silk swatches and 3 gem studded chains on a mule, but cant bring myself to bother trying more robes.  I will probably save these till i need robes to use or for a friend.<br />
<br />
I guess next step for me is Velious stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">:confused: Could someone explain to me the logic behind &quot;too many solstice robe successes&quot; making it too expensive?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lupoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the chain cost alot to make, its used in the recipe. If you suceed in making a robe it eats the chain (part of the robe) if you fail the combine you get the chain back. (saving the cost of the chain, which is about 400pp?) the robes sell for cheap in the bazaar, around 100pp on morell Thule, so you would lose about 300pp per sucess. Expensive after a few sucesses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oooh I see, thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aethia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just the question I was going to ask, but a bit differently.<br />
<br />
boyfriend has Erudite tailor (228).  He's done Solstice robes up to this point, with the occasional Tempest robes to fund our progress.  ***Note: we are on Stromm a server 9 months old<br />
<br />
My human necromancer had 60+ attempts on LOY robes.  At 200, I spent the 3 AAs to raise it over 200.  Current skill 203.<br />
<br />
For us on Stromm, solstice robes have sold well, up until recently (say christmas). Which is why we decided to keep the Erudite tailor on solstice robes.  Succeeding too much when robes sell for less then cost (~575?) means a loss.  However on Stromm we've managed to stay on the plus side with robes.  So solstice robes depend on your market's economy.<br />
<br />
What we decided to do (given we had 2 chars that needed to have tailoring &gt; 200), was to have the Erudite Tailor do solstice robes to 220s ish (depending on when supplies ran out) and then work on Artic Wyvern stuff and have the Human tailor make LOY robes to 232.  Then Arctic wyvern to 240+ geerlok<br />
<br />
This plan can be used with any combination class, however, depending on if the 232 LOY robe components are easy to obtain.  Now we are out of Solstice robes and making less profitable stuff, but skilling up.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps - but LOY robes success rate is very high - so be prepared to vendor them in the bazaar or to merchants.  Even at 200 I succeeded 60/63 times with a trivial of 232, no geerlok.<br />
<br />
Edit: At 200, with 284 int, no geelok I got 1 skill up per stack.  This has been constant with LOY robes for me since 180 tailoring and my int was much lower then (221).</div></div><hr />
