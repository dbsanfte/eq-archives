This just made me think of the NASA shuttle with the teacher on board. Then other things going on in America today and I just wanted to say to everyone who is an EMT, Cop, Firefighter, and anyone in any part of the US Forces;<br />
THANK YOU!!!!<br />
Thank you for everything you do for us as a country, as people and as humans. I thank my father for being a volunteer EMT for 25 years and instilling so much on me, my Grandfather for fighting in WW2. So many people to thank. Please, always remember you are needed and appreciate. Please be safe.</div></div><hr />
