I took my 65th shaman to the Northman forge in Halas, and proceeded to put the smithy hammer, imbued ivory, large patchwork boot pattern, Large chainmail boot pattern, frost temper, and 1 infused MQ boning (just like the recipe says to do) and it rejected me, tried 2 bonings and no cigar.<br />
<br />
SO just wondering if it is bugged, or what i am doing wrong. Tattered and Patchwork peices of clothing are both made with a ruined bear hide and appropriate pattern, so don't think it is that.<br />
<br />
If anyone can help I would really appreciate it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The Infused MQ Boning is made from Velium Bonning, Small Brick of MQ Ore, Smithy Hammer and Celestial Temper (which needs Blue Diamond Powder and Purified Water).<br />
<br />
And to comfirm, the ivory was imbued by a Shaman Correct?<br />
<br />
You have stated the recipe correctly, sometimes simple things can get you twisted around... basically double check all the items you are using, and that you are using the Cultural Forge, versus the non-cultural one... and you ARE a Barbarian trying it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The recipe (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=4527&amp;menustr=035000000000) calls for large patchwork boots (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=2138) NOT a large patchwork boot pattern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ahh... sometimes I see too many trees, I believe Renjah has stated the problem correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krystahls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">nope i just wrote it wrong like a lil newbie, we did put the patchwork boots in, and the right boning, and temper, and smithy hammer. And yes the ivory was mass imbued by my shaman. All i can think of is maybe it doesn't require a large boot chainmail pattern like the website says. or maybe we where in too much of a hurry and did something wrong. I will try again tonight. Thanks for posting and i will let you'll know what we did wrong. If anything  :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aethn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Double check which forge you used.  I have done that before in Halas, had me frustrated for 30 min until I realized I had turned 180 and used the wrong forge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Galain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Are you maybe putting in a Tannan Smithing Hammer instead of a regular?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Confirmed that the recipe from the DB works.  <br />
<br />
I made a pair for my BL, with the tunic and sleeves... and then found out he worships Mith Maar...<br />
