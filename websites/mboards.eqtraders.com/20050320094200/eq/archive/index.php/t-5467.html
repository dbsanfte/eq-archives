<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vordok</div><div class="date">03-28-2003, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whenever I try to turn on dopropertinting, all character models turn into black blobs. Search revealed one post that suggested that older video cards might have a problem, but my card is fairly new (a GeForce3 Ti 200 with 64MB bought about a year ago).<br />
<br />
What I'm wondering is if either a) there is some other setting I need to tweak (either in EQ or with my card) or b) someone knows what the specs needed for dopropertinting are (such that I can confirm that my card can't support it, as opposed to maybe it being a setting issue).<br />
<br />
My apologies if this is considered off-topic. I ran into it while trying to get armor dying to work.</div></div><hr />

My friend had this same problem and I found that suggestion on the Tech Support boards.  He tried it and it worked for him, too. :)<br />

Oh, bumping this to OOC, as it's unrelated to tradeskills.</div></div><hr />

I feel sort of stupid now, since I thought I had covered all the technical bases (upgraded Direct X, went to the EQ support site and read through the knowledge base, et cetera).<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.<br />
