<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pootle</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hollowshade is a zone that has an 'permanent' War going on it it.  Between the 3 factions Owlbear, Wolf, and Grimlings.  Now first thing that needs to be mentioned is that this war is --- VERY BUGGED<br />
<br />
What has happened in your case is that the Wolfs have attacked and won a battle against the Owlbears.  Thus the owlbear cave is now populated by wolfs.<br />
<br />
TO end the war the entire zone must be taken over by one faction, including the Vah-SHir outpost.  Once this has happened, a Named will spawn in the outpost.  WHen this named is killed, the zone is reset.<br />
<br />
I have personally killed the final Grimling and Owlbear.<br />
<br />
NOTE: the nameds corpse lasts for like 10 seconds even if it has loot, so get those items quick.  They are NODROP too.<br />
<br />
Off the grimling i got some Mask and a 1HB (skull on a stick) both were pretty crap.<br />
From the Owlbear i got a SWEET range item (see my magelo  click my sig name) which i often get asked about as i dont think many people at all have got.<br />
<br />
NOTE: I do not know how to control the war, how to help any of the factions or activate/trigger the battles.<br />
<br />
I have only killed the named leaders by being lucky to be in the zone at the time.</div></div><hr />

I have heard that if you kill a Owlbear|Sonic|Gimling defender(s), then that faction will loose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llwyd</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can find a lot of discussion about the Hollowshade war in the smithing forum. This is because one of the best ways to skill past 188 in smithing is to make shadowscream armor, which requires components from owlbears and sonic wolves. Hollowshade is the best place to farm stacks and stacks of these components.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pojodan</div><div class="date">01-12-2003, 04:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen the Moor taken over completely by each of the three races and each time the Vah Shir outpost stays the same without any named that can be killed the reset the place.<br />
<br />
It's nice to know that at one point it WAS working, but now it seems it's simply a place for smithers to farm components and Vah Shir questers to get irritated (Not like getting the peices for the dang Sonic Wolf Bane weapons isn't a pain in the rear as it is)</div></div><hr />
