<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>smirnof</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello =D  I just started working brewing.  And I got to 188 skill in no time at all.  Now I was getting ready to start making Minotaur Hero's Brew, but when I typed it in under the new UI, it didn't come up as an option.  I looked up the ingredients on this website, but it didn't show a good location where I can get the ingredients so I could do it manually.  Why would the recipe not come up under the new UI?  I had the same problem when trying to make Faydwer shakers...  But once I had raised my skill closer to trivial it came up under the search.  Anything Im doing wrong?  And where is a good place where I can buy the ingredients to the Minataur combine near a brewer?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Goto expirment and do the combine in there a coupleof times until you create one brew. Then it should be on your recipe list. <br />

BTW i did mine in shadow haven, no one was there and i could work with no problem. If you have GOD you can do it on the boat also.</div></div><hr />

All the brewing supplies can be bought from a merchant right next to the barrel.  The water can be bought from a merchant right around the corner from the bar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Halas is another wonderful location. Every item can be found on the 2 merchants next to the barrel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>smirnof</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thank you soo much.  A friend of mine said Shadowhaven, but I couldn't buy from them.  Did a quick quest for the faction mod necklace, and found out they didn't have my ingredients =D  I finnally found my nook in Quenos.  I knew that town was good for something :D <br />
<br />
Im almost 248 now, I read a lil bit about the combine to get from 248-250.  The ingredients are found near kaladim?  TY again, the info is most helpful.<br />

is a thread helping with the groundspawns of the two funguses you need for the combine. The recipe isn't too bad, as long as you have the patience to camp the groundspawns. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I got my last 2 skillups on the Kaladim's as well. Iirc, it was about a 1 in 40 ratio. Not that bad if the ground spawn isn't contested on your server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everything but the water is found on the two merchants right next to the brew barrel.  Water, unfortunatly, is only to be found clear on the other side of town in the next zone over.  Grab a tailored backpack (or other 10 slot container) and stock up to do a batch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>arturio emerys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Abysmal Sea is a great place to do all kinds of tradeskills.  There are 2 vendors near a brew barrel that sells everything you need to do MHBs.  Ones name is Dray Cuves.<br />
