<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sylphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I see there are currently 574 traders up on my server.  Anyone know what the limit is now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The limit is believed to be 600, but I don't know for sure.  One thing that seems evident, though, is that there is not enough trader space in the bazaar anymore.  600 people all trading at once, you have to literally crawl thru people to get to the one who has the item you want.  It's time to expand the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nanndas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wonder if it was changed with the recent patch. Just prior to it I got out of trader mode in the morning to go buy some veggies and upon returning to my spot couldn't back into trader mode. The limit was 550 and I guess someone was waiting also. I also agree with how crowded some areas (around the bankers) are and trying to target a certain trader..<br />
<br />
<br />
Nan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah the limit has been 550 since they raised it last time, and I've run into that same situation of not being able to set back up when 550 is hit. So if it's higher now, that's definitely new (and welcome). I like setting up more towards the back anyway; I hate it when some ogre sits on top of my trader :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Benthair Dunthat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Limit was raised during last patch, no word on what it is now. Actually plent of room in the back of the baz, but everyone wants to be right by the bankers for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I too vote for more room in the bazaar. Or at least make a second bazaar.. or make Shadowhaven /trader-able.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Itek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">???<br />
<br />
Um... maybe I'm missing something...<br />
<br />
With 550+ traders 24/7 on my server I was able to position a trader and had no problems getting customers. Sold over 50% of my stock in under a day.<br />
<br />
I then visited 3 different traders and bought things from them with zero troubles.<br />
<br />
Clue: Position a trader further away from the two banks than the first half of the first two sections.<br />
<br />
I remember when &quot;find trader&quot; came out. I'd had no trouble finding people with the &quot;right click to face&quot; method, but I'm an Eagle Scout and spent two years in college ROTC so I'm pretty good at finding my way around. Everyone complained about it so I tried it out. Best thing since &quot;no weight effects in the bazaar&quot; in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Seriously, move your raggedy trader 75 feet farther from the bank. You won't have a single problem with people not able to buy from you. &quot;This ogre came and blocked me.&quot; ... Move.<br />
<br />
They aren't going to make the zone bigger. It's plenty big now and making it bigger won't help a -blessed- thing unless you take the above advice. (If people crowd as close as possible to the bank, what difference does the size of the zone make? None.)<br />
<br />
They aren't going to make a second &quot;bazaar-enabled&quot; zone. That defeats the ENTIRE PURPOSE of HAVING a bazaar in the first place. (Go to GuComics and read about vanguard and the return of &quot;The Vision&quot;(tm) and then go to that website and read the FAQ about &quot;centralized selling places&quot; and realize how good you have it.)<br />
<br />
They aren't going to re-design the zone to have &quot;fixed vendor stalls&quot; which, while they would certainly be an improvement and eliminate crowding, would be a massive coding under-taking. They designed it this way. They like it this way. And Verant/SOE has always taken the &quot;coding is hard&quot; line on changes. Cosmetic changes, fixing typos, re-arranging database info that's cheap and easy. But changing a single line of code is like pulling teeth.<br />
<br />
Trader crowding is a result of &quot;percieved scarcity&quot; and it's all in your mind. With the advent of the &quot;find trader&quot; button you can position yourself as far as possible from the banks and STILL get a brisk business. (THE - VOICE - OF - EXPERIENCE: My trader was a step away from the end of &quot;trader row&quot; closest to the ShadowHaven side of the PvP arena. I sold over 70k pp in product in less then 30 trader hours. And there was even a trader farther yet from the bank standing in front of me. She got several customers just in the time I was watching while I was checking to see what had sold while I was AFK.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What Itek said. Move towards the back, there is always room.<br />
<br />
One idea to help with the stupid crowding around the banks is make that space available by rental only. 10pp per hour or something, could work like the tribute system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I actively avoid buying from Traders near the banks.  Too much hassle to deal with clicking on the speck of visible space to get the right person and the lag, both from the crowd and from having to face the entire rest of the Bazaar.  If I recognize a name of a seller as someone that's near the banks and see someone else selling the same thing for a price that's close enough, I go elsewhere.  <br />
<br />
Er, but more to the topic, when I'm Trader I park on my crate in the back and have gobs of room.  On the few occasions when my crate is occupied, in order to encourage them to go elsewhere I use shrink and duck to worm my way under the person there, grow back to a more visible size, and then sit, so I'm claiming my spot but not blocking them.  But even then, there's tons of room in the adjacent stalls.  <br />
<br />
I'd support just about anything that'd discourage the right-by-the-bank pile...as long as there is not such a clear division that there would just be a pile at the edge where the penalty starts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't think the bazaar needs more room i've noticed on Kane Bayle, while it's gone up to average 250-300, theentire back half is EMPTY with the exception of 5-10 traders, everyone crowds up front by the banks (making it almost impossible to buy somehting).<br />
<br />
If they do incorperate more room, they should add in a &quot;space&quot; limit, and to make finding a &quot;space' easy, they should have to teleport to an open space, the nearest one to where you're standing (?), to aviod &quot;you need more room&quot;style error messages.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They didn't design it this way.  They designed it to have a trader limit of like 300 (or whatever the number was when SoL came out.)  The number now is significantly higher with no additional space.<br />
<br />
They also do a heck of a lot more than just cosmetic changes.  Did you happen to hear about the new graphics engine?  They rewrote the whole engine from scratch to make things better for us, and to take advantage of some of the features in DX 9.  Don't you think the whole 5th anniversary thing took a wee bit of coding?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I just dont understand why everyone crowds around the banks? What the heck? <br />
<br />
I set up shop on my crate back by the arena too (good thing we're on different server Verdandi!) but I also move one way or the other if someone takes &quot;my spot&quot;. I like to keep the same spot (or close to it) because i DO have folks who continue to buy from me and i like being easy to find. Also, the &quot;find&quot; feature doesn't always work so i have my /loc in my AFK message. I've been on my crate since about a week after I started full time trading in October 2002 &gt;&lt; i like consistency!<br />
<br />
LOTS of room toward the arena. If you are one who sets up shop next to the bank, why do you do it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, my bazaar alt is overloaded and slow moving. In order to place cash in the shared bank and retrieve the recently made items to sell, I have to walk to the bank. If my alt was far from the bank, I would have to cut my clip plane drastically or stare at the floor, both of which I find quite annoying.<br />
<br />
Having said that, the stalls near the Shadowhaven bank are much less crowded on Kane Bayle. I can be an easy straight shot from the bank, and still not be crowded next to other vendors.</div></div><hr />

I've carry over 100kpp and 8 trader satchels and still moving fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think he means with the the clipping plane all the up.<br />
<br />
I personally have a kick ass machine and I still can't move through the bazaar without the clipping plane all the way down.</div></div><hr />

  <br />
Nah, the original number was 500, they really haven't raised it that much.  It's just that the extra people are all standing near the banks. <br />
My trader is bound on his spot and I just gate back to it after I buy something/bank.  The first month of the bazaar I moved around some, wondering if you got more sales in different places, but it became pretty obvious that location really doesn't matter since most people use the bazaar search anyhow.  In fact, the only times traderfind doesn't work for me is for people who are close to the banks (though I have heard others say it happens when you stand on an object, that has not been the case for me).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>GunnyBurlfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hehe I like the talk about crates. I have my trader on his crate, and woe be unto you if you try to claim it! I'm positioned behind the tailoring vendors in the bazaar, well away from the utter horror that is the banks.<br />
<br />
My trader has been up on that crate since the Bazaar first was patched to work properly. He has never moved, nor will move until the servers go offline for good, or until I find another online game that forever takes my attention. (SWG did not.)</div></div><hr />

Seriously, when we can /tar just about anything and use another /command to interact with it, why should we be tied to only being able to initiate a PC trader with right-click.  Just silliness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Lag?  I don't have much, I set the view up so I have an overhead view of my toon, with a slow (by today's standards) computer, I've gotten very proficient at navigating zones like Shadowhaven, Bazaar, PoK, and PoI in that view, and I probabaly navigate much better than a lot of people with the normal view!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I keep my trader by the SH bank.  Why?  Well, I used to sell in the back, but the runs to the bank were a pain.  I'm close to a bank, and the SH bank isn't too crowded on my server.  Nexus bank, on the otherhand, is a madhouse.  <br />
<br />
I think they should let us buy from the /bazaar window.  That would make things so much easier then running around from merchant to merchant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I stand way in the back near the SH entrance to the PVP arena as well. I rarely set up shop anywhere else. The run to the bank takes me a grand total of 15 seconds or less. :boggled: How is that inconvenient? Yo No Comprendo.<br />
<br />
I to personally avoid anyone who's trader is set up near the banks. It doesn't matter which side of the Bazaar you're on on Xegony, the trader stalls nearest the bank are aweful!</div></div><hr />

I COMPLETELY agree. I rarely use my mouse while playing anyway.. it'd be so nice if there was a command to browse someone's wares, instead of having to right-click on them when they're inside 30 other people.</div></div><hr />

~Viola!  Verdandi's merchant wares are now available to browse. The problem with that is &quot;U&quot;(se) tends to be the equivalent of clicking in the approximate middle of the screen.  While that tends to work fine for things such as doors and NPC merchants, for piles of corpses and closely crowded traders, you're far more likely to &quot;U&quot;se a merchant different than intended.  Also, &quot;U&quot; doesn't help for those cases where you can't see the merchant and thus don't have any idea of where to face (but you can /target them) - though its been a while since I've run into this bug.<br />
<br />
Edit-Anyhow, it seems to be a moot point, since &quot;U&quot; on a /trader just targets them :( It will open an NPC merchant's window, but not a PC's, it seems.<br />
<br />
They gave us the /loot command to deal with hard-to-reach and hard-to-click corpses; an equivalent command for merchants would be handy.</div></div><hr />

If U truly doesnt work (will have to check when I get online tonite) then a /shop command would be a great tool comparable to teh /loot command, completely agree with you.  /feedback !</div></div><hr />

Normally within 2 sections of the absolute back.  I hate having to find a trader up the near the banks.  Its not like people need to be found by trolling up and down the rows of stalls anymore.<br />
<br />
Even with my beefy systems i still lag in the bazaar - I generally just turn clip plane down and watch the floor - works fine with me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I always go to the back of the zone when I put up my trader,. Not just because the lag isn't as bad back there, but also because the nimrods who use tricks to make people go LD so they can steal their spot always seem to go for spaces up front.<br />
<br />
I would, however, like to see a second zone for trading, instead of them just increasing the # of trader slots in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
(I don't suppose moving the LDON camp out of the EC tunnel and closer to the WC zone line, then making a second Bazaar there would be possible?...... ;)  )</div></div><hr />

When you kill a mob and it dies and drops out of your target window, press U to get the corpse back in your window, and C to con and see if it has more than 30 sec, and you should bother looting it or not. <br />

I use this when boxing on the laptop with that little square-touchpad-excuse for a mouse; U + /loot + Alt + Esc-key = muuch easier. <br />
