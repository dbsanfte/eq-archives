<br />
Here's a question. When you're training for tailoring (or anything else), should you work on something until it trivials, or move on to a higher product first?<br />
<br />
Imagine I'm at 125 Tailoring (which is true). Should I continue to make Wu's waistbands until they trivial at 128, or do I have a better chance of leveling with Wu's mask, which trivials at 135? Or does it not matter?<br />

You could move on to the next item, but people usually only do so if that is the cheapest route.  As long as you are working at something above your skill, your skillups shoud appear.  <br />
<br />
There is some discussion about whether or not some types of tailored goods give skillups more frequently than others.  Some have said they see very few skillups on Velious tailored goods compared to other items like solstice robes, but that is a debate yet to be conclusively resolved.<br />

With Crystalline or Wu's, depending on what you wanted to make, you may use 1, 2, 3 or more Swatches.  If you can find an item that requires 1 equal to or higher than an item that requires 2 Swatches or more, go with the lower number required until it trivials to save on components.  This way, you won't have to go farm components or go buy them as quickly.<br />
