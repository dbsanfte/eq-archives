<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turlo Lomon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've seen recipes listed quite a few different ways.  Some of the sillier ones indicated the era they were added (which is all subject to opinion).  Anyway, my idea...<br />
<br />
Should be track the in-game sources on recipes?  Currently we have the fields, but I have yet to come across a recipe that has it populated.  <br />
<br />
For example, Small Bowl.  Under sources would list &quot;Basic Pottery&quot;, which had a link to the book text.<br />
<br />
We could also have transcripts of NPC conversations that give out recipes, etc.  <br />

(This is the type of info my personal website used to have before it was nuked).</div></div><hr />
