<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lyron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, so I was trying to explain stat food to my mother, who does not play EQ.  When I got done, she said:<br />
<br />
So it's like vitamins, but you don't eat the vitamins, you just carry them around in your pocket, and they work like that?<br />
<br />
And I had to say, yes, and in fact, the goal is to stuff yourself so full that you never get hungry enough to eat the vitamins.<br />
<br />
EQ's weird sometimes :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Healblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Or, you need to keep the vitamins very very close to you, but you have to make sure you don't get hungry.  Otherwise the vitamins would be the closest (first) food you'd eat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I force feed myself Summoned Food/Water this keeps me from eating my Stat food.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kcalehc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think the easiest answer would be 'Because it's Magic'.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It the old saying, &quot;Having is not so pleasing a thing as wanting; its not logical but its often true.&quot;  Thus it is with food in EQ - the thought of that delicious, tasty, tantilizing meal invigorates body and mind, boosting it to new heights.  Actually eating it however, you realize that this god-meal you have been dreaming of is nothing more than mortal food, and the effects of the dream are gone.<br />
<br />
Thus you force yourself to eat lesser foods to keep yourself from getting hungry, while keeping the wonderful feast sitting right there as the next thing to eat 'when' you do get hungry.  So you're always savoring the dream-food, but never actually eating it.</div></div><hr />
