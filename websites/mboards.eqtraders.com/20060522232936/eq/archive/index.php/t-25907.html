The GM Smiths Hammer is LORE AND NODROP - but the Trophy task requires that I make one to get credit for it.  Does this mean I have to destroy my original so I can make the new one (hopefully)  and turn it in?<br />

Any advice would be appreciated!<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Read your task.  Read it again.  Read the full text.<br />
<br />
Sorry if I'm repeating myself... but it's something that's been said (and stickied) alot.<br />
<br />
Just show (hand) your trophy to the person who gave you the task... you get credit for having &quot;made&quot; it.</div></div><hr />
