<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nithas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The new GoD arrows:<br />
1. Don't have the magic flag<br />
2. Have higher triv then comparable arrows we can already make, and those at least have a magic flag.<br />
3. Are more annoying to make then acrylic arrows. Found the arrow head parts. Once.  In the bazaar for more cash then it was worth to make.<br />
4. Do crap-tacular damage.  <br />
<br />
Quivers:<br />
1. There's all of 5 in the game.  Why the heck aren't more available?  <br />
2. Halflings already make some wicked-cool bags, you'd think one of them would figure out how to make a quiver.<br />
3. Where the heck do those GoD mobs who use bows put thier stinking arrows?  If they use endless quiver AA skill, why the heck aren't they dropping quivers?  Don't they know you still get quiver haste with Endless Quiver?  Retards.<br />
<br />
Bows:<br />
1. New expansion, can we please get another bow recipie?  Just one?  A rentable one....<br />
2. I got this nice skill, fletching, to 250.  Great, now I'm so broke because the last 10 skill ups took 12k I can't buy parts to make any darned bows... Gotta love a skill I can't even cash in on.  Curse all you enchanters and your stinkin 250 Jewel Craft...<br />
3. Anyone ever notice bows don't have any string?  I mean I remember putting one in the fletching kit when I made my friend a nightmarewood, now it's not there.  Lazy graphics coders...<br />
<br />
200 sense heading:<br />
1. I bound 4 keys to auto-sense heading when I made my first toon so I could always know which way I was goin.  40 levels and I could finally unbind those keys.  Not too long after, EVERYONE has 200 sense heading...  That is so lame.  I want my 1 skill pt back with interest. <br />
<br />
Misc gripes:<br />
1. The cartography thing is cool and all, but I'm astounded by the number of people who can't find thier own butt if you give them the /loc.<br />
2. I love the PoK books, but darned if there aren't a lot of people who'd be S-O-L if they ever got removed.  And think of all those poor druids and wizzys who lost such a nice way to bilk lazy people out of thier hard earned cash.<br />
3. So many people gripe about recommended and required level on gear.  Bah!  I'll admidt, I got twinked when I started, and it only made me have no respect for what I had.  Does a level 1 character REALLY need a fungi tunic, 30% worn haste item and flowing thought gear? I kinda wish all gear had a recommended and required level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>data9724</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hehe, i actually got the opposite problem with the PoK books, we need MORE books.<br />

<br />
I am not sure about the sense heading, since the cartography maps were introduced.  I don't think I ever look at my compass anymore.  I just hit backspace and see where I am on the map.<br />
<br />
Perhaps, someday, some overzealous halfling will discover a new quiver recipie.  But, until that day comes, I would not hold my breath.</div></div><hr />

Works for my main, but I have a level 54 warrior, who is the lucky recipient of my tradeskilling, who cannot gate. Just had him in Sirens last night, for a guildmate's shawl farming, which is why this came to mind.<br />
<br />
He also has no tradeskills. I guess I could get him the OT hammer, since hes a zek worshipper, and therefore not KOS in the outpost. For the same reason, hes still KOS in skyshrine, as I don't want to blow his kael faction.</div></div><hr />

:upsidwn:  <br />
<br />
heh, what I find funny is that the shaman gate-to-city potions are now actually cheaper than the vial of velium vapors.<br />
<br />
Small pieces of velium still sell for 100pp on Tunare, and the vial requires 4 (2 pieces + 1small brick can yield 4 pieces), making the cost 400pp (+ the other material costs) for anyone who /traders a decent bit.  The shaman gate-to-city have a cost of 168pp (by the Prices pages) and the Gate has a cost of 252pp.  Even if you add in the periodic failures and mark up for a bit of profit, if you can find a shaman selling them they're much cheaper than the Velium Vapors.  Which seems unfortunate to me, I always liked the Velium potions since they were nice, cheap, and self-sufficient for any class.<br />
<br />
But ya, being able to get to/from CS would be nice.  At this point I only rarely go there, and when I do I make sure its for a large enough run - 200 minimum of the sauces/spices and 400+ brown algae - otherwise its not worth the hastle of hunting down a porter (they seem to be especially reluctant to port to CS and IC, I've found, especially for anything less than 100pp (one way)) or harrassing a friend.<br />
<br />
Running the full path back would certainly be interesting - currently KoS to both giants and dragons ;)  (I don't have the key either, but the key is only needed for SS-&gt;CS)</div></div><hr />

You'd need to get well above not KoS to get the hammer, and it has a disturbing habit of being slow to proc when you need it most (why no, I've never meleed and lifetapped a wyvern to death fearkiting while waiting for my OT hammer to proc).<br />

OT faction is pretty difficult to raise and somewhat easy to trash, especially for older characters.</div></div><hr />

i am lazy, i ask for ports to CS for my 2 toons.  i also volunteer a mod rod, kei and cash for the service.  also respect the answer of sorry am busy right now =).  i can run it, but my farming time is limited sometimes, so i prefer to just have the 1 zone time to get there and kill them dern othmirs (must remind someone to have them drop more fur for me kkthx).<br />
<br />
i miss the courtesy that used to be in the game.  it is all about getting there now, fast, over the top of whomever is perceived to be in front of you... i zoned into nederia and wandered around (yes i know its been there a while, but i live in CS when not raiding) and stopped to stare at the waterfall for a long time, what a nice spot for a picnic (when i have timeto make us a picnic again).  <br />
<br />
i miss bards, creating and singing songs in RM while everyone camped the poor giants.  it added so much to the role playing. (another thing i miss, even tho i amhorrid at it, i like to try).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a note: you need F9 to find your butt. The /loc doesn't help.<br />
<br />
Actually, the loc  does help a bit to start, although you'll need to be a tracker also..  Once you get to the loc of your butt, then tracking will tell you where it is.  It is a bit bugged, and often peopel will unknowingly move passed where their butt is, and it will jump on track from &quot;it is ahead of you&quot; to &quot;it is behind you&quot; very quickly.  When this happens, you should stop and turn 180 degrees immediatly... and recheck tracking to see if you've actually passed it, or if it's a side effect of low tracking skill.  You may have to turn around repeatedly sometimes to get your tracking to reaquire your butt, and occasionally your butt may warp back to it's spawnpoint. <br />
<br />
With the inherant flaws of the tracking system, you should consider /bug, and /feedback, when these anomilies occure.  BTW, just to expidite this so as to be most helpful to the devs, when you do /bug this, make sure to mention if you have both hands free or not... for some reason they need this info.. so i think they're onto the coding problem that is making it hard for many people to find their own butts.<br />
<br />
Make no mistake though, this is a serious problem... and not to be poked fun at, or have jokes made about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is there an idiot-proof guide to loc? Because I've never, ever, felt deprived by not knowing, or caring, how to use it. Especially since, from the year dot, if you /ooc a negative number, the - is deleted. Fantastic! Cue even MORE running around in circles!<br />

How odd.  Usually, the stain I leave is notably not Halfling-shaped any more.  It's only when I'm nuked into nothingness that I stay Halfling-shaped, and then it's a Halfling-shaped scorch mark.<br />

The day tracking tells me my butt is ahead of me is a bad one.  I once asked a ranger, &quot;Give me a /loc for your butt so I can find you!&quot; and he said that tracking said his butt was about to be handed to him, but from behind, as expected.<br />
<br />
But all of this does not address the fact that you must use F9 to find (that is, actually see) your butt.<br />
<br />
Seriously, though, I've found it's easy to remember which way is which if you print out a map from EQAtlas (any map will do) and just note the location markers on the edge, or even just draw up a cheat on a little note and stick it on your monitor.  That way, when you need to react quickly to a /loc (I have to do this all the time as a healer), you can glance and go.<br />

You need the key to get out of SS, not to get into it. <br />
Its only &quot;strange&quot; because of the Velious history, since originally you *couldn't* get to Cobalt scar without going through Skyshrine (and thus getting the key first), I guess they felt it was unnecessarily redundant (and an extraneous extra &quot;key you need to keep with you&quot;), so they left the other direction unlocked.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Reflan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Things that cheese me off:<br />
<br />
1.  Someone thinking that if you don't respond to their real or imagined camp check calls, you don't own the camp, or that you even owe them a response.  Sometimes you're fighting and too busy to see their call, sometimes same with chatting, sometimes you have /ooc off and/or /shout channel off because you're tired of hearing the endless spam of strangers.  Nobody owes anyone a response on camp check calls, and the lack of a response doesn't mean it's suddenly open season on someone's camp.  That's fake courtesy, not real courtesy; what's really courteous is if you come upon a camp and someone's on it, don't suddenly try to claim it or &quot;accidentally&quot; train them.  Especially if it's a camp that obviously has to be cleared to or worked for before you can even get there.  I've seen some people only able to get to a camp because I cleared the way there pop in out of nowhere after I'd been in a camp for hours and tell me it was their camp!  Puh-lease.<br />
<br />
2.  People who ask me the very instant I zone in somewhere for buffs.  Jeez, you don't even know where I am!  And I don't necessarily want to get in a big fat conversation with you about it and give you directions, or come running to you so I can enjoy the opportunity to buff you.  If you see me near you and I'm relatively stationary, it's one thing, but give me a minute to get my bearings, then ask.  And no, I do NOT want to run to you.  Not even for 20pp.  If you're doing the buff begging, YOU do the running.  When I'm in the mood to buff at all, buffs are free, but not when you aggravate me.<br />
<br />
3.  People who spam buff requests.  Random strangers are nobody's highest priority.  If I don't respond after a while, either move on or try again.  A request every few seconds is just a guaranteed way either to not get buffed, to get my worst buffs, or to get on my /ignore list so you never get buffs or anything else from me ever again.<br />
<br />
4.  People who don't say even a simple please or thanks.  <br />
<br />
5.  People who are actually involved in a give and take conversation and respond by not answering and/or pretending not to have heard.  Example:  some tradeskill stuff drops in a camp.   You ask if you can have some of the tradeskill stuff that drops -- not the stuff that's worth 20k that everyone should roll on, just the minor stuff someone will probably sell to a vendor for a few plat, which I'd be willing to pay more for if I had to.  You don't ask for the world, just a reasonable share of what everyone's getting.  Response:  silence.  Just have the cojones to say, No, I'm selling this and then we're all splitting the profit(at which point I can say, well, I'll be happy to buy it from you for what the vendor would charge or even more, so nobody loses out on any money).  Or, No, I'm a greedy bastard who doesn't give a **** about anybody else in the group and I'm keeping everything for myself and you can't have any, but at least I have the guts to admit it and not just try to slink around like a creep about it and hope nobody notices me trying to pull a fast one even when it's completely obvious what a jerk I'm being.</div></div><hr />

Things that cheese me off:<br />
<br />
1.  Someone thinking that if you don't respond to their real or imagined camp check calls, you don't own the camp, or that you even owe them a response.  Sometimes you're fighting and too busy to see their call, sometimes same with chatting, sometimes you have /ooc off and/or /shout channel off because you're tired of hearing the endless spam of strangers.  Nobody owes anyone a response on camp check calls, and the lack of a response doesn't mean it's suddenly open season on someone's camp.  That's fake courtesy, not real courtesy; what's really courteous is if you come upon a camp and someone's on it, don't suddenly try to claim it or &quot;accidentally&quot; train them.  Especially if it's a camp that obviously has to be cleared to or worked for before you can even get there.  I've seen some people only able to get to a camp because I cleared the way there pop in out of nowhere after I'd been in a camp for hours and tell me it was their camp!  Puh-lease. <br />
<br />
<br />
People who don't respond to camp checks are even more inconsiderate.   <br />
<br />
If you can't be considerate enough to spend two seconds to type out the response 2-4 letter response, and save me the 5-10 minute run across dangerous ground to get to a camp that you're too busy to call, after I call out in Shout and OOC multiple times, and then announce that I am heading to the camp, and claiming it,   then I'm not the one causing the disturbance.<br />
<br />
Camps are normally abbreviated into 2-4 letters, or a short word for this reason.  No matter how busy you are, you have time for this.    The only exception I can think is if you are high speed, unsnared kiting.  (Think HoH sentries.)     As a kiter by nature, and having dot-kited and quad kited in Uper tiers of PoP,  I can safely say that no situation is so bad that you can't, after a minute or two, call the camp.<br />
<br />
Patricipating in the self-policing concept of &quot;Camps&quot; that we players have agreed upon, but snuffing the concept of the camp check is inconsistant and , as I've mentioned before, inconsiderate.<br />
<br />
<br />
 (Mods, if this comes across as name calling, let me know and I'll try to clean it up.   I'm calling his actions, and perhaps the reasons behind them, inconsiderate.  I tried to avoid name-calling.)<br />

<br />
I have many times been in a situation where even the 4 letter abreviation response = death.  Heck MSOT of the time... I do not even know the 4 letter abrevation for where the heck I am.  Heck... being a quad kiter... I have hade messages scrolled off my screen before I ever saw them.<br />
<br />
I myself almost never ask and instead go look.  *I* am the one looking for a camp... *I* am responsible for finding myself a camp, not the people already in the zone.<br />
<br />
If I spend 5 or 10 minutes getting to a camp and it is taken... all I do is &quot;oh well&quot; and move on.<br />
<br />
Yes I do call camp checks sometimes.... but more often than not I just go and look.<br />
<br />
To me this is more of what america is doing... constantly making OTHER people responsible for your actions.<br />
<br />
but that is my opinion of it, and just mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Saleani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I frequently have ooc and shout turned off. If I have to do tradeskilling in PoK, they are turned off. If I am on a raid, they are turned off. If I stop in the bazaar for shopping, they are turned off. If blithering idiots are blabbing in ooc and shout, and refuse to take it to tells (or get a room), they get turned off (I still think BoThunder should be a pvp zone).<br />
<br />
If you think someone is inconsiderate for not responding to ooc and shout, they most likely have those channels turned off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Mileron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">2. People who ask me the very instant I zone in somewhere for buffs. <br />

<br />
In BoT the other night on my cleric, I had someone offer me 400pp for Virtue!  Now, Virtue is a 1000 mana spell, and even with SCM2, takes a huge chunk out of 3400 mana.  And the people who were asking, asked right after they'd trained and wiped my group out... (think Minis from Tables to the zonein) and just didn't understand that, after 5 rezzes with no clicky, and six virtues... I had NO mana to be buffing them, while my group was pulling.  And my group is certainly not going to stop, for the same reasons above.  <br />
<br />
Luckily, we were able to move into the north wing finally, and my /afk message of 'No, I am not doing Virtue for donations.  Thanks, and have a good night' helped ward off the beggars.</div></div><hr />

I paused, for a bit, and held off on responding so that I could better put my thoughts to words.<br />
<br />
It seems , to me, that if we are going to adopt certian systems and customs to peacefully coexist, then it would be neccessary for both parties involved to cooperate.<br />
<br />
Lord knows I've quadded.   From Cougars to Valorian Guards, I've been there.    And I've seen the text scroll off of my screen faster then I can respond to it all.  But I must be a quicker typer than most, since I always find the time to call my camp.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*shrug*   It's not about making other people responsible for my actions, Mr Ogre Man.   It's about making people responsible for their own participation in society.  <br />
<br />
We can't seclude ourselves off in the middle of nowhere, and refuse to communicate, and expect people to know what we're doing.People who turn off OOC and Shout, are effectively shutting themselves down from communicating with the people who wish to share a playing space with them. <br />
<br />
If a person is hunting, and refusing to listen to anything else that someone has to say, then they have in essence said that they are going to do what they want, regardless of what other people think.   They have already stopped listening and communicating.<br />
<br />
<br />
And , at that point, they've ceased being considerate.<br />

<br />
I filter OOC and shout to a separate window, and they're always on.  I respond to camp checks because I'd expect the same courtesy when I make camp checks.<br />
<br />
I've never been in a situation where I can't take the seconds it takes to type the response to the camp I'm in or near. And I make a point of learning the names of the camps so I can respond to checks properly.</div></div><hr />

How about a compromise.  It is not *ALWAYS* rude to not respond to a camp check :)  <br />
<br />
I can agree with that.  Doing it consistently, with a rationale of 'I'm tired of answering them', is rude.   Especially if you then complain because someone came to your camp, maybe taking some of 'your' mobs on the way there.  Missing a camp check because you are busy, is not rude.  Miscalling it because you don't know the 'preferred name' is also not rude.  (And lord knows I've fallen into that category on countless occasions.  I responded to a camp check in Seb with, 'some random bridge' once.   I think it turned out to be 'B3').</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Sulkano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">And who are we to judge others participation in society? Most of us are busy enough being responsible for ourselves. We should all consider oursleves lucky when someone acknowedges our presence, let alone opens some sort of meaningful communication. Generaly when someone is complaining about another being uncooperative and inconsiderate it means that person has something they want and wont share.<br />

EDIT: hmm, ate my quote and wont let me add it to this post</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">A Halfling, agreeing with an Ogre.  Who'd have thought it?  I turned off OOC the very first time I logged into Everquest, and I've never turned it on since then.  I'm a roleplayer.  I avoid OOC not because it's spammy, but because it is, well, out of character, and that's not the way I like to play.  That said, I have never called a camp check in my life, except for once, in Kedge Keep, in jest.  If I want to hunt somewhere, I go there and see if it's available.  Yes, it's very inconvenient sometimes, but I figure it's my responsibility to find out if a camp is occupied, and if someone doesn't respond to a camp check, it's not my place to decide whether they should have done so.  On the other side of the coin, if I'm fighting in a camp and someone shows up at the camp, I'll share it unless there's a specific reason I'm there, in which case I'll tell them exactly what I'm after, and I'll share anything not directly related to that goal.  That's always struck me as a fair compromise.<br />

From 100,100 to 0,500 is northeast.<br />
<br />
The tricky part of E/W is (1) I always get them mixed up and (2) in a standard map layout and right handed coordinate system, west is negative.<br />
<br />
Loc is your friend anyway.  <br />
<br />
You see this annoyed me a lot to start with. Graphs etc have the horizontal positive to the east so I kept getting turned around using the location as it goes against every other location or plotting system I have used. It still takes me running in directions to see which way the numbers are moving to find a loc. <br />
<br />
The maps were a godsend; the compass too although I had maxxed sense heading on about 4 characters anyhow.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Carmaris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I don't generally respond to camp checks, I don't generally ask for 'em.  I never get uptight if someone pulls a random mob from my &quot;camp,&quot; I only get annoyed about a named if it's something I've been camping for a specific drop.  If someone isn't keeping their camp clear--I'm talking leaving a mob up for 5+ minutes--and that mob is non-named and has something I want/need, I have no qualms about pulling it.<br />

On the exit to CS from PoM, I'm still curious about that.  Zoned in there the other day and didn't see anything outside the castle that looked like an obvious zone out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Its not obvious. Its invisible. <br />
<br />
If youre on the zone-in pad, go DUE NORTH (or whatever direction it is directly towards the fake bridge at the castle).<br />
<br />
As you move forwards, click around the screen. Youll get a 'that is too far away' message... and eventually youll click on it, and port into CS.</div></div><hr />

Southmost part of the zone, on the river, just in the cave is a little bitty doll house.  Click on that to get into PoM.</div></div><hr />
