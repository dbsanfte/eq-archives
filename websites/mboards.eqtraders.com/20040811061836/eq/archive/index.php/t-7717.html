<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ilona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From my own personal experience (not tried fire stuff yet  :cry:), I'd say 230 is fine to try it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
just 2 more and I will have a 2nd attempt as backup</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>matteo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wow.  3 skillups on 200 combines is horrible.  You are probably better off doing robes right now Bart.  I am still failing on AWM about 50% of the time at 236.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">im not too happy with the current potc robe market.<br />
<br />
swatchs for 30pp each<br />
robes selling for 700pp each<br />
<br />
I dont have that much farm time.. and the # of subcombines is starting to really get annoying...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>matteo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No doubt the market is messed up right now.  I was able to get about 70 combines worth of silk at 10pp per swatch before everything went up.  I am hoping that will take me to 239.  After that it's all AWM.  I don't even bother trying to sell robes anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ilona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am still failing on AWM about 50% of the time at 236.<br />
Expect to continue to fail about 50% of the time at 250 skill.<br />
<br />
And the market has been messed up for ages.  It went from 2400pp per solstice robe to 600pp per robe while Gwen was skilling up.<br />
<br />
I have made approximately 3 solstice robes since then, all for friends/guildies.<br />
<br />
Come to think of it, I've made exactly two items for sale since hitting 250 skill... I moved on to smithing and watched the same happen to the sickle market  :roll:   Thankfully I'll be out of that soon too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">using another &quot;quick and easy&quot; method to gain some points that require no farming of uncommon drop components.  now that I have at least 220 smithing, going to do the Acid Wash portion of the Aid Grimel quest to raise smithing a few points and it only requires running back and forth from the quest NPC and the forge each attempt.  can do about 20 times in about a hour.. which I think is pretty good for having only about 6pp cost per attempt (acid wash requires 3 CEs)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ilona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If I had the flags, Bartox, I'd do that too :)</div></div><hr />

after the first 40 combines.. thought the RNG was going to h8 on me.. but made up for in the next 60.. and got a total of 6 skillups on my last batch of AWM combines... bringing me up to 223 and now I can attempt the tailoring part of the aid grimel quest..    *cross fingers and toes and eyes*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">woot!! grats on the skill up's!  GL on the Grimel Robe :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">reached the 230 mark... should I try.. or should I wait...  hmm... going to do another 100 AWM combines and then see where my luck takes me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ilona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If you have more ingredients for skillups anyway, do those first.<br />
<br />
Otherwise yes, I'd give it a go at 230+geerlok.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />
<br />
PS If you succeed first try, I know a little druid that would love to get her hands on any leftover saps :D</div></div><hr />

still chugging along with smithing... i have much farmage needed for the last push in tailoring to get 9 points... and my interest is probably at a all time low... (thx vacation)</div></div><hr />

&quot;How are you fixed for tempers?&quot; he asked, looking at his rapidly depleting supply of plat.  Now that Euell can sit in PoJ and forage justice fruit, he needs something to be able to do between presses -- 400+ CEs would fill the time rather well.</div></div><hr />

I have been doing Sickles here and there, no real rush atm since the prices on sickles have fluctuated back and forther (almost on a hourly basis) that it doesnt give me any reason to pump out 100 combines worth just to make the last stretch for 250 smithing.   However, I may mix in some Cultural pieces just to break the monotomy.  <br />
<br />
Imbued Emeralds<br />
Celestial Essence<br />
Mistletoe Tempers <br />
<br />
getting these items in quantity will certainly speed up the process for sure, if one desired to help. <br />
<br />
If I dont have platinum, I could always offer other goodies in trade.</div></div><hr />

I've got two stacks of mistletoe on Euell, getting ready to whip up some tempers, and I've probably made, oh, 20 bajillion CEs since the recipe came out.  I need to eventually get 3 sickles for him (one for each earring, one to actually fight with) so I'm CERTAIN we can work something out.  <br />
<br />
Quantities, please?</div></div><hr />

I'm one of the sickle sellers, and obviously I match the lowest price on the market...it annoys me to no end that someone is always lowering the price by 25pp or so...and then after a while he logs off.  :p<br />
<br />
Good luck with smithing...I did sickles for my last few points, and I got a pretty good skillup rate off of them, too.</div></div><hr />

6 stacks of each? (tempers, dusts, CEs)  <br />
<br />
I don't know how I missed this, but anyway...<br />
<br />
I've got my shammy, oh he of the most empty packs, working on the 12 stacks of CE, and Euell rounding up the Elvin wine and mistletoe.  <br />
<br />
I don't have any imbued emeralds, but if you have them/can get your hands on them, I can dust them for you.  <br />
<br />
Don't sweat it if it turns out my delay means you no longer need the CE or the temper -- I'll either use them myself or move them to my trader, and I'm sure I can get my money back.  Otherwise, they're yours.  Probably by mid week at the latest.</div></div><hr />
