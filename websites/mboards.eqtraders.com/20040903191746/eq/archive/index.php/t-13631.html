<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sir_Toland</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i am just kinda curious if anyone counted how many hides they used to skill up using studded hopper hides.<br />
<br />
i just finished wu's and i have been collectiong supberb and flawless hides.  so far i have about 5stacks of each.  a friend told me he thinks it should take about 10stacks of supberb to get past studded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sir_Toland</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">:D  even guesses... if you used Studded Hopper to skill after wu's... just say that you're guessing<br />
<br />
Thanx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As an educated guess I would say about 1 skill up in 20 tries. I also assume you meant Acrylia Studded armor as studded rockhopper is trivial before wu's :) Seeing as there is a 30 point spread I would say about 600 hides or 30 stacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you can also check back in this forum a ways.. there's several posts detailing  peoples journeys from 158 up... with numbers...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Agreed.<br />
<br />
Best bet is to assume 1 in 20. 30 points so 600 hides. Or, if you want to look at it this way, 3 10 slot bags full... :)<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kalelce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just finished a stack of Acrylia studded armors.  I got 2 skill ups in 20 attempts.  My wisdom is somewhere around 205.<br />

PS - Anyone wanna buy some masks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sir_Toland</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I WOULD REALLY HATE TO SEE 1 SKILL UP PER 20 PELTS... BUT EVERYONE KEEPS SAYING THAT.... GOD I ALREADY HATE THAT **** HOPPER TUNNEL AND ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE I HAVE TO CONTEND WITH...  OTHER DAY A DUDE WAS THERE LOOKING FOR A SHARD AND I SAID LETS JUST GROUP TOGETHER I CAN GET HIDES AND YOU CAN GET SHARD... WELL COMES TIME WHEN HE GETS HIS SHARD... AND POOF &quot;OH I GAVE PELTS TO MY BUDDY HE NEEDS MONEY FOR ARMOR...&quot;  DUDE THAT WAS MESSED UP... OFCOURSE ATLEAST I DIDNT HAVE TO FIGHT OVER THE SPAWNS WITH HIM</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Daddo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you think 1 skill up in 20 attempts is bad, it might be best for you to just stop now.  I'd _LOVE_ to get 1 in 20.<br />
<br />
280 wisdom, 223 skill, and I'm averaging 1 skill up every 35 attempts.  The rate was worse between 190 and 210.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sir_Toland</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">haha i saw your title... thats why i pointed it out... just giving you a hard time for giving me a hard time. no hard feelings... it is sometimes hard not to get fustrated about this game... did i use the word &quot;HARD&quot; too much?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Heartsong_Steelsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">And we have a forum for containing those frustrations.  Use that, and we'll all be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kelador Stormwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well I just blew through 3 stacks (60) flawless hopper hides without getting a single skill up (after giving up on Solstice robes because I made 120 of them without any skill ups either...) so I'd say how many you need depends on how lucky you are with the RNG.  It's possible to get 3 or 4 points on a single stack if you're lucky.  Or you could be me. :mad:<br />

BTW current skill is 208, wisdom 305 (maxxed for ranger)</div></div><hr />

Actually can get higher wis than that with your PoP aa's. Look at Innate Enlightenment under PoP Advance.<br />
<br />
Oh to make this post relevent at all - 38 combines, 1 skillup to 188. On top of 20 solstice robes. so 58 total.</div></div><hr />

Except of course that rangers don't get Innate Enlightenment.  If they did you can be sure I'd have it by now ;)  Hybrids are limited to 305 max capped in all stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">One freak time I got 5 skills up in a stack, it’s never happened again! The most I got was about 3, if I was lucky, but mostly it’s about 1 or 2. Since I’m a Wood Elf I started doing Cultural and it seems to be a little more generous on the skill up side, about 2 skill ups per stack consistently, I’ve gotten as much as 3 but it’s pretty much a process of chance.<br />
<br />
I’ve even tried the early morning combines. People have suggested that if you do combines between 6:30am EST to 7:30am EST your chances are better. I’ve done it twice and I’ve not really seen much of a difference. <br />
<br />
I hope with GoD there might be some drops that are a little more time conscious and not involved various camps for drops. I’m currently 191 in tailoring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LoL thanks, didnt know that, well you can always work on your ranger gate aa, or is that maxed? :D<br />
<br />
Interesting tho, i always thought Shamen were thought of as a Hybrid, I men they cant MA, but can melle semi well, and solo.<br />
<br />
AKK sorry off subject  /threadhijack off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">i beleive gate is the divider line.  always thought shamans had a bit too much ac and hp for a &quot;pure&quot; caster but i'm a wizard with paper tissue armor and both hp after buffs.  still lots of respect for shamans.  about the only real casters to melee at high levels.  i don't even have a weapon atm hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>zumavt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I did mostly acrylia studded armor post Wus occasionally getting multiple skillups per stack offset a few times with no skillups for a stack. On average I got better around 1.5 skillups per stack though one should plan for the worst and not get disappointed. <br />
<br />
I took a slightly different approach than most. I made only WIS gear that seems to sell better than other pieces: legs, arms, tunics and cloaks. While this took much longer to buy that much acrylia, I found that I could sell the pieces at break even prices if I didn't pay more than 50pp for bricks. While it took me 5 months to get to 188, I pretty much broke even when you add the profit and a couple of skillups on fleeting quivers. After a stack of combines, it would take a week or two to sell most pieces during which time I'd be buying superb rockhopper and acrylia for the next run.<br />
<br />
Concerning those dismal skillup rate droughts, try exiting the game and restarting. This may only be possible or worthwhile when you have numerous stacks of combines but it has worked for me numerous times to reset the RNG. For example, last weekend I had saved 5 stacks of smithing combines to get from 196 to 200. After getting no skillups with the first two stacks, I logged out and back in and then got 4 stillups in 16 combines.  All I was hoping for was to get the 4 skillups with the last 3 stacks but hit a lucky streak with the RNG. This is one reason why I am still sitting on 5 stacks of wyvern and velium studs, it would crush my morale to get very few skillups so I am saving for one or two restarts if the skillups don't occur in the first stack of two. While this doesn't guarantee a better series of skillups, it may provide for better than average results if the RNG is behaving favorable when I finally get started.<br />
