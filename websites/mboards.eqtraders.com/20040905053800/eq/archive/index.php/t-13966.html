I got to 202..  and thought.. well lets see how hard this can be.. <br />
<br />
After many many trueshot bow combines, darkwood bow combines, and acrylia arrow combines i finally hit 204.  It was then that i decided to quit fletching.  After about eight months i got that itch again.  I looked around and tried to figure out how best to handle it.  I talked to people that were fletchers and i finally decided on darkwoods.  <br />
<br />
So i went to Shadowhaven and started combining darkwood bows.  I made the bow, then i sold it straight to the merchant.  I would say i spent about 8-10k to get trivial with darkwood bows.  Next i looked around and found a friend that had a tinkerer.  He stated that he would sell them to me for 20pp each.  I was happy because with high charisma it's 44pp from vendors. I then tried to strike a deal.  I had a Improved healing 3 item that i didn't need, and his primary was a cleric.  Listed price for the item at that time was 20k.  So he gave me 20k worth of cams.  I had looted the item so it was technically free money.  After those cams ran out from making Darkwood cam bows i started giving him plat.  It only took another 4-5k.  <br />
<br />
Once i hit trivial on Darkwood cam bows, i then used my Tunare ability to do those Blessed Champion arrows.  I would make 160 at a time, and did it 4 times.  Ding 250.  I would guess that i spent around 20k total since those bricks of mithril and the emeralds were expensive.  This is the fastest way i have found, and it wasn't too costly considering other people's posts.  If you are a karana ranger, i feel sorry for you.   <br />
<br />
So i would say ..   if i counted the item i traded for cams i spent about 55k to get it up to 250.  I had 4/5 of planar power, and i decided to get both my wisdom and dex up as high as i could.  I was sporting 290 wisdom and 280 dex when i did combines thanks to some chanter, shammy friends.  I of course had to spend some money beforehand on &quot;fletching gear&quot;  with as much wis/dex i could find.  It seems that it was a good idea making shissar 1h blunt weapons when i got my bane weapons, because they both had 15 wisdom and 12 dex on them.  I always buffed with kei, focus, and diaku when i started fletching.  <br />
<br />
If you don't have the ability to get that much money, good luck foraging/killing to get acrylia arrows and such.  I never had any luck skilling up with them. <br />
<br />
i hope this helps at least one person.</div></div><hr />
