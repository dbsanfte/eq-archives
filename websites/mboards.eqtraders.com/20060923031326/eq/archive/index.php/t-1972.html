<br />
<br />
<br />
Also since my smith is only a lvl 8 ench, what is the most effective way for me to raise my skill up after that? shadow Scream armor is really not easy unless i find someone to kill mobs and allow me to loot the no drop stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

At that point I would say Scream is the best choice. Unless you want to spend a ton of cash and do mistletoe cutting sickles.<br />
<br />
However as a High elven smith I will tell you that getting to the 240ish range is going to be a pain in the backside. I have burned through over 200 morning dew and 150 tempers to go from 202 to 206.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArrakeenNaedShoj</div><div class="date">01-07-2003, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you go to the main page, click the link on the top left that says &quot;Recipes&quot;, then on the subsequent page click the link near the top that says &quot;Cultural Recipes&quot;, then on the subsequent page click the link near the middle that says &quot;High Elven&quot;, It will take you to a page that lists all the recipes and trivial levels for all the various cultural armor for us Highelves. <br />
<br />
At your current skill some of the Enchanted Koada'dal Mithril plate, as well as ALL of the Enchanted/Imbued Koada'dal Mithril Plate is not trivial. The bracers(a one sheet item) do not go trivial until 204, and I would suggest that you go with them before attempting a 3 sheet item for skill. You will be able to use the various Enchanted/Imbued to earn skill all the way up to 240ish. Which with a gearlock, is maximum skill. Meaning, you never have to do shadowscream(or even own SoL, PoP, or for that matter SoV) if you do not want to. <br />
<br />
However, as someone who at 54 still has TREMENDOUS difficulty using this as a skillup method, I do NOT recommend it to others. You will have about a 95% success rate on most of the peices, but otherwise the experience is wholly unpleasant. <br />
<br />
First, unless you have a decent skilled forager, a lot of plat, and or a very high level character you will be killing yourself to get Morning Dew in anything resembling the quantity you will need. Even with all three of those things, you won't get it fast enough. You need 3.5 for every one sheet item, and 2 per sheet beyond that. Since the most I have ever gotten foraging was 3 in a 2 hour period before, this is a HUGE bottleneck, and just a useless annoyance.<br />
<br />
Second and this is more ludicrous, for every peice you will need at least 4 Large Bricks of Mithril enchanted. While this may not seem too important, finding a 49+ enchanter, who isn't raiding, grouping, soloing, farming, or sitting somewhere casting KEI is very difficult to do. Then if you do find them you have to convince them to sit and do the most boring thing ever, cast a spell 3-5 times and then sit and med back up to full(or siphon mana off of you and then med back up to full). That kind of convincing generally does not come cheap, unless you are only doing a peice or two. But you won't be if you are trying to skill up. I normally have to offer 500pp to get someone to enchant 40 bricks of ore for me. Which by the way is enough for about 10 attempts at one sheet items. <br />
<br />
Third, you will need someone to Imbue Emeralds for you. While this isn't a major sticking point for us clerics, everyone else will have to level an alt to 29 to do it themselves(suggest a WE Druid, since it will kill 2 birds with 1 stone). Or find someone willing/selling them and do the exact same thing you had to do to find an enchanter only on a smaller scale.<br />
<br />
And lastly, it's an expensive way to smith. The material components if bought from a vendor are only slightly more expensive total than doing Ornate Chain, but all the incidentals, like enchant/imbue costs, the time/cash spent collecting Dews, etc really add up. Yes you can make a profit selling this stuff back to players. But it is slow to sell for many, and the profit isn't outrageous.</div></div><hr />

Luckily the success rates on enchanted imbued are pretty good (4 for 4 so far) but the dew is killing me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArrakeenNaedShoj</div><div class="date">01-07-2003, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's really nice armor. For clerics, Druids, Pallies, Bards, and Casters that can wear it, it's just about the best twink suit to give a level one. Since It won't need replacing until the 40s or so. And you can go from it, right into BD Cultural/Velious Quest or more Uber gear with out a bunch of unessesary steps in between. Heck many of the peices are better than Planar for us clerics. <br />
<br />
I can understand why they would want to limit it's production. But having 2 Crazy Time sinks, and Several lesser but still annoying time sinks, is a bit much.</div></div><hr />
