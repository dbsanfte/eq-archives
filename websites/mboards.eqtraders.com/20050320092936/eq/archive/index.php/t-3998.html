Needless to say the demand for any droppable armor is very low (people do not spend pp on something they might lose the next day), plus with the new changes to disarm I feel that RZ will be even worse. I'm just curious if I ever decide to move if it would be better to move to a new server where competition is lower, or move to a more established server. I don't mind PvP servers, so perhaps a coin only teams server would be an option. Is there a need for a smith on any specific server? I am high enough to make heraldic armor, black acrylia weapons and mistletoe cutting sickles.<br />

The only GM smiths there are ones who took advantage of the free MoveLogs.<br />

There is profit to be made, methinks.<br />

<br />
Maybe it is just to one, but make sure you've checked that out.<br />
<br />
That and you lose all your items, which really would be difficult to restart without a friend with a bit of pp to replace.<br />
<br />
Depending on class you may be able to start naked... but I would imagine it would be difficult.</div></div><hr />

It has been allowed to move to and from PvP servers for some time now.<br />
