Dont like it? Dont tinker.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Platinum is free.  You just kill a mob and loot his money.<br />
<br />
Tinkering is a thing of beauty.  This stuff you will never find just dropping off of some Mob.  Tenderly handcrafting you own items for personal use or for sale to lucky others.<br />
<br />
Besides you got to skill 50 for no cost.  You didn't have to loot part of mobs to put them together like baking and tailoring.<br />
The stuff is useful not like skill ups in jewelry crafting when the items are not enchanted.  Plus without even having to skill up you can create a 5% fishing bonus item and bait.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Handor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you're more concerned about saving money, some suggestions:<br />
<br />
- Check the recipes closely.  Some of the 'next' trivials are more spendy, you might try something more challenging if it's a lot cheaper.<br />
<br />
- Farm the heck out of Netherbian and do brewing geerloks.  Those only cost a few pp each, and I think they added a new vendor  in SH a while back so you don't even need to run to Katta any more.<br />
<br />
- Max out your int/wis before making attempts, and make sure your charisma is high enough to get best prices -- this makes a huge difference when you're dealing with higher end attempts.<br />
<br />
Tinkering now is painless -- it took me *months* of farming stuff to get my skill up, back when the only way to skill was rebreathers.  And once every warrior had 2, there wasn't much demand.  So you ate the cost to sell back to a vendor.  Now, you can get to well over 200 on *cheap* skillup attempts.  Know someone who decided they wanted to be a tinkerer, built a bot, got him to 16, and within a week was over 200.<br />
<br />
Those who want to tinker, will -- regardless of time, effort, and cost.  Those who hate spending money, should GM brewing. ;)  IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hell its the easiest tradeskill I've seen to skillup and I'm a GM or pretty **** close to GM in all of them. I recently did a gnome tinkering for them. I footed part of the build. We went from 50ish to almost 230 for probably around 60k. Thats with buying stuff high priced in the bazaar. The gnome also has that 10 percent tinker robe. Skilling him up on bow cams now from the elementals. Finally found a good usage for those stupid piles of Molten ore we get while xping. :)</div></div><hr />

/agree<br />
<br />
That, and I think you need to read up a lot more on Tinkering to see what the costs are.  I know it cost me well over 200k, **** clockwork for skillups :/</div></div><hr />
