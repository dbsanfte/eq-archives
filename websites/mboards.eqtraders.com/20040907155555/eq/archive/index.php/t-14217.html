Is there somewhere that shows the trivial changes that have been made?<br />
<br />
Is there somewhere confirming the new smithing skill cap?<br />
<br />
I sure wish they wouldn't change the trivials on current items when they put in new expansions. I now have a bank full of useless sub-combines :( <br />

Anyone have a link to a patch message that says theyr'e changing existing trivials? Specifically smithing trivials? <br />
<br />
And I might also remind you, the max tradeskill level is 250 raw skill... This isn't changing any time soon. There is no &quot;new&quot; skill cap. Or I'm 100% wrong, and someone has a link to an official Everquest web page saying it's being changed, or at the very least a copy of the patch message that said it will change.<br />
<br />
As far as the trivial levels on the new recipe's, there's a forum for updating recipe trivials near the top of the main message board forum page, otherwise all recipe trivials are indeed maintained on the http://www.eqtraders.com web site as Hibashira said. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fluteria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think what they're talking about is with the new interface you can see the ACTUAL trivial number, and so to update the board/site with the correct trivial (according to the new ui).  I don't think trivials on old recipes changed, this is just our way of correcting any incorrect trivials or finding the exact trivials when all we have on the site is a range.<br />
<br />
But then I'm not a moderator, so that is just my guess. :)</div></div><hr />

Yes with the new UI you can easily tell the exact trivs and this is most useful for those beyond 250.<br />
The age old dispute of the cap on effective skill level has also been sorted as it tell you quite specifically your skill with mod item is 252 and never gets beyond that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now what would be nice is to revisit that old formula for success to see what kinda chances we have at our current skill to make something beyond.  :)<br />
