<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kothall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering if anyone had looked into this.<br />
<br />
I have a 52 Enchanter who has been VERY buisy in LDoN.  One thing I noticed is that traps -- especially on boxes and the like -- are nasty and that a poison based trap can kill rather quickly.<br />
<br />
As such, with the Potion of Gorgin Toxin and Potion of Spurn Affliction having instant cast times...  Has anyone looked into marketing these to LDoN groups?<br />
<br />
My little Shaman is only 31st level right now so they are a bit out of his reach to make but I do believe my Enchanter would cough up a couple hundred plat to see that he doesn't die AGAIN from some yoyo accidentally setting off a box trap -or- from just rushing across a room and getting hit with a trap that goes off because there just wasn't enough time for the rogue to locate and disarm them all....  Time is an enemy in LDoN runs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I made was Ethira's Poison Antidote.  Costs about 6.5 plat per charge to make.  Pretty low trivial at 57.  Takes 3 charges to cure the poisons, at 65 anyway.  Casting time is 2 seconds, plenty fast enough.  Can't sell the stuff, no interest in it.  People would rather die.  But at least my characters don't.<br />
<br />
Potion of Gorging Toxin does Cure Poison.  Cure Poison only removes 4 counters.  It would take about 6 uses of it to remove one of the posions.<br />
<br />
Potion of Spurn Affliction is the same deal, but for disease.  The diseases don't damage you quickly, no rush on them, doubt this would sell at all.  If you want to get around disease, my advice is get yourself a Shield of the Immaculate.  Rocks as an enchanter, great for removing slow from charmed pets.</div></div><hr />
