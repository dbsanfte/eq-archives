<br />
My Smith has 188 skill but no Luclin/PoP.  Is there any caveats I don't see toward farming windstones, etc. with my bard and having my smith try some Acrylia bp/greaves?<br />
<br />
W/O Luclin/PoP are there any other bp/greaves possible/worth making that I'd have a reasonable shot for?  My smith is Iksar, and my bard is Agnostic Vah Shir (don't think there's any high end cultural they can wear).</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for your question, I'll let other tackle that, as I'm persuing cultural armor to skill up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't mean to douse your smithing aspirations but the Iksar just don't have much usefull in the way of cultural armors. I could go off on SOE for their completely brainless cultural design for Iksar but thats a post for Primal Scream. The Fearsome Skyiron (Iksar BD Cultural and only high end cultural you can make) is horrible. The AC is weak for War/SK and the Wis on some of the set is so-so for Shammies. The set is Iksar only as well. Trolls have more useful items w/ their recycled cultural IMHO.<br />
<br />
The Acrylia recipies will make some useful midgrade armor for your Bard and smith (chain only for the Iksar.) Farming components is slow. I'm lucky to get enough for 2-3 combines in 3-4 hrs of nonstop farming w/ a 51 necro. <br />
<br />
W/O PoP your smith will not have access to the Tanaan forges required to make any of the planar metal pieces ( Nightmare Iron etc.)<br />
<br />
Things are bleak for Iksar Smiths.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sir0die</div><div class="date">12-26-2002, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, i gotta ask, just because an account doesn't have PoP or Luclin, if the tradeskiller can get the appropriate items for the combine (cant farm them themselves, so let's assume components were givenm to them) does that mean they can't combine them?<br />
<br />
so what happen? click combine and instead of a DNC message you get a &quot;go buy PoP/luclin dummy&quot; message?</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as I know it, if a person can get ingredients from an expansion they do not have, they can try the combine. The only exception to this is the PoP recipies that require using the non-portable, PoP only (Tanaan) tradeskill containers (forge, brew barrel)<br />
<br />
As far as the portable containers (Tanaan Sewing Kits etc.) I've no clue but I believe they are tradeable.</div></div><hr />
