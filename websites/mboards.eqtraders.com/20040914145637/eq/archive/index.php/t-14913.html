<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KiTA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello.  I am a young Jewelcrafter working on getting money so I can finance more Jewelcrafting.  Problem is right now I'm only level 8, and such, I can only easily make Silver Jewelry (An ex-guildmate offered to make me Enchanted Gold at cost, but that's not as reliable as making it myself).  <br />
<br />
The problem is, I donno exactly what sells very well in bazaar.  I mean, I imagine the +2 STR/INT/WIS stuff will sell nicely, but I can't imagine the +3 Save vs All ring will sell for 250pp, yet alone high enough to make a profit.<br />
<br />
What has everyone else had luck selling at this level of Jewelcrafting?  I was thinking just have an &quot;Amber Day&quot; for +2 STR rings, then a &quot;Jasper Day&quot; and &quot;Star Rose&quot; day where I just sell a few packs of mostly one type of jewelry, but, like I said, I donno.<br />
<br />
I play on Morden Rasp, so the economy has not stabilized really very well yet (Prices fluctuate from anywhere from 50% normal to 500%+, depending on if it's a twinked transfer selling or not), so I also need to take that into account. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When I was a young enchanter, skilling up and making the skill pay for itself, I looked at what items would have value to specific classes. <br />
<br />
As a result +HP and +Mana items were my biggest sellers.  Followed rapidly by +Cha, +Wis, and +Int items. <br />
<br />
Look over the list of things you can make, then decide which to market.   Go through zones in which people are leveling up.  Lake of Ill Omen, Paludal, etc. and offer them for sale.   You'll get enough takers to be worth your time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Another thought: try going to Shadeweaver's Thicket and killing lesser shades (who are also level 8).  The shadeling silk and swirlling shadows can be sold to tailors and blacksmiths for great deal of money.  You'll be gaining exp and making lots of plat at the same time.  A full stack of swirling shadows can sell for ~500pp, which should be a sizeable chunk of money to put toward your skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Doze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would create a mule in the bazaar ( actually I did ) and keep him stocked up with +2 wis and +2 int rings and I would price them at 4pp each.   Whenever you camp just log your mule on and go afk in trader mode.<br />
<br />
Our server is perhaps one of the few that you can make good money as a Jeweler because we have a lot of new characters in need of equipment.<br />
<br />
I did a lot of guard killing in HHK to pay for jewelry crafting and I may be the first native on our server to get the trophy ;).<br />
<br />
Send me a tell if you have any questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ZealSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the silver items seem to always be for very low levels except for the rare item like jacinth rings which might be useful in certain situations.   I'd wait for electrum because there are many other things that you can make that sell well.  Alternatively you can just sell components, like enchanting clay and selling that in bazaar, or selling the lowest level mana vials in bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arfyak Reflux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">All these are really good answers.  My recommendation to add to the others is that, if you are a Delf 'Chanter, you do the Stein of Moggok quest.  Takes about 10mins (once you get the pattern down) to do and sells for around 300p.  Initial cost is in the 10p or less range, so the profit margin is great.  At lvl 8 the xp is awsome to.  If you are not a Delf you will have to wait 'til 12th to do the quest, but the xp and money are still good.  A good guide is here at:<br />

<br />
Also for the fish bones there is a side quest that can be done instead of killing the one in the pond:<br />

Hope this helps. I know it is a little off topic, but it was one of the ways I helped pay for JC with my 'chanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dledari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My bazaar mule always has a stack of enchante clay, silver, electrum, and gold, as well as a stack of vials of viscous mana.  If you put your enchanted silver and clay bars up in the bazaar, you will get AT LEAST twice what you paid for the items from the vendor, you will most likely get a lot more, but server prices vary.  <br />
<br />
The enchanted bars have made me quite a nice sum of money, and still do.  They are a great way to fund your skill.  <br />
<br />
As for items that sell, I've had the best luck with the star rose quartz items (int), jasper (wis), and jade (hp/ac).<br />
<br />
Hope some of that helps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bregalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't really think any silver jewelry sells anymore.  If you do a little bazaar surfing, you'll find a great many non-JC items with better stats and selling at less than cost to make.</div></div><hr />
