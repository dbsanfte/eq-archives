<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cleric Taven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thank You for the extra note about Hopeless Willow Moss being used for the Iksar Warrior quest.  One less vault item to wonder What's this for?<br />

Salt Minnow (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9435&amp;menustr=035000000000) has no known Recipe, which is nothing new, but it does carry the  Tradeskill flag.  I don't believe my Iksar monk fished this out of a Kunark body of water, but rather Foraged it someplace.  I wish I could remember which zone rather than just guessing now since it shows as unknown in the database.<br />
<br />
SOP Bark (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=6241&amp;menustr=035000000000) doesn't carry the Tradeskill flag, nor I have found, while searching, Quests as an alternative reason for it even to exist.  Vendors have no interesting in buying it and they don't stack.<br />
<br />
I could see a message thread started for some known items in topical board, but would suggest that just maybe Foraging could exist as it's own board.   FAQ to the list of known zone forages and grow from there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inyidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd imagine, since Foraging isn't a tradeskill, it won't get a board of it's own.  Generally, items that are foraged are discussed under the tradeskill they're used in.  Anything without a known use could probably be discussed in General.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Iniydd's got it.  If a foraged item only applies to one tradeskill (or that's where your interest for it is) then use that skill's forum.  Everything else can go in General.</div></div><hr />
