<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Orin Strongbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'd just like to say that I've always loved your site.  Since pre-kunark days.. this has always been a great place to check out tradeskills.  Everytime I take a break from EQ, this is the first place I check out to see what's new.<br />
<br />
My post is really about something I'd like to see, and I think everyone at your site could benefit from.  Muse over at EQatlas compiled a .pdf for all of his maps and /loc's and then sells it online.  I, for one, purchased it, because it saves me quite a bit of time vs trying to do it all myself.  just buy, d/l, print.  Good to go...<br />
<br />
What Im suggesting is that perhaps the same thing could be accomplished here.  A list of info compiled into an easy to use format.  Lists of vendors, recipies, quests, drops, whatever.. could be all put in using existing data.   <br />
<br />
Just a thought..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This very &quot;simple&quot; request is not as simple as it sounds on the surface.<br />
<br />
Sure we could create a set of PDFs that list out (basically dump) everything that has been loaded into the database that we have developed. And have these available for download (whether we charge or not for them is a different issue). <br />
<br />
But the information we have is NOT static. It is constantly being refined and updated. New items, recipes, sources, mobs, zones, quests are being added DAILY. Corrections to the existing information is being made DAILY... whether the corrections are small (a mis-spelled word) or large... (a complete re-write of a section that was out of date). <br />
<br />
And a large part of what the database driven site has made possible is that if something like an Item name is mis-spelled... we make a SINGLE change in the database... and then EVERYWHERE the item is referenced, when it is looked up from the database, it is corrected. The only time when this does not happen is when in a writeup the item name is hard-coded (not looked up), but I am working on changing this slowly so that they are.<br />
<br />
And also note, that unlike EQ ATLAS (which is a wonderful site), the sheer quantity of information we track and maintain in the databases is not a matter of 100-200 items.. it is on the order of 10,000+ items, 6,000+ recipes, 2,000+ mobs, 3,000+ sources... ALL INTERCONNECTED.<br />
<br />
And the site's most valuable asset as a database driven site is that they are interconnected. And displayed to allow you to click from an item... to the recipes... to the sources... and such. Making use of the features of the web.<br />
<br />
If we were to generate a set of PDFS for downloads... it would be out of date the day after it is generated. So even if it is auto-mated... and produced WHEN you request it... the following day, that PDF is out of date... and becomes more dated as time goes on. The value of it due to the updates becomes less and less.<br />
<br />
One of my old sayings applies here:<br />
<br />
If it is in print, it is out of date.<br />
<br />
PDFs are good for information that remains relatively static for extended periods of time. The EQ Traders Site is a very active and energetic site that is under constant revision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well Said Krazick :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Orin Strongbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I completely understand your rebuttal.. and I agree wholeheartedly that the dynamics and up-to-the-minute detail and accuracy are 2 of the many things that have made this site legendary.  Was just wondering if an idea could be used to help the site fund itself.  <br />
<br />
On a side note.. someone asked in PoK today... 'where's a good place to get info online about trade stuff'... <br />
<br />
<br />
NO LESS than 9 people replied in short order.. <br />
