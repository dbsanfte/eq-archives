My guild is &quot;Asile&quot;.<br />
<br />
would prefer a free combine, but we are willing to pay a resonable price.<br />
<br />
i've been told that the champ mags do not stack, can anyone confirm this? or if the demi-secs them selves stack?<br />
 :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wolfram</div><div class="date">12-31-2002, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will do combines for free and if there are any components left over, those would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Usually on 5PM to 10PM weekdays and most of the day on weekends.<br />
<br />
Later,<br />

<br />
Second point... at 200-ish brewing skill... I was about 85% on these (that's a conservative estimate, I didn't keep really close records)... so you might well want to just bite the bullet and have someone in your guild spend a couple evenings getting up around 200ish skill... very very easy path...(I spent about 600pp getting to 200+).<br />
<br />
I did ales to 40something (barley, malt, water + cask)(trivial is higher but i got way fed up with the casks)<br />
Then skull ales to 151 (no container! vinegar, spices, short beer, cyclops skull (returned on success or failure)<br />
then sorry to say you have to do the evil Mino hero brew up to whatever level you wish (trivs at 248)<br />
<br />
Go to halas, you can stand in one room and go all the way up if you bring your cyclops skull with you. (I 'borrowed' one from the undead cyc in SK while i was XPing on gnolls he conveniently wandered by one evening... but you always see them for sale in the bazaar for about 20ish plat or so).<br />
<br />
Good luck!  <br />

PS (edit) that is to say you can stand in one room after you finish skull ales, or if you bring the vinegar and spices with you... sorry... that was a mite confusing.</div></div><hr />
