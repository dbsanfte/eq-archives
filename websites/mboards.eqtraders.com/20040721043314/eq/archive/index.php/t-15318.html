&quot;Increases in power the closer it is to midnight,&quot; the above reflects stats at 6... At midnight it hits 33AC 148/148 16 to all stats/saves and at noon it drops to 16AC 71/71 7 to all stats/saves.<br />
<br />
It's only nominally a tradeskill combine as it is no-fail and the clay is a raid drop, but I figured people here would want to know since it's a pottery combine.<br />

Where did you find this? I loot for guild alot &amp; have yet to see it drop I think but possibly missed it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lucy gets it's spell information directly from the spell database on your hard drive so it knows when spells are updated instantly.<br />
<br />
For items though, it only knows about what links people running the item collector have seen in game, similar to how Magelo only knows of items owned by people who have used the Magelo updater.</div></div><hr />

Ok so you had to have found the jade flecked clay somewhere ~ do you recall where?</div></div><hr />

Ah yes, good old 'Hitpoints unknown calc: 1 range: 0 -&gt; 20', I love that one! :confused: :boggled: <br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's probably an hp regen that varries with the time of day.  Maybe magelo knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Belanar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's the same effect as on the hollow acrylia obelisk charm people got for having an inner Acrylia key when they changed Acrylia... if anyone ever figured out what the effect did back then.<br />
<br />
I haven't sat down and tried to figure it out yet.<br />
<br />
Magelo seems to think it's 6 hp regen but it seems like it must be something more complicated than that.<br />
<br />
My regen is way over the hard cap of 35 so I need to take some time and play around with my gear to see if I can figure out what it's down.<br />
<br />
(As an aside, they really need to raise the regen cap. 35 regen when people have 6-14k hp is pathetic considering they created the cap when people maxxed out at what, 2k hp? 2500? Let's see a little scaling here!)<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm going to go out on a limb and make a guess, probably wrong but I have a feeling it is a regen, but rather than a specific number of HP / tick it is a different amount of time, IE every minute/20sec/whatever.</div></div><hr />

SO THE UNFIRED PART is not NO DROP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Belanar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">No, all items listed are magic/lore/no drop. Sorry, I was more precise in the database update thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Talanic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just a FYI on Taskmistress Krisz:<br />
<br />
She is the only Ixt in Riwwi.  I am not sure if she is a PH spawn or not, but if she is not, she is very, very rare.  Hits for about 3k, AEs for 3k, and AE snares (Curse).  If she has a PH, it is one of the MOBs that paths all around the area and around the inside of the arena building--but not in the arena itself.  <br />
<br />
Every time I have encountered her, she has despawned shortly after killing someone or something (was a pet once, and me once).  It is possible that it is deliberate and she is supposed to despawn after killing anyone--meaning raid gets one shot at her, and if you wipe, that's it.</div></div><hr />
