<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thundergug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, so I have been doing several tradeskills, all to be specific, and currently tailoring is the only one not capped at 200 (I have 2 at 250, but haven't dedicated the AAs to the others yet).  My impression is that tailoring is by far the worst skill to raise above the 180s.  EVERYTHING else has reasonablly easy methods of skilling up, to 200 at least.  Am I just blind, or is this really the case?<br />
<br />
The way I see it, the only practical methods of skilling up are reinforced acrylia, and arctic hides.  On my server (Kayne Bayle) there are rarely, if ever, traders selling more than 1 flawless hopper hide at a time, and I don't think I've seen an arctic wyvern or drake hide in the bazaar in over a month.  <br />
<br />
Now granted, farming hte items isn't too dificult, but it is incredably time consumeing.  Compared to ALL the other tradeskills, this is by far the worst.<br />
<br />
So here's my question after all that rambling...  Am I missing something?  Are the only practical methods of skilling up beyond acrylia studded items reinforced acrylia, arctic wyvern/cobalt drake stuff, and solace robes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>AB-girlie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you got it ! enjoy tailoring.. and farming ( <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Welcome to high end tailoring. <br />

Over here is your rack that youll be stretched on, slowly, 24-7, with no food or water... and this is HANS... he will be whiping you repeately with a cat-o-9-tails dipped in lemon juice and sprinkling the wounds with salted fire-ants.<br />

The badly played and out of tune polka music preformed by rythmn-less mimes is just an added bonus we like to throw in for your enjoyment.</div></div><hr />
