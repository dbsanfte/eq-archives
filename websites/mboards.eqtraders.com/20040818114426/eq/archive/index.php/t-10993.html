<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inien of Vazaelle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Had a guild mate combine KEI with no problems.   Malosini - you're missing words of recall.</div></div><hr />

Malosini - you're missing words of recall.  <br />
<br />
Was this verified in the in-game recipe book?  If so, the database entry will need to be corrected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Inien of Vazaelle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That's the recipe that was listed when I was reading the books and compiling the info for my guild's website.  Haven't checked in a while, though.  If I remember, I'll check it in game.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>llaffer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I must have attempted to combine KEI about 6 times (all but one was successful).<br />
<br />
The recipe you are attempting is correct:<br />
<br />
both halves of 25, both halves of 26, quill and parchment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>NightGod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Using the term 'I' in there sounds like you're trying to do all the combines yourself.<br />
<br />
Note that anyone can combine priest spells, but you have to be the proper class to combine the INT caster spells. IE, if you are a wizard, you can't combine KEI, as that is am Enchanter spell.</div></div><hr />

His sig states &quot;61 ENC on Veeshan&quot;<br />

-Lilosh  <br />
<br />
and thats why he cant combine malosini because its a mage spell.<br />
<br />
Also malosini is common and its a crime to waste some of the rare words hes using on it. better to hold out and get all the words needed for malo.<br />
<br />
Veldin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>NightGod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I should have been more clear who I was refereing to. <br />
<br />
Llaffer, who has combined the spells successfully, is a 61 enchanter. <br />
<br />
Bigsby, the person who is asking for help didn't state what class they were, but I'm willing to wager they aren't an enchanter (and most likely not a magician, either).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Malosini is both mage(58) and shaman(57)</div></div><hr />

Malosini is both mage(58) and shaman(57)  <br />
<br />
Heh yes you are right but its still common :)<br />
<br />
Veldin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Inien of Vazaelle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It should be very common, it's a vendor spell.  :p  I know it's sold at the mage vendor in Firionia Vie and possibly even the shammy one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think I'm confused about this post - having others refernce me tends to do that :)<br />
<br />
Yes, I did the combines for KEI myself as I am an ENC :)  I've not tried Malsoni at all.</div></div><hr />
