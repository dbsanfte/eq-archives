<br />
I don't know who else may have fair tailoring prices.<br />
<br />
I have seen Raiya's prices which are a total ripoff.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have been told that Robynhood has the cheapest prices in the land now, and he does free tailoring combines with his Druid main. Too bad- I kinda was hoping he was you, reborn (or remaned).  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raiyaeq</div><div class="date">03-14-2003, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mod, please lock this post.  Jorev only makes personal attack and he's once again banned on Vazaelle.com.<br />
<br />
His previous post name/char was Birch which another post was locked due the to arguement between him and Galadon.<br />
<br />
Birch, you don't even know the name of my mule.  &quot;My price is way off?&quot;   I think you need a better pair glasses since most of my stuff is as low as it can be in bazaar if not lower.<br />
<br />
I respect other tailors (moelle, evasto, galadon, annir, etc.), say whatever you like/want, if my mules continue selling, that tells the market that my price is not off at all.  Oh yeah, also, no matter how hard you try, you'll never reach the game play level we are at.  Cuz you'll always be the birch that everyone laugh at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galadon</div><div class="date">03-14-2003, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welp, I'd have to agree with Raiya on that one.<br />
<br />
Raimule's prices are by far the lowest in tha Bazaar atm.  Like always, Birch is unsuccessfully attempting to sabotage others. Heh, I only hope he gets to see he is still the laughing stock he always was before he is again banned from the boards. Oops, I went on like a VCC R&amp;F, I apologize. But I agree again with Raiya, perhaps we can delete this thread and make sure Birch doesn't return, in any form.  :D</div></div><hr />

Jorev, Don't call anyone else a Ripoff.   Personal Attacks are unwelcome.<br />
<br />
Sorry folks, I somehow missed this post for..err...  a while...<br />
