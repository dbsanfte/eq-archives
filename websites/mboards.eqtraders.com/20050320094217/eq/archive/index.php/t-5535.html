Some guy running from a monster... trying to cast spells... seeing spam of &quot;Insufficent mana to cast spell&quot;....<br />
<br />
Followed by a simple slogan.  &quot;Got C3?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Actually last night I didn't get C3 for once, because I was planning on farming... turns out, medding just sucks, hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
simple thing yesterday.  My level 8 chanter was asked to enchant a stack of silver bars.  No biggie.  Well my C3 died right before I went to start.  Well, I thought, No Big Deal.  20 minutes later I finally got the 20 bars enchanted, much to the everyone's dismay.<br />

ACK, can any caster survive without KC3????<br />

My bard however has had KEI 4 different times because she was grouped with someone who was passing it around.  My chanter only hunts in one group which is my friends she doesn't hunt with anyone else and we are such a good team that we hardly ever have down time due to mana shortage.</div></div><hr />

Yep, I do just fine without it. Half the time I click it off. <br />

Shaman. <br />
Necro. <br />
Shadow Knight (we get a 50-100 mana proc, it's better for mana to melee than to med).</div></div><hr />

<br />
And now the sad part. I'm a Paladin, and don't even use any of the Clarity line very often...<br />
<br />
Does this count as an addiction?<br />

With the Extended C3, Manaskin, Harvest, and my pets mana regen help, I find that I can stay at about 80% mana for the full 3 hours of fighting, and the only time I sit is while my friend is pulling. So YEAH I LOVE C3 ))</div></div><hr />

<br />
(I prefer to group, and in a good group I spend more time acting as a pet cleric and dmg shield caster (unless there's a Druid or Ranger in the group) than nuking mobs, so I rarely need c3)</div></div><hr />
