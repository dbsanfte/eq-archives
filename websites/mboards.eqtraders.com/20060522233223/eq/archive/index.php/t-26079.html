<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grolyn</div><div class="date">04-16-2006, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's an oddity in Mon Letalis.  Get levi pot, clicky item, or spell, get up to the platform in the middle of the zone (steps to there is north-west area of the &quot;support&quot; connecting to the center mountain), and find your eway up to the very tip of the northwest spire pillar.  There is 4 blinking shield image (like crystal shield of remembetrance or some summoned pet toys) that when clicked on opens a tradeskill container.  No tradeskill UI pops though and I can't figure it out.  Someone in eqtraders channel said it looks like a forage but ML is a long run from any vendor that sells smithing supplies.<br />
<br />
From the distance it almost looks like a warning light for low flying planes (or spaceships). :D I don't know who put it there or if it works at all.  If it's not for quest and has no known use, maybe Ngreth could try to find out who put it there and why.</div></div><hr />

Not of the forge type though. What about the tusk of the elefant in South Karana :-) stil looking for a filling for that one too. If I remember well it even has a combine button.<br />

Any apprentice dentists around?</div></div><hr />

You have to put a Broken Orb of Discordant Energy in it. There is a similiar container in Dreadlands at the top of the big spire there. One orb gets put in each spire.<br />
