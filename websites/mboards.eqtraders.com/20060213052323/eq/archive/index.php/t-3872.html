<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angelsyn</div><div class="date">02-16-2003, 04:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Khaarq...  Sold out of Idols.  Sold out of Stiens.  (I've been buying some cheaper stiens to keep stock up, but I'd rather you earned the profits.)<br />
<br />
Gammy &amp;amp; Umgrog (&amp;amp; Mightion, if he's up to it)... Down to 2 Sickles.  The price has fallen (Kshi keeps selling at 1750), so I'm only able to pay 1500p each for them now.<br />
<br />
Gammy...  Out of Orbs, Out of Sceptres, out of non-Imbued and Vengeful Yaks.  I have someone who really wants a Cazic-imbued Sceptre... and I've got 4 (I think) staffs we can try with.<br />
<br />
Fulorian...  Still doing Robes for tailoring skill-ups?  I could sure use some.  I'd also like some more Heraldic.  I want a second Radiant Heraldic Bracer for Keyne &amp;amp; I think another Luminant Heraldic Bracer &amp;amp; Boots to sell.  Anything else is up to you.<br />
Also, those Sandstorm Pearls aren't going to sell at 10k.  I've seen 'em now in the Bazaar as low as 2500 (and once at 1500pp).<br />
<br />
Ceggon...  I've got 70+ Tufts of Dire Wolf Fur &amp;amp; 9 (or so) BDs set aside.  I'll see about making the Celestial Tempers &amp;amp; getting the Platnum Threads.  I've also got a few HQ Brute Hides for you.  I'm hoping for 2 Haversacks. ;)<br />
P.S. Should I buy some acorns and brew up some acorn oil?<br />
<br />
Starna...  I found 7 Excellent Sabertooth Hides at 90p each &amp;amp; 1 at 50p last night.  Have them put aside for you.<br />
<br />
I'm still working on gathering the Branches of Planar Oak I need for making Blessed Fishing Poles.  I'm willing to pay 200p each for them.<br />
<br />
If I think of anything else, I'll add it later. :D</div></div><hr />

I have Idols and Steins ready for you, and will be looking for you tonight (Wed)  Not having great successes with the steins still.  Made 4 out of 18 attempts and no skill ups. (Blew 2 JC combines out of 20 lacquering the gems)</div></div><hr />
