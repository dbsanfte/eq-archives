<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wornhands</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How many combines/pp will it take to go from 201 skill to 222? I've done over 200 and still at 201 skill :steamed: I can't even sell them back to recover any cost, have to fire and tribute them :boggled: I think I will **** my pants and break something IRL when I have to make star ruby steins to go over 222.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I found pottery skilled up slower than most other skills. 200 combines for one skill up point is just a random fluke in the random numbe generator. Keep hacking away at it some points come fast some come slow. Average it all out and it isnt so bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wornhands</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well after nearly 20k I'm up to 211 skill. I had to start dropping them on the ground after several hundred were made, the tribute master stopped accepting them along with every nearby vendor in Halas. A tribute master refusing things is just evil and unrealistic, just like their whole tradeskill system :steamed:</div></div><hr />

If you don't like it, why are you bothering? They are not forcing you to do anything.<br />
<br />
Never ceases to amaze me how people think they have no control over their choices. If you don't like it, don't do it. Going without IS an option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cantatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is more of a rant than anything else and isn't going to go anywhere good.  If you want to rant about Pottery and lack of skill ups, please post in the PSR. <br />

Thanks,<br />
