How does this work? Does every/any alcohol boost strength or just particular ones? Are some more effective than others?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArrakeenNaedShoj</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AFAIK any drink that can make you &quot;drunk&quot; in the game will increase your STR/STA and lower your INT/WIS(and I think your AGI or DEX). I believe there is a cap to how much it can raise/lower your stats and it is based on your alcohol tolerance in some way, but I am honestly not sure. I stopped getting drunk with my cleric when they started making it affect wisdom. I so loved being a &quot;friar tuck&quot; kind of preist back in the day. I would suggest getting any strength gear you can afford and buying/bumming any strength boosts you can before you start imbibing. But that's just my logic(I hate seeing the world all funny and stumbling around).<br />

Of course, people like Angelsyn would know better.<br />

And yeah, it used to be in the FAQ at some point.</div></div><hr />
