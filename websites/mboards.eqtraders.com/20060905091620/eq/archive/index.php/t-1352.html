I am failing more than one third of the time. With other trade skills and combines it seems 90% success is common, once the item becomes trivial.  Is their a skill level at which I can establish a a decent success rate.  I guess I was of the mistake impression that once something went tivial it does not matter how much over the trivial your skill actually was.</div></div><hr />

There is a thread there on success rate versus skill and what to expect. There are two very similar math models, one porposed by Iswar and one by Laurefin.<br />
<br />
To sum it up, just barely over trivial for leather padding = horrible success rate.<br />
<br />
Success rate at the trivial point is horrible for low trivials, and gets decent in the 170 skill range.</div></div><hr />

Everything was trivial for the Acrylia I was smithing.  I decided to increase skill and after working it up to 77, I have gotten a helluva lot better at my successful combines.  Now I lose 1 piece of Acrylia in a stack of 20 or so.  Maybe even higher, 1 in 30.  Might think about increasing your skill about 30 or 40 points.<br />
