I think it will work well as a storage compliment to a collapsable spit and bowl. <br />
<br />
If anyone wants one, send me a tell any night this week. Pricing is still up in the air, but I'm happy to get 100pp to cover my costs and failures  :(  Or bring me a thick grizzly skin and 35pp for ribbon and silk, and I'll give you any successful combines. (I'm bound at the ribbon vendor, so it only takes a minute to buy more.</div></div><hr />

She is having a high success rate with these bags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scarbrowed</div><div class="date">03-02-2003, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm just curious, Dellany, did you get all the sales, or is it just that no one is buying? I've given up on these until a market emerges. My guild mate purchases got me a few skill points, so I can't complain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystic Lioness</div><div class="date">03-03-2003, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I certainly did not get all the sales.  The ones that I have made so far were for guildies and friends.  Maybe the market is weak?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scarbrowed</div><div class="date">03-03-2003, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I just sold one at lunch today off my bazaar trader. Maybe the word is not out yet. I hope it does, it has been great for skillups when it sells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aahhz</div><div class="date">04-09-2003, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I sell about 2 or 3 of these bags each a week; sells are slow but steady enough for me to keep one of each made at all time.<br />
<br />
I give a free set to every Shaman member of my guild, but so far none of them have started Alchemy so they just put them away in their banks.<br />
<br />
Seems weird to me someone not taking advantage of a Tradeskill; especially a class only one; but that is just me.</div></div><hr />
