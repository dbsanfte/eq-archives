<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know Barbequed Cragbeast Souffle used to combine, because I have a partial stack I was going to fill.  I tried the recipe in both an oven and a collapsible spit, and got DNC both places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaaba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did you use the new egg batters or snake eggs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Supercell99</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heres the scoop on Cragbeast Souffles, and i think all others that require 2 snake eggs. <br />
You need to make egg batter and use 2 of them instead. <br />
If you use dragon, drake, or wurm eggs, then you need to combine the egg and a cup of flour in a mixing bowl.<br />
All other eggs like snake, griffon, basilisk, etc you combine the egg with a bottle of milk in a mixing bowl. <br />
<br />
So the new recipe is:<br />
Beer-battered cragbeast meat <br />
egg batter (x2)<br />
clump of dough<br />
vegetables<br />
Good news is you dont have to use just snake eggs, any will do. Bad news is that its another sub-combine. ;)<br />
<br />
edit: can be bbq, beer-braised, etc for the meat. I posted beer-battered which is what i make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>reyahnke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I tried to combine 3 different kinds of meat rolls and get DNC for them all.  I had these recipes learned before they were wiped and they worked fine. Now when I try to learn them in experiment mode they give the DNC.  I tried Barbequed Hynid, Beer Battered Hynid, and Barbequed Cragbeast with the batwing to make the rolls.  It does not take an egg so can't be the change to egg batter.  So what gives?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaaba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You must be doing something wrong like using the wrong container then because I've tried a great many different recipes of GoD baking recently and they all worked.</div></div><hr />
