<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arhallia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Endurance appears to have been added to all BD cultural armor which possessed mana. (note I said MANA, and not HP)<br />
<br />
I have a theory that endurance not being added to the Helenic armor -- and I'm guessing the Fierce Heraldic and RZ Ogre armor also doesn't have it -- is not a bug, but rather Sony's attempt to &quot;balance&quot; cultural choices for Warriors/Berserkers, such that RZ and The Tribunal are not clearly the &quot;best&quot; choices, gear-wise.<br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm that Endurance was NOT added to RZ or Tribunal cultural gear (the stuff with extra hp in place of mana), whereas it appears to have been added to all other cultural pieces?<br />
<br />
If Endurance has been added to these items, then the Helenic armor was clearly forgotten in the changes, as it has no Endurance as of the new patch on 3/10, while other cultural armors I inspected today did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have also noticed it on Stonehide and Night Terror Chain armor. I assume a lot fo changes are incomming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I noticed most of my pieces of gear that had the same amount of +mana as +hp got +endurance of the same quantity. (ie, if it was +30hp +30mana, now its +30hp +30mana +30endurance).  Admittedly a lot of the pieces were BD cultural (Underfoot), but some were not yet followed the same pattern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Checked real quick and Fulvous and Serene Steelweave don't seem to have gotten Endurance despite having mana, Rigid Steelweave did get Endurance on it though.<br />
<br />
I think, or I suspect, that for the Endurance value of existing items they copied the mana value on existing items to become an Endurance, and that's why there's no endurance yet on the pieces that have only HPs but no mana. It would explain why Fierce Heraldic (RZ) has no endurance. Since that armor can only be worn by warriors and bards I'm guessing they'll fix some of the hp only items to also include Endurance.</div></div><hr />

Checked real quick and Fulvous and Serene Steelweave don't seem to have gotten Endurance despite having mana, Rigid Steelweave did get Endurance on it though. <br />
<br />
Simple reason for that...  Fulvous &amp; Serene Steelweave can only be worn by Clerics, Paladins and/or SKs (and Bards?).  No reason to add +Endurance, since those classes either don't use it at all, or don't use it enough to worry about.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Edit: For the longest time, Helanic &amp; Fierce Heraldic armours were considered so much better that it was thought to be outright stupid to make a Warrior that wasn't a Tribunal or Rallos Zek worshipper.<br />
<br />
You got the extra hit points and often better stats you wanted...  Now you want the Endurance too?  It's called Balance, and it's finally here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I noticed endurance added to any item I wore that was wearable by melee classes and possessed mana.  The reason I assumed was that rogues/warrior/monk/berserkers etc always have to compete with us casters for +mana items that are obviously good for them, but if they win, they are &quot;burdened&quot; by having spent money/dkp/whatever because the item had significance to the caster classes. Now the melee have a reason to bid/buy these items.<br />
<br />
It appears they added the endurance in the same amount as the mana on these items as well, which backs my claim.  This is evidence if you look at items with different amounts (I used my Ring of the Shissar as the biggest difference of hp/mana.) The developers have tiered items so that HP&gt;all, and mana+endurance.<br />
<br />
As a side note, does anyone have a formula for calculating Endurance, and also, does Endurance affect casters, or are we bound to a set number, and unaffected by the bonus like warriors are unaffected by mana bonuses.</div></div><hr />
