<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penrif</div><div class="date">12-19-2002, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been keeping logs when they're relyable during my farming of the south islands of Hollowshade and the shadow island in Twilight.  The numbers should be acurratly reflect the drop rates in these two places.  They are an average over all the mobs in those areas, I AoE every stinkin' owlbear an' wolf and keep the shadow island pretty clear (**** I love sense undead).  Possible errors come from the mob being too far away from me when it died (DoT) causing the kill message to not show up or me missing some corpses (lost in a tree in Twilight or in some hut in Hollowshade).  Here's what I've found:<br />
<br />
2250 wolves killed, 503 substance.  4.473161 ratio<br />
845 shadows killed, 506 swirling.  1.669960 ratio<br />
1837 owlbears killed, 411 wailing.  4.469586 ratio<br />
And as a complete side-note:<br />
48 perfect owlbear pelts.  38.270833 ratio<br />
<br />
So I'd guess 1 substance per 4.5 wolves and 1 swirling per 5/3 shadows.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penrif</div><div class="date">12-19-2002, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't parse my time, and that's a really beyond the amount of time I want to spend writing my parser.  Not to mention your results may, and likely will, vary.  I live on a server that has a friendly, low population and has an incredibly good crop of GMs and guides, so things have been going very smoothly.<br />
<br />
So, to try to figure out how long this'll take, just do some math.<br />
Travel time to Hollowshade (minutes with PoP) + time to set up the race you want (0-10 hours) per session, plus 4.5 * how long it takes to kill one.  Don't forget downtime.<br />
<br />
Travel time to Twilight (15 min without porter) per session + 1.666 * how long it takes to kill one.  Don't forget downtime.<br />
<br />
Happy farming!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eumerin</div><div class="date">12-26-2002, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AFAIK, once a GM decides to reset a zone, they can pretty much do it instantaneously.  If there are people in the zone, they will probably give them a few minutes warning so that no one ends up in a really bad spot when the recently killed &quot;monster of uber death and no loot&quot; suddenly pops now (instead of 2 days from now, as it normally would), players aren't in an instant death spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bennan</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With the time it takes to farm, in my experience Wailing Substance only.  If I run around and whack the mobs non-stop I averaged about 30 to 35 an hour.<br />
<br />
If I two boxed and used my other character to AOE, then I can average around 60 to 70 Wailing Substance's an hour.<br />
<br />
If I am the only one in the zone hunting the mobs, I two box.  Otherwise I just run around and whack the mobs.<br />
<br />
My plan is too farm 1000 Wailing Substance's and 1000 Shrieking Substance's, make the requiste 1000 metal rings.  And then make 40 humming orbs a day, and farm the needed amount of Swirling Shadows per day.<br />
<br />
I think that will save alot of time all round, and this is a time consuming skill up path....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shrieking Substances drop on, oh, every 5-7th Wolf in TM.<br />
<br />
I was killing wolves in the caves somewhat near the Grimling zone in HM and got, MAYBE, 2 SSs off a gazillion of them (the cave where the pack leader spawns).  Am I hunting in the wrong place in HM?  I don't mind camping the owlbears in paludal while I do something on my other PC, so those aren't a HUGE issue, but the SSs are annoying me greatly..;-)<br />

wailing and substance are no drop and swirling is no rent right?</div></div><hr />

The substances only drop off of Owlbears or Sonic Wolves which are inhabiting the southern islands.<br />
<br />
The way to get both substances is to be the first one in the zone after it resets.  Kill owlbear or sonic wolf chief (which will precipitate an attack by that group) and then help them to wipe out the grimlings.  When you are done with one and need the other, help that team beat the gaurds in the south.  You can flip flop back and forth as long as no one comes along and wipes out one of the groups.<br />

Nice data Penrif<br />
unfortunately my druid friend quaded the shadows and only got a drop rate of 1 swirling shadow per quad.  I hope it was just a bad day.<br />

suggestions.<br />
Swirling shadows are the hardest part to get; as in REALLY mind numbing work. (and you need twice as many of them.)  The shades in Twilight are a pain to kill without AoE and the shades in Hollowsade are a looting nightmare (so many corpses).  And then after collecting, you have to use them right then. You can't just stick them in the bank like the substances.  So, don't just collect substances and store them up first.  After you get more then a couple stacks of both, farm Swirling Shadows whenever you have the chance.  Thie eases the monotany.<br />

Ok, now that I know to look at that island, I shall.  But to say 'the substances only drop' is incorrect.  They DO drop on the other sonic wolves in zone, just at a crappy rate (2 in way too many kills).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rassy fleetfoot</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the shadows in twilight arent that bad. in fact in addition to the swirlies they drop, these guys drop decent cash too. and spiny weapons that suck pretty bad but sell for a few gold to vendors, which are fairly close. the named shadows also drop some ok gear, mostly blunt weapons, and some average kinda caster gear (+3 int face and belt ive seen so far)<br />
<br />
I wouldnt say you need to ae kill the shadows in TS..just bring a couple friends, let them suck some exp and make some cash (mid to high 40's exp isnt bad here) I pull them a couple at a time, we beat em down, rince and repeat. theres about 20 spawns on the island, on a 15 minute-ish timer. spend a few hours there and you're ready for a buncha shadowscream combines.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bennan</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I have found in three test runs of an hour to an hour and a half each that the drops of Swirling Shadows are not that bad in T.S.<br />
<br />
Hehe the monotony of collecting all the humming orb stuff, is a pain, but once its done its done.  And I will not have the problem of having a bugged H.S holding me up, of course after I collect all the stuff I need.  Which is what I have seen adds alot of extra time to other players efforts...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penrif</div><div class="date">12-31-2002, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding Hollowshade:<br />
<br />
What it takes to get a reset depends on the server.  I've had good luck getting a speedy reset, depending on when I ask, on Firiona Vie.<br />
<br />
I've seen two different kinds of reset.  First we got the one where they give a 5 minute announcement that the zone is coming down...you camp out, they reset, you come back in.  Second, I've seen one where it just happens.  The one time I had this happen I was in the middle of looting a shreiking, about to click on the thing and bam, all my corpses go poof and grimlings spawn.  Color me pissed.  I wouldn't be suprized if this is the new way to do it, nice and quick on the GMs, they just hit a button and it happens.<br />
<br />
Regarding Twilight:<br />
<br />
I'm pretty confident of my numbers there, but it is the smaller of my samples.  I have another couple days to go in there, I might roll some more logs and see what happens.</div></div><hr />

If you've got 2 accounts, give the shadows to your bazaar mule, have him hop into arena, kill him, get him ressed and leave the shadows on corpse.  Instant norent storage for a week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xorshaik</div><div class="date">01-02-2003, 07:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think everything is quite as simple as it is stated.. HS doesn't work like &quot;kill leader in one camp and that camp attacks somewhere else.&quot; <br />
<br />
The current state of affairs on Druzzil Ro is that owlbears own the islands, wolves own the rest. There hasn't been any attack in 4 days now, and it hasn't been for a lack of trying every possible combination of attacking one camp or another's leader.<br />
<br />
But as to the original topic.. My experience with shadows has been in TS that it seems to often take 2 clearings to get a full stack.. sometimes worse. I have counted spawns in a clearing and it seems to be 20 (would be easier if I had track, but I kill 1 at a time with enough speed to have downtime waiting for respawn) That puts it closer to 2 kills per swirling shadow in my subjective recollection of my own experience.. I keep logs mostly so I can have a look later.</div></div><hr />
