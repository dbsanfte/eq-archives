<br />
Etherial Energy rings can not even be combined untill your skill is 220. BUT they are trvial at 212.<br />
<br />
I have Gauntlets of Dark Embers (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=13156) so when i get to 192 skill my effective skill will be 220. This means i can make the EE rings to get from 192 - 212 skill.  <br />
<br />
BUT what the pain is, is that i have to also have a 220 brewing skill to even make the tempers (same deal triv at 212 cant combine till 220). Yes i could buy them from another player but getting someone to make you hundreds of tempers isnt easy. So i amd curently GMing brewing as well. 400pp and 2 ddays later im at 189 skill in brewing and think Mino Hero Brew is the nastiest thing on the planet. Also had to go get 2 AA points to buy new taninn tradeing skill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
VI has descided that the hardcore, high end player is thier base customer and they are desperate to do whatever is needed to keep these folks in the game.<br />
<br />
That is why it was descided that if you wanted your character to GM multi tradeskills you needed AA points (and more than one at that) - no surprise that they made it (realatively) easier for the high end crowd to advance in the various tradeskills as well.<br />
