The main page has this listed at 210 trivial, and I was wondering what my success would be with 188 plus geerlok.  Also, I think i read here that most things get to the max of 95 percent success rate when trivial, but some things, like old cultural, reach that cap earlier on.  If this is true, does anyone know how much earlier on this is?  One last thing, at what skill(with geerlok added in) should I attempt to make an old enchanted dwarven cultural breastplate and have a success rate of approximately 50 percent? Thanks in advance for your help.</div></div><hr />

I am 4 out of 4 making imbued enchanted koada'dal plate armor..the stuff that trivs just over 210 like you're trying to make. i made 2 boots, 1 greaves and a bracer..no problem. no imps either tho..hehe</div></div><hr />

At 188 skill I had great luck with 1 and 2 sheet Enchanted Dwarven Plate, never more than 2 tries for any piece. On 3 sheet items, with the exception of one bad run of the RNG, it never took more than 3 tries to make legs, BP, or cloak. The Enchanted Imbued Dwarven Plate was a little rougher to make but usually a MAX of 3 tries on 1&amp;2 sheet items and a MAX of 4 tries for BP / Legs (never tried imbued enchanted cloak.)<br />
<br />
Bottom line, with 188 smithing and a geerlok you have a pretty good chance of making the Enchanted Dwarven Plate Helm. Now finding a chanter to enchant all the brellium might be a different story :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArrakeenNaedShoj</div><div class="date">01-09-2003, 06:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At skill 193 with and without geerlock, I have done over 300 non-trivial combines of the &quot;old&quot; highelven armor. I have failed about a dozen times so far, giving me just over a 95% success rate. That was a combination of 1, 2, and 3 sheet items of enchanted/enchanted-imbued.<br />
<br />
I am extrapolating from my experience(and that of others reporting similar results) that the old style cultural works similar to fine steel plate, that you reach the maximum success rate of 95%, some 20 or more points BEFORE they stop giving you skill. But that is really just My own guess/opinion.<br />
<br />
Oh, and like gimp mentioned, good luck on finding a 49+ enchanter, who has the spell, and isn't busy raiding, grouping, soloing, farming, or making gobs of cash KEIing, and is willing to come cast a spell 3 or 4 times, then med back up to full and do it again for you for an hour or more just to get enough for 5 or 6 attempts at 2 sheet items.(If it sounds like I am against enchanter's I apologize, I honestly have yet to meet one that wasn't at least curteous to me, I just think it's dumb for Verant to pick the class with arguably the most options for fun things to do and make them the only way you can get the most boring part of an items creation done. I really wish they would lower the cultural enchants to say 30ish and their Mana costs accordingly to lessen this obscene bottleneck.)</div></div><hr />
