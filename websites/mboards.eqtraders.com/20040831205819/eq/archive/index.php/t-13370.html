<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I see all the Trades have a Trophy. Is there a Trophy for the Fishing Trade? If not....why isn't there? <br />
If there is one...what is is it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No trophy, because for some reason its not considered a true tradeskill (maxes out at 200 instead of 250, and you can keep using skill points after reaching a skill of 20).<br />
<br />
The reward for maxing Fishing is that you're able to make Blessed Fishing Rods.<br />
<br />
I guess the Fisherman's Companion could be considered a trophy, but since all you have to do is get the bones and turn them in, even someone with 0 Fishing skill could get it.</div></div><hr />
