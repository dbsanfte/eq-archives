<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velvetina</div><div class="date">12-23-2002, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">:(   I've been farming pelts (lion, bear and wolf) for several days in East Karana and East Commonlands, hoping to get a supply of low-quality skins to make leather padding for plate armor. I haven't found even one low-quality skin on any of the mobs or merchants in either of those zones. All I get are ruined, medium and high quality pelts. I bought a few low-quality pelts in the bazaar for 10-15 pp, but the last couple of times i looked there hasn't been any for sale. <br />
<br />
Is there some place else I should be hunting? Does anyone know of a source to get a quantity of old-world, low-quality skins? No wonder they say tailoring is so hard.  :!:</div></div><hr />

i would recommend skinning the  MQ pelts to LQ, but not the HQ, either sell them, or use them to get your tailor5ing up to 116 by making quivers.<br />
<br />
now if your ultimate goal is to up your smithing, skinning the HQ down to LQ will get you your padding, but it would be a BIG waste of money. Sell the HQ for 25-35p then buy those LQ for 15p, you'll still make 10-20 plat to finance you ore purchases.<br />

The Cats there drop a LQ or better pelt about 80% of the time, and about 40% of the time drop more than one. If you can sustain the farming(this works especially well for high level trackers) the numbers there can be staggering. Then just downgrade all the HQ/MQ(or better yet make a profit bazaaring them) and you have your pelt supply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rassy fleetfoot</div><div class="date">12-23-2002, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yup..stonebrunt is highly recommended. i was hunting there for other reasons, and left with 3 backpacks of assorted quality pelts, even after giving a friend 100 hq cat pelts to work on her tailoring. All cats, even the little leopards drop 1-3 pelts most of the time, save the hq ones for quivers and cut down all the mq ones to low and you're set for life. better yet, bring friends and ae them. also while you're killing, panda's and gorilla's drop cash loots.<br />
<br />
NO ruined pelts drop here, except from the titans which its unlikely you'd be killing for pelts anyway hehe</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soleanla</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 06:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For me the best zone is Marus Seru. The Greyhoppers there drop Low Quality pelts like candy. Also, they drop Greyhooper hides which are good for tailoring to about 88. The Low Quality Rockhopper hides combine with both shadeling silks as well as normal spiderling treads. :) Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Handor</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 06:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another good spot for pelts...<br />
<br />
Smugglers in Jaggedpine.<br />
<br />
You can usually find a rogue or two there wanting the half-elf mask, and there is an ok quest you can do with the named smugglers' heads...<br />
<br />
But a lot of the smugglers drop pelts of all types/kinds.<br />
<br />
At 51 would still be experience too -- not great experience, and you'd definitely want a group / partner -- but experience at least. :)</div></div><hr />
