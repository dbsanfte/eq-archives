Short list of names/ids of unknown drinks I've been holding onto:<br />
<br />
5511 Screaming Vengeance<br />
5512 Purifier<br />
These two are in a large hole, a nether some twenty numbers wide. I imagine they're weapons, but anything that looked like a drink is included here. Closest items are Soulfire and an axe, but the gap is mighty large.<br />
<br />
8399 Fiery Red Fluid<br />
sandwiched in between a click regen herb and the trueshot longbow. was here from looking for Hot Sauce, but it could be her fav?<br />
<br />
12600 Dreadland Dry Porter<br />
12601 Black Wine<br />
12606 Felwithe Falls Water<br />
Another hole here, with kunark vendor drinks and food (Cab Pale Ale, etc.) on the positive end and the rogue elemental armor on the negative.<br />
<br />
13049 Free Ale<br />
48 is Rabbit Meat and 50 is Giant Rat Ear. Beats me where this fits in.<br />
<br />
19191 Burning Skull<br />
19199 Soulbearer Dark<br />
These are in the block of Brodder brewing recipies. Hints, please :)<br />
<br />
31856,'Dwarven Keg<br />
It's in a block of clicky illusion items so I figure it's an illusion dwarf GM item.<br />
<br />
These are from an old parse of items I had from the emulator project, if you wondered. No guarantees as to the validity of my information, but none of these are in the lucy database and there are item not found pages under their numbers. Something to work on, if you're feeling suicidal.<br />
<br />
If we still wanna work on the mug/stein angle I have a list of those too, but posting it will just cause undue clutter :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its time to put some sort of recepie in game, instead of this silly taunting.<br />
<br />
You should not be forced to go to a seperate web page for information or hints to finish an in-game quest.<br />
<br />
Every known drink available in-game has been tried.<br />
No more data has been found.<br />
<br />
Either the quest is broken, or unfinished.<br />
<br />
Unless the recepie drops from a so-far-not-killed mob, possibly a denizen of shadowhaven, maybe even the annoying elf herself, then i dont think this should be given any more lip-service. We are all sick to death of hearing about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is my *opinion*.</div></div><hr />

Unless the recepie drops from a so-far-not-killed mob, possibly a denizen of shadowhaven, maybe even the annoying elf herself,   <br />
<br />
Well Lewena herself doesn't drop the recipie, I got tired of her mocking me with the hint of a quest I killed her. Nothing on the body.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Garndart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ive read over 500 post on at least 2 boards on this quest.....<br />
<br />
That being said I would like some kind of confirmation that this quest is actually implemented and working.<br />
<br />
Brodder / Tanker / whoever at SOE who reads this board. Can you log in and do the quest. A) verify that quest works. B) verify that what you need to hand in can be made,bought, farmed foraged.... or all of the above.<br />
<br />
Why i ask this is this reeks of the Loyalist shield from katta where<br />
the quest wasnt fully implemented and a certain mob didnt spawn. It seems broken people have thrown everthing at this including the kitchen sink. Now if its working I think that this is great a super tough quest. But i would bet one of my trade skill trophy's that this quest isnt working. When you get as much human brain fire power thrown at this as this has had andstill dont solve it the past things like loyalist shield,original fiery defender, vex thal entry key, etc etc etc point to it being broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KanadWinterstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hi there ____, care to bring me a drink? If you bring me my favorite, I will tell you a secret. <br />
It's only super tough because our only hint is Lewena's hail text. Brodder is the one who gives us the &quot;new ale&quot; anagram clue and then people go haywire trying to give her stuff. The old thread had her being given all the essences, the blood wine from the burning rapier quest, and really crazy stuff that could never (should never?) have been used in a luclin quest.<br />
<br />
This is taunting us like the sewing needle recipie was... and is probably equally unsolvable (hq bits and steel bits? jar of acid? smithing hammer? honestly...)<br />
<br />
It'd be different if we had an in game hint, but people (myself included) have been scouring SH for something, anything that looks like a recipie and nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I spent a huge amount of time and effort on the Brodder's Revenge / hot sauce fiasco.  I spent even more time trying to tie in the recipes to Lewena.  I got burned on both counts.<br />
<br />
One of the first assumptions I posed to Brodder regarding the new ale / Brodder's Revenge search was whether he had tested this recipe and it was live  in the game.  He indicated that he had, and I went with that.  From his shock upon finding the real recipe, it's obvious that he had in fact not tested it.<br />
<br />
I have less time to play nowadays.  I am no longer willing to carry this torch.  I will not get involved until either a developer indicates that the quest is tested and functional; or they indicate that new NPC's or NPC text has been added with further clues; or someone here posts concrete progress of some sort or other on this quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brodder FoamyMugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You're Wrong Kyros I had tested it immediately after the big Tradeskill patch nearly three years ago...<br />
 I was told the recipes would likely change, but I ran around with several stacks of Stormguard Rootbeer, Brodder's revenge and Double Brewed Double stout dwarven ale for a month or so after, clicking them to make people wonder...<br />
<br />
 When diaries came out  BR no longer worked as it had before.<br />
 I couldnt get nagafen spices any more.  nor would BR work- I was told some old recipes got canceled to make room and would be later re-implemented- such as Hot sauce, chili, meat pies, BR, and several of my beverage quests were being reviewed and adapted.<br />
<br />
 So sorry to burst your bubble, but between the NDA, and changes at SOE and in programming whims of devs...I did say, what I knew would work might not anymore, and had to go off clues and stuff SOE allowed me to retain.<br />
<br />
 My bond is that, I didn't break the NDA and the final recipe I was given was in no way close to what was discovered on test.<br />
<br />
 BR is supposed to use a garnish and hot sauce as it is a hangover cure akin to a bloody mary with a Dwarven kick to it.<br />
 It was supposed to blast drunkeness fog out of a character...but instead it gets you really really drunk...go figure.<br />
<br />
 Don't you hate it when your ideas are wrong? Well so do I, and I am sure the dev's had to make some short cuts to get some things live and adapted them sans the background I had or Yak had in these brews. (to see how some of my brewing quests were bastardized is another).<br />
<br />
 I always said, &quot;don't read too much into what I have posted&quot; but I was analyzed word by word, phrase by phrase anyway, that's not my fault.<br />
<br />
 I provided clues from my own notes, what I had made before, and what had worked for me.<br />
 The original BR was  Dwarven Ale, Whiskey (vodka was substituted here as a placeholder by Yak), veggies, (garnish was to be added later but cross recipe usefulness items were not in DB at that time), Aviak Egg (looted or foraged), Spices (as placeholder for nagafen spices or hot sauce) and a cask.<br />
<br />
  that worked as Dwarven ale + vodka + veggies + spices + egg + cask for the few months after the main trade skill bit. Then it stopped working. When Scars of velious went live (and diaries went live).<br />
 The bit about brodders revenge quest n clues were removed from my diaries as were other quest clues and walthroughs (Test of Hate/Elven Dark Spy quest).<br />
<br />
 I wasn't told what changes were going in and what else was in secretly...<br />
<br />
 Dwarven whiskey was provided in Thurg Pubs...but halfings and dwarfs had their own versions...<br />
 All the schnapps recipes I had using superior gnomish spirits were changed to something sillier.<br />
<br />
<br />
 I am a writer, creator, visionary, and most of all a dwarven dreamer, I've done what I can to make EQ more fun for tradeskillers and like Den Mom, we do what we can, within the limits that bind us.<br />
<br />
 And communication black outs and NDA's that we honor are why we are who we are.<br />
<br />
  Fell BURNED, sorry matey, not my fault.<br />
 Want to help, great, if not, go sulk in a corner.<br />
<br />
  Now who's got my pretzels! I'm in a mood for a nash and some ale!  BAR WENCH! SERVICE!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I understand they gave you an NDA, but why didn't you ever say that you tested them once and made them, but couldn't guarantee that the recipe was the same.  You never said it directly, in fact you evaded the question several times, when we asked you if you verified the recipe in game.  Most people read what you wrote as gospel.  I feel a little used about that and have no desire whatsoever to ever give Lewena anything ever again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brodder FoamyMugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I was asked to not confirm or deny any recipe's status in game.<br />
But I could provide clues. And provide round about formulas of the recipes as I knew them as they were purpoted to be similar in nature...the deviations weren't so minor after all, something I had no control over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'll concede that it wasn't your fault, Brodder, that recipes got changed, and I honor your commitment to your integrity.  Were I in your shoes, I'd likely have done (or tried to do) the same as you have.  I didn't mean to suggest you intentionally led us astray, but in the end, it was a case of the blind leading the blind.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, that doesn't change the fact that none of us have any real clue how to help out Lewena.  It also doesn't change the fact that I personally don't have the play time to commit to this search.<br />
<br />
A few months back, we were promised new NPC's or new NPC text with some clues or suggestions on how to proceed with the Lewena quest.  To my knowledge, those have not surfaced.  Our one guide (Brodder himself) is guessing just as much as the rest of us; he just has a richer background to draw on.<br />
<br />
As I said, this time I prefer to wait until we have some concrete proof that this quest is live, functional, and completable.  I wish you luck in the search.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Until it is confirmed that the quest works, AND that hints have been added, I am not starting another Wild Goose Chase.  <br />
<br />
And after all the effort, the hair-pulling, the pleading with Lewena to enlighten us, the quest reward had better not be 5 coppers and a rusty sword.  I want a portable still or brew barrel, thank-you-very-much!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>DeegerStormcrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The reward (if any) will probably not be a portable still unless the drink she wants is vastly expensive with a very high trivial (IMO, anyway).  So I wouldn't expect anything more than a minor reward.<br />
<br />
I understand everybody's frustration.  I gave up on BR, Lewena, etc. a while ago.  We over analyzed Brodder's comments because that's all we could analyze.  Starving men will tear moldy bread apart in their haste to eat it ;)<br />
<br />
That said I'll guess the devs are frustrated too.  We might be missing what appears (to the devs) to be a very obvious clue.  It's no fun to create something you think is clever only to find your target users getting mad at you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>KanadWinterstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">As expected, she doesn't want any of the 5th anniversary drinks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Meh, I've given up on Lewena until someone can find another clue to her in game.  I've tried everything I can think of and everything everyone else has thought of. Either she really doesn't want anything and it's a broken quest like most people think, or the reference and object is so obscure and impropable (Like Brodder's Revenge recpie that was finally solved by the new tradeskill UI window) that unless we are flat out told what it is, we're never going to get it.<br />
<br />
And as for your pretzles, still working on them.  Trying to get black pepper so I can make beer batter to test out on clumps of dough. Mabye noodles... dunno.  <br />
<br />
I'll be able to give more definative answers after I get the expantion and do some experimentation.</div></div><hr />

She's changed her tune. It used to be ( Oct 24, 2003) :<br />

<br />
Now, I know it isn't much, but it's a change. I think we all figured out that the drink couldn't be purchased already.<br />
<br />
and 2) <br />
Brodder's poem which everyone (including Brodder) says has been over-analyzed:<br />
<br />
Dah recipe is der for ye...<br />
A New ale ye see...<br />
For if not found by you...<br />
A New ale would be the clue..<br />
<br />
Missing it may be, but der it is...<br />
I'm sure it nuttin wif a fizz...<br />
In name it was...Cold n Blue...<br />
Gnomish antifreeze it could be too<br />
<br />
Spiced ale never seen?<br />
Brodder's Revenge?<br />
Test of Hate-elven delight?<br />
Quested too hard they say...<br />
Many groaned in dismay.<br />
<br />
Perhaps a mug on a shelf a clue?<br />
Near the lass it may be.<br />
Catnip tea and ale?<br />
Ah'd shiver hard let me tell you.<br />
<br />
Sumtin to warm the soul<br />
maybe...<br />
The clue in a name could be...<br />
The search maddens them all...<br />
But it's not far from that hall...<br />
<br />
My bags are full, and halflings distracted...<br />
Jumjum I'd never consume<br />
Nor the juice of a legume...<br />
But with vodka, and egg and spices concoted...<br />
YOur revenge might be cured after all...<br />
<br />
I'll be watching and smiling, <br />
ever perservere.<br />
If ye hear a belch from below...<br />
twas dah wind...<br />
pardon me if that came after...<br />
<br />
;p<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Brodder...<br />

Everything else I found by searching her name on these forums wound up with either over-analyzed portions of the above poem, or WAGs (Wild *AHEM*ed Guesses).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The vendor at Grimthor's Bar in Shadowhaven sells drinks relating to each of the &quot;houses&quot; in Shadowhaven, and in sets that seem to fall into the Faydwer Shaker / Faydwer Porter recipe patterns:<br />
<br />
stout / fordel / midst red (wine?)<br />
House Stout Lager / House Fordel Porter / House Midst Reserve (all ales, or each house's &quot;specialty&quot;?)<br />
<br />
stout red + fordel red + midst red + mead + cask = DNC<br />
HSL + HFP + HMR + mead + cask = DNC<br />
<br />
Even though none of these items has a tradeskill flag, I keep asking myself  - like recipes that haven't been discovered - what if the flag is only set when the recipe something is used in is discovered? I don't know if SoE would do that sort of thing, but having these items grouped in exactly this way is far too suggestive, in my mind.<br />

<br />
Just to give some feedback on that particular line.....Kaniz hides have had tradeskill flags on them and have since I've been in PoTorment (Sept 2003), perhaps longer.  Only since the new UI in Feb did anyone find a use for them. It's possible they aren't flagged yet, isn't there something in game used in tradeskills not flagged?  May just be a flub though  :(</div></div><hr />
