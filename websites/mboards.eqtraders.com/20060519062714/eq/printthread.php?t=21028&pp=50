				<div>Originally Posted by <strong>AbsorEQ</strong></div>
				<div style="font-style:italic">Hello Tradeskillers!<br />
<br />
You've probably been hearing rumors and rumblings about some upcoming changes to the tradeskill system and you're probably curious as to what they might be.<br />
<br />
Well, you're in luck! We're planning on implementing the first portion of these changes with the next scheduled update, with the second and third portions to follow in future updates. Due to the nature of these changes, we want to explain them now, giving you time to prepare for them and discuss them within the community.<br />
<br />
NOTE: We use the word &quot;average&quot; in this discussion very frequently. There's a reason for that. We can only calculate the average rate at which a skill will increase. Any particular character will most likely experience deviation from that average.<br />
<br />
The mathematics used to determine the change to gain a skill increase with any given combine are rather complicated, and for those of you with the enormous brains needed to understand them, you can probably get formulas from Tanker at the next Fan Faire. For the purpose of this discussion we'll keep it more generalized. Currently the average number of combines needed to gain a skill increase does not progress at a smooth rate. The current system was built when the skill cap was 200, and therefore the most dramatic increase in the average number of combines needed to gain a skill point is between skill 160 and 190. Currently the average number of combines needed for a skill up more than quadruples between 160 and 190.<br />
<br />
That made sense back when the skill cap was 200. It doesn't now.<br />
<br />
We have created a new algorithm (some sort of mathemagical formula) which will effectively remove the harsh spike in combines required for a skill-up in the 160-190 range and spread out that progression across the entire range from 0 to 300. This change makes the progression a lot more logical, with a more reasonable increase in the average number of attempts per skill increase from 0 all the way up to 300.<br />
<br />
There are some side-effects associated with this change that we wanted to make you aware of, the largest of which being that it will decrease the over-all average number of combines needed to get a skill from 0 to 300 by about 15%. At the same time, however, it will increase the average number of skill-ups needed to go from 250 to 300 by about 20%. Basically, the average number of combines per skill-up needed from 160 to 190 was too high and those needed from 250 to 300 were too few. Smoothing out this skill increase progression required reducing the effort in some places and increasing it in others. The over-all effect of this change is a net reduction of about 15% in the average number of combines needed to reach 300, along with a smoother progression that should make the entire system feel more reasonable.<br />
<br />
We plan to make this change with the next update, so plan your tradeskilling accordingly. There are two other changes that we plan to implement in the near future, though they will not be going in the next update.<br />
<br />
In the near future (not this next update), we will be introducing a new feature to the tradeskill system that will allow us to add a new flag to some of the recipes that require more difficult to find items. We haven't given it a name yet, but this new flag will allow us to set a minimum chance to gain a skill increase on specific recipes. Basically, if we assign a minimum skill increase chance of 50% to a recipe, then there will be no less than a 50% chance of gaining a skill increase on that recipe. Keep in mind that there are other factors still involved that can supersede this, such as your primary stat and the success of the recipe, but it is close enough to use as a generalization. Using this new functionality, we can make it so that recipes with hard to find components can be useful for gaining skill increases, perhaps equally as useful in that regard as recipes that only use store-bought components. <br />
<br />
Initially, we will probably set the minimum skill increase change on a limited number of recipes, in order to evaluate them. From that point on we will continue to evaluate recipes to see if they should also have a minimum skill increase chance.<br />
<br />
The third change (also not happening with the next update) will be an extensive revision of the trivials for most recipes. We plan to evaluate the recipes for each tradeskill and change their trivials based on various factors, including the overall value of the final product and the time investment / difficulty to gain the items needed to make the product. We will use this information to create a reasonable progression for all recipes in available to each tradeskill.<br />
<br />
This is very likely to mean changes to the trivials for most or all of the recipes. It will likely mean that recipes that produce better items will have higher trivials. It will also probably mean that recipes with easy to obtain items will have lower trivials than those with harder to find items.<br />
<br />
We understand that this will probably stir things up for the folks that do tradeskills, but once the dust settles we believe that the system will be much more reasonable, rewarding, and much easier to work with, both for players and designers.<br />
<br />
This change will take us some to implement, as there are a lot of recipes to evaluate, so please be patient and<b> keep an eye open on Test, since that's where the changes will show up first.</b><br />
<br />
So, in summary, there are three large changes coming to tradeskills:<br />
<br />
1. Smoothing out the increase in the average number of attempts needed to produce a skill increase (coming with the next update).<br />
2. Introducing a per-recipe minimum chance to gain a skill increase based on the effort and time required to get the components of the recipe (also coming in an update soon, but not the next one).<br />
3. Changes to the trivials on many recipes in order to make the skill up and reward path more logical (coming in an update soon, but not the next one).<br />
<br />
We know this is a lot to change, but we think it will make the whole system more logical and rewarding.</div>

OK, this makes sense. Now, since you've admitted the tailoring Adjustments were a mistake how about reversing them until they were meant to be adjusted?<br />

We play this game for enjoyment. Finding out that 1000's of man hours are wasted is just plain wrong. Do the right thing and gain some positive PR. EQ sure needs it, especially now.</div>

Might be time to recalculate skilllevels before patch comparable to the xp recalculation when xp was smoothed out fo r the hell levels.</div>

<br />
1) they need to reverse the early implementation of the tailoring triv changes (which from absors own mouth were nto due till the patch after next, not 2 patches ago which is when they did go live<br />
<br />
2) changing the average skillup progression needs more thought on its implementation.<br />
Those who have just gone through the 160-190 hard part will now have a harder time due to also havign the slower 200-300 part when its smoothed out. Meaning 0-300 for them will be more than 0-300 for anyone before the change AND 0-300 by anyone after the change!<br />
When its smoothed out it needs applying to peoples trade skills as well.</div>

		<div>Overall, I think the changes will be positive, especially the &quot;Minimum Chance of skillup&quot; setting.  I won't feel so obliged to hold on to rare components until I max out my skill at 300, if I know that I can make the attempt and get a greater chance at a skill up as well as the chance to succeed on making the item.<br />
<br />
Don't go overboard on the &quot;Maximum chance of skillup&quot; settings though Absor, because the RNG already smacks tradeskillers around, so giving the RNG any additional advantages against us is just no fair :(<br />
<br />
<br />
And please do consider undoing the Tailoring trivial changes and implement them only with the rest of the changes.  Because with usually a month between regular patches, it would pobably be at least may before the trivial changes would take effect, and that would be a very kind thing to do for the folkd sitting on stockpiles that they cant use because they are already past 252.<br />
<br />
Finally, Spell Research recipes top out at 227, take a look at those and add some PoP and GoD spell recipes, will ya?<br />
<br />

		<div>Currently, the progression of tailoring, alchemy and (non-Elven) fletching is so difficult that it may as well be non-existent. When they readjust the trivials and add the min_chance_to_skillup flag, I hope they take that into consideration and make amends. Even with the min_chance_to_skillup flag, if the recipes that are reassigned trivials to post 250 require elementals drops, bazu bones or scarce foraged items (to name a few), we are still screwed. When pottery is updated, we will likely come upon hard times as well. There are, I am certain, even more pitfalls, but these are the ones that come quickly to mind.<br />
<br />
A perhaps fitting little anecdote would be: The cruel tyrant hears of an old lady who prays for his well-being every day. The tyrant is intrigued by the woman's actions, because he is well aware of the fact that he is an evil ruler. He summons her to his palace and asks her to explain. She states that the tyrant preceeding him wasn't as cruel as he is, and that the tyrant before his predecessor was even less mean. She would rather he live than be under the grip of a possibly harsher despot.<br />
<br />
Bottom line: While the tradeskill system in its current form may be far from perfect, we are acclimated. We have learned how to adjust and overcome. Positive, non-intrusive and not all encompassing change is always appreciated (e.g. adding recipes to fill in progression (alchemy, fletching *hint*), adding containers to the list the bag lady will tokenize, increasing / decreasing certain drop rates). As you most certainly thread with caution already, I advise even more caution. Please, don't throw tradeskilling from the frying pan into the fire.</div>

		<div>I'm interested by the concept of an extra chance to get a skillup on items with rare components. But I also think that idea could be taken further.<br />
<br />
In EQ2 everytime you succeed in learning a new item you get extra tradeskill XP. I'd like the same idea to be brought into EQL in a slightly modified way. How about an extra skillup roll triggered by a new recipe being learned in your container? It wouldn't have to be a high chance, 5% or so, but it would encourage everyone to try out different recipes instead of just concentrating on one item and grinding.</div>

Is it just me or does this line make NO SENSE WHATSOEVER?!?!?<br />
<br />
It takes 50 skill ups to go from 250 to 300. If you increase that by 20%, then youll be gettin 60 skillups and get to 310.<br />

I think if we did all that would happen would be the same folks getting angry again because they had just sold all their tailoring skillup material. It affected me too, but I'm learning to adapt. There are still relatively easy and viable ways to skillup, just no one is using them. Sure it sucks using 4 pelts a combine, but that's life. (And I want 2100) If anything we've been given a gift in sacrificing one tradeskill for the benefit of knowing the others will be getting nerfed too.<br />

			<div><strong>my 2cp</strong><br />&nbsp;</div>
		
		
		
		<div>There are two *extreme* cases of players who trade-skill.  Those who will always do it for enjoyment *unless* they are given enough disincentives and those who will only do trade-skills if given enough incentive.  Most trade-skillers will have a bit of both in them in varying proportions.  There seems to me to be no point in Sony providing trade-skill quests or items that push people who hate trade-skills into doing them.  They'd be much happier if the item in question just dropped off a tough mob somewhere.  For those of us more towards the other extreme we don't need much incentive, we just don't need *disincentives*.   (Also driving people who don't like trade-skills into it because of the gear means they steal OUR supplies lol.)  Where I fit on the scale is I need very little incentive to trade-skill, I just want the stuff I make to be ok for the level of skill required.  However at the same time certain kinds of disincentives put me off a lot.  The biggest disincentive of all was of course the old UI, getting rid of which deserves endless praise.<br />
<br />
Anyway I thought I'd mention a couple of my personal disincentives as relates to the post re: trivial progression and the new recipe flag.  Both sound like great ideas btw.<br />
<br />
1)  It is fairly minor and it may be just me but merchant resale bugs me.  I don't want to plat farm with trade skills but I think a success should show a profit *even* if it is one silver.  I've always had to grit my teeth through pottery because it seemed so dumb to destroy what you made because firing it made a big loss.  Firing should have a higher triv at least because for me destroying what I succeed at straight after making it is annoying.  The recipe flag mentioned could be used for that too.  Recipes that require mob drops could have a slightly higher resale e.g 2 silver.  It would have to be small to prevent people making a fortune sitting in front of a merchant.  Items made with rare drops could be worth more.  I have no idea how difficult this would be to implement though.<br />
<br />
2) A second disincentive relates to variety.  At certain times in certain trade skills you spend a lot of time doing one thing e.g farming supples for tailoring.  Smoothing out the trivial list so a player spends less time just killing spiders or whatever before they move on to the next mob is a good thing because of this e.g instead of one triv being 10 points and the next 20 points make them both 15.  However I'd also like to see more alternate paths at at least some of the same triv levels.  So for example a chanter tailor at one triv level is running around in a big zone looking for wandering mobs and wishing they had track while at another triv level a druid is looking at a room full of mobs wishing harmony worked in dungeons.  Apart from the class aspects just having two alternatives for the same triv level would ease the pain a bit because if bored of one zone getting one type of drop you could try the alternative for a while.  A second bit of variety I'd like is with fletching (which is pretty much ok at the lower skill levels) but a bit boring.  Some old world fetching recipes for turning mob drops into magic arrow heads e.g cockatrice beaks or longer range fletchs from some feathers.  They don't have to produce uber stuff, one damage magic arrow heads would be fine but it would be a change from merchant stuff plus when I've started a ranger from scratch they've never had the plat to skill up to silver arrows by the time they meet mobs that need magic arrows.  Recipes like that would be a good choice imo for the higher skill up recipe flag.<br />
<br />
nb: A lot of trade-skillers secretly want trade-skills to be a *bit* painful otherwise there is no satisfaction at the end, just not too much.  Impossible to quantify however.<br />
<br />
The third thing I thought of today should probably go on the wish list thread so I'll end here.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">In EQ2 everytime you succeed in learning a new item you get extra tradeskill XP. I'd like the same idea to be brought into EQL in a slightly modified way. How about an extra skillup roll triggered by a new recipe being learned in your container? It wouldn't have to be a high chance, 5% or so, but it would encourage everyone to try out different recipes instead of just concentrating on one item and grinding.</div>

The retentiveness in me is forcing me to point out (sorry) that in EQ2, the tradeskilling system is completely different.  You level up just like any other class, but instead of getting XP for killing something, you get XP for crafting items.  You learn the recipes by purchasing the recipe books.  You gain the extra XP when you make your first pristine of each item (there are 4 qualities of the combines, from crude to pristine.)</div>

		<div>I read over Absor's stickied post and I just wanted to say that I think this is a great idea. I have always wondered why stuff like the reinforced acrylia armor has worse stats than the studded armor, when the reinforced is a higher trivial. It always seemed kind of backwards to me. It's nice to see that these issues are being given attention. I think that once it is finished, the tradeskill overhaul will be good and will help tradeskills make more sense.</div>

Am I the only one that sees a problem with this? I hate to be negative, but don't raiders already have huge advantages? Who do you think has first, and almost exclusive, access to these &quot;hard-to-find&quot; components? It sure isn't me, or many of the tradeskill community who aren't in raid heavy guilds. I can only imagine the bazaar prices for PoP and later components if it is known they increase skill-up chance.<br />

If you all think I'm making too much of it I'll stop, I just think it's one of those ideas that looks great on paper, but causes rifts when implemented...</div>

You need to raid quite extensively to get flagged so you can group in pop so that is very much a case of needing a raid, if not to get it at least to get access to it.<br />

As for don, while not needing a raid it does need a high lvl group, so a tradeskiller at say 60 is gonna have a much harder time than a trade skiller at 70, or a raid trade skiller.</div>

I got a majority of flags from other guilds doing them who didn't care if I were there or not. None of my flags have come from my guild that I've been in for quite some time. Furthermore, we don't know what will qualify as a &quot;rare&quot; combine, so it may or may not be elemental stuff even. <br />
<br />
As for the lower level tradeskiller, unfortunately that's just the way it is. I know it sucks, but there's always going to be someone who will fall through the cracks. I hope that perhaps they scale it so people of lesser levels doing say elemental combines will skillup more than someone at say 70, but who knows. Most of the good and rare combines nowadays can't even be used by a level 60, so I do expect this to affect 65+ characters more than anyone else. When it comes to raiding guilds, most raiding guilds have a specific tradeskiller. Anything that drops on the raid goes into the guild bank, so at best, probably only one person benefits from this, not an entire guild.</div>

		<div>So if I'm reading this all correctly anyone over 190 skill already went through the toughest part of skilling up but if they are between 250 and 300 still they are gonna make it 20% tougher to finish it up? Why in the world after 6 years of the old system would they change it that way? I mean how many people are at 0 skill after 6 years and thinking after the next patch &quot;Hey, why not start trade skilling, I hear its 15% easier.&quot; ?!??!?!?!  Maybe I am not understanding all this, but aren't these changes gonna make it harder for a large majority of the trade skillers out there? Many people I know either have never touched trade skills (and never will) and the ones that are into them are already up in the 190+ ranges and now they are getting news that sony is gonna make it harder to finish. I am so lost by this thinking by sony, I could see using this thinking for a new game (like EQ2) where everyone starts at the same skill lvl (0) and it effects everyone equally, but to change the game 6 years in with people at various lvls might help some but penalizes others. How is that even close to fair?  <br />

Yes I understand that the mechanisms are totally different but I think this is one feature that really shone in EQ2 and I would like to see brought back into EQL.<br />
<br />
In EQL we now get a message that tells us that a recipe has been learned if we are successfull on a new recipe. If an such extra roll was keyed to that message then it should be possible to implement. The flag to make such a roll possible is already there in the game.</div>

				At the same time, however, it will increase the average number of skill-ups needed to go from 250 to 300 by about 20%. Basically, the average number of combines per skill-up needed from 160 to 190 was too high and those needed from 250 to 300 were too few. Smoothing out this skill increase progression required reducing the effort in some places and increasing it in others.

So they are changing the hard part of tradeskilling from roughly 160-190 (when there are quite a few skill-up options in most skills) to 250-300 (when there are much less skill up options in most skills)? My skill-up chances on rare combines had better be a heck of a lot higher to make up for that.  :boggled: <br />

While making massive changes to tradeskilling fundamentals, how about looking at the excessive clicking annoyance?

Right now after the tailoring nerf, farming othmirs for 5 hours gets about me 1 tailoring skill up, ...53skill ups to go... so 265hours of killing green cons ahead of me (probably more like 300+ hours since the 295 triv takes the double amount of furs) and we're going to increase it with another 20%? not looking forward to spending 300+, let along 360+ real life hours to gain 53 skill ups to max out a single skill...<br />

<br />
If so, this means that there <i>could</i> be some recipes used for skilling up from the-soon-to-be hell zone of 250 to 300 that have a trivial below 250.  Perhaps we can skill up on Solstice Robes even though the trivial wont move!  Perhaps not the sort of recipe this is ment for, but it seems it will be at least possible computer-code wise.<br />
<br />
It sounds like this will add skill up options anyway.<br />
<br />
Or does this just mean that for <i>non-trivial</i> recipes, some will be better than others?  It does seem to me that making a Lore Black Acrylia Halbard, with hard to get (for me) Akheva blood, should build my Smithing skill more than churning out Shadowscream.<br />
<br />
Separately, I for one refuse to be goaded into dropping every thing and making a run to 300.  Firstly, this is not how I view TS.  I do it to make things, not to have the number. Not sure I want to get Pottery to 300 for example - I can make what I want at 260!  Secondly, if it is 20% tougher, but there is a recipe with ingrediants 50% easier to get (for me) then it might be better after the patch than now.</div>

Ummm... that's exactly what they DIDN'T do when they got rid of the hell levels..<br />
<br />
If you were 83% through level 45 before the change, you were STILL 83% of the way through level 45 after the change.<br />
<br />
I would be completely amazed if they do anything to adjust people's current skill level. It's not that I don't agree that it would be nice (especially for those like me with most of our skills sitting in the 190-250 range), but it just sounds too complicated, error-prone and potentially confusing. <br />
<br />
But... stranger things have happened... like when they got rid of hell levels after saying for years it was impossible :)</div>

<br />
As it is now, it will do more harm than good, and penalize/anger/discourage the folks that have worked hard to raise their skill up high, but haven't been able to max the skill yet.<br />
<br />
If SOE is trying to encourage more players to start tradeskills thats understandable, but penalizing existing tradeskillers just isn't right. Imagine the roar SOE would hear if they suddenly added 20% more pre steps to do for the late/mid stages of PoP, GoD, and OOW flagging to everyone who hadn't gotten the last flags yet, after making it easier for more folks to do the lower parts of that work.<br />
<br />
This is also a nice double whammy for the tailors.<br />
<br />
I just wish they would stop fiddling with (ie breaking) stuff that worked and fix the numerous broken things in the game.</div>

Not sure how things are on youre server but on TM where I am tradeskills are completely messed up, if youre not 300 on the skill, and often even if you are at 300 skill, youre still selling most of your final products at a loss. I love making all my own stuff but usually I can find finished products on my server in the bazaar for 25% of the creating costs of what it would take me to create it. (Examples would be gem studded chains for 100pp, bazu breastplates for 20K while the bloods alone go for more, eartweave gear between 6-12K while the at my skill buying the components even with lesser failure AAs Id have to cough up an average 20K a piece, valorium rings of gallantry at 2K each while metallic liquids run for more on my server) <br />
As for pottery, I'm at 300 skill at the moment, ceramic shields of valor often sell for 5K, components costs 6.5K on my server in the bazaar... I can make m with practically zero failures but if I sold the components I gathered for them in the bazaar instead I'd be pulling off a 1.5K profit and I could buy the shield without any risk on a random failure.<br />
As a 292 Jeweller, I can get 1.5K for my iron amulets of unseen horror... or I could sell the parts I collected for almost 3K, and buy 2 amulets from another jeweller from that plat....<br />
As a 300baker, I still buy my misty thicket picnics at 1pp each in the bazaar since I dont find it worth my time anymore to create them when they are going for that cheap. (5 GM baker chars btw, using bristlebanes party platters on all of those)<br />
As a 300brewer, you probably get my point by here.... I buy my drinks from other brewers selling at their component costs and below it.<br />

The way I'm interpreting Absor's post is if the ingredients are easy to get, their trivial will be lowered which in my personal opinion will most likely lead to all the 335 solstice trivial combines being lowered to 252. It's a risk I choose not to take myself after what happened to the tailoring economy on my server. I'm sorry but as a 247tailor with -10% failures I find I highly frustrating if friends ask me if I can create a robe of ancient earth for them and I have to tell m to go buy m at the bazaar prizes because buying the components seperately will cost m way more than buying the robe and that I'm still facing only a 60% succes chance on it after he/she buys the stuff for it......  <br />
<br />
When I started on tradeskills 5 years ago I did it to make a few pp to get my lvl 52 cleric out of her bronze gear, after I reached that goal I did tradeskills to be able to supply my guild with solstice kits they could afford when they where still going for 10K and I could create m for 50% of that to help people out. Those days are over, solstice kits can be bought in the bazaar for 2K which is way below component costs. The tradeskill economy is already completely ruined in my eyes on my server, I'm just trying to hit 300 in all skills asap just for the title and to keep doing all my combines for guildies and friends for free with the best succes rate possible. In the meanwhile, I'm practically destroying my plat on tradeskills and turning the succeses in for my guilds tribute since I refuse to sell 300+ triv items for 25-50% of their component costs in the bazaar.</div>

First things first the good news, I really like the idea of some reciped being flagged for a greater chance to provide a skill up, it shoudl hopefuly mean expensive and tiem consuming, even dangerous recipes will become worth while. My pottery sat at 247 with my potters trophy, I think in that time since PoP when I pushed it above 200 I've made over 100 PoP pottery combiens with high trivials you know I got my first skill up from them today to 248. Now ceramic shield of valors aren't hard to get the components for but they certainly don't sell like they used to but Ro incense burners and Rathe totems? Those parts are just daft to get hold of.  :D <br />
<br />
However with regards to the smoothing out of tradeskills...omg what are they thinking? Yes it's a fantastic idea to make it smooth and flowing but most people here that care about tradeskilling are already way past that point and have invested many, many hours and potentially large sums of hard earnt platinum as well to push towards high skills. Hell to join the 1750 clum and the 2100 club you have to have at least reached 51st level (yeah it's fast compared to the good ole' days) anf plowed a into tradeskill cap increases. If this was implemented from day 1 of EQ then great, or if they returned all our hours, pp, effort, swollen/damaged fingers/wrists and reset every one to 0 and said go for it again then it would be an even playing field for all. Right now this is goign to land as a double whammy for those who have plowed through the high number of combines and are going to face them yet again going over 250. Lets not forget the fact they are up front saying it will take a higher number of total combines to 300 a skill.  :mad: <br />
<br />
This spurs me into instant action. I tend currently to spend a little while each day working on my skills for fun and to eliminate the painfulness of farming, sub combing and combining for hours and hours in a row. It certainly is slower but stops me going spare. Right now I'm going straight back online and plowing everythign I can before we start raiding this evening. Farming for shadowscream is the worst thing I've ever done in my EQ life of over 5 years but pain aside I'm against the clock now, I just hope I'm not goign to find my server trade skill farming spots more crowded than Kunark on release of the xp potion  :( <br />
<br />
Guess I need to go out an aa as well to unlock JC, Smithing and Tailoring /shudder.<br />
<br />
Absor if you are out there, and we know you are take heart we've battled, researched, practiced, farmed and come to accept and understand the systtem we currently have. Make it better yes but don't spit in the face of those the system means the most to while you do attempt that.<br />
<br />
Volunteers to right new guides for all skills when this goes live? Poor Denmother will be busier than on an expansion release can you imagine every trivial changing? Have a heart...<br />

And while you are at it how about letting Half-Elves use the cultural fletching of their diety? My ranger was born many moons ago when Ruins of Kunark was new and exciting if I'd known then I woudl have sadly choosen Wood Elf as my starting race. After all you let me reset my home point from surefall galde to Kelethin for Origin so why not go all the way? ;)</div>

		<div>I think what you're all forgetting is that even with a 20% increase to diffuculty in raising tradeskills, you're also an increased chance to skillup on rarer items. From the looks of it, they are making tradeskills a real accomplishment to have, not just a skill from boredom. In your quest to 250, there's probably a good chance you'll be making enough rare combines for people that it will negate the 20% modifier. I'm not a huge fan of what some of Sony has done, but I've seen enough good and helpfulness in Absor and Maddoc to the tradeskill community to at least hope that they've taken this into account.<br />

		<div>Adjusting the skill rates would also have to factor in the people who are already 250+ which means that they would be losing skill points, which I don't know about other's view points, but I don't see that as very fair anyway.  Giving someone something then taking it away is also not a good way to go about this.  When they removed the hell levels, my experience did not change at all and I was only 10% full on lvl 60.  It smoothed the whole path out.  It still required the same exact amount of exp to get to 60, the whole path was more evenly spaced than one level costing twice the exp of the previous.<br />
<br />
Pretty much impossible to do with tradeskills because you would have to factor in multiple bad runs vs people who never had to do more than 60 to get a skill up, there's really no way to smooth it out that is fair across the board unless they went back into the logs of every character and factored in every TS combine they did that would gain skill and then figured out what their adjusted would be.  Way too much work for no reason other than to negatively impact a good number of tradeskillers and give a bonus to very few, probably even less.</div>

		<div>I am not sure how to take this news, I won't know for sure until it's implemented. Meanwhile, I am just plodding away at combines to get everything as high as possible. I have hard time believing that they would make it easier for us to skill up. I mean look at the past implementations. They nerfed the Fine Steel trivial in Smithing to make it &quot;better&quot; for us. How about increasing skill up difficulties on Fletching, Pottery, Smithing and Tailoring? They didn't make other skills easier, just made those harder. Now with the recent Tailoring nerf, it is even more difficult getting skill ups. <br />
<br />
They have made it easier to combine by making more than two containers open at once. They also made it easier by letting you mass imbue/enchant things. They introducing combine buttons on the tradeskill containers to make combines easier. However, I don't remember anything change that made it easier to skill up. Can anyone remember anything that would contradict my theory?<br />
<br />
As many stated, fixing the &quot;hell level&quot; of 160-190 sounds like the first time they are actually making it easier to skill up. However, that comes at a sacrifice of higher levels, which I suspect that most of us are at today. BTW, how is it smoothing out the skill if the higher level is more difficult to skill up? To me when you smooth out the progression, that means you have the same chance to succeed in skill up at level 10 as at level 270. What they are proposing is more of a exponential skill up, not a &quot;smooth&quot; linear skill up. <br />
<br />
After getting the easier skills up to 300, I tried to get smithing up and spent about 6-7 hours of farming for 40 combines. That got me total of 2 points. This is current system, not the new proposed system. That means I would have to spend over 150 hours of farming for me to get from 250 to 300. That's on top of all the raids I need to attend and XP groups I need to AAs to get better at tradeskills. And it will only get worse after these changes go in. <br />
<br />
I would say if they have a few recipe changes that comes to our favor, then I may take my words back. However, from the past behavior, I would doubt that very much. I am, for one, going to try my hardest to skill up before these &quot;nerfs&quot;. I may be broke at the end and probably won't enjoy the game as much between now and then, but it sure beats what is coming.<br />

		<div>The original post by Absor made it sound as if 160 to 190 were hell levels, but this was more correctly stated by Absor as &quot;the average number of combines needed for a skill up more than quadruples between 160 and 190.&quot; The progression from 160 to 190 is actually linear, as is the progression from 0 to 190. At 160 the skill up rate for near trivial combines is 20%, and for 190 it is 5%. Therefore, the skill up rate at 190 is four times less than that at 160 which is where the 'quadruples' comment comes from. <br />
<br />
What they seem to be doing is extending the linear progression out to near 250 which makes it easier to skill up from 0 to 250 as Absor stated. The skill up rate after 250 then changes from the current 5% theoretical chance (1 skill up in 20 trys) to a 4% theoretical chance (one skill up in 25 trys).<br />
<br />
The theoretical skill up chance only happens if the trivial is very close to the players actual skill. If there are no combines with close trivials the 4% theoretical chance will drop to an actual chance that is below 4%. This means that if there aren't many trivials close together in the 250 to 300 range the actual skill ups will be less than 4% and it could get really ugly especially in those tradeskills that are more difficult, meaning those tradeskills with Y values of 3 or 4.<br />
<br />
The new hell levels will be 250 and up depending on what and where the available trivial combines are. So, for those of us above 220 and not yet significantly above 250 we get to go through another, even more difficult, set of hell levels in addition to the ones we went through from 190 to 220.<br />
<br />
Let's hope it makes us stronger.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The theoretical skill up chance only happens if the trivial is very close to the players actual skill. If there are no combines with close trivials the 4% theoretical chance will drop to an actual chance that is below 4%. This means that if there aren't many trivials close together in the 250 to 300 range the actual skill ups will be less than 4% and it could get really ugly especially in those tradeskills that are more difficult, meaning those tradeskills with Y values of 3 or 4.<br />

<br />
But due to the nature of the formula, this is not really a problem. At a skill of 250 with a geerlock, one has a 95% success chance on combines with a trivial all the way to 291. At 280 it is 334. So that gives quite a wide range potential skill-up recipes. <br />
<br />
Of course if they change all the trivials so there is nothing between 250 and 350 then it will be a different story.</div>

		<div>It seems to me soe is trying to bite blizzard here.  This is a bad move IMO, one of the reasons I didnt like WoW, and quit after only 4 days, was that ts's were nerfed beyond recognition.  You basically get a free gm skill(300?) in one ts  as you level through the game.  The way it is balanced, your ts(whichever you choose) progresses at the same rate you do.  It is mindless, there is no farming or tenacity involved at all.  Basically, you are guranteed skill ups for most of the items you will be crafting at your level, and if you are not guaranteed one, the chance of a skillup per combine is very very high ( I seem to recall 80%+ here). SOE has stolen this idea:  &quot;In the near future (not this next update), we will be introducing a new feature to the tradeskill system that will allow us to add a new flag to some of the recipes that require more difficult to find items. We haven't given it a name yet [Blizzard calls it World of Warcraft], but this new flag will allow us to set a minimum chance to gain a skill increase on specific recipes. Basically, if we assign a minimum skill increase chance of 50% to a recipe, then there will be no less than a 50% chance of gaining a skill increase on that recipe.&quot;  You'll notice this guy is trying to pawn this off as some kind of bonus to the tradeskillers.  He states that this new &quot;flag&quot; will be for recipes with &quot;more difficult to find items&quot; as one of their components.  I think ultimetly, this &quot;flag&quot; will have nothing to do with giving ts'ers some more skill ups, it is just the implementation of SOE's new and improved WoW  ts system.  And knowing sony, it will be some half-ass attempt which in the end, will only leave things fubar'd.<br />
<br />
     From everything that I have seen I am thinking that EQ's TS's will be nerfed beyond all recognition to the extent that wow's allready are.  I really think they should be hardened.  It is way to easy for power-gamers(which I am) to level tradeskills.  I think SOE is taking ts's in the opposite way which that they should.</div>

'Nerfed' is a bad term. WoW tradeskills are just done differently.<br />
<br />
The skills are far from free. Training and learning recipes gets progressively more expensive as you go, and at the high end, most recipes are drops (some of which are very rare), which players who get them can/will gouge you for.<br />
<br />
Not having to farm actually would be considered as freeking incredibly AWESOME by a lot of people. WoW does a really good job of hiding 'grinding' and 'farming' in other things. More often then not, you get the drops for tradeskills naturally as you hunt/level, and the stuff you hunt is usually for a quest (questing is actually cleverly disguised grinding, with cash/gear/faction/bonus xp rewards).<br />
<br />
You can actually sit down in a particular area and grind out xp or farm tradeskill stuff (or even stuff to sell in the Auction House), but I find it to be a LOT more boring and tedious then actually questing and exploring. The boring tedium required to accomplish a goal is one of EQ major drawbacks.<br />
<br />
If im questing or doing an instance with guildies, i can find myself playing for hours without ever noticing. If its just brainless solo grinding/farming, i can lose interest and actually feel physically tired after about half an hour.<br />
<br />
Another good thing is that 'camps' are almost non-existant. I cant really think of any tradeskill item offhand that only drops in one small area that someone else can be hogging. Leather for leatherworking is a guarenteed item from any 'beast' mob in the game. Cloth for tailoring drops from any level-appropriate humanoid. Ore for mining/smithing/engineering can spawn in any of dozens of points in a zone, so many points that trying to camp one spot is pointless.<br />
Etcetera and so on... <br />
<br />
Some of the items/gear made at the top end of each skill are *EXTREMELY* nice and used often by even the top raiding 'ubers'. Ive heard of people even dropping one tradeskill alltogether and skilling up a new one from 1-300 just to make one item they happened to get the recipe for.<br />
<br />
The skillups are very simple in WoW. In your recipe book, you look at the *color* of the text of the recipe name. If its orange, you get a skillup if you make it. Period. Guarenteed. No RNG. No suffering thru 300 combines for a skillup. If the text is yellow, you got around a 75% chance for a skillup. If its green, between 25 and 50%. If its grey, you can not get a skill up from it.<br />
<br />
If you gather tons and tons of materials for a skillup run in EQ, you can burn them all up and get 1-2 skillups. Or none. Or 25. Or.. ??? <br />
<br />
If you gather tons and tons of materials for a skillup run in WoW, you can go from 1-300 in probably 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Does it sound like im trying to sell WoW? =D<br />
<br />
Of course there are some drawbacks. <br />
<br />
Commonly made skill-up-path items suffer from 'sickle-itis' as theres far too many available in the AH, and you have to drop your price to what a vendor will give you for it often to try and move it, or just dump it on a vendor anyways.<br />
<br />
Oh, theres no vendor-diving by the way. Anything you sell to a vendor poofs.<br />
<br />
Theres also a very small number of recepies available compared to in EQ (but then again, EQ has been around for many years and many expansions)<br />
<br />
One other, and quietly major issue, is bank space. Its very limited. You get erf... its either 24 or 30 bank slots (its early and i cant remember and the servers are down for a major content patch), and you can BUY more bank space... or rather you can buy slots to put bags in.<br />
Muling stuff is also weird. Unless you have 2 accounts and can hand stuff from one to another, muling involves MAILING the stuff to another character, which not only costs 30c but it wont arrive for 60 real-time minutes. Funky, eh?<br />
<br />
Another thing is *everyone* does tradeskills. Theres really no reason not to, even if you just pick up 2 of the 'gathering' skills and sell what you gather in the auction house. Getting from 1-300 in some of the 'creating' skills in WoW is nowehere near the ordeal it is in EQ, and you can quite literally do it in one day and turn a profit and have some really nice gear upgrades doing so.<br />
In that aspect, thers far less sense of accomplishment.<br />
When i hit 1750 in EQ i broke into tears in joy/relief and dances around my room.<br />
When i got 300 in Leatherworking in WoW I was like (yay). <br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Because every class can solo 1-60 in WoW with a pretty even ammount effort, and because tradeskills are moderately eesy, and progress lineraly as you level, its very easy to hit 60 and have maxed tradeskills in a relatively short period of time and end up saying 'Now what?'<br />
Fortunately, the classes are pretty different and playing alts its lots of fun (one thing i really didnt find appealing in EQ) <br />
Aside from my 60 Night Elf Hunter (the 'ranger' of WoW, but not really. theyre a pet class that shoots arrows, and has FD. Its weird) i have a 40 Human Warrior which has 300 engineering (aka tinkering, but you can make guns, bombs and mechanical dragons(!!)) which is pretty fun (still feels weird that i can solo a warrior =D). Ive also made a Troll Shaman on a different server which ive really been enjoying lately. Im doing leatherworking as well with her, as it seems far more leather/mail creations are more suited for shaman then they are with hunters, so ill have a greater variety of gear to make/use as i progress.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, when they come up with an expansion they will expand tradeskills even further. (Not raise the cap, i mean, but add more recipes and tradeskill quests)<br />
<br />
Sorry for the long ramble about WoW tradeskills. I just wanted to offer a better view of how they work from someone who only played for 4 days.</div>

I don't know about your server, but on mine, you aren't given a chance very often at combining rare combines unless you are already max on that skill with a geerlock/trophy/better, salvage 3, and mastery 3.<br />
<br />
So, that quote isn't accurate for me, at least.<br />
<br />
As for the change, I am not against it, per se...I don't really like it at this point (skills are 300, 289, 255, 240, 231, 200, 200), but I think it is a good change overall. But, I don't think it makes tradeskills more of an accomplishment, nor do I believe tradeskills are easy, or something you do because you are bored.<br />
<br />
I have worked very hard for a very long time (4 years+) to get my skills where they are. The 300 is in baking (which is very easy) and the 289 is JC. At this point, there is no easy progression for me except for brewing, and that requires hours and hours of mushroom farming. The rest all require a LOT of plat. I've blown over 100K on tradeskills past 200 in the past year. I am BROKE. I am not a raider, I'm not a &quot;daytrader&quot;...I'm just SOL. I make money while I hunt and, when I get a few K, I make what I can afford. It is a very slow road...and when (not if...WHEN) I hit 2100, I will be extremely proud of my accomplishment regardless of how many people claim it is too easy and you can just buy your way there.</div>
