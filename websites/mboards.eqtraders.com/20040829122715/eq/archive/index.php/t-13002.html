in 11 hours and 200p i made fish rolls till 135 and did patty melts till 191 with making the non-stick frying pan etc... <br />

i tried making candied cockroaches (200 tries got me 3 lvls). friend told me to try mtp so i started those and got about 5 lvls after about 500 tries then i tried to make the halas pies, i get 2 lvls per 100 tries. <br />
<br />
is this common lvl rate ?? at this rate it will cost an arm and leg to finish.<br />
<br />
is the spoon worth all this ??</div></div><hr />

I usually got 1 or 2 bumps per 60 combines at most. Sometimes none at all. It happens in baking. Going the MTP route.. expect to have 2000 successes before you hit 250. Not attempted combines. Actual successes. I usually always tried to get 5-10 bumps per time i was focusing on baking.. and then just plugging through over time. Just remember.. post 191 is a marathon, not a sprint.<br />

<br />
I make a lot of money on the MTP and Hala Meat Pies...and the spoon with its 10 str, 10 wis, 10 Int, 50 Cha and 100 percent wgt reduction bags?  Heck Yea... I would do it all over again and again... <br />
<br />
Now for the other trades... well lets just say.. I will NEVER be GM at tailoring or smithing... :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
IT IS NOT WORTH IT!!!<br />
<br />
That said, my druid has her Baking Spoon (only took 6 tries!) and my mage has her Smithing Hammer (miraculously on her FIRST try, the one and only time things actually went well for poor Ndaara). I LOVE them, but I didn't do trades for the GM Trophy. I do trades because i enjoy crafting, in RL and in EQ. <br />
<br />
If you don't, then don't. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>cannyar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i've read a lot of posts about how people got skill in baking very quickly with meat pies and picnics.. i wonder if sony nerfed skillups somehow as i've made well over 200 stacks of meat pies and have gotten maybe 15 skillups. i have, however, made a bunch of pp selling them in the bazaar.. i have 253 int w/o kei and most of the time i have it on anyway.<br />
<br />
oh well. back to clicking. my baking is 205 now and i'll just keep going. i'd like to get my spoon some day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Diania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't remember the last skillup rate I had on my main with baking, but I recently did 400 halas pie combines with my pally, with about 208 wis or so (she's only lvl 40 so no KEI), and I went from 213 to 221, which I figure wasn't too bad.  And I had done 200 picnic combines before, went from 208 to 210, had a ton of failures, so I decided not to make picnics with her for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>couyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">here is an update, i kept my nose to the grid and started only doing about 40 combines at a time. resulting in 3 lvls per sitting. i finally got it up to 225 and just one away from halas trival point. then i got that wild hair and tried for the gm bakers spoon, that took me 3 ties to get, i love it. it fits nice in my range slot. well let me end this note and get back to playing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was getting lousy skill-up rates doing HMPs (but making a decent profit selling them) and did 20 MTP combines with no successes or skill-ups. Once I started doing the truffles, I went from 191 to 200 fairly quickly. (I quit doing Baking that I can get skill-ups on, because I'm thinking of 250ing Brewing first - There are waaaaay too many Bakers on The Rathe to make it worth doing for profit)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just be sure to brew your own. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Garndart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think the ease refer's to the ease that baking iscompared to some trades such as smithing tailoring tinkering etc.<br />
<br />
With very little cash and relatively little time compared to say smithing, a trade skiller can power through hundreds of combines.  Post 200 in smithing (i'm doing this right now so im using it as an example) I can expect maybe 20-60 combines depending on the drop rate and the random number generator for 4 hours work. In 4 hours of baking I can do maybe 200 combines in baking. Your still looking in the 1000's of combines maybe 5000's to go from 200 to 250 the difference being you can do baking in a couple of power days and smithing takes weeks if not months. Money is also a huge thing also. I think I spent maybe at the most 5k in baking and made a huge ammount of that back in sales. Smithing I can spend 5k in 6 combines. So the ease isnt all that easy just alot easier then say the other trades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm getting an average of about 5 skill ups per 200 combines right now skilling my druid. He's 255 WIS of course. Longest run w/out a skill up was 120's, shortest was 1. :)<br />
<br />
I'm having horrible skill up rate on my Dwarven Blacksmith, but my Erudite Brewer, and now my Wood Elf Baker seem to be doing OK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">that is almost exactly what i got for skillups doing picnics.  felt like doing some so have the stuff for 3 200 runs.  hoping for about 1k picnics though 1.5k would be even better.  i try very hard to feed my guild.  :)</div></div><hr />
