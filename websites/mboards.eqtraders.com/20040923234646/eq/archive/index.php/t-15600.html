<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok.  I am finally asking for feature requests for EQTraders.<br />
<br />
Here are the rules.<br />
<br />
[list=1]<br />
  This is for requests not demands.  Demands will be ignored.<br />
  I may say no.<br />
  Please make the requests realistic.<br />
  I may say no becasue I do not see a way to do it.<br />
  Please keep all feature requests in this forum.<br />
  I may say no becasue we do not want the site to have that feature.<br />
  Realize that I am self taught, so I will not be fast on features that I decide to implement.<br />
  I may say no<br />
  If I say no, it is not because I personally hate you, nor that I am out to get you... it is because of one of the previous reasons.<br />
[/list=1] <br />
<br />
Remember... I am the House Ogre, and I am not afraid to use my stick :)<br />
<br />
One thing to which we will automatically say no:  Any page that is going to require alot of manual updates.  It just will not happen.<br />
<br />
Also... Unless there is overwelming demand for it, I will avoid doing things that require cookies, logins or simmilar &quot;personalization&quot; features.  There are just SOOOO many problems with that :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see a lot of duplication of effort which could be combined to make THE trade skill information.<br />

I don't know what your tables look like but it seems to me that with the aid of some serious pharmaceuticals you could hallucinate a REALLY nasty query to automatically find &quot;profitable&quot; combines and forward the info off to whoever is the tradeskill contact of the week for Sony.<br />

More on topic:<br />
<br />
I would love to see an advanced search page. Something where I pick a tradeskill, pick a minimum and maximum trivial range. It returns all the combines that meet those cirteria.

I realize the last two options might require semi-recursive queries to return, depending on your DB they may not be possible. Once again, if SQL help is needed, I would be happy to assist in that area. I really dislike front end coding (graphics, UI, etc), but like complex SQL problems so...<br />

<br />
This curently is just an article (not directly DB related) so it will mostly be a matter of time there.  As for making it automatic, there are iussues with that.<br />
<br />
What to do if there is a drop only part... that is also sellable so the DB has a price on it... include it or not?<br />
What to do on a ND part (probably make it 0 cost)<br />
What to do when there are multiple ways to make it (the recursion starts to get BAD...)<br />
What to do when we is missing pricing info?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The biget issue here is the diference in the way we do our db.  It would be a HUGE MANUAL linking... tons of work.  And it would take an agreement.  Plus... I don't like the idea curently of having a link that aways points to another site :/<br />
<br />
This is not a No... But a &quot;I want to think on it further.&quot;  You can also give us drop (what mob in what zone drops it...) info in the DB submisions forum when you see it... even from allakhazham's.  We each own the way we display the data... not the data itself :)</div></div><hr />

Problem #1 is the fact that people do not get us much pricing info...<br />

I will look into the more doable parts :)  I can probably say no right off to the depth (subcombines... you are correct too many sub queries) and the prices (costs) go with the post above about what to do with odd pricing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Originally posted by Tudani <br />
I'd also love for the listings that come up in a search to have the recipe and trivial shown as well as the item info (ala the recipe listing pages).  Since often that's all the info that I need when I'm searching.  <br />
It you mean in the curent items search, I would have to say no.  There are 3 issues...<br />
<br />
[list=1]  it would require UP TO 5 more DB queries for every item that comes up in the item search...  Just not something I want to add.  (everytime a recipie is needed there is a hit to get (1)the recipe, (2)the tradeskill container, (3)the components, (4)the extra success results, (5)the extra failure results.  Now to only do the trivial I only need a second hit... (the first one)... but this second hit means it doubles what the computer needs to do on that page... which equates to the page taking twice as long to load... and giving the server twice as much load for that page...<br />
  what do you do when there is more than on trivial to make that one item, and yes there are cases where the trivial is diferent (baking tools that can be made with smithing and pottery)<br />
  potery items are a mess because of the firing step... and most trivials shown would be 15... which is not usefull.<br />
[/list=1]<br />
<br />
If you mean on this theoretical new recipe search...  well, yes it will be included.<br />
<br />
The reason for a diferent recipe and item search is... item seach is more a &quot;what is this item used for...&quot; while recipe is more &quot;I need trivials in this tradeskill&quot; OR &quot;I only want items that are the result of a recipe&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok... gonna post my idea (as you haven't had enough of them already)...<br />
<br />
Armor Sets:<br />
  - Build a Table with:<br />
     Armor Set Name<br />
     Item IDs for each component of the set<br />
<br />
Generate a List of Armor Sets, that can be drilled into based on the Item IDs... <br />
<br />
Potential to identify common components, with different quantities... maybe a complete sell/purchase price of the set to an NPC<br />
<br />
Yep, would require manual entry of the sets... but since I do most of that anyway...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jarak_akn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I would love to see an export feature.<br />
I quite often want to do some additional manipulation of data in a spreadsheet (like excel) and currently I have to parse the information quite a lot before being able to use it. (I just copy and paste off of the on screen lists)<br />
<br />
It would be nice to be able to export even a slightly formated version of the data, e.g. csv or tab deliminated. Ideally from the results of the advanced search discussed above :-)<br />

(sorry for the stuff here the general public will not understand... but Krazic will :) )<br />
<br />
How about if it was a form *like* the sources form... (will only need one freeform entry field not 3 like sources)  This way you could also do &quot;weapon&quot; sets.  It would have a &quot;set name&quot; and then a list of items in the set.<br />
<br />
Then the issue would be how and when to display it.  I think I would want to work on a more dynamic way to create the left hand menu before we did this...</div></div><hr />

No :)<br />
<br />
Then in 30 seconds Yan-tis, IGE, super-sales... whatever has a copy of our DB to sell to people :/  Not gonna happen... sorry.<br />
<br />
Plus, with recipe results... the amount of &quot;columns&quot; returned is dynamic... making a CSV (or tab etc...) not horibly feasable... or with alot of wasted space... the WORST case being the containers which can be small just 1 or 2 (brewing) or huge (tailoring... up to 7 or 8)... with components I can predict that it will be no more than 10 so have 10 columns... not so with the containers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The best way I can describe this request, is to give an example.<br />
<br />
Let's say I have ton of Vegetables and want to know how best to use them.  I search on Vegetables, then click on Find Recipes That Use This Item.  The list of recipies that comes up is currently NOT sortable by trivial ... my wish is that it could be sorted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would it be worth making an agreement to have a search-button linking to allakhazam's Item Lookup search page?<br />
<br />
Either in the general sidebar (only one addition to the page?), or as a default field on all items that plugs in the item's name?<br />

Before I added that link... would have been good, but since people wanted the &quot;what uses this&quot; link more handy... now it would not be a good idea.  Thank you for the sugestion though.  For now the answer is no from a UI standpoint.</div></div><hr />

Have a subscription service in order to get at pricing data of items. That way, if someone tries to ping-pwn the DB to find exploits, you'll know who it is, b/c they'll be signed in. (And you can swing the ban stick at them : P )<br />
<br />
I'd give you RL money to see prices of stuff ^_^. <br />
<br />
<br />
I know it's a bad idea b/c you/Denmother-sama have said you don't want to have some data available only to those who subscribe (or something close to that). Also, it sounds like a whooole lot of work/code/stuff. But maybe someone can take that and make it better. Or maybe it gets filed in the round cabinet.  : P <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The 'see what recipes this is used in' link is the best thing since sliced bread, btw. <br />
<br />
<br />
I kind of want a way to see what data you guys still don't have. What trivials are still unfound, what right click info is still not there, etc. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I had a frightening idea, about a 'submit per recipe/item' thing, rather than a forum to do it.... a user could go to the item's or recipe's page, and submit their update there, directly attached to the item/recipe, then a data entry clerk or someone a la Krazick can go through and see what has had a submission, and then do the update that way. To me, it seems then that posts wouldn't get lost. As far as being practical, that sounds like a nightmare to set up.  But that's why you have a big red NO stamp available. ^_^ <br />
<br />
<br />
Again, crazy as heck. But there they are. <br />
<br />
-- Sanna</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">another reason this is not likely to be implemented... is the fact that the prices of items simply have not been entered for the most part. <br />
<br />
Personally I see little value to track prices of items... but that is likely the fact that I am an old jaded monk with 15 K Plat in the bank, and don't care that Recipe X will make me 3 Gold per combine. <br />
<br />
What I find of value is to know that I can make Item Y, and sell it to another PC for 10 x the cost... and tracking those prices is not something we will ever likely do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Some sort of automatic price calculator would be invaluable for alchemy, because it is almost entirely vendor based.  Maybe even something along the lines of our current (and very outdated) pricing pages, but dymanically generated.  Almost all ingredients are bought off vendors, and for most people almost all successes in the skillup process are sold back to vendors.  For this reason I was extremely happy when Cubby provided updated vendor pricing for all the herbs.  Since then, when I started adding all the non-autolearn recipes to my recipe book in game, I sold one of each potion back to the vendor to get the vendor buy and sell prices.  All that's left is the prices on autolearn potions, of which there aren't all that many.  So the data is already there, at least, to make such a feature extremely useful to shamans.  But then, is that one use enough to make implementing the code worthwhile?  That's not my call. :)<br />
<br />
Edit: We don't have much pricing for 5 and 10 dose potions but if I correctly recall the statements made when the charged potions were given prices different from the single doses, they should simply be 5 and 10 times more than the singles, respectively.  That being the case, any discepancies should be reported as bugs.  Any pricing features we may add shouldn't be made with the charged potions in mind.</div></div><hr />

the reason we do not have much pricing now is missing data more than a desire to not have it.  Pricing data on recipes is already on my list of things to do.<br />

my ides for the recipe search MAY include a way to search on unknown trivials.  Not sure about doing the right click info, maybe make searching the notes part of advanced search.<br />

maybe.  It would be a low priority item.  One reason for the boards method is posible corroboration or disputing a change from the community that a more &quot;private&quot; method does not allow.</div></div><hr />

Thank you :)  <br />

Can you rephrase it here.  It did not make sense to me... AND I want to keep all of this type of thing in one area so I am not hopping all over the place to find what to do.  This MAY also fall under the subset idea Krazic proposed.</div></div><hr />

Some sort of automatic price calculator would be invaluable for alchemy, because it is almost entirely vendor based.  Maybe even something along the lines of our current (and very outdated) pricing pages, but dymanically generated.  Almost all ingredients are bought off vendors, and for most people almost all successes in the skillup process are sold back to vendors.  For this reason I was extremely happy when Cubby provided updated vendor pricing for all the herbs.  Since then, when I started adding all the non-autolearn recipes to my recipe book in game, I sold one of each potion back to the vendor to get the vendor buy and sell prices.  All that's left is the prices on autolearn potions, of which there aren't all that many.  So the data is already there, at least, to make such a feature extremely useful to shamans.  But then, is that one use enough to make implementing the code worthwhile?  That's not my call. :)<br />
<br />
Edit: We don't have much pricing for 5 and 10 dose potions but if I correctly recall the statements made when the charged potions were given prices different from the single doses, they should simply be 5 and 10 times more than the singles, respectively.  That being the case, any discepancies should be reported as bugs.  Any pricing features we may add shouldn't be made with the charged potions in mind.  <br />
<br />
I may be looking into some &quot;auto&quot; pricing method overall.</div></div><hr />

Sorry about the link :)  I did it that way so you could see what converation had already taken place with Krazick on the issue.<br />
<br />
To rephrase it ...  Introduced into the game about 6 months ago or so were a group of fletching recipes (some for bows, some for arrows, and some for subcombines used to make those bows/arrows) that are 'cultural'-restricted combines, but instead of being limited to a certain race, they can only be made by those who worship Karana (regardless of race).  <br />
<br />
When I click on Recipes at the main site, then Tailoring (for example), I see categorized groups of recipes including Cultural itemized by Race.  When I click on Recipes, then Fletching, the categories include Wood Elf Cultural.  However, there doesn't appear to be a way to get a quick comprehensive listing of the Karana 'Cultural' items.</div></div><hr />

Ok, as long as there is not overlap with current cultural something can probably be done about it since it is cultural and we already break clutural things out.    Or it may fit into the new &quot;set&quot; idea. (for armor sets)</div></div><hr />

Taking a look at the PoP Fletching Options, I see Seven (7) Bows... I see NO Arrows... or other Fletching Combines that are unique to PoP. And for so few, it was deemed not enough to be a seperate sub-category.<br />
<br />
Yes, it would be helpful to be able to filter by expansion for any tradeskill. But that specific request has been turned down. <br />
<br />
My count might be off... but it isn't off by much.<br />
<br />
And before you jump on the idea of &quot;GoD Pottery only has a couple of items! and it has it's own category&quot;... at the time GoD released we had no real idea of how many recipes for each one would be needed. To play it safe, we set up one for just about all.<br />
<br />
So YES... we could set up a seperate PoP Fletching category... I am just not sure it is worth it for &lt; 10 items.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>gnormy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Krazick (and others) have done unbelievably huge job of interpretting all of the submissions and entering them into the database.  My suggestion would be to create a semi-automated way for players to generate new submissions and similarly a way to semi-automate changes to existing items.<br />

As a rough outline, this would be the player filling out a web-form so the data of the item/recipe is more arranged.  This would be submitted to a review area, where someone like Krazick would look at it and make changes needed, and then finalize the item/recipe by moving it via script from the review area to the full database.<br />

Players could query against the &quot;review&quot; area to whats pending submission.   This may increase the load on the database but would also lower the load on the message board for those seeking to see &quot;whats new&quot;.<br />

In my mind this would be very extensive change since its an automation of a process that is currently executed manually.

When peoople have to register for yet another site, most won't do it. Those sites that have this ability are hardly well known.

Oh, Like Yantis/IGE?<br />
<br />
Currently the site only requires a registration if you post on the Forum. To use the actual Database and get at Items and Recipes... no registration is needed.<br />
<br />
If, and that is a BIG IF, EQ Traders tries to do something like this, it would require a seperate registration to access and modify the user information.<br />
<br />
Then we get into issues like:<br />
<br />
1 User -  8 Characters... or 16 Characters... or ## Characters. <br />
Adding New Characters<br />
Deleting Old Characters<br />
Keeping the User information secure<br />
Providing the ability to send out Passwords people have forgotten<br />
Tracking Skill Levels for each character<br />
Tracking Trophy/Geerlok <br />

Also... the forums and the database are 2 totally diferent servers, with totally diferent database servers... so I may not even be able to get them to talk to each other.<br />

Now it may be posible to ad such a feature to the boards server, and use the existing login... I am not sure I want to fool with code I am not familiar with, nor add more load to the boards server (not that it is under any jeapordy)<br />

There is also the abuse risks.  Someone claims they are X person on Y server with Z skill... just to grief X person with tells.  We have no way to prove that a person is who they say they are in the Game.</div></div><hr />

At the moment, there are too many and they look too much alike.  Right now, we have to actually identify the icons by color AND by details.

Since you can have multiple containers, you would probably have to set up a &quot;containers&quot; supergroup.  You'd also want one for ingredients, and you may wish to include fields for trivial, yield, and notes.

In fact just tonight i added a script that would let people Ban characters from a chat channel (well make it so he kicks them from the channel anytime they join it) since Sony didn't provide such a command for it and it was needed. :) I can pretty write up some code that saves any links it sees and will respond back with an item link when requested for one :).  My hope was to work with EQTraders to add useful tradeskill functions.  Such as &quot;How do i make &lt;item&gt;&quot;, &quot;What recipies is &lt;item&gt; used in&quot; and such :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If when you say &quot;Links&quot; you are refering to in-game links that clickable when you -link- an item in game to them via a tell/ooc/shout/guild/chat channel etc... that would require the EQ Item Id.<br />
<br />
In the database we do have a spot for that ID... but it is rarely filled in. It would require a fair bit of lookup and loading from some place like Lucy. The IDs we normally link within the site are our internally DB generated IDs which have no relation at all to the IDs used in-game.<br />
<br />
Now Maybe... if you can convince the folks who maintain Lucy to support a EQ Item ID lookup XML type function... you could take the item name we track carefully, toss it at Lucy, and get back in the in-game Item ID they track carefully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">Or...<br />
<br />
find a person (not Krazic) willing to take the task of looking up Item ID's in lucy (they are the same as EQ's ID since it uses a sniffer) and entering them into our DB (this person would get access to do so)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">&quot;Real&quot; item ids in EQ tend to be less than 32,000 - so yes, relatively short.<br />
<br />
&lt;foggy memory story&gt;<br />
If I remember correctly, at one point in history some ideas were actually rejected due to how many item ids all the needed items would require and concern about reaching the maximum cap on number of items imposed by the signed 2-byte number used to identify them, or at least that was the reason posted.  The item ids were converted to some less restrictive number format eventually, but most items (especially things that have been in the game for a long time) will still be sub-32768 numbers.<br />
<br />
I *think* this happened sometime in SoL-era and was caught up in that revamp-athon, but I'm not sure ... I just remember it was after Velious (when mob HP was converted from 2byte signed to (I believe) 4byte signed).<br />

<br />
Item ID: 0067674 :) MUCH shorter :)<br />
<br />
and with some help i could mine the IDs pretty easily.  The EQIM bot i have setup is set to log all links it sees to a CSV file.  I have it parsing out the Name, Link, and ID at the moment for another project i'm fiddling with :)<br />
<br />
So basicly.. being a glutton for punishment I think i would be willing to at least generate csv files with Item Names and Sony Item IDs.  And data entry if you don't want to write an import script :) (Although import script would definately be the way to go :) )</div></div><hr />

If the person mining for the exact ID numbers used Magelo Pro (as I do), it would go very quickly... you can search for, say, 'ornate' and get the first 10 pages of results... the link itself contains the EQID#. <br />
Rather than via Lucy, where you search for the item, click the item, then click Raw, then look for the #. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>NerissaGoldenrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">Two things I'd really like to see:<br />
<br />
First, I'd like to see an option to turn off optional sub-combines in the printer-friendly version of a recipe trees.  For example, if a recipe calls for a flask of water, I'm MUCH more likely to go spend the 1s at any of a number of merchants than hunt down the foraged pods of water, I don't need to see the recipe for a flask of water in the tree for the final item.  (And if several sub-combines also use water, I certainly don't want to see it every time.)  Similarly, the various bricks/blocks of clay &amp; ore can be made of other sizes, or can be found themselves  -- if the item is available (via merchant or drop) in its final form, I'd like to skip the optional ways to make it, and get straight to the heart of the recipe.  Perhaps some sort of indicator that there are ways to make the item if you can't/don't want to find it in its final form would be appropriate (such as a different style of bullet, maybe).<br />
<br />
My second suggestion may not be feasable, and will certainly be more difficult.  The pottery recipe list currently shows the unfired item as a sub-combine of the finished item.  From a logical/database perspective, that makes sense, but that means when I sort the list by trivial level, everything just gets thrown together because the firing trivial level is the same.  I'd much prefer to be able to sort it by the trivial level of the *unfired* part, since that's the part that's going to determine my chance of success and whether I may get a skill increase.   I would suggest being able to filter out the finished items, but I'd like to be able to see which type of firing sheet I need if I ever do want to actually fire an item.  Since this only really applies to one trade, I don't expect that it's something you're likely to do... but something to think about anyway.</div></div><hr />

I'd hazard to say that there are few enough of these recipes that they could be (somehow) manually marked. <br />
<br />
The print-off for the SolEar was /huge/... because it got into metal bits... which got into tarnished/rusty conversions... and /all/ the recipes for CEs... <br />
<br />
I know I know nothing of the coding, but perhaps there's a way to put a 'stopsign' on it... &quot;if not calling for this recipe directly, do not show any ways to make this item&quot; ie for clay and ore... or &quot;only show one way to make this item&quot; ie for metal bits, CEs... ie only show celestial solvent+ScentMarr, not ALL OF THEM. <br />
<br />
I don't think there would be a way to 'automatically' do it, it'd have to be hand-done and no I don't know how and i wish i did.... but it would probably be worth it, not to mention a bandwidth saver after a point. How many pages are called up that have to reference all the CE recipes or all the sub-ore recipes, or such. <br />
<br />
not easy, no. but almost definately worth it. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and now that fewer and fewer recipes have unknown trivials, ie that returning allllll the 250+s aren't really a problem... what about the ability to search for unknown trivials? (Are there even enough left to make this worth the coding?) If it were done by Unknown Baking, Unknown Brewing... Unknown Dwarven Cultural... it might not be too bad on the server. <br />
If it's needed at all.<br />

Actually. I have something for it.

It is a little less detailed... it just plain does NOT show chosen recipies in the complete list... it instead marks them as &quot;utility items&quot; (we also wanted to come up with a beter phrasing for it... but I have lost track of that thread too!!)<br />

The thought has some merit. However, the PhpBB Forums that EQ Traders use (where you are reading this post), is a seperate Database from the Primary EQ Traders Recipe Database. The Forums DB is not enough under our control to access a user list, and use it in the way you suggest. <br />
<br />
Nor does Ngreth/Niami wish to build a user list that is seperate from the forums and need to worry about managing it seperately.<br />
<br />
The idea has merit... but it is very unlikely to be implemented anytime soon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u132"><b>Kaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p132">Probably the single most useful improvement that could be made would be to enable users to quickly identify vendor-based recipes. Imagine how much easier life would be for players, if they could quickly identify recipes which did not require looting, foraging, or heading off to the bazaar.<br />
<br />
And I have a VERY simple way to provide this information, though of course you might come up with some superior alternative:<br />
<br />
Color coding.<br />
<br />
One would not even need a special option (though that'd be wonderful), but simply for the link to each item name to be colorized based upon whether it was vendor, foraged, dropped, or made. With one extra color for items which had more than one way to be obtained.<br />
<br />
But I'd be ecstatic simply to have a quick search that produced items whose recipes were simply vendor based. There are few things, as a casual tradeskiller, that I value more than finding a recipe I can put together without having to pay some lunatic 15pp (300pp per stack) for vegetables, or log in my ranger and stand around jabbing the forage macro I wrote, or go fishing, or kill green mob X in zone Y for six hours waiting for a drop or stack, et cetera.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u133"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p133">Well, color coding to distinguish categories of information might on the surface sound like a wonderful idea. However, it is a bad idea from a web perspective to encode useful information.  There might be better ways where it might be italicized, underlined, bolded, or stared (asterick  ) if vendor sold.<br />
<br />
However to actually encode that as part of the Query I doubt is something Ngreth is ready to do. It would require quite a few more queries to get one single recipe out.<br />
<br />
Then there is the issue of those recipes that have a &quot;tool&quot; that is returned (regardless of success) that would add further trouble. Not to mention the Recipe Tree where you have lower level combines that &quot;could&quot; be purchased entirely, but it would have to bubble-up the tree the fact that item X3 is made from vendor bought items only, and is used to make item X2... add nauseum.<br />
<br />
Yes, on the surface is sounds &quot;nifty&quot;... and to be able to avoid the middle-men/women with their exhoribitant markup fees (15pp per vegetable) would save many of us plat. But think about it, the only reason they charge so much for them, is because people with too much plat buy them for that much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u134"><b>Kaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p134">Hmmm...speaking as a senior web developer, there's nothing wrong with color coding, from a web perspective. In fact, it's a highly useful interface tool. It's also not nearly so difficult as you imply; it sounds like you're envisioning something much more complex than is necessary.<br />
<br />
When a recipe is listed, the name and id of each component in the recipe is listed, as is each sub-recipe in those cute little javascript trees. Surely this means that there is a query of the record for each ingredient, and returning the field(s) that would tell us the source(s) is not that difficult.<br />
<br />
Unless it would require bringing in whole new tables, this would require almost no new code at all.<br />
<br />
And if it did require including an additional table, that's only a few moments to mentally structure, or not even that if one uses (shudder) a graphical tool to create queries. Unless there's a concern for processor load...the addition of another query in an already multi-table query would increase the load, but only a little, assuming a normal sort of table optimization.<br />
<br />
I'd even be willing to help with the coding, if necessary...I've been doing professional web development since 1995, database work since 1991, so it'd be little problem and worth the added information benefit, to me.<br />
<br />
As for the pricing, I'm as much an advocate of the free market as you can get...but one thing that makes markets work best is information. As it is, there is no relatively easy way for people to avoid using ingredients which can only (easily and in bulk) be obtained via bazaar. The advent of access to information on alternatives will actually (if we assume enough people use your site, and will tell their friends) drive the price down a bit, as the mass production of alluminum broke the international tin cartel in the seventies, high tin prices simply driving manufacturers to alternative 'recipes'.<br />
<br />
Essentially, the prices are so high because ubers, who're going to pay 150k for a single Ornate pattern already, don't care WHAT they pay for ingredients...and so they should't. 29pp for silk is no problem for them, a thousand silk to raise their skill still doesn't dent their overall expenses. <br />
<br />
But that doesn't mean that the rest of us shouldn't use whatever alternative means of working on tradeskills we can learn.</div></div><hr />

You would probably write it in WML, which is a sort of subset of HTML with some modification. And, of course, WMLScript, which is a javascript spinoff in the same way. There's also XHTML, but I think WML is considerably more widespread. <br />
<br />
I'm not at the machine where I do wireless development, so I don't have quick access to the references I've bookmarked, but here are a couple I googled up that might help:<br />

BTW: I'd like to second the idea of an obvious link to a spreadsheet (or better still, database) of tradeskill info for people to download if they want to construct their own queries. Heck, that way I can just write a vendor-based recipes query all on my own, and not bug you about it.</div></div><hr />

Yes... you can encode content based on color... but to prevent color impaired readers from struggling to preceive the content... much less black and white printouts... it becomes a major pain.

<br />
I will go so far as to state that there are a number of places where color is used to highlight some features of the site (the side menu-bars and their sub-menus... the &quot;red (Trivial 335)&quot; bits... but generally the use of color on the site is more to supplement and artistically enhance the provided information, rather than add meaningful content.<br />

Given the fact that many people would like to be able to print out the information. And they very likely will print out on a black and white printer... it should be useable/precievable from that type of printout.</div></div><hr />

<br />
See, that's just a scary degree of political correctness there, way too nineties for me. Of course W3C is a bureaucracy, thus they're insanely PC, but that doesn't mean we all have to follow suit.<br />
<br />
This is what I explain to any client who's worried about only basing the site on what people with text reading non-javascript monochrome browsers can handle perfectly:<br />
<br />
In your effort to make sure you include the final 0.01%, you are excluding the other 99.9% who would benefit from the improved interface. You actually cause more net harm than good, alienating more users than you benefit.<br />
<br />
The percentage of people coming to this site who're color blind is undoubtedly microscopic, or smaller. The percentage who use monochrome printers is probably pretty ****ed small, too, since you can buy a color printer for about $89 without too much shopping around.<br />
<br />
But all of that is really irrelevent to this debate, anyway, because here is the huge, gaping problem with what you're saying:<br />
<br />
If color coding of ingredient sources were implemented, color blind and antique printer people WOULD LOSE NOTHING.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Because right now you have NO system for quickly identifying source. Adding a system based on color coding, which would be simpler than ANY other solution (such as adding a graphic showing the source by every item, or trying to find enough variations of bold/italic/strikethrough/upside-down) would therefore deprive nobody of anything, meanwhile it would provide a vital feature to the 99.9% who are not completely colorblind, including people who have ancient printers but can at least see the data on their monitor.<br />
<br />
&gt; I will go so far as to state that there are a number of places where color is<br />
&gt; used to highlight some features of the site (the side menu-bars and their<br />
&gt; sub-menus... the &quot;red (Trivial 335)&quot; bits... but generally the use of color on<br />
&gt; the site is more to supplement and artistically enhance the provided<br />
&gt; information, rather than add meaningful content.<br />
<br />
This, of course reduces the developer's ability to produce an interface that is heuristic/intuitive and easy to navigate for the 99.9%. <br />
<br />
It reminds me of silly people who say we should have universal health care, and cite examples of countries where the health care is indeed universal...and where a painful, life-threatening illness therefore can have an 18 month waiting period for treatment. <br />
<br />
&gt; Given the fact that many people would like to be able to print out the<br />
&gt; information. And they very likely will print out on a black and white<br />
&gt; printer... it should be useable/precievable from that type of printout.[<br />
<br />
Doesn't the site already have links to printer-friendly versions of pages, like so many other sites do? That would make more sense than limiting the interface utility for the overwhelming majority of people who have at least partial color vision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u138"><b>Kaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p138">This is not a request for something to be allowed to the general public, but an extension of an idea I had a while back.<br />
<br />
I don't know what your tables look like but it seems to me that with the aid of some serious pharmaceuticals you could hallucinate a REALLY nasty query to automatically find &quot;profitable&quot; combines and forward the info off to whoever is the tradeskill contact of the week for Sony.<br />
<br />
I probably don't have strong enough mushrooms though.<br />
<br />
Why would anyone want to TELL Sony about a profitable tradeskill combine? Don't they do enough such anti-creativity nerfing already? Heaven forfend you feign death during a solo fight and then the mob dies, or find a bow that can be sold back to the vendor for a couple platinum profit, et cetera...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u139"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p139">Why would anyone want to TELL Sony about a profitable tradeskill combine?One answer would be for the sake of the economy.  Profitable, vendor-based combines have proven easily macroable, thus leading to huge platinum influxes.  It drives up bazaar prices and increases the divide between the haves and have-nots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u140"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p140">OK, yes I *Could* do it.<br />
<br />
And yes it WOULD take a reference to 2 other tables (not just one).<br />
I unfortunatley coded for MySQL 3 which is NOT relational, so I had to create map tables, and this would require a map table to hit the correct spot in the second table.  (You say why... because the server originally only had MySql 3... not 4.  The server had 4 right when I released... darnit... and the recoding it would take to make it relational would be huge)<br />
<br />
Second issue, is as krazic said, when an item has more than one type of source.  Which do I choose.  **YOU** say choose the vendor source, but druid, ranger, wood elf, and iksar (and probably others) say... choose the foraged source.  While yet even others will say I am only interested in drops...  which do I mark it for?  Again... I refuse to have cookies keep track of which you prefer.  Whe could use extra &quot;markers&quot; ($ for vendor, * for foraged, ^ for dropped, etc) but see my third issue bellow.<br />
<br />
Third issue is information overload.  There is already a HUGE amount of information on that page.  Sure *YOU* can take more information,  to MANY others (more than the &quot;1%&quot; with color blindness problems) it becomes very confusing, especially if we use marker characters.  If we use colors it is not as bad, but you have the problem of my second issue, unless we use a huge color pallet, in which case we are back to information overload.<br />
<br />
I will consider it some more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u141"><b>bugfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p141">One thing Id like is a pdf or something of all the recipies, which you can generate with PHP btw.. so you could automate it.

<br />
I get asked for this regularly in various formats :)  The answer will continue to be the same.<br />
<br />
The other problem is bandwidth.  People will NOT hit this just once... and the download will be HUGE.... people use MUCH less bandwith searching for what specifically they are looking for :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u145"><b>bugfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p145">Na you dont sound snippy, you're an ogre :)<br />
<br />
Like everything theres pros and cons, and it sounds like you've weighed it up.<br />
<br />
Only other suggestion is maybe on top of the tree of the recipie would be to add where to buy options, so<br />
<br />
    * grapes(3) <br />
    * wine yeast<br />
    * soda water<br />
    * champagne magnum<br />
<br />
Each of those is clickable with where to buy if possible, currently you expand if made, maybe expand where to buy any of the components, or forage or drops so people can say <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I fancy making..... brut champagne, I need to... get me a chanter for the gold, buy the gold, get a bottle, get the soda, grapes, hey I can do all this in PoK bargin.. /ooc Hey would a chanter mind doing me some gold enchanting?? <br />
<br />
and make the item<br />
<br />
would be a fair bit of work though I suppose :(<br />
<br />
Reading back someone suggested putting say a * after vendor bought etc.. actually adding that to the query wouldnt be so hard.. each itme would just need a flag on it saying v,d,f, (vendor, drop, forage, crafted) you just pick that up as well as the name of the item from the table</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">*afeared*<br />
<br />
&quot;maybe expand where to buy any of the components, or forage or drops&quot;<br />
<br />
The thing about including all of that information in that click-drop-down list... ALL of that information is loaded when the page loads. That's why Ngreth Sir put in the &quot;subcombines not shown&quot; tag, or whatever the wording ended up being. It's a stop-point for the server to say, &quot;ok, not loading anymore info below this point.&quot; When you load that info, per page load, it takes BW. When you /don't/ load that info, it /saves/ BW. <br />
<br />
Inserting all, or even some, of the info you suggested, would skyrocket BW usage. Plus it just sounds /scary/ to code. <br />
<br />
Yes, I'm just another prole saying this, but still.... *shudderwince*. Clicking a link to find further info hurts far less than always including info which would be useful to /some/ people /some/ of the time, but not /everyone always/. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I still raise my hand and vote for &quot;ability to search for unknown info.&quot; I realize I'm (re)saying this on the day OoW comes out, so this place is gonna be a madhouse for a while, so please don't think I'm trying to put temporal pressure on this or anything.... but if the whole Tyking-thing about adding EQIDs to the pages, and making a hidden backsystem to allow Tyking to put recipes in-game is still something that ever wants to be thought about.... then the ability [for some people?] to search for what's missing data in a given slot would be very helpful. <br />
<br />
once again, i wish i knew how to code stuff... would make me feel less like I might be asking for something really hard and just don't know. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
good luck, everyone, with fielding OoW info. ^_^<br />

<br />
and some things... like &quot;water flask&quot; the extra info would be gargantuan... (I could add more exceptions... but there is an aditional layer of code and/or queries on an already very busy page.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u148"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p148">Not sure if this has been suggested (long thread...)<br />
<br />
It would be helpful if when you searched the database if trivials could be shown next to the items, similar to the recipe lists - and if possible to be able to sort them. <br />
<br />
For example: say I have a bunch of serrated arrowheads and I want to know how far I can skill up with them. First instinct is to search - this gives me all the arrows I can make but, doh! it doesn't show the trivials until you click them one by one. So I realise what I should have done was go to the GoD fletching section - this gives me a list I can sort by trivial - but it includes a bunch of arrows made with discord arrowheads, which, for the sake of argument, I'm not interested in because I can't obtain, not being KT flagged. Quick trivial list works, but has a load of entries no longer useful to the, say, 220ish fletcher.<br />
<br />
*Pauses for punctuation. None materialises. /Sigh... oh well*<br />
<br />
Anyway, I hope you get the idea. It's nice to have a small, practical list to work with, so I prefer to search, but it'd be great to have maybe just a teensy shiny knob and/or whistle added to the search if possible!<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the work on the site, and I understand if you don't get to look into this one for a while!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u149"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p149">Well... the problem being that that search only hits the items table (not hte recipie table.) and it would take twice as many hits to get the trivial...  I will think on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u150"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p150">Going to Serrated Arrowhead and then &quot;Find Recipes that use this item&quot;, it does generate a list of recipes with trivials present, though its not sortable by trivial.<br />
<br />
Other than the sorting aspect, is that what you'd be looking for?<br />
<br />
I know I've sometimes been looking for a &quot;class&quot; of item (say, GoD 34/28 weapons) and there isn't much of a way to do that (&quot;Velium Gemmed&quot; includes others, GoD Weapons includes others, etc) but it seems like searching for a class would be difficult to implement.  That might be what you were getting at, rather than the &quot;Find Recipes&quot; aspect.  If so, I have no idea for a workaround.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u151"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p151">How about adding a new forum for augments.  Otherwise, each of the various boards will get augment posts on them (or all the augment posts will be put on the general forum.)  I do see the overlap though, since it's not really a tradeskill in itself, but uses other tradeskils to make.  I'm thinking that having one place to consolidate them would be a good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u152"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p152">Since this would probably involve changing the data type I'm not optimistic about this actually happening, but could the stackability of an item differentiate between &quot;not stackable&quot; and &quot;No stackability information yet&quot;?
