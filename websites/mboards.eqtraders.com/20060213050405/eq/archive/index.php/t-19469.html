<br />
Now I'm headed to the XP grind to get my AA points for TM and 1750.<br />
<br />
I've also been leveling Ladano's (alt) fletching. If anyone comes across any Acrylia, Chunk of Condensed (Ice/Shadow/Flame), their processed states (Arrowheads and Acrylia Arrow Shafts), or anything else for post 227 (wood elf or normal) fletching they'd like to sell, let me know here or in game.</div></div><hr />

I also have a bunch of Acrylia Arrow Shafts &amp; Condensed Substances tucked away in the bank.<br />

Just have to catch me peeking in at my Trader sometime.  :D</div></div><hr />

I will look for you as I'm checking my trader. I work 3rd shift now, so I'm usually checking weekdays during the hours of 12 noon to 4 pm eastern. I am also on extended hours on weekends, usually 10 pm to 5 am eastern.<br />
<br />
Also wanted to ask you who made your Ice Cream Churn for you. I have the hide and 3 boot gaskets and wanted to see about having one attempted for me.</div></div><hr />
