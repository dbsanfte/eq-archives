<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was so excited when LoY came out.  I have been hearing about Frogloks as a rumor since Velious was released.  Imagine my surprise when I created my new shaman and found what could only be the greatest blessing a tradeskiller could find. A CULTURAL FORGE!!!<br />
<br />
Fast forward a year.  After getting my blacksmithing to 188 the day of LoY release, I have yet to be able to use the wonderful forge that I prayed under February of 2003.  I naively talked to every NPC in Gukta, did EVERY quest (even the weak Paladin shield one, and I am a shaman.) I discovered and posted on allakhazam the shaman shield, the troll invasion.  Doing all this with the hope that some NPC would talk to me and say &quot;Good work little tadpole, here is how we make our mediocre, but frog only armor.&quot; After 65 levels and many AA I still go back hoping for more (despite being told by the dev's that 'it is in the works.' :steamed:)  <br />
<br />
All races and classes that have been subject to cultural subversion and oppression rise up and rant!  Gnomes, you have a forge, complain. Half Elves, join the outrage!! Even trolls get cultural armor!!<br />
<br />
Vah Shir are not welcome to complain here, you godless heathens! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cerpicio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Forge?  Forge?!  We don't need to steenking forge, we have our toolboxes!<br />
<br />
Yes, us gnomes have a cultural forge, but we don't have any use for it.  But I like our tinkered cultural armor just fine as it is.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Annalina Romanov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Um, half-elves aren't supposed to get a cultural forge anyway . . . <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Frogloks should get cultural smithing, but should not get cultural armor. They already have a very wide array of armor that they can wear.<br />
<br />
It would make more sense to make Frogloks the good version of Trolls, as far as Blacksmithing goes - improving pre-existing weapons and shields, in other words.<br />
<br />
This would make sense, as maybe some Frogloks enslaved by the Trolls had watched Troll smiths at work, and after take over of Grobb managed to somehow apply what they had learned in the name of Marr, and taught other Frogloks how to do the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Absor posted, about 2 or three months after LoY went live, that frogloks do indeed have their own cultural.<br />
<br />
Then he expressed surprised that nobody had made any yet.<br />
<br />
Then he went away and checks and came back and said &quot;Oops, it's ready but not patched in yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
And that was the least we heard...about 9-10 months ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Malathos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Has anyone actually tried to make any froglok cultural ?<br />
<br />
I know that the dwarven cultural is FRG wearable (the non-imbued stuff). The imbued stuff is dedicated to Brell, so they can't wear that... but maybe if you tried to make dwarven cultural with the gem for the appropriate god for the frogs (can't remember of the top of my head) - possibly a combine in the frog forge ???<br />
<br />
Just a random shot in the dark ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Froglok cultural is luminant heraldic. Too bad they need a human smith to make it for them :D</div></div><hr />

Very funny.  (grumble, grumble, looks at her Mischievous Plate armor that only dwarves can make).<br />

At least Frogs can wear BD Cultural plate.<br />
<br />
Vah Shir don't even have that option.<br />
<br />
Even on the diety-required PvP server where Vah Shir worship Tunare... they can't wear Blessed Full Mithril.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I fully agree with Zyrtryx Conjureblade on the idea of not giving us Frogloks cultural armor. I just want to use the forge, I don't care if it is profitable.  I made a troll, ogre and dwarven smith just so I could make stuff that scarcely sold (with the exception of dwarven.)  <br />
<br />
In reference to the Half Elves being not intended to have cultural, I realize this, but that doesn't mean there shouldn't be an outcry =)<br />
<br />
Vah shir - see above.<br />
<br />
Gnomes - demand a use for your forge, if nothing else than for making bits of steamfont water tempered velium bits that have no use! Demand that SoE stop leaving things in game that have no use, I just want everything to have a use, or have it stop taking up space.<br />
<br />
Absor! Get it fixed! I practically cried when you crushed my hopes and dreams and being 'surprised that I had not yet made any cultural.' You then came back and told me that all my hardwork didn't have an end, and that MAYBE it would be fixed later, here we are two expansions down the road....please, just give me something useless to use the forge for, I just want a combine!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Us gnomes need a way to make blue diamonds in that forge.<br />
<br />
A lump of coal, or at least a raw diamond.  Maybe a temper.<br />
<br />
But it should still use the tinkering skill, even if it is in a forge.  It's the gnome cultural forge, after all.  (And I'm already a GM tinker, but only ~180 in smithing).<br />
<br />
<br />
Just sayin'<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">LOL, making blue diamonds would be sweet.  Perhaps not through tinkering, but alchemy (the closest skill to chemistry in the game.) Maybe a raw diamond, permafrost extract.  It would need to be something fairly expensive so that the blue diamonds tradeskills created wouldn't be overly cheap from the non-tradeskilled ones, but this would be insanely fun (and a way to actually MAKE money with alchemy)<br />
<br />
However, this is about Frogloks! =P<br />
<br />
(Yes, I know I asked all oppressed classes to post about uses for their stuff)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hmm <br />
<br />
/geek alert<br />
<br />
Alchemy would be the precursor to chemistry, but both baking and brewing are also chemical processes.  Brewing would actually be most closely related to chemical engineering.<br />
<br />
Now to make diamonds or other gems that is the realm of material science - smithing is for metallic materials and well pottery is the closest thing for working with inorganic non-metallic crystalline materials and non-crystalline glasses.  So pottery should get to make blue diamonds.  <br />
<br />
Now until recently you would need to use a kiln that could generate huge pressures to cause the phase transformation from carbon sources like graphite or even charcoal like in the comic books.  But now with a little bit of plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition you can grow your own in an evacuated kiln with an RF generator.  Wooooo.<br />
<br />
Tinkering is much more like mechanical engineering.<br />
<br />
Poison-making would be organic chemistry.<br />
<br />
Jewelcraft would be the artistic end of metallurgy for the most part although the edges would be a bit blurry.<br />
<br />
Fletching and Tailoring are industries that would use attributes of the other skills with some specialized knowledge tossed in.<br />
<br />
Sorry could resist....</div></div><hr />

Please do not do that again. If you haven't got something to add to a conversation bumping it with a senseless post only serves to waste moderator time and bandwidth. <br />
