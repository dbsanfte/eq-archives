<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>morromid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">for those that don't know it, there is an autoinventory command that puts what's in your hand in your inventory. <br />
<br />
you can now make a macro that is tied to your turn key (left or right arrow) and forage and put it away automatically.<br />
<br />
/pause 50, /doability 3<br />
/autoinventory<br />
<br />
I always put pauses in, they might not be necessary. Some of the commands take a litle time to do. Remember the pause takes place after the command.<br />
<br />
Its good for fishing too. Cast twice and put the loot away each time.  Not good if skill is low and you catch lots of junk. You can make the autoinventory a separate macro if you want to choose when to put items away.<br />
<br />
/pause 50, /doability 2<br />
/pause 50, /autoinventory<br />
/pause 50, /doability 2<br />
/pause 50, /autoinventory<br />
/say Time to press the fish key again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good post for people who have not been here before, or don't know about it.  But, this has been in game for quite some time now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Furyrpied</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This works really well for foragers, just be warned tho, if you are wanting to make a trade with someone (or give plat for buffs etc..) don't hit the key associated with the /autoinventory command.<br />
<br />
I have my 'forage macro' tied to my &lt;- and -&gt; keys (so i forage every time i turn) but find it a little frustrating when i am trying to give something to someone when i have to turn to face them hehe...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>crystilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It may have been in the game a while but not everyone knows about it.  :) <br />
<br />
Been playing over 2.5 years on the same character, worked all tradeskills up to 220+, got bind wound and all languages maxxed cause I was bored (cleric here), and just learned about the /autoi command last week.<br />
<br />
Used it when I was fishing for 3 hours in CS to get the cobalt cod for tailoring increases from the wyvern hides.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Due to lag isues, ive found it better to put /autoinventory as the FIRST line of the macro, then do the forage/fish/whatever and then the pause.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Otoole</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I need to ask a dumb question here...<br />
<br />
How does one know what the doability number is for a particular action?<br />
<br />
/doability 2 = fishing<br />
<br />
/doability 3 = forage<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Always? Or just because of where they are in your &quot;abilities&quot; lineup?<br />
<br />
Thanks. :)</div></div><hr />

It's per character, unlike alt activate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The six button ability box.<br />
<br />
I believe it's numbered like this:<br />
<br />
  1  2<br />
  3  4<br />
  5  6</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Otoole</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok, got that solved. <br />
<br />
Onto another question for you autoforage/autoinventory-ing types. You know how the &quot;Forage&quot; key remained depressed until it was available for use again? Is there a command to keep the new social key depressed in the same fashion? It's not a big deal if one has the key automapped for right or left turn, but I was just curious. I'm like that. It's kind of annoying at times. lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Greymantle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No unfortunatly there is no way to keep the hot key that you make greyed out. Has something t odo with the coding of the ability keys, thye have there own built in preset delays.<br />
<br />
<br />
.:(</div></div><hr />

If the Fishing button is still depressed, I know the macro hasn't finished yet.</div></div><hr />
