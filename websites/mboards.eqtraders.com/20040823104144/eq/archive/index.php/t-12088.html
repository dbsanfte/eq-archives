Just as a quick note - you have been doing a wonderful job, trust me, I know (I too am a racknine client, on the same server - had my entire site working again today and now my db has vanished, not sure why) - I'm sure those of us whom love this site as much as I do support you in this rather sticky situation.<br />
<br />
Although I know I can be a pain in the butt, this is my favorite eq site, and the one I recommend to any that have an interest in tradeskills.  So, raise your bottle Faydwer Shaker, and look forward to a more stable racknine future!</div></div><hr />
