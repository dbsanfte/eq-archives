<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Llientylln</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">60 EVB combines with no skillups (58 of which were successes)...  :irked: <br />
<br />
so I figure maybe the RNG is really working against me... log off and right back on... next combine = skillup 205</div></div><hr />

Hmmm, yep , ther it is....<br />
<br />
RNG is like a female dog.  You can love it, and pet it, and hug it... but when it comes down to it...  she's a  {meanie} !<br />
<br />
Try 147 combines to get 193.  And i am sure there are people who have done worse.  At leaset EVB are easy to farm.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Annalina Romanov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's something that I keep saying over and over again . . . don't focus so much on just skilling up. Run an appropriate quest at the same time, or be making things for someone, anything to take your mind off of skilling up. I've run the Shadowscream Boot quest many times now, and I've found that when your mind isn't watching for that &quot;you've improved in the skill!&quot; message, those skill ups come pretty quickly. I know I've gotten at least two to three skill ups on Heraldic Armor, and most of the time I was doing that, my friend (for whom I was making the armor for) and I were more concerned about succeeding on the armor, not on the skill up. Lo and behold, a successful item  . . . and a skill up!<br />

I didint think it was that much of a bad word, but in future i will not use it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of my skill ups since 195, about half of them have come making armour for people, or that random run of nightmare plate/chain I did when I found 30 mephit bloods on a vendor (that reminds me, I need to get another emblem).</div></div><hr />

NP.  Just keep in mind that  if the only way you can get it by the word filter<br />
is to  p u t   s p a c e s   b e t w e e n  t h e  l e t t e r s, then you shouldn’t use it in the first place :D</div></div><hr />

It get you past the moderators and people look at you funny.<br />
<br />
Its a lot better then being normal and boring.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Healblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah, in my experience, anyway, &quot;Poopie-head&quot; is more effective than those words which are likely filtered here... but you have to really be convincing with tone and body language for it to work.<br />

Maybe they're just scared of me when I do that... /shrug... I'm an EQ Tradeskiller, I can be insane whenever I want to.</div></div><hr />
