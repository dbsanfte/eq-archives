<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ashreal Jaeger</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all!  I have been spending the usual huge ammount of time in tailoring.  I have been keeping pretty good notes along the way.  Now mind you I am a human mage, so while farming greens for me is a joke.  Most of the spiffy racial armor/vials chanters can make, and foraging I had to either buy, or con friends into helping me with.    Assume any combine with under 10 combines in it I used my tailoring modifier.  Otherwise I just went at it bearbones. 250-265 int every combine.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbuegel</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 02:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, your success rate went to 1 skillup in 17.6 attempts post-patch (oct 16).   429 attempts and 25 skill ups.  Thats WAY better than 65+  (which is really higher, probably 75ish, since the last 25 brought the average down).</div></div><hr />

I probaly wouldn't of bothered with it anymore without it.  Skill drove me nuts to say the least.  Its cute now to get hordes of tells  every day.  Can you comb.. can you com... can you....  ahhhhh!

I think that I will stick to other routs.<br />
<br />
 &lt;i&gt;Staying with only using 1 pelt or swatch will all of these &lt;/i&gt;<br />
greyhopper armor &lt;i&gt;masks&lt;/i&gt;( Can raise you from 50's all the way to 88 )<br />
crystalline silk armor &lt;i&gt;masks&lt;/i&gt;( Can raise you from 88 all the way to 108 )<br />
Wu's fighting armor &lt;i&gt;masks&lt;/i&gt;( Can raise you from 108 all the way to 158. This is the only one that I would suggest going for the Sleeves ( 2 Swatches ), and Tunics at ( 3 Swatches ) because there is really not a easier route to take )<br />
acrylia studded armor &lt;i&gt;masks&lt;/i&gt;( Can raise you from 158 all the way to 188 )<br />
shaded hide armor ( Can raise you from 188 all the way to 221 )<br />
acrylia reinforced armor ( Can raise you from 221 all the way to 242 )<br />
<br />
Then I would say your choice of Velious combines seeing as how most are all &gt;250 on the trivials.<br />
<br />
The reason that I suggest this way is because it is a path more geared to the high end player that is a tailor. You are getting EXP and getting supplies at the same time on most of the items that you are camping. Taking a few friends along is the best idea to do for these so that you dont die in some of the zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mardark</div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">shaded hide armor ( Can raise you from 188 all the way to 221 ) <br />
<br />
Ummm, and you plan to spend how many years going from 188 to 221?<br />
<br />
Sticking to the 1 swatch method, really will slow you down and increase your overall costs.  Most methods of skilling up are a balance of cost and time to get materials.  I cant imagine ever using shaded hide armor as a skillup path.  I have hunted the mobs that drop the patterns, they are not common at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moraganth</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 05:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree<br />
<br />
There is no way to consider shaded hide a possible route.  In the 4 levels i've been hunting ME, and Ahkeva, i've seen... oh.. 7 or 8 shaded pieces drop, and 0 (zero) mind worm hides drop.<br />
<br />
My list for skillups was around here someplace.. and it;s occasionally pocked with mulit-component pieces, but those are almost alway for people who waht this, that, or the other thing.<br />
<br />
My general rule of thumb has been wyvern mask from 158.. they're easiest to gather for, and i can do it all if i have too (thankfully i haven't).  Any acrylia attempts in there are bonuses.... the 2 shaded attempts were really bonuses.<br />
<br />
For tailoring it's really a use whatever you scrounge up type mentality.</div></div><hr />
