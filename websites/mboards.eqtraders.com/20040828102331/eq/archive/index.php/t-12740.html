<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rohirrim Amanomori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
<br />
i am starting to collect chunk of condensed... for 202+ fletching - tried twilight sea yesterday and droprate was kinda annoying - 19 pieces in about an hour.<br />
<br />
What is your expierence in droprates in different zones ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">run around shadeweaver's with alts collecting hopper hides, shaeling silks, and chunks of condensed myself.  would ae it if i really cared but leveling an alt there for them is np either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go down into the tunnels of Shadeweavers Thicket. Clear out all the Gor Taku in a cavern and Shak Dratha will spawn in thier place. Shak Dratha drop chunks of condensed shadow regularly - sometimes as much as 3 chunks on a single mob. Stay up in the top three caverns as the higher level mobs lower down the tunnel system don't drop the chunks as frequently - and are much harder.<br />
<br />
Only Shak Dratha drop the chunks so you have to clear out any Gor Taku you see to spawn the Shak Dratha. The good thing is that Gor Taku run around with a fair amount of spare change in their pockets - sometimes close to 2pp. The Shak Dratha are a big stingy on the cash but also drop Shade Silk regularly which is also worth collecting and the Shak Dratha Senthians drop paper spell components fairly often too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>lonewylfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One thing to note if you are farming the Dratha type. There are two types in the tunnels in SWT. There are light colored ones and the dark grey colored ones. The shadows only drop off dark colored ones. And they only spawn during the night (my observation was about 6-7PM to 6-7AM game time). During the day, light colored ones spawn. <br />
<br />
If you are lucky and someone killed these during the night, the new spawns are still dark colored ones and you can farm until light. Sometimes there are mixed in a room because someone only killed a few. There are 3 rooms kind of close to each other and using AoE method, I can clear a room in one shot. Doing this, I was able to clear the 3 rooms twice before the light colored ones spawned. <br />
<br />
What is frustrating is that you can't tell the game time on the moon so I had to keep asking via /gu what time it was so I knew when to start the cycle all over again. Each clear of 3 rooms would yield me about 1-2 stacks of shadows, which was enough for 20-40 combines. <br />
<br />
Good luck. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>FentFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I found this guide to be most helpful!  I've got 2 accounts, with my second being a level 62 Magician (no alts on FV server, so gotta have 2 accounts ;)).  With epic pet, my Magician was able to blast all 3 west-most caves in Shadeweaver's Thicket, killing Gor Taku in the daytime and Shak Dratha during the nights.  <br />
<br />
It seemed that if you wipe out everything, you'll eventually get *all* Shak Dratha in the caves.  In addition to the Condensed Shadow, these guys also dropped a ton of Shade Silk, which can be combined and sold to players as well.<br />
<br />
All in all, after about 5 hours of pharming, I had 6 stacks of Condensed Shadow which I turned into Arrowheads with the usual trivial amount of failures.  The next step, then is Acrylia Caverns to pharm up some bricks and such.  I don't really feel like paying for items in the Bazaar that I can get for myself easily.<br />
<br />
Of course, once I've GMed fletching (at 204 skill now), I may just return to Shadeweavers and harvest the Condensed Shadow for money.  The pieces I collected today would've amounted to over 2K if I'd have sold them in the Bazaar.</div></div><hr />
