<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Stats, and how they impact tradeskills, have been the subject of much debate, pet theories and urban legend. Over the years we've received several conflicting/changing reports on the effect of stats when tradeskilling. Here is the most recent information we have.<br />
 <br />
The basics<br />
INT &amp; WIS whichever of the two is higher will affect skill increases when practicing any tradeskill. The higher either your INT or WIS is, the greater the chance you have for a skill gain while tradeskilling.<br />
 <br />
CHA higher charisma, along with faction, will affect your buying and selling prices with merchants.<br />
 <br />
Exceptions to the above<br />
Smithing skill increases for smithing are determined by INT, WIS or STR, whichever is higher.<br />
 <br />
Fletching skill increases for fletching are determined by INT, WIS or DEX, whichever is higher.<br />
 <br />
Poison Making skill increases for Poison Making are determined by INT, WIS or DEX, whichever is higher.<br />
 <br />
While tailoring has been mentioned several times as needing DEX, at last check it was still not implemented.<br />
 <br />
A specific quote from Tanker, SOE Dev<br />
Here's the list guys:<br />
Smithing - STR<br />
Fletching - DEX<br />
PoisonMaking - DEX<br />
END OF LIST &lt;&lt;-- note, there are NO more tradeskills that have alternate attributes. <br />
Stats have no impact on your chance of success or failure on the combine when practicing tradeskills. (Only your current skill is supposed to impact your chances of success or failure when creating an item.) What the stat will affect is your chance to get a skill up on a failure. The paraphrased quote is &quot;You have up to 100% greater chance of a skill up on a successful combine than you have on a failed combine. Your stat will 'mitigate' the difference between a failed combine skill up and a successful combine skill up.&quot; What this means to us is that it increases your chance of a skill up on a failed combine (not a successful combine) Since we fail fairly often on combines, it will increase the overall chance of skill ups over many combines.  You can see a calulator at http://www.eqtraders.com/calculators/main.php<br />
 <br />
Yes, this is subject to change/debate, but until otherwise corrected by SOE itself, this is the latest official word we have on the subject. (as of April 14th 2004)</div></div><hr />

In the never-ending discussion about what stats do for you, especially in relation to tradeskills, many myths and legends have grown up about stats and their effects.  The following information, directly from the EQ Character Creation Screens, is the correct and latest word from Sony Online Entertainment about stats and their game effects.  Formatting and emphasis have been added by me, for clarity's sake. <br />

Strength is one factor in determining how much damage you do with weapons and special attacks.  It directly affects the amount of weight you can carry before suffering penalties.  It also increases your chance to gain Offense and Bash skill points.<br />
Tradeskills:  If your strength is higher than your intelligence or wisdom, it determines how quickly you gain skill in Blacksmithing.<br />
<br />
Stamina increases your maximum hitpoints.  Different classes get more hit points per point of stamina than others.  Stamina also determines your maximum air supply when you are underwater or in an airless zone.<br />
<br />
Agility is one factor in determining your avoidance--how often NPC’s will miss when trying to hit you.  It also increases your chances to gain points in some combat skills.<br />
<br />
Dexterity affects your chances for special melee abilities such as combat effects and critical hits.  It increases your chances to gain points in most combat skills.  It is also a factor in determining how much damage you do with throwing weapons and archery.<br />
Bard Only:  High dexterity decreases the chance you will miss a note while playing a song.<br />
Tradeskills:  If your dexterity is higher than your intelligence or wisdom, it determines how quickly you gain skill in Fletching and Make Poison.<br />
<br />
Wisdom affects your chances of gaining skill points in most skills, if it is higher than your intelligence.<br />
Wisdom is the primary spell-casting attribute for Paladins, Rangers, Beastlords, Clerics, Shaman, and Druids.  It affects how much mana these classes have, which determines how many spells they can cast before they must rest.  It also determines how often a spell will fail to be cast correctly (fizzle).<br />
<br />
Intelligence affects your chances of gaining skill points in most skills, if it is higher than your wisdom.<br />
Intelligence is the primary spell-casting attribute for Shadowknights, Bards, Wizards, Enchanters, Necromancers, and Magicians.  It affects how much mana these classes have, which determines how many spells they can cast before they must rest.  For all except bards, it also determines how often a spell will fail to cast correctly (fizzle).<br />
<br />
Charisma affects how much merchants will charge you for their wares.  It also affects the chances for charm, memory blur, mesmerization, and divine intervention spell effects to work.<br />
Bard only:  High charisma decreases the chance you will miss a note while playing a song.</div></div><hr />
