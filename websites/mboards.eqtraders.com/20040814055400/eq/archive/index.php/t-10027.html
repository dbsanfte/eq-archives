<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Billit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After hearing how cheap it is to GM brewing, I thought I'd give it a shot, brewing was always a slow trade for me to go up in but I didnt run into a problem until MHB.<br />
My average skillup was 2 in 100 combines!!!!! (I think about 285 took me 200 combines).<br />
This seems WAY out of wack looking at other peoples run logs here.<br />
<br />
I FINALLY get to 248!! WOOT.<br />
I figure I'll make Kaladium Consttutionals:<br />
I get enough for 100 combines (darn Yarrow!!)<br />
<br />
Not only did I fall 50% of the combines I DIDN'T get the TWO skillups and now I'm banging my head on the wall!!<br />
<br />
So, do I just have VERY bad luck, GM's hate me, or am I doing something really wrong here?? <br />
<br />
My info:<br />
lvl 60<br />
Dwarf-Cleric<br />
255 WIS<br />
I used a geerlok making the KC after only making TWO on 20 attempts(and WIS was still 255)<br />
<br />
Thanks for letting me vent, and for any help you can give me!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kahmon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I made Demi-Sec champagne. The trivial is exactly 250 so you will succeed most of the time. Also, because it is part of the Solstice earring quest there is always a market for them so you can easily make a profit too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I thought about making Demi-Sec champagne for my last two points, but I decided it was too bloody expensive and too difficult to get the bottles.  So I went the Kaladium Constitutionals route.  The herb is a pain to buy, as is the failure rate, but its not really that hard to do.  The ground spawn is all in one spot and the respawn time is fairly quick.  The RNG, however, can be as cruel to you for your last two points as it ever has been.  I’ve read posts where people have gotten their last two points with 20 combines or less.  I didn’t happen to be one of the lucky ones.  I can’t remember the exact number, but it took me over 180 combines to get my last two points.  So no, you aren’t doing anything wrong.  You’re just having a streak of bad luck.  Just keep at it and the points will come.  Plus, at least on my server, the constitutionals still sell for a decent price.  So you should be able to make at least some of your money back.<br />
<br />
Just as a side note, I made my brewing trophy with 248 skill and on the first attempt.  Because of that I didn’t feel too bad about my luck with the constitutionals.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Moonlilly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Keep plugging away.  You'll get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">aye KCs only have about 50% success rate at 250.  They do sell well and are fairly easy to make.  Demi-secs are just way too troublesome to make to be worth it IMO.  Keep clicking and you will get your two points!  I got mine in 30 combines!  hehe :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My best success rate on KC's at 250 with trophy is 60%. My AVERAGE is 52% success. So, you're right on in the succes market as far as constitutionals are concerned. <br />
<br />
As far as getting to 250. *shrug* you got bit by the RNG. Do another hundred. :) Your stats are perfect, but as usual, some people get luckier than others with the RNG.<br />
<br />
And of course, you can always sell the Constitutionals and recoup every PP spent getting your brewing up easily. :)<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Imhotep_CN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got 248 on Mino Hero Brew and decided to attempt my brewing trophy.  Not only was I successful on my first try, I got a skill up to 249 on the attempt!<br />
<br />
But I do plan on Kaladim Constitutionals for the last point in the near future.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>liliputt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did the KC. Farmed around 80-100 of each fungus from Kaladim but got my last 2 points with only around 20-30 combines. Int was on 280 and used geerlok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Billit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for all the words of encourgement!!<br />
I feel much better now :)<br />
going to try another 100 KC's then.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Soulfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I did champagne for last 2 points. I set up 100 combines of em, cos me a bomb, and guess what? got 250 in the next 2 combines.<br />
<br />
But sold the champers for a whopping profit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>andaerice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually I hadn't thought about doing KC's for the last two points.  Thanks all :)  I went to Kaladim today and picked up enough for 80 combines (I figured 1/40 was a fairly safe assumption), then ran up to PoK for the subcombines.  Anyway..<br />
<br />
25 combines to hit 249<br />
25 more to hit 250<br />
<br />
Well roughly.. might have been 26+24 or 23+27 (was doing more finger crossing than counting), but had 30 left set up when I dinged GM.  I went ahead and finished the lot of them, and ended up with 152 finished KC's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>arnalh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">hell, yes, you'll only have a sucess rate of 40-50% on KC, but each sucesfull combine will only cost you an average of 5-6pp and you can easily sell them for 10-20pp, what's the problem? i managed to get my money back to cover the cost of my corking device and my corker easily... now i am grand master brewer, i have my trophy and i have more money than when i started.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ehre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I went with the demi-sec. It isn't too tough if you have friends to help you get the materials together, and you will more than make your money back since they sell for a good profit; especially if you can find someone who likes to sell PotC/Xanthe's Ring/Earring of the Solstice MQ kits.<br />
<br />
If I remember correctly, I got my last two points in 28 combines. 249 came after two combines, and 250 after the 28th of course.</div></div><hr />
