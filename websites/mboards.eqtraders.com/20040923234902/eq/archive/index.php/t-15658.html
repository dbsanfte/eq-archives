<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BuilderOfCastles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Working on the second attempt at undergarment, I have come to the horrifying problem of being stuck at sap #5.  I have spent the last 3 days solid trying to get one more sap.  I have killed more spiders then I have to attain the previous 5 saps.  Also, I have gotten a lot of things I didn't notice before, like 'burnt silk', blistered arachnid legs and the similar vendor loot.<br />
<br />
My question is, has anyone gotten a sap recently?<br />
<br />
Am I just having the worst luck, or did I run into a rework of spiders to add more vendor loot, which has placed sap on the endangered species list?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dalur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I spent about 5 to 6 hours there in field 1 hunting for the spider queen with a group of guildies non stop pulling usually 1, sometimes 2 - 2 druids in the group - we both DC'ed the DCable spiders and used that to help the DPS.<br />
<br />
After the 5 to 6 hour time, we ended up with 2 saps total.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Finavar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The problem with DCing the baby spiders is that they are placeholders for the named in Field1.  Add one more DPS type person and they will out damage the DC pets anyway.  <br />
<br />
Still the drop rate on sap is insanely low.  I have used a group: Paladin, Druid, Beastlord, Bard, 2 Rangers, where we basically chain 2 pull the field and get 1 or 2 sap in a 2 or so hour session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>crimson69</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have not seen a sap drop in over 200+ spider kills in field one (30 or so probably the light blue ones) For my tunic attempt(s) i have had to purchase most of them at about 15-20k apiece and so far I have had 2 tunic failures, and 3 brewing failures (with 250 brewing and a mod item).  I don't think the drop late has been lowered or anything, i know enchanters who can go in there soloing and for 3 hours come out with 5 or more saps, it is all random (too random in most cases)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>crystilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When I was working on Grimel earring #1, I ended up giving up trying to farm the saps because they were so incredibly rare and instead went back to Sol Ro and farmed ornate to buy the saps in the bazaar.  Found it much saner!<br />
<br />
Now that I'm crazily working on earring #2 (failed once on robe last night), I'm back at this again and will most likely stay in Sol Ro for my 4% a kill duo'ing with a mage for Ornate.  In a 3 hour span, we usually get one piece at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Fire mini's raid last night, we cleared Field2, one sap dropped. (and no freakin' solidified magma's - argh!)<br />
<br />
You're just hitting RNG. Keep farming. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>banazir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nothing has changed on the saps.  Burnt Silk and all else you have been seeing has been dropping since the zone was created.<br />
<br />
You need to expect to spend ON AVERAGE 3 hours per sap killing 2 per minute to get the saps.<br />
<br />
If you managed to get 5 in 5 hours consider yourself very lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>banazir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As a side note, I spend close to 30 hours to get enough saps to complete two earrings (8th and 7th) with 240 + geerlok tailoring (4 combines.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I got 2 saps off one spider about 2 weeks ago, then a third sap 2 spiders later (bringing my total sap count up to 5), and zero since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>crystilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Failed the robe 5-6 times (forget which) on earring #1.  During that time, when I tried to farm for saps, I had the following:<br />
<br />
1)  1st time in PoFire, 2 saps dropped (within an hour or two) and I got them<br />
2)  About 10 more hours of steady killing, got sap #3<br />
3)  Sap 4 came with about 15 more hours of steady killing (and clearing F1).<br />
4)  Sap 5 came from someone who spent 12 hours soloing the spiders for me.<br />
<br />
5)  Saps 6-7 came from friends who had extras.<br />
6)  Saps 8-18 (or 8-21) came from farming Sol Ro.<br />
<br />
It took 2 months from #1-4 and only 2 weeks from #5-6.<br />
<br />
~~<br />
Sol Ro time spent:<br />
<br />
1)  3 hours (1 ornate worth 80k, not split with someone else)<br />
2)  5-6 hours (3 ornate pieces worth 140k-split 2 ways)<br />
3)  2 hours (1 ornate worth 20k-split 2 ways)<br />
4)  3 hours (1 ornate worth 70k-split 2 ways)<br />
<br />
The money I earned from my share helped raise all my skills to 220+, finished up the 1st Grimel Earring and bought 2 attempts at the robe for 2nd Grimel ear.  (I'm stuck on the fletching part now.)</div></div><hr />
