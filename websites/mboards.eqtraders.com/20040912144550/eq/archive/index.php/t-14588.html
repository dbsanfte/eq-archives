<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so I don't have the GoD expansion.  I was wondering.....<br />
<br />
If I was lvl 52 and had the GoD port spells, just because I want a complete spell book and they can be bought in Nederia's Landing, what would happen if I tried to port a group of people over??<br />
<br />
Would they make it into Natimbi?  Would I wind up in Nederia's, the Nexus, or PoK?<br />
<br />
Just pondering....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you use the self gate, you end up in the &quot;safe spot&quot; of the zone you cast it from.<br />
<br />
If you use the group spell, anyone with GoD gets sent to Natimbi, anyone without GoD gets sent to the safe spot of the zone you cast it from, including you.<br />
<br />
If you use the Translocate, anyone with GoD gets sent to Natikmbi, anyone without GoD get sent to the safe spot of the zone you cast it from, assuming they click yes on the confirmation box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmmm.. that could so rock.  I could port people into GoD from PoK, make quite a bit of plat doing it as I would never have to leave the zone, and I wouldn't have to worry about getting whacked around by any wandering mobs there.  I just might have to try that when I get to 52 :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eowenna Celerdain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Uhmm ... <br />
<br />
Unless they changed it so this can no longer happen ...<br />
<br />
Sometimes if you don't have an expansion, and try to zone / gate in, your character *does* go there.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, if your account isn't keyed to that expansion, you immediately lose access to your character.  And you can't regain access until you request a GM to &quot;walk them out&quot; to someplace where you *do* have access.<br />
<br />
So be cautious.  Attempting to GG folks to a zone you can't go to may cost you more time than it's worth.  :boggled:</div></div><hr />
