<br />
after failing Aid Grimmel robe combine twice now (expensive), i decided to pour some more money into tailoring. this post is an accumulation of the data i saved on the combines, if anyone was looking for a general idea on the 220-241 path via solstice robes...<br />
<br />
started with materials to do 400 combines on the Ceremonial Solstice Robe= (1200 silk swatches, 1200 imbued emeralds, 2400 celestial essences + chains) it took me about 3 days to get all the subcombines done. had 355 wis the whole time and did not use a geerlok for this. here is the data:<br />
<br />
on making Gem Studded Chains at 252 jewelcrafting with no JewelcraftingmasteryAA's:<br />
<br />
104 successful combines on Gem Studded Chain (ruby, emerald, sapphire, worked silver chain)<br />
84 failed combines on chain = :(<br />
<br />
Successful Robe Combines from 220-241:<br />
104 robes vendored to tailor merchant~<br />
<br />
the fails i didn't bother to count, but the success rate seemed fairly high and it was very expensive to have this many combines succeed (i sold my chain bridle). <br />
<br />
overall the 400 combines yielded 19 skill points, the last 2 i got from Black Pantherskin armor from some pelts i had banked. out of 15 combines on Pantherskin armor i got the last 2 points pretty fast, which at 240 skill = 252 w/geerlok.<br />
<br />
glad it's over, hope this helps<br />
