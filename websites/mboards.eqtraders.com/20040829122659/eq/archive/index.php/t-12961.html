<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Silound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Site down for soem reason or is there really a BW limit that was hit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gumble Tinkertumble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, the one time I need check on a recipe too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This belongs in the Denmom's Corner, to get her attention, but I'm sure she and Ngreth are aware of it by now.  Usually all kinds of alarm bells go off when something like this happens; at the very least, they should have gotten an email from the Web host.  They've probably already gotten a couple of PM's on the boards about it too. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Moved... leaving copy behind.<br />
<br />
Bandwidth issues again... bah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wow.<br />
<br />
We actually did excede our bandwidth for the month...<br />
<br />
205067.66 Megabytes<br />
<br />
we have a 200000 megabyte limit... this is the first month since we we got the last 50 more than a year ago... that we have exceded it.<br />
<br />
I am going to have to talk to Denmom about it, and she is asleep... so it may be a bit.<br />
<br />
(The first time this happened in november was a bug... it exceded at 50000 megabytes... a bug... this time it is real...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">About a year ago also.  Racknine gave us 50 gigs of FREE trafic for mentioning them on our site :)  They applied it to the boards, which did not really need it (we had 50, curently this month we have reached 42... so were not likely to even excede the original 50 much less the 100)<br />
<br />
I sent them a trouble ticket when I responded above, asking then to take 25 from the boards and apply it to www.eqtraders.com... and they respnaded fairly quickly (11 minutes!!), AND did it... so we are back up... AND the extra 25 should last to the end of the month :)<br />
<br />
so enjoy :)</div></div><hr />
