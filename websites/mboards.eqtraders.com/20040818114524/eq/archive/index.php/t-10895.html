There is a post stickied above -  That is your guide as to what to do next.<br />
<br />
As for the rest of the questions, no, people here generally can't tell you what it's worth. EQTraders is a site for tradeskill discussions, and those are not tradeskill items. The economic conditions vary widely from server to server, so what's worth a lot on my server might be worthless on yours. Given all this, I doubt anybody here will be able to give you an idea what they're worth.<br />
<br />
If you're new to fletching or tradeskills, I suggest you take some time to browse these boards and the main EQTraders site - there is a lot of good information there and almost every conceivable question has been answered.Cheap Fletching Chart (new fletcher on tunare, current skill is 60. i can make CLASS 2 BONE PINT ARROWS, and a few bows. plz advise as to wat i should do next) Cheap Fletching Chart (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7396)</div></div><hr />
