<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fridgecritter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I will dispense with the formalities, and get to the meat.  Make twice brewed double stout dwarven ale (look up the recipe on this site) till 148 and then make minotaur hero's brew till 248 (All items for both drinks can be purchased for CHEAP off of vendors in kaladim and in PoK, so you can be GM brewer in 1 day)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No short beer sold in PoK, you'd have to go to SH to get it. <br />
<br />
Other than that, yea, it could work but you can do it cheaper to do fetid essense to 122, one fishing grub and one flask of water (both of which are sold in PoK) sell for way less than DBDS.<br />
<br />
From 122 up to 148 you could do dbds or Faydwer's Shaker up into the 180s, thus delaying the wrist-wrecking MHB and all it's subcombines. It's also store bought (halas has been touted as an excellent place for it, there have been others) and is inexpensive.<br />
<br />
My personal preference is to use Shar Vahl essense.  True I have to walk around SH a few times to get the fruit, but at least it's only the cost of a water flask per combine.  Depends on if you want to use money or time to skill it up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What subcombines?  All items for MHBs are avaiable directly from merchants, in some places a mere couple of steps from a brew barrel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i think he means the wrist problems associated with a 9 item combine and not the subcombines of it.  9 item combines are hard.  want to gm the easy wrist tradeskill do jc.  brewing is cheap and easy too though.</div></div><hr />

I did these in SkyShrine since all the city barrels seem taken when I want to tradeskill.<br />

All the items sold in the same room as the barrel, or the next room over in SS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My path:<br />

Fetid Essence to 122 (PoK.  Took me all of 15 minutes and 4 pp)<br />
Faydwer Shaker to 188 (Skyshrine)<br />
MHB up from there (Oggok)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">for uber cheapness do shar vhal essence instead of fay shakers to 187.  ground spawn are hard to beat in price.  get 28 fruit per circuit so not that hard.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gelaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't have any /locs but I can tell you where the others are.<br />
<br />
Everyone who has eight has the same eight, the ones between the fire dancers and Elefan.<br />
<br />
The others are on the other side of the zone. They're at the same end of the zone as the Shar Vahl newbie area, just on the other side. To get there put the entrance to Shar Vahl behind you and walk. <br />
<br />
There are a couple of groves of Payala trees over there (look for the purple leaves) and that's where they're found. One grove seems to not have any, but the other one or two have lots.<br />
<br />
They're easy to find - I never write down the /locs because the purple leaves on the trees give them away.</div></div><hr />

Check it out... it's in the DB under Payala Fruit<br />
 (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1383&amp;menustr=035000000000)<br />

I can't thank the ones who came up with the DB format enough!  You guys are so awsome!</div></div><hr />

Why not level up into the 160s by brewing Halas Heaters.  All the items are sold in thurg except for the brown algae.  So you make one run to cobalt scar (not to hard) and buy a ton of algae.  Then you can resell the successes to a smith or take the time to brew your own Coldain Velium Temper.<br />
<br />
I have spent alot of time looking around trying to fit peices of different trades together to make things cheaper.  Like why not do fillets up to 140 something and do them in each of the 4 meat classes (lion bear wolf and mammoth) so that you have enough to make like 200 attempts on Halas 10lb meat pie (good for leveling and making plat (I think) in the mean time)  I still have over 300meat pies in the bank cant use bazzaar in Japan for some strange reason so they sit there.  Now if there was just a way for me to combine brewing with something other then smithing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Brildary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It's true the ingredients for Faydwer Shakers are easy to get, and there are other recipes whose ingredients are also pretty available...but make no mistake, it takes hours to skill up.  I've posted some of this in the Primal Scream Room, but just to let up- and-coming brewers know, it took me 10 hours of clicking to skill up 46 points on Shakers.  This isn't a complicated recipe, no earlier subcombines, no combinations of bits and pieces from some other brewing run, this was just straight ahead combining of existing, easily purchased cultural alchohols. And it still takes 10 hours! I've made inquiries, and this is a fairly common length of time...nothing high level about it, down to earth brewing. So don't be lulled into thinking it can be knocked out in an afternoon after school. You won't do this and get your chemisty homework done on time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>pikamoos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Um I'm not sure why you are having such a hard time skilling up.  I started at 0 last night and spent around an hour finding the barrel finding the grubs and doing the combines for fetid, and I maxed my skills at 122. <br />
<br />
This afternoon at lunch I ran to East Freeport, found where to buy the combine stuff, and found the brewery, started combining and got up to 172, all within one hour.  <br />
<br />
I'd think if you knew where all of the stuff was located you could probably make 172 within an hour and a half, easy.  I have my intelligence at 280 so this probably helps, but I would go quicker if I took the time to empty out all my backpacks before I started.</div></div><hr />

If your a little race... find the brew barrel. You have everything in one room to get to 248 on MHB's (except water which is right outside the door to the right on little female vendor). So everything is there including the short beers.<br />

I went from 200 to 248 in 2.5 hours for 40pp.</div></div><hr />

I will post more detailed data under a separate thread when I can pick apart my log at home for my path from 187 (Shar Vahl Essence) to 248.  Now to plot and scheme for those last two points.</div></div><hr />
