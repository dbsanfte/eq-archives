<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaldolur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings!<br />
<br />
I haven't paid much attention to brewing recipes since I hit 200. I brew Qeynos Afternoon Tea for myself - and that's about it. But a friend asked me tonight if there were drinks that lasted longer than regular water. My answer was &quot;of course, yes&quot; - but then as I began to check out the recipes, I've noticed something has changed...<br />
<br />
There used to be brewing recipes that produced &quot;whistle-wetter&quot;, &quot;drink&quot;, &quot;refreshing&quot;, &quot;lasting&quot;, &quot;flowing&quot;, &quot;enduring&quot; and &quot;miraculous&quot; drinks. Each lasted longer than the previous.<br />
<br />
But now, all I can find are a few &quot;whistle-wetters&quot;, lots of &quot;drinks&quot; and a handful of &quot;miraculous&quot;. Have the other duration drinks been removed from the game? Or am I simply overlooking something in the recipes?<br />
<br />
I'd greatly appreciate any feedback you can give me!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Kaladim Constitutional lasts the longest.<br />
<br />
Well... Twice Brewed Kaladim Constitutional lasts twice as long, but it takes 2 to make it so the end result is the same.. its also part of Aid Grimel so you need lots of flags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aoleus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's not that drinks of other durrations don't exist, they're just not created through brewing is all. Although, even after taking into account the purchased and dropped non-alcoholic drinks, I don't believe the list grows a whole lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaldolur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank you both for your replies... but they don't answer my question... :) <br />
Kaladim Constitutional lasts the longest.<br />
Yes, I am aware of that. It's a &quot;miraculous drink&quot; - longest lasting category in the game, but that wasn't my question. :( <br />
It's not that drinks of other durrations don't exist, they're just not created through brewing is all. <br />
If they aren't created by brewing - then what skill is used to create them, please?<br />
<br />
I'll go back to my original post - and expand on it a little. In the game there used to be different drinks &lt;created through brewing&gt; (and food) &lt;created through baking&gt;, that lasted for various lengths of time. The table was as follows:<br />
<br />
FOOD--------------------DRINK--------------------DURATION<br />
snack.............................whistle-wetter.................15 minutes<br />
meal...............................drink..............................30 minutes<br />
hearty............................refreshing........................60 minutes<br />
banquet..........................lasting............................90 minutes<br />
feast..............................flowing..........................120 minutes<br />
enduring..........................enduring.......................150 minutes<br />
miraculous.......................miraculous.....................180 minutes<br />
<br />
(all of this information was taken strictly from EQ Traders - albeit approximately 2 years ago.) ;)<br />
<br />
Now - I have looked at the entire list of non-alcoholic drinks (ones that can be used in place of water) and all I see are:<br />
<br />
3 recipes for &quot;whistle-wetters&quot;<br />
12 recipes for &quot;drinks&quot;<br />
1 recipe for &quot;refreshing&quot;<br />
1 recipe for &quot;flowing&quot;<br />
6 recipes for &quot;miraculous&quot;<br />
<br />
My question remains: What happened to all of the other recipes for the different durations? (and if they aren't brewed as suggested in the reply above, how are they created?) :confused:<br />
<br />
Thank you very much! :)<br />

I believe he was indicating extended duration drinks sold by NPC vendors (Fizzlecutter Formula 5000, Otter Milk, etc.).<br />
<br />
There are tons of drinks available that have varying durations, but only a handful of the longer lasting ones are player-made.<br />

Though I am fairly certain that the above list isn't a complete composition of every drink item, I don't believe that any of the brewing recipes with long durations have been removed from the game, though I could be wrong.  Perhaps you were confusing a player-made item list with a vendor sold item list.  I don't know.  In any case, I hope this helps to answer your question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">when you look up the brewing recipes, you noticed they are broken apart by era, right? just asking cuz i couldn't figure out where the velious baking recipes were the other day... even though i KNOW the eras are broken apart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brodder FoamyMugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Who in der right mind would drink Otter's milk?<br />
::SHivers::<br />
<br />
 And whut ye be wanting wif non-alcholic beverages anyway?<br />
 Nutting wrong with a stormguard rootbeer whilst ye's on duty, or a malted milk to curb yer appetite...or some eggnog for a meal...<br />
<br />
 Long as ye recon dat dah true pleasures of brewing lay in the brews I've discovered...<br />
 Ahh nutting beats a double brewed double stout dwarven ale...cept maybe free ale...or better yet, sumone else's buying or footing yer bar tab...<br />
<br />
 note- Brodder's Revenge should be a Miraculous Drink btw...even though it has some alcohol in it...<br />
 It has many curative properties too...har har har...<br />
<br />
 Now sumtin like bean beer...well dat's not sumtin we talk bout the fire...if ye know whut I means...clouds the issue at hand...and gets a might...breezy too.<br />
