<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Waldrick</div><div class="date">04-19-2006, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I searched a bit, but could not find anyone describe this happening before.  I went to talk to the Coordinator and got the Beginner Smithing trophy task.  I had not completed any of the steps of this task when the oddity happened.<br />
<br />
While cleaning out some bank space I used the loom in the Guild Hall to turn some MQ Cat Pelts to LQ pelts for later conversion to padding.  I used a skinning knife that I made months ago.  After the conversion it returns the LQ pelt and the skinning knife.<br />
<br />
After I converted the second skin I got a &quot;Task Phase Completed&quot; text on the screen.  Looking over the task it had marked the &quot;Create 2 Skinning Knives&quot; as complete.  I guess having the knives returned from a tradeskill action set the flags.<br />
<br />
Just an oddity I wanted to share.</div></div><hr />

If an item is returned from a combine (no matter whether it was a component or not) it counts as having been 'created'.</div></div><hr />
