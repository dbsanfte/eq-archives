<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dahna</div><div class="date">02-19-2003, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently discovered this anime tv which main theme is the online world, like perhaps Serial Experiment Lain, but more classical.<br />
It was an interesting one because even if the story takes place in a mmorpg, the anime always suggest that it is still a game.<br />
<br />
The scenarii roughly talk about an introverted player who suddenly wake up in &quot;The World&quot;, the most popular mmorpg of his time some years later in the future, losing all his memory. He notice that he is not bound by the game rules, and soon is attacked by the GMs considering him as a hacker. He is saved by a strange cat, a forbidden &quot;banned&quot; player and find out that he can't log out of the game. So he main quest for him is to find a way to get out of this world, and he will be helped by several players, for money or just to help him out.<br />
<br />
This anime does not talk about an online game just to be &quot;in the move&quot;, but develops some interesting AND intelligent point about the mmorpg in general (not the usual &quot;mmorpg is cool, mmorpg is bad&quot;...) like :<br />
<br />
- the mmorpg aspect : the presence of GMs, the World's rules, the teleportation system like the zone. There is also some funny details like the hero who encounter others players with the same appearence, only different with some details.<br />
Also the classical point is that the hero's companion are typical of a fantasy mmorpg : the barbarian warrior (who is played by an adult wise man), the machiavelic magician, the GM-Admin (yes, a GM leader), an ex-GM, a rogue/spy/Pk...<br />
<br />
- the &quot;real world&quot; aspect : sometimes we can see some cutscene of a player getting frozen because he is going to drink some tea (not really &quot;realist&quot; but it had to be noticed), or some conversation via BBS or email. We can learn a little about the real player life and some of these informations will be important later for the hero.<br />
Also the relationship between players is well explained : for exemple 2 players will fall in love but one of them think that it is only a game and does not want to go further.<br />
<br />
Technically, the anime is well done even though it seems &quot;old&quot; (it was broadcasted in japan tv in 2001) with a deep background history (so deep that it created a game, some OAV and a manga, all parallel history but all connected in some facts). Of course, it was all because of the Noir team for those who know them : Sadamoto for scenarii (illustrator and mangaka of the manga Evangelion) and Kajura for the music.<br />
<br />
So in conclusion, I recommand to see this &quot;original&quot; anime tv if you want to see some &quot;cross-over&quot; actions with what you are currently playing :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Itzena</div><div class="date">02-20-2003, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's already showing on US Cartoon Network - it started a few weeks back, iirc. I'm surprised that there hasn't been a surfeit for new barb warrios called Bear or erudite paladins called Mimiru, personally. ;)<br />
<br />
The OSTs make amazing listening in EQ, btw. Really good music.</div></div><hr />
