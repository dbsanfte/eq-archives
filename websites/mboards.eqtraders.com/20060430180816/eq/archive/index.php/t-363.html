How do you usually go about getting metal enchanted for cultural?  I'm looking to get some enchanted brellium to work on dwarven cultural and was curious how to go about getting it enchanted.<br />
<br />
At first I thought to offer to pay by the hour as much as they could enchant, and while they were enchanting I would take it and beat it into sheets.<br />
<br />
The second way I thought of was to pay by the brick, for as long as they wanted to enchant.<br />
<br />
Which method do you guys use or is there another way I haven't thought of?  Also how much do you usually pay for this service?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
hint if possible, have a bard that can sing a mana song, or bring a character that the enchanter can drain mana from in a /duel. Will make it go much faster, and the enchanter will appreciate it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I needed a LOT, pay XXX by the hour then have the enchanter sit with you close to the forge and feed them ore.<br />
<br />
If I just needed 10-20 I would hand over the ore then make a donation afterwords<br />
<br />
Don't think I ever offered X per brick, though I suppose you could do that method as well for smaller amounts of ore needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fror</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the replies.  I'm a cleric, albeit only level 28, so I'll have a little bit of extra mana that they could tap.  I'll look and see if there is anybody on my server that is willing to go by the hour.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />

I've never thought of that! Theft of Thought and Wandering Mind would add quite a bit of mana regen.<br />
<br />
Just have to make sure that the buyer zones first so that you &quot;win&quot;.  ;)</div></div><hr />

LOL I have a collection of screenshots of that  :twisted:</div></div><hr />

From a simple &quot;casting C3 for donations&quot; standpoint, one bar of mana is probably worth at least 200p. It would, of course, go up if I had to sit around and med to do multiple sets. <br />
<br />
That being said, I am a tradeskill fan, so I usually just do vials/bricks for whatever is being offered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">farghen</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A warning about Theft of Thought.  Guards sometimes attack the enchanter for casting it on another player in a duel.  First time you try it, make sure there is a zone nearby.</div></div><hr />

Cubwynn, love your threads man :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jessamyn Sunweaver</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OR, a very effective way I've discovered thanks to a cleric friend...<br />
<br />
Go to the old world, and bring a Complete Heal able cleric with a Manastone<br />
<br />
Have the enchanter enchant the ore till they are OOM. Use the Manastone to clicky their way back to FM while the cleric heals when they get low.<br />
<br />
Give Manastone back to cleric when FM. Cleric then fills his/her mana to full using the manastone while the enchanter is enchanting bricks.<br />
<br />
Rinse, repeat. Soon you'll have more ore then you know what to do with in a VERY short time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenasi</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another advantage of the manastone is that using it, even once, resets the spell-reset-timer-gem for the enchant metal series.  I was enchanting tons of steel VERY quickly when just 3-popping the manastone in between enchants (tested it with a single 'hit', as well, worked the same way...3 just seemed to get me a good amount of mana back).  Also, don't forget that druids/shamans can *almost* CH now-a-days as well...not to mention the regen adding mana regen to the equation.<br />
<br />
You used to be able to do the same sort of thing with mages pre-modrod2 nerf...cleric + mage = infinite mana fast.  I used that combo once before the nerf in the Bazaar to make tons of imbued/enchanted mana vials/gems.<br />
<br />
Of course, that requires that you have an enchanter you somewhat trust.  Above all, what I'd suggest is tracking down any friends you have that are of the level you need to enchant your ore and try and trouble them for a little of their time.  Also, I suggest if they are rarely available to create a ore mule near your forge...take them there...and wring them dry.  Fill the mule so you don't need to go 'WTB:  49+ enchanter to enchant XXXX' whenever you get an order/urge to smith.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />
