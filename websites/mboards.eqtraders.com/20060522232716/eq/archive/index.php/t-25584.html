<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">03-10-2006, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I created an Iksar just so I could skill him up and make GM DoN armor (there does not appear to be anyone doing it on my server). <br />
<br />
I had gotten to 162 and then started on EVB's, but then stopped and took a look at the expert level Trooper armor, and wondered if this might be a better skill-up path. <br />
<br />
First of all, it is somewhat more expensive than EVB (assuming you farm the Velium), but not massively more expensive.  Secondly, I'm thinking (hoping) that there will at least be some sell-back and/or tribute value with these pieces, which might make it more worthwhile. <br />
<br />
Lastly, I think I remember reading something about DoN cultural combines providing a skill-up bonus?  I searched, but couldn't find it.  Is that true?  And if so does it only apply to Master and GM combines, or does it apply to all of them?<br />
<br />
Are there any other drawbacks to this that I may be overlooking?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

1) No tribute or sellback on cultural items. MINIMAL market in bazaar for anything less than GM. I can't sell my Master stuff for the cost of the threads. :\<br />
<br />
2) Skillup bonus is 5% for Master, 10% for GM...nothing on anything less AFAIK.</div></div><hr />

Then do LDoN armors to 210.  Even if you buy the temper components you will make a profit doing them because many of the pieces tribute for much more than the cost of materials.  Be warned!  The small, medium and large sizes of each piece often have significantly different tribute values!</div></div><hr />

I couldnt even give them away on Povar, 2 sets (halfling) given away from 50 made in 6 months, the rest i just destroyed as bank space was becoming critical. No trib or vendor sell back allowed on them.</div></div><hr />
