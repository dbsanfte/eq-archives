<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This past weekend one of my favorite sites ran into some problems, and sorta lost their web host.  :boggled:<br />
<br />
Those who craft in Star Wars Galaxies are likely having the same sort of twitches that I am (and trust me, it gives me totally new empathy for what folks went through when our site was totally down), due to THE premiere SWG crafting site being down for the count.  Like EQTC, his site is run on much love, and donations from the community.  Like EQTC, the information is user-provided (and there's a TON of information there, including an up-to-date resource listing by server) and the site is ad-free.<br />
<br />
I'm quoting a chunk of the pertinent information below, taken from the front page of http://www.swgcraft.com  If you know of anyone that can help with the following, please contact Trokk directly.  (His preference is option 2)<br />
<br />
<br />
I am currently looking at three options (in order of preference):<br />
<br />
1) Rent a dedicated server myself. Unfortunately, I do not have extensive experience setting up and maintaining a secure and solid dedicated web server. I could probably Forrest Gump my way through it but there's a danger that my lack of experience will result in security and performance problems. If I go down this route I will need the assistance of an experienced community member who can spare some of their time to look after that side of things for me.<br />
<br />
2) Find a community member who currently has spare bandwidth and CPU cycles on their dedicated server and is willing to host the site for a monthly fee that will go towards their hosting costs. This community member must have a good amount of experience configuring and maintaining a dedicated web server.<br />
<br />
3) Approach the game networks and see about advertisement driven hosting. As much as I love the security of hosting on a games network, I'd prefer to stick with a non-advertisement driven site if possible.<br />
<br />
Before the site went down it was running on the following kit:<br />
<br />
Intel Celeron 1.3GHz (the site was pushing this CPU to close to it's limits during peak hours) <br />
512MB RAM <br />
60GB (7200RPM) Hard Drive <br />
700GB Monthly Transfer Allowance (the site was using ~5GB/day) <br />
Red Hat 7.2 <br />
Latest PHP and MySQL <br />
Apache v1.3.27 <br />
Shell access (very important) <br />
If you are in the position to help me with any of these options then please get in touch. My old @swgcraft.com email address no longer works, for obvious reasons. You can get hold of me on a temporary email address I have setup: swgcraft@yahoo.co.uk</div></div><hr />
