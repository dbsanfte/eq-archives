<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cigarskunk</div><div class="date">01-04-2003, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Needed to bang up my tailoring to do MTPs so figured I'd go the easy root and kill two birds with one stone to boot.<br />
<br />
Had a 21 tailor skill from whatever to start with.  Bought enough mandrake roots for 100 combines.  Hit 66 skill at 98th combine and failed my last two combines. :(<br />
<br />
Out of those 100 combines I had 54 success.<br />
<br />
Int was 162 through combo of INT gear, food and drink as well as chanter buff Voice of Quellious.<br />
<br />
So basically I averaged one skill up every other combine - total cost was about 500 plat although since I'm going to actually use all of those in my baking, cost could technically be said to be just the 46 failure - about 200 plat.<br />
<br />
The thing that really gets me was how fast the skill ups came - my buddy had done this same root with his troll SK and it took him twice as many combines to get to the same place starting from his high 20s - it would seem that I had either hit a magic number or the Voice of Quellious buff was better than I thought.</div></div><hr />

At a similar int skill, it should have been somewhere close, altho the rng is pretty flakey sometimes.</div></div><hr />
