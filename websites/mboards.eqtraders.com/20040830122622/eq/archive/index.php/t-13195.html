<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqNichola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dunno, just letting you know that if you are going to fish in PoWater you will want to have either FD or a fixed duration invis spell, cos there is no place to fish out of aggro range of mobs. Druids get an 'Improved' invis spell (fixed duration) I believe? Make sure you keep it timed :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gryfalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They are a great way to skill up if, as mentioned, you can make yourself invis for a long time.<br />
<br />
Have seen rogues do it forever.  Actually, I am quite sure he was macroing...<br />

Anyway, it's great because you can forage in PoJ for a long time getting tons of different skill-up goods, and then fish to use some of them.<br />
<br />
Then you get a group up and hunt Regruas.  Been using their claws for all my skill ups from 240 to 250.  4 more to go..;-)<br />

Rogues get an AA ability called Shroud of Slealth (SoS) which is a perminant improved hide. The only time it fails is if the mob can see through it (rare) or if the rogue wishes to drop it, or does an action that causes it to fade.</div></div><hr />
