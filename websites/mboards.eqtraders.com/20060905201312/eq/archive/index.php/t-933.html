Anyway, I recently sent the message below to the Developer's Corner regarding Vah Shir smithing. The point of this post is to see if other Vah Shir playing characters have the same feelings and, if they do, to send their own request to the Developer's Corner.  I'm sure this may be an old topic, but I'm new to Vah Shir and I find it a bit crazy that a whole race cannot be classified as having a &quot;culture&quot; within the context of the semi-new smithing armors.  I personally do not think diety=culture.  If that is the case, they should've named the new armors more along the lines of being &quot;blessed by the God's&quot; and not claiming them to be &quot;cultural smithing&quot; items. At any rate, help me flood the Dev Corner with &quot;requests / comments&quot; if you feel the same..<br />

Sending this out as a request for someone within the developing team to please look into this matter. Perhaps it is an old issue, but it's hard to believe that &quot;Cultural Smithing&quot; should be based solely upon worshiping a diety. Yes, Vah Shir are agnostic. So by being agnostic, they do not have a culture?  Recently spirit stones have come into play for Vah Shir shaman. I see no reason why a set of smithed armor could be made using this same basic premise. This would not only open up blacksmithing as a viable option for Vah Shir, but it would also refrain from puting such a huge penalty upon the class simply for wishing to be this race. I find it very hard to believe the Vah Shir as a race couldn't come up with a set of armor especially designed for themselves.<br />
