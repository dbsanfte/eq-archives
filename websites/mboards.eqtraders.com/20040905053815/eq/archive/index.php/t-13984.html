<br />
I was in Thurg yesterday and noticed that the price to buy CVT from a vendor is 5pp, 9gp.  I thought the price used to be around 25pp-ish or so?  If looks like brewing CVT to sell in the bazaar is no longer profitable....<br />

Some translocation sales may work, though.  (Buy in Thurg, put on your bazaar mule, sell for 1pp profit or something.  You want to sell low enough that the added value of Bazaar convenience is worth the price to your customers, and high enough so the added work is worth it to you.)  (If you have a buying mule in Thurg, then the added work of buying, putting in a shared slot, and taking it out on a vendor mule shouldn't be horribly onerous.)</div></div><hr />

(sorry spent alot o time on pottery/alchemy lately</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, it's buyable again, though I forgot to check to see what a merchant will pay you for it now. I bought a few myself a couple days ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">4pp and change sell back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>imjonah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Suddenly the 1000 CVT's I have on my mule went from being worth 40k to being worth 5k.  It now costs more to brew the stuff than to buy it.  For a couple years the price was around 25p, then they screw up the merchant the price goes up to 50p now they bring back the merchant and drop his price by 80%, how is that right.<br />
<br />
     bad enough they take away a nice little profit maker, they destroy the value of our inventory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Because of the many people that took advantage of the price when it was 0, and loaded up 24 10 slot bags (16 in the bank, and 8 on the toon) on multiple alts for free, and were selling them in the bazaar for 10-15pp each (pure profit.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kaalen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah - I figured it was probably due to the free CVT bug too.  That being said, it is now cheaper to buy then make.  If they wanted to decrease the price to buy it from a vendor, they should have also decreased the price to make it so that brewers could still make a profit...<br />

They are going through all the recipes to remove all recipes that you can do to make a profit.  Gogo macro traders making millions doing them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah, um, but it also makes them pointless to make for non-macro traders. Why make something for roughly 10 plat when you can buy it for 5 plat off of an NPC vendor? What's the point of the recipe at all then? Either the recipe should be adjusted or the vendor sell price. I'd vote for the recipe at this point since there have been so many vendor sell price adjustments and the bugs due to them have been so many on this item.</div></div><hr />

Must of been one that bought 1000s for 0pp and trying to profit from it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Aw. We complained about the price when we HAD to buy them, we complained about the sploiters who bought them when they were free, we complained about the pain when we HAD to make them, and we complain about the lost profit now they finally started selling CVTs at a half-way sensible price. <br />
<br />
:cry: <br />
<br />
Accept it, they hate us and want us to suffer. <br />
