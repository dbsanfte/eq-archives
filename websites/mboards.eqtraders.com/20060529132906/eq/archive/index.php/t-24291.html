Years ago I began brewing with one of my older characters, now starting anew with another character I have found that I do not want to do what I did with my old character...which is travel zone to zone and having to either get help from other players or have to run faction quests time to time so I can go into areas to aquire materials for my brewing.<br />
<br />
Stepping my virtual foot down I decided to write this minor guide so that others who like me do not always have the time to spend online running around to get stuff to use for brewing, or just plain impatient such as I can be at times. Hopefully this will be usefull for everyone out there because NOTHING in this guide requires faction (dark, light, whatever). All of it is in the Plane of Knowledge.<br />
<br />
If you are able, get gear that raises your Intelligence or Wisdom. From what I have come to understand having one of those stats over 200 either maxes its potential or brings it close in helping skill ups. <br />
<br />
Just to be perfectly clear as to why I have such large gaps between trivial levels of recipes. I have found that having a larger gap from trivial increases the overall rate of skill ups, granted it also opens up a lot of failures but the purpose of this guide is to level up your skill first, return on your investment(very little) last.<br />

After you have achieved 248 you may try to get your Grandmaster Brewer`s Cork, keep in mind that this is where my One Zone Power Brewing Guide ends. Ends here because after this point you may need to go to other zones to get what you need for levelling your skill up more or to get your Grandmaster Brewer`s Cork, which may have you going to someone who can make some <br />

Now don`t quote me on this but I BELIEVE this is trivial 250. EQTraders at this time lists it as &gt;300 but if you have any experience with high skill level crafting you know your chance of sucess is very high and your chance of levelling up in skill very low. So the chances are in your favor of getting this in one try are very high. Just beware of the risk and take responsibility of such.<br />

The tradeskill trophies really are all trivial over 300.  It's true that they were added when the skill cap was 250, but were designed at that time to still be a bit tough at max skill.  There is currently a thread going in the General forum called Nailing the trivial of the Tradeskill Trophies (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/showthread.php?t=24214) aiming to use statistics to work out the probable precise trivial, just for the challenge of it.  But it's definitely over 300.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will shortly post an updated version in this thread of my guide.<br />
<br />
Changes should include:<br />
- Ommiting the trophy<br />
- Ommiting the shortbeer<br />
- Changing location to Shadowhaven<br />
- Adding quest information to get the faction gear to shop in shadowhaven<br />
- Adding Fetid Essence<br />
<br />
I posted the guide going on old information. I only just came back to EQ after over two years. Currently I am unable to play due to waiting for my computer to arrive (just moved) right now Im using a 10 year old japanese vaio (Try your patience at waiting an hour for your email to load :P ). I got to play for a couple weeks before my move but I am still far behind on the power curve. I will post my update as soon as I can.<br />

Annex Note: I understand that you can do most things in this guide in Shadowhaven or a couple other zones, but I wanted to post a guide that would be open to the most amount of people possible. With no faction worries, no secondary quests needed, and lastly as cheap as possible with keeping in mind the fewest recipes as possible... having this guide based in PoK, the Hub of EQ seemed the best possible route to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
one comment: I would leave it the first way, as fishing grubs can only be foraged &amp; are infrequently sold to vendors (imo).  vegetables, while also foraged, can also be made and are frequently sold in the bazaar, so if prioritizing access to supplies (money not being necesarily an object), the vegetables version would seem to maximize those things for new but not necessarily poor brewers.  since short beer is used later in the guide &amp; apparently not sold in pok, keeping it as one of the early steps also doesn't seem like a bad overall idea.<br />
<br />
[edited to add: are fishing grubs reliably sold in pok?  on rereading I see you list a vendor, but I didn't realize they were sold anywhere in the game in unlimited supply rather than player-generated.  if so, I agree that adding fetid essence is a good step.]</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can skill all the way to 248 without having to move more than 3 steps from the barrel.<br />
<br />
They also sell the ingredients for Faydwer Shaker which is a nice intermediate step with less components that MHB (triv 188).<br />
<br />
Also your comment about large gaps between skill ups is not correct. Skill-up chance is increased on successes, so it is better to keep the gap small if possible.</div></div><hr />

Oh yes they are sold in unlimited quantities in POK. Right near the little (PITT) bank.</div></div><hr />

I just put it down how I did it with my new main character after doing it the long way two years ago.<br />
<br />
I find the new system of crafting much easier and less a pain on the wrist with the auto combine system. Thus vegetables seemed to me being a viable route.<br />
<br />
As for being closer to trivial skill increases your chance of success. I have found that to not be true, for me at leaste. It was a pain doing 80 or so combines to get 1 skill up so I went to the next highest combination I had on my list and flew through a lot of skill levels which slowed down the closer I got to trivial.<br />

Abysmal Sea: Was there only once, and that was only in passing for the most part. That and even if I added it, then I would have needed to check on faction to see if you needed to have some good faction in order to go there without any problems. I decided to stick to the, in my opinion, best accessable area that was known by me to be infact neutral to ALL players no matter what you have done. Had a friend who played a iksar monk who took pride in killing most guards to get money for his crafting to end up having to go to very select locations, usually in far off places in order to do his crafting. Just wanted to present a guide to the widest possible player base.<br />
<br />
Also the same could be said about Shadow Haven just as Abysmal Sea. Do a small but easy faction quest and you have shortbeer and all the other things needed to make Faydwer Shaker and other drinks that could be nice intermediates.<br />
<br />
Being that my new main is a lvl 24 non-twink enchanter, I was able to afford what I put in the guide. Took me a bit to make sure I had enough money but I was able to achieve my financial goal while working on getting supplies to work on my tailoring.</div></div><hr />

You may have found that, but seeing as the skill-up formulae have been given out by the developers, it is not really a matter of opinion. Click the &quot;calculators&quot; link on the main site to see how this works.<br />

Abysmal Sea is neutral faction for all. However you do need the GoD expansion to access it. If you do have GoD though, then this is definitely the most convenient place to skill up from 122 to 248 as you dont have to move from the same spot next to the brew barrel. I dont believe Soda is sold there however, so it is back to PoK for Champagne.</div></div><hr />

Calculators and and other engines with the set formula or not, I have in my experience encountered a slowing of skill ups the closer I get to trivial.<br />
<br />
Now this is not just some idle thing I throw out from a first experience. I have experienced this time and time again. Now yes, the equation may hold true in the game but in actual function, &quot;I&quot; get fewer skill ups closer I get to trivial. I get more successes to be sure, but not more skill ups.<br />
<br />
Now this is something I have experienced on three different servers. May be totally different for someone else. It may be that I just tend to get lucky or not so lucky on the random draw. I was using experience in this guide, not some calculations. Infact this guide I have had for a long time one of my CDs, along with a bunch of other crafting stuff on Excel and PowerPoint which the computer I am using at present doesnt have (No idea what they are besides the names).<br />
<br />
As for the Abysmal Sea, something I may have to look into as soon as I get my computer back (*crosses fingers). I actually just bought the GoD expansion before I moved so I have not had much experience in what it entails. I believe I was escorted through there once to rez someone with my alt but that is my extent of my knowledge and thus reason for my ignorance on that area.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, well you would, because skill ups are less frequent as your skill rises.</div></div><hr />
