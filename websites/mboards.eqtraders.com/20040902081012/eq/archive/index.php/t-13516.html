<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So as a young halfling druid who was starting to toy with the various tradeskills, I bought myself a fishing rod to fish for food.<br />
<br />
Later when soloing in the Karanas I would med by the river, and click fishing as i did so.<br />
<br />
Now I am 65, very well skilled in nearly all the tradeskills.  The other night i decided to make a fishing pole for a solstice earing for my twink ckeric (i have made a number of these in the past) so i went to my guildtrainer and payed for the last 7 skillpoints to take fishing to 200.<br />
<br />
Long story short, cleric got the earing.<br />
<br />
ANYHOO --- I am now working on my baking (was 190 last night) which is my only skill left under 200.<br />
<br />
So i decide to go to POS and fish for Salmon.  <br />
OMG i forgot how boring it is....  i think i worked through 100 bait before i went to bed.  Got around 18 Salmon.<br />
<br />
Anyone got any tips, or should i simply do 100 bait every night till i catch enough of em?<br />
<br />
BTW - Brell's Fishing Pole ROCKS :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lixivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">have a friend, or use one as a bot and fish at the same time, double the fish in the same amount of time, thats what i did for cod oil, it worked very well, didnt seem like i wasted so much time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">unfortunatly my bot account does not have POP.  Altho this may change when i get my bot cleric up to 46.<br />
<br />
Great idea for Cod Oil tho.<br />
<br />
I use a switchbox to share Monitor/mouse/keyboard between 2 computers, but if i write a hotbutton that does 2 fishing and 2 autoinventory, i can stagger them as i flip between comps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>unstabl13</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I took 600 catch-alot-bait &lt;whatever its called &gt; the one that gives you 2% , to PoS . After 4 hours &lt; roughly &gt; I came home with 130 salmon . I promptly sold them for 500 a stack &lt; 25 per fish &gt; I have done this twice now , second time caught a little less than 130 . Seems to me , that to catch these fish , you have to be commited to fishing there for a few hours . <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Trixzie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Generally I go to PoS with 6 stacks of Catch-a-lot bait. I, on average, come away with 25 Salmon, and 70 fresh fish. People on Saryrn can't seem to get enough of fish rolls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lixivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well i would say in the time it takes you to fish and forage the items for salmon, you could be making MTP faster. depends on how much time youre willing to sacrifice for non aching wrists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was hoping to use Salmon + Jug of Sauce, to move from 190 to 202, avoiding doing MTPs through tradeskill Hell Levels.<br />
<br />
Its breaded Salmon that needs the foraged component (triv 215)<br />
I wont be doing this unless i can buy bread Crumbs, as foraging is much worse than fishing!</div></div><hr />

I was hoping to use Salmon + Jug of Sauce, to move from 190 to 202, avoiding doing MTPs through tradeskill Hell Levels. <br />
<br />
Just a suggestion, but if you get sick of fishing for the salmon, try Griffon Melts if you can get the meat cheap (ie, farm it yourself or have friends\guildmembers who hunt in Jaggedpine). Barring that....Ohabah Truffles. I did those from about 189 to 200 (well, a couple of the skill-ups I got during that time were from Griffon Melts, but....), and only stopped because I'm wanting to 250 Brewing before Baking. <br />
<br />
Either sell the truffles or store them away and hand them out to Monks and Rogues before a guild raid (Warriors are better off using HMPs or MTPs). I know a few Rangers who like them, too....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, i do them too...<br />
<br />
I worked through 50 Mushrooms and about 70 salmon the other night.  Salmon I bought in Baz and mushrooms i founf on a mule of mine.<br />
<br />
went 190 to 195.<br />
<br />
I would just rather fish than forage....!<br />
And Salmon is a 2 component combine.  Truffels are a lot more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">and my appologies for turning this thread into a Baking discussion.<br />
<br />
No offence to my fellow anglers was intended!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Forgot to mention that I've had a few fishing droughts myself.<br />
<br />
I always carry 2 stacks of bait with me. (I have the Fisherman's Companion, so worrying about a pole breaking isn't a problem) If I'm fishing somewhere with a vendor nearby, I usually go through at least 3 stacks of bait. The most I ever did in one sitting was about 5 and a half stacks, and that was when I first went to OOT. (I was fishing on Zachariah's island - best fishing spot in the zone, if you're not evil)<br />
<br />
I occasionally fish for Saltwater Seaweed in OOT, and sell it in the Bazaar. I've had occasions where I get a stack or more in an hour, and occasions where I'm lucky if I get 3 an hour. <br />
<br />
Two guildmembers once decided to go fish in OOT (on Sister Isle - second best fishing spot in the zone, if you're not evil) after I talked about fishing in guildchat, and I joined them about 15 minutes later. Both had Fishing skill that was less than half of mine, and they each caught more Seaweed than I did in the time we were all there together! <br />
<br />
Wish I could do that with them again sometime, but they both quit EQ to go play SWG. And one of them was my best customer when I sold food regularly (I sold him a LOT of Truffles and HMPs - at a discount, of course). :(<br />
<br />
You just have to keep hanging in there and hope for the best.</div></div><hr />
