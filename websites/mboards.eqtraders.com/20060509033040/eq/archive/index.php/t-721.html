However I am often on at the time I took your original order (but not long after).<br />
<br />
I have been sending you tells but suspect you were still in bed!<br />
<br />
Anyway due to an unstable server/zones and a lack of chanters when I needed them I have finally got enough for another couple of tries tonight if I can get some bricks enchanted. So far have had enough fails to force me to try and sell some gear to finance more tries. <br />
<br />
Anyway, as a GNOME Cleric 250 Tailor (possibly the worst race to level in Tailoring!) none of these trials would be news to you LOL!<br />
<br />
Anyway the short answer is, I havent forgotten and am still trying, its just that my inventory isnt robust enough to cope with a string of fails for this type of order. It was a bit low anyway due to bad luck on making a bracer 1/13 :p !<br />
<br />
BTW do you know Pippon?<br />
