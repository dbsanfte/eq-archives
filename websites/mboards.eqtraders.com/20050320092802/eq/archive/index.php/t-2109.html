It was working this morning, but for some reason it now crashes after trying to log onto my server from the select screen, never even gets to the loading screen. Anyone else just now having problems?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Traska</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 01:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's funny.  In my experience, it actually works better.  Less video lag, less worries... and a heckuva lot more stable.<br />
<br />
Kudos to SOE  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sumamael</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 04:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imo there is only one reason why I would still use EQW and thats because the gamma setting works with it. The SOE version does not adjust gamma and everything is dark as hell with it in the windowed mode.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Traska</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And again... funny, but my windowed EQ is BRIGHTER than my non-windowed.  At least on my second (bazaar mule) computer... which has a dark as hell monitor to begin with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lonewylfe</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No problems here with my gamma, except that it makes my desktop washed out. Rather have a washed out desktop than a dark eq! Though windowed it does make the text in the chat window a tad blurry, just enough to be annoying though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username"></div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like it, but with windows XP you have to release the mouse every time you want to switch windows...<br />
<br />
You also can't alt-tab, you have to minimize EQ.<br />
<br />
I don't see how this will be possible 2 boxing unless they figure out how to alt-tab between multiple EQ windows.<br />
<br />
Also noticed the text formatting, it does screw it up... you'd think they would have thought of that during the 'test' phase.<br />
<br />
All in all, great for bazaar so I can surf and look things up... but otherwise just a nifty toy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No sympathy for you, sir.   :/<br />
<br />
<br />
I would imagine that there would be other boards for this, especially if EQW has its own message board.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username"></div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whoops, I completely misread the post.<br />
<br />
I thought he was having problems with official EQ in a window, not 3rd party software.<br />
<br />
My above post is dealing with the real thing, never bothered with any 3rd party software.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramlador</div><div class="date">01-12-2003, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wasn't really asking for any help, just curious if anyone else was having the problem. As it had already been mentioned on the EQW board, I didn't repost there. Apparently it was a problem with EQ resetting a display value in eqclient.ini. Between that fix and the new version of EQW, everything is fine now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laureana</div><div class="date">01-12-2003, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My computer freezes with the new eq windowed mode :\ After hitting alt + enter it went into window mode but the window was completely black except for the top bar where the buttons to minimize were, I couldn't click the button to minimize or X out of the program because my cursor wasnt showing up lol. Had to manually turn off my computer to restart it then edit my ini file to turn off the window mode. Don't know about the 3rd party version, Ive never dared tried it on my computer, it barely runs EQ as it is hehe</div></div><hr />
