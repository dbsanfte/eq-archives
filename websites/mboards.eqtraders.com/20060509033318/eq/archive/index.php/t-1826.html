Storm rider skins I see regularly in the bazaar, the rest I haven't seen.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you are getting any of this stuff in workable quantities and we can talk trades.<br />
<br />
Bartox, if you are getting this stuff, I'll be happy to trade massive quantities of enchanted clay.</div></div><hr />

this stuff drops but not common.. so dont expect stacks =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe.. no, we can share. More Bartox to go around. As for the supplies, I haven't been touching the leather armors myself, because I can't gauge whether any of the pieces are good or not. I'd probably have to have a high level druid to really tell. That, and temper components are hard to find. You are right that storm rider skins are pretty common to find. The same goes for the storm rider blood and even electrified copper. All of those I have plenty of but the limiting factor for silks comes down to the ent sap and the storm volass hair. For the leathers, it will be the temper components. I shouldn't say that the sandstorm pearl is too rare, since I have a fair amount of the powdered sandstorm pearls &lt;boy was I happy when 3 sandstorm pearls combined into 4 powdered sandstorm pearls&gt;. It's those drops of pure rain. I've had a lot of problems getting my hands on them as they drop in the east barracks in BoT and the only person who I've seen really collecting them has been hanging onto them for some armor pieces. I'm sure there is some out there to purchase, but I never even see the stuff in the bazaar. Good luck to you though and let me know if any of the leather pieces are worth it.<br />

PoStorms is where you get ent saps and vorlass hairs.</div></div><hr />

Mainly for the silk stuff at the moment though, as I'd like a couple of pieces for Ilona; and an extra blood to make the spell for a druid friend whose arm I can then twist to imbue for me  :twisted:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyrdlan</div><div class="date">01-06-2003, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I don't CARE what you are all looking for!<br />

<br />
<br />
Seriously though, there is no reason we can't work together.  The main joy of making this stuff is, well, making it.  The target market is beastlords, by the way, not druids for the leathers.  Prying druids out of Elysian is difficult at best.<br />
<br />
The nice thing about POP recipes is often you can get multiple subcombines from one component set, so there is no real reason we can't put up and share around to get a couple combines each.<br />
<br />
If you are interested, let me know.</div></div><hr />

Cenyen, send Ilona or Gwenae a tell next time you get something you don't know what is for, please!  I'm used to getting tells saying &quot;Is this X for anything?&quot; :D</div></div><hr />
