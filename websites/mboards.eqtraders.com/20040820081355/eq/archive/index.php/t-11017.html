<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>yawp64</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Howdy, Fellow Fisherfolk,<br />
<br />
I have two different characters who are aspiring fishermen (well, one's an aspiring fisher-froglok and the other is an aspiring fisher-halfelf, but I digress...). Both characters have fishing skill levels of 50+. After trawling through the fishing recipes from this site, I realized I had the mob-dropped components for a stack of Giant Bloodsucker Treble Fly (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=2558&amp;menustr=080050000000). Wouldn't it be fun to hand those to my fellow fishing guildies! So, I bought a tackle box and got to work.<br />
<br />
To my surprise, not one combine produced the fishing lure. 20 combines failed. Assuming the trivial is correct, I should have gotten 1 failure and 19 successes.<br />
<br />
Has anybody else run into trouble with the lures? I tried only one recipe, so my experience with this is limited.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

As for the high failure rate... blame the RNG... try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dahna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Giant Bloodsucker Fly line has indeed a high failure rate compared to the others (as well as fire wing flies /sigh). Tried at 26 44 55 160 and 200 and it was usually 1 / 4 tries.</div></div><hr />
