Last day or so, I've been getting time outs trying to get to  tinkering.org.  Anyone else have same problem?  Are they down for some reason?</div></div><hr />

Kritta, the gnome who ran tinkering.org has laid down her toolbox for other venues in RL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kritta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">*chuckle* Um... kinda, but not really.<br />
<br />
The site is run by Kredal. He owns it and the domain name. I just did my best to keep it updated and so on. I haven't worked on it for awhile and know no more then you do... that it does appear down. <br />
<br />
I sent an email to Kredal asking what's &quot;up&quot; and I'll post here when I find out. <br />
<br />
Thank you, please drive through. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kritta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok, here's the general scoop.<br />
<br />
tinkering.org, runs on host<br />
host talks to kredal's old email account<br />
no message came due to email account incorrectness<br />
i alert kredal, kredal notices, kredal talks to said host<br />
kredal will get back to me<br />
<br />
;) Krit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kritta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Kredal has all but retired and I've decided to keep tinkering.org up and running for as long as it remains fun. ;)<br />
<br />
The site is up and running. Please alert me to any problems, but all should be well.<br />
<br />
Thanks much.<br />

<br />
I adopted tinkering.org back at my last duty station, and used my work email address as the point of contact for the webhost.  When I cut all ties to my old base, including changing banks, and dropping the credit card attached to it, my webhost tried to send me emails saying &quot;hey, we can't get your money&quot;, and later &quot;hey, we couldn't get your money&quot;, and after that &quot;hey, you haven't paid us, so we're shutting down your site&quot;.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I never got any of those emails, so I thought everything was hunky-dory.  Silly me.  After being alerted by Kritta that the site was down, I talked to the web host, and luckily they had kept all of the database information intact, and was just waiting to hear from me.  Whew!  So, I told them that I was in fact alive, but that someone else (Kritta) would be taking over the site, and paying for it and stuff.  Last night, she was able to do that, and tinkering.org is back up and running, with no loss of data or anything.  Horray!<br />
<br />
Sorry for the interruption of service.  (:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bebinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">well at least it got straightened out with no loss of data.    It would be a crime to lose all that hard work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Knowing next to nothing about web hosting, would it be prudent/possible to archive all of this lovely information, on the off change Kritta decides that it is no longer fun in the future?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kredal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes, it is quite possible, and I'm sure Kritta will be doing that the first chance she gets.  (:  Both of us were panicing when we realized that the DB stuff might all be poofed.  Luckily, it wasn't.  This time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kritta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">After this weekend (out of town), Easter weekend and then the weekend of the 17th (I'm a bridesmaid for the 5th time, bleh) and things start to settle down I'll see what I can do. :)</div></div><hr />

Kritta - thanks for the time and money you are going to further put into it.</div></div><hr />
