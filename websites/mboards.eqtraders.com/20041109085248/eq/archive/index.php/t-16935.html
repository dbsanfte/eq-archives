I clicked on the first link , then started looking from the beginning, it hooked me and I am still trying to get throught the entire archives :)<br />
Only on July 2 2003 so I better get to cracking :)</div></div><hr />

The crossovers ( QoW &amp; S*P) are lots of fun :)<br />

Just as the Spork (tm) is suitable for gouging out your eyes in the face of l33tsp34k, the Spoon(tm) has a similar function when it comes to work-related annoyances Work or Spoon (http://www.workorspoon.com/default.asp)</div></div><hr />

um, whee. <br />
Do not read the original linked comic if you have a(n unbelivably) weak stomach for blood and 'gory images', and are eating. <br />
<br />
I need some bleach now... I'm still hungry and that face is in my head.... <br />

Sorry.  Several years of dedicated gaming, esp of FPS Gaming means I have read so much and listen to it so often, I've finally gotten the &quot;j00r 1337 5p34k 1z /\/0VV 250!!!111  VV007 !!111!1OMGWTHBBQ&quot;  (Translation: Your 'leet speak is now 250!  Woot!)<br />
<br />
I suppose given how much it's growing, 1337 5p34k might someday have real language purpose...<br />
