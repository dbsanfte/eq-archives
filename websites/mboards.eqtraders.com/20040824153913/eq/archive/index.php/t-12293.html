<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Iangolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After 16...countem 16 stacks of 20 ceramic, large, wood, field I have not leveled up from 186...not once...here is the strange thing too...I have not failed in making the arrows...not once either...<br />
     Am I just in the middle of an unbelivable run of bad rolls or have I goofed on the recipe(I have not recieved a trivial message if I have) by the way my wis is usually around 140, using a grelock as well when fletching.<br />
<br />
     Any suggestions or theories would be welcomed.  <br />
                                                                                Thanks<br />

DID I MENTION 16 STACKS????!!!!!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Iangolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Great...so Im not wrong in thinking that is crazy, this is not over one session, this just through parsing my log over the last four days...the recipe that I am using Large nocks, ceramic vanes, field points and wood shafts have done me well over the last 6 points...so its not the recipe is it?.  <br />
     Has anyone else ever hit or heard of hitting such a lag in skill-ups pre 200s??  And if not what should I do...I have my logs...should I petition to make sure nothing is bugged?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">135 picnic combines for a skillup at 194 i think.  your is bigger though but i had 255 int.  get your wisdom up some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Iangolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok so get my wisdom up...Ive always heard that is my primary concern...but just to make sure a I have all my bases covered...what about INT or DEX.  <br />
Just out of curiosity where do you guys normally like to have your wisdom sitting at when you hunker down for a fletching session?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Quikpick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Doesn't matter whether it's wisdom or int. It uses the higher value for determining skillups. Not sure if fletching uses dex for this check as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">dex is a secondary stat.  it can be used on flecthing if higher than int and wis.  rangers were getting screwed makuing arrows.  my int is always 255 for combines unless i forget to change out of my merchant mugs from selling.  then its about 234.  <br />
<br />
wis at 140 is really bad for skillups.  what is your dex at?  you can get buffs for dex easier than wisdom.  might make a skilling suit for tradeskills.  gear that isn't wonderful but is just to boost the stat.  if you do other skills as well go ahead and get wisdom up instead of dex.  if just flecthing dex might be easier/cheaper to raise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Galain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I feel for you.  I had several runs of over 300 combines without a skill up, but it was in tailoring.  So at least you know you are not alone.</div></div><hr />

Thanks E...ok here is where I sit <br />
STR    167, DEX    117, WIS    141, INT    107 unbuffed, so ideally go buy WIS gear...think I have a forrest loop in the bank and pick up a KEI before I fletch...any other suggestions?  Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">emerald dragonscale tunic is 5k on my server.  thats 20 wis lol.  <br />
<br />
this has been done before quite extensively.  many threads with suggestions.  <br />
<br />
link (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=12196) from the general thread.  look for your diety stuff.  velium jasper is 7 wis each finger.  velium ruby vail is 8 wis face.  polished quartz jewelry gives int/wis/ac/mana i think 8 with the velium neck peice.  might make a magelo and look for upgrades.<br />
<br />
edit.  can be more specific if i know class/race/god<br />
<br />
and &quot;wis at 140 is really bad for skillups.&quot;  i dont like how that sounds.  for a non caster that is pretty impressive.  for most normal casters that is a good start.  erudites can start naked with 142 int.  i get a little spoiled with others at 100 wis/int.  40 points is a lot.  also had lots of help with gear.  sometimes i sound harsher than i mean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I slowed way down in the mid-180s.  Not 16 stacks worth, but I reacted by focusing on boosting my wisdom.  I went from 180-ish, to 255 (with KEI) and the rate of skill up went way up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Iangolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ok...got my wis up into the 180s....moving again...up to 192...shew...oh by the way 55 ranger wood elf Tunare....that is with KEI...any suggestions for fishing for better wisdom buffs with lower  durations...lots of chanters in my guild</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Only better wis buff if voq (voice of quellious).  It'll add 3 more wis, and it lasts roughly 1/3rd as long as kei (from the same chanter).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">could use dex to skillup for fletching and i think jc.  not for any other tradeskills but can use it for those.  reason i metnion is cause the dex buffs are bigger and tend to stack more.  just an alternative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I am a halfling rogue and with my tradeskilling suit and KEI on my wisdom is at 258.  I'm *desperately* trying to get it up a bit more but there just isn't much else that I can wear that has more wisdom.  I may need to bit the bullet and shell the big bucks for those extra couple of points...  Ah well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">link a magelo and you can get suggestions on what to wear/get.  for fletching a high level shamman could buff your dex pretty amazing.  might get the chanter buff too to see if its stacks with.  think shammies get a 100 pt dex buff post 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mathaetaes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I could be wrong (I'm not a big tradeskiller), but I was told that they made strength a determining factor for skillups as well, since all the warriors were whining.  When I do my tradeskills, I have my shammy friend buff me to 255 str and then rock... I noticed a significant increase in skillup frequency when I did this... but I suppose it could just be the placebo effect.  Am I on crack?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Oualawouzou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Mat, STR is only affecting skill-ups for Smithing.  Like DEX only affects Fletching.<br />
<br />
And 140ish DEX isn't so bad for skill-ups, at least up to 189.  I average one skill-up every stack and a half to two stacks.  Gotta raise some more funds to breach the 200 barrier. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">hehe spent 800pp the other day on 80 combines of the best non-acrylia arrows.  if i am using the good stuff anyway i can use all good stuff.  then sold for 10pp a stack till i realized a stack was 20 and not 10 and at 1pp per arrow to make that hurts quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mathaetaes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Oual - hmm.. maybe my dex was buffed by the same shammy buff that did strength.. or maybe I just thought I was getting more frequent skillups.  Next time, I'll focus on maxing out dex before attempting my next round. <br />
<br />
As far as my recommendation for increasing a stat... I'd recommend utilizing the melee buff related to the skill, and making a tradeskill suit to fit that.   <br />
In my ignorance, I made a suit that maxed out strength, spending MAYBE (probably much less than) 1k in the bazaar on items that had lots of str, but not much else.  I don't think it'd be hard to find dex items the same way... Most melees go for AC, strength and stamina primarily, then dex as a secondary if necessary.  Buying items with low AC/STR/STAM but lots of dex should be fairly cheap... and these, combined with a shammy buff should max you out easily.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, many casters tend towards ignoring all stats but their mana affecting ones (at least until they've maxed out wis), so int and wis gear may cost a little more for the same increase.  Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">also if you are doing more than one skill int/wis work for all.  str is just smithing and dex is just fletching.</div></div><hr />
