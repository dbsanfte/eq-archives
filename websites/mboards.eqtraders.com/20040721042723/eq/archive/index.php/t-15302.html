<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>garet allenon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i've read a couple of threads about people farming excellent sabertooth hides in Loio and OT...does anyone know about the drop rate in Trak's Teeth? the mobs are going to be a bit tougher, hence less killed total, but does anyone have any info on whether it's worth it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't remember seeing any sabertooths in traks teeth, ever.  You might mean Emerald Jungle, but the cats aren't all that common, and visibility is low in both zones anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Corii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">IMO the sabretooth tigers in Trak's Teeth are too rare to make it a viable farming spot.  You have to run around and find them with tracking while trying to avoid the frogloks that aggro and seem to be everywhere.  With the 30 or so tigers I have killed in TT I have not found any excellent hides, only regular.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I'm desperate enough to farm for exc sabers, I got to LOIO because  everything is such low level. I head to the big field in front of the observatory and aggro every single mob I can find and then AE them. By the time I'm done looting, they've mostly respawned, rinse, repeat.<br />

Doing that for an hour usually nets me 1 or 2 excellents.</div></div><hr />
