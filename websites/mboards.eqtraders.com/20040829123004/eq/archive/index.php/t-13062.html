<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>samoyed1958</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well after a 2 year break from EQ... I came back in december and got my lvl 18 gnome out of the closet.. my question is.. is it worth it to even try to start tinkering now I'm flat broke just tryin to get use to eq again is hard right now.. looked at some of the threads here and to have the pp to even start is going to take weeks... ponders just doing baking and other skills first</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spektor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you want to start a tradeskill with next to no money, brewing is the way to go.  You can probably get it to 250 with under 1000pp and then start making alot of money of Kaladim Constitutionals, but if you plan on tinkering, do brewing on another character since you require AA's to do a second tradeskill over 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tinkering doesn't count as one of the primary 7 trades, so, you CAN get brewing, and tinkering up to 250 on one character without AA's. Poisonmaking is another one that can go to 250 independently of AA's.<br />
<br />
So, a Gnome Rogue, theoretically speaking, could get both Tinkering and Poisonmaking AND one of the primary tradeskills (brewing, smithing etc.) all up to 250 without AA's.<br />
<br />
That said, I got my wizard to 250 brewing, AND a corking device for less than 800 pp. That's paying cost for the corker though. Had a friend make it for me.<br />
<br />
So, to fund your tinkering, brewing is probably a good idea.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

Not sure which server you are on, but if you're around E'Ci gimme a hollar. :)</div></div><hr />
