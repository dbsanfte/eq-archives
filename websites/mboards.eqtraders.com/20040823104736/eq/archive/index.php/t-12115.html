     First off i just wanna say that i have been using Eq Traders for weeew Several years now and it has always helped me greatly and this is teh first time i have registered to post threads on teh message board yes it has taken me this long lol.  But what i wanted to ask, after i searched teh site for a E-Mail address lol whichi understand why it's not posted is, I have noticed that the recipes are linked by Expansion, For years i have wasted paper printing up the Recipe pages by Each trade and wanted to update my HUGE 3 ring binder lol and really don't wanna print them out by Expansion and was woundering if you would be creating a &quot;COMPLETE&quot; link which combines all the recipes of each trade skill so we can print them all up at once.  I was jsut curious + i wanted to leave my mark on the Message board lol.  Thanks for your time and hope to hear from ya soon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">May I suggest that you create the list, and the post it here for us, perhaps? I know that Denmum and the Scary Ogre have more then a metric TON on their plate right now.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that if you were to make such a list, than others would find it quite useful. I doubt that EQtraders has the time for it anytime soon, though.<br />
<br />
Also, I will add my recently created disclaimer:<br />
<br />
Then again, I do not in any way speak for the mods or admins of EQTC. <br />

Thanks for the post and the idea.  With the recent server hard drive melt-down, we're a bit tapped out resource-wise.  Even before that, things were pretty stretched here just keeping up with the day to day things.  <br />
<br />
At this time, we're not taking sugguestions for new features.  As soon as we're able to work on new features, we'll ask people for ideas.  Until then, keep a note. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aditionally.<br />
<br />
Any such list if GENERATED... will time out.<br />
<br />
If created Statically... it will be out of date within a day or two.<br />
<br />
The time out issue may be my fault.  I will admit to being a novice programer.  I tought myself PHP and MySQL just two weeks before I started on the site.  I am sure some of the people helping me were pulling out their hair at my &quot;newbieness&quot;.<br />
<br />
We have no plans of creating a static link.<br />
<br />
Aditionally... That would be a bandwaidth nightmare... because we would have silly people not just go to it for printing, but constantly accessing it for looking up one recipe... a HUGE waste of bandwidth.  A waste of bandwidth we frankly cannot afford.</div></div><hr />
