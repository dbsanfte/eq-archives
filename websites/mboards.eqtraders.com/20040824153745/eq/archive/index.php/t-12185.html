<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zumbenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">To simplify my shawl quest work, about a week before the crash I had printed out darn near every recipe page, tradeskill guide page and the shawl quest pages (none of the item location info tho, always ran back to eqtraders when I couldn't find something).  <br />
<br />
So if the hard drive recovery doesn't work, I have this info available and am willing to help you get it back into the database.<br />
<br />
FYI, we've used Ontrack Data Recovery services many times for a variety of failed drives and optical media.  It's amazing how much that they can recover for $2k to $4k.<br />
<br />
And I also want to say thanks for all the hard work by everybody I don't know :) for making eqtraders a resource available to all us tradeskillers.</div></div><hr />
