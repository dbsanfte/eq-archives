<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GreysLuclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In Cobalt Scar, the Othmir all talk about sharing a bowl of spicy clam chowder.  Has anyone ever tried to make this?  I tried a few basic combines, 2 or 3 clams, some algae spices (purchased right there), and a bowl, but no complex ones (no snapper oil, water, etc).  I don't know if it would be faction only, or exp, or just a quest starter for something, or if it is just game color.  Any ideas?  I will go try a few things later.<br />

<br />
The only potatoes in-game are foraged from an LDON dungeon, iirc, so I doubt it would have a potato in it.<br />
<br />
My guess is that its just flavor-text, and not an actual quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Elinea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Going by real life chowder, New England clam chowder has potatoes....but its not spicy either (at least not the kinds I've ever had). Now, the Manhattan clam chowder, which is red sauce based, doesn't have potatoes and I could see that concievably being spicy. I don't think anything tomato-ey (or something like it) exists in game either though, does it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naeadiene Needsamap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Othimir food merchant sells clam chowder.  I've seen the text you're talking about and wondered myself.  (especially when we were all trying to find the hot sauce recipe)<br />
<br />
It's not uncommon for people to put tabasco in their chowder, that maybe where it would get the spice.</div></div><hr />
