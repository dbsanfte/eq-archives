<br />
<br />
Pending approval from a Mod, I'll join in with some helpful hints.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verdandi</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The tricky thing with these is that as soon as a site gets well known it gets shut down.  So, by definition you are very unlikely to find a &quot;good site&quot;.  I have a friend who used to find them by doing searches on an hourly basis for chunks of time here and there.  Even at that rate it sometimes took him weeks to find a search result that hadn't already been shut down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you OWN the machine, and OWN teh game you want to emulate on your PC, it is legal, otherwise it is not.<br />
<br />
So lets not put any public links here.</div></div><hr />

As far as I know, it's still working too, although it's not been plugged in for years.</div></div><hr />
