<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tricsun</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 11:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any suggestions on getting some skill ups, that doesn't include Acrylia armor and the horrific drop rates on the windstones?  I know, i can get to 188 with Fine Plate BPs, but after that, it's acrylia, cultural (low dwarf cultural), or shadowscream.  Shadowscream seems to be the cheapest way, but farming the No-drop ingredients is very time consuming, as a warrior at least, who doesn't have those nifty AE nukes, and getting the right mobs up on the Grimling islands is kinda iffy.  Any other ideas?<br />
Thanks much.</div></div><hr />

Sorry but thats it.<br />
Do the fineplate, it is increadibly easier then any other option as you only have to farm/buy the padding.  Everything else is merchant sold.  If plat is a big problem then stop tradeskills and ding up a bit or just farm for shadowscream.  From the sound of it i would recomend dinging.  It is amazing how much 100 plat seemed to me a while ago but now I wish i could do vendor bought skillups at 100p per combine.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but thats it for you.  With any luck the dwarven plate market will not be ruined on your server like it is on mine and you may actually be able to make money, as it is now on Zeb, if it isn't BD or PoP then it is realy hard to make a dime off of smithing.</div></div><hr />

Smithing won't make you any money.  I'm doing it because I can.</div></div><hr />

You mention that you are a Dwarf, dependant on your level I would suggest that you go to Skyfire and hunt for Lava rocks and The Hole for Murcury. Then all that is left is to get yourself an enchanter to enchant Brelium. If you buy the spell and only ask for say 10 or 15 bricks to be enchanted most chanted will help you out. <br />
<br />
Stock pile folded sheets and rings (they both stack) then when you feel that the RNG will be good to you spend the time smithing. <br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

And plat, still, is definitely a problem.  Warriors, as most know, aren't really a solo class, and without my clicky BP, i'm kinda S.O.L. there.</div></div><hr />
