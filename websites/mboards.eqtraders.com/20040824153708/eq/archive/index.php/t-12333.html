<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>QuteCleric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I came on the brewing scene much later than most people that post and investigate the mysteries of Brodder Foamybugs :rolleyes: ... Anyway, there are a few contradictory posts in regards to Brodder's Diaries that I'm confused about...<br />
In the translation posted on the boards, it states that they are written in gnomish(being a gnomish cleric I could read them in game no problem so didn't really question what language they were in) however a few other posts state that Iglan in kaladim sold the diary pages written in common.... As Iglan is the only one mentioned to sell the pages throughout the site(and they aren't even listed on allakhazam), the following questions come to mind that if anyone could answer I'd be happy! :)<br />
<br />
1.) Which language are the books Iglan sells in?<br />
2.) If they are common, was the original reference to books written in Gnomish false? or were they translated in some patch?<br />
3.) If they are common and were always common but versions existed that were written in gnomish, who sold them or how did one get them?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gnomes don't like me very much, starting with the fact that I am an Iksar and ending with the fact that the silly gnome mage in Crushbone kept assisting the Taskmaster and had to be killed.  So I don't know if they are sold in Ak'Anon or in gnomish.<br />
<br />
However I *DID* find all the known volumes in one of the merchants in BBM.  As you exit Kaladim, hang a left like you're going to the PoK book, he's in one of the buildings you pass.  It is written in common (or at least some language I have mastered, and I have not begun training in Gnomish yet).<br />
<br />
So I can confirm that the books ARE sold over by Kaladim off of a dwarven merchant and are not in Gnomish.  I don't know if they are also sold in Ak'Anon and written in Gnomish due to faction issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>QuteCleric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for answering one of my questions Quichon, now I just need to know where the intial fact that they were written in Gnomish comes from...<br />
<br />
Qutie!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>astianax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i believe the original story was that the diaries were penned by (or for) brodder's gnomish friend that he mentions a lot of his stories. and that after they'd been in the game for a while, the dwarves finally got off their lazy butts and decided that gnomes couldn't be the ones getting rich off the discoveries of one of their own<br />
<br />
but, since i also got into the brewing thing late,  and am also despised by gnomes, i couldn't verify this<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>QuteCleric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's all good and fine and all but if you read:<br />
<br />
http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=21<br />
<br />
It says specifically that he learned gnomish to read them.... where'd that come from?<br />
<br />
Qutie!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Filur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Its Froni that learned gnomish to translate them. Not Brodder. the diarys are supposed to be penned by Brodders Gnomish friend Catbik Tinkerton :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>QuteCleric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I never implied Brodder did, the fact that Foni had to learn gnomish to translate the diaries means they were written in gnomish, where are the gnomish copies found, if anywhere?<br />
<br />
Qutie!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brodder FoamyMugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No I wrote my own diaries. <br />
 Not Catbik.<br />
 But since catbik was with me for nearly all of our adventures, he n I came to an agreement. The gnomes would publish my diaries...<br />
 Of course gnomes have to tinker with everything to improve it...<br />
 Generous demonstrations of their fate should they alter my recipes on kobolds and minotaurs convinced them that this was a good suspension of that cultural policy.<br />
 But it didn't prevent them from translating the books into gnomish.<br />
<br />
that's all there's to it.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>QuteCleric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aye, but no one has yet to understand my question :P<br />
<br />
Froni said he had to learn gnomish to read your books<br />
Ignan sells books written in common<br />
<br />
WHERE are the books written in gnomish?<br />
<br />
Qutie!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>astianax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">methinks the gnome wants to keep the money circulating in her hometown hole in the wall.<br />
<br />
only options i could see for the gnomish versions would be ak'anon/steamfont, sol a (highly unlikely), and, depending on when they were 'discovered' the iceclad gnomes or somewhere in shadowhaven<br />
and there is a possibility the dwarves leaned on the gnomes to stop selling their version of the recipes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>QuteCleric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes I agree to all those posibilities but have yet to find them anywhere, and the fact that they existed in game at one point or another in Gnomish and gnomish ONLY, SOMEONE has to know, now stop being so quiet and just tell me!<br />
:mad:  :D <br />

This is the identify message when cast on the Pages from Brodders Diary I sold by Iglan Thranon (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=208) in Butcherblock. Identify has the nice side effect of telling you what language a text is written in :)<br />
<br />
This brings up another good point, it seems to me like all written texts in the game appear to be broken now in that they are readable by anyone and not just those with high language skill. Spoken languages are the same as they always were, but I am able to read the diaries (written in Gnomish) with a 0 skill in that language. I can remember this as far back as the PoP release, anyone have a longer in game memory than I do?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>KanadWinterstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Alright, the more I think about it now the more it bugs me :P<br />
<br />
All written texts in the game I have tried are readable by me, and I have only the following language skills:<br />
<br />
Common  100<br />
Barbarian 100<br />
Elder Elvish 15<br />
Elvish 13<br />
Dark Elvish 13<br />
<br />
Some examples of things I've tried to read since I first noticed this:<br />
<br />
the Dusty Kobold scrolls dropped by Lorekeeper Roggik (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=6431) in the Warrens<br />
<br />
the Tanned Splitpaw Hide dropped by gnolls in South Karana<br />
<br />
all the Liber Brassica Felix books I could find... I can verify volumes 2,3,5 and 6 that I went out and recollected last night.<br />
<br />
I can read all these texts, despite my undeveloped language skills.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the Liber Brassica Felix volumes, anyone know if the Grobb and Skyshrine books are still sold? I looked in skyshrine last night and was unable to find volume 4. Shame if those two are lost to the in game world from the zone revamps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>QuteCleric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hmm... based on this it would appear that languages for texts in game is broken for the time being, thank you for investigating this :) Still home for the holiday and unable to get into the actual game :-/<br />
<br />
Qutie!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>astianax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">it is rather not fun that read languages seem broken. i just pray that it's not another way of dumbing the game down...<br />
<br />
as for the liber brassica felix books, i've not heard of those before...have you searched for the grobb one in neriak (or had someone do it for you)?</div></div><hr />

It was some time ago but when they revamped CT the books there were in another language and if you didn't have the skill you got gibberish when reading them.<br />
<br />
So somewhere between then and now it was broken.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>KanadWinterstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">astianax: http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q123&amp;menustr=120010000000 The books I'm referring to are the source text for the Protection of the Cabbage quest. each volume 2-9 is written in a different and obscure language, such as Orcish (vol. 3) and Old Erudian (vol. 6). Part of the puzzle for that one was translating the books so that the recipies could be known... but now anyone can read them.<br />
<br />
Good one Veldin... hadn't been to CT after it was revamped until just recently so i didn't have that reference. I know that all the books I have collected from there recently have been readable to me, just like everything else I've tried.<br />
<br />
Actually I don't mind it being this way, it has saved me making language training mules for my main character, and saves all of us the points to train in the obscure guildmaster only languages. It was never announced though, and to my knowledge never acknowledged... and that part of it does bother me.</div></div><hr />
