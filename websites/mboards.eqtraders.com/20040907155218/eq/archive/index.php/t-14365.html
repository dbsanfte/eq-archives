<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>talamariv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not sure if this is a bug or if I missed an update, but I was trying to do Tae Ew Shield Combines in SH and got, &quot;this forge can only be used by Barbarians.&quot; <br />
<br />
It was only when using the new UI.  If I did the combine the old fashioned way (experiment) it worked fine.<br />
<br />
Bug, or am I missing something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Were you trying to make the recipe from your favorites?  Favorite recipes have been prone to corruption after patches.  Normally, you can just remove the recipe from favorite, search again, and re-add it to fix the problem.  Devs know about this one and are working on it.<br />
<br />
If you searched and found the recipe that way, and still got the Barbarian message, then that is a different bug.  /bug it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Glinlor Stormweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think they think they are culter forges.. As it said Only a Oger could use it... They made a boo boo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shadow Haven doesn't have cultural forges.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Glinlor Stormweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes...I know that... Thats why they are buged=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ErikModi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is far more widespread then just Shadowhaven.  The Freeport ones all said Barbarian, and the one in PoK near Zosran Hammertail said Ogre.  I did manage to get it going again from the solution posted previously, but this is still a bloody serious bug that needs to be fixed.<br />
<br />
And this is part me venting.</div></div><hr />
