<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all-<br />
<br />
Next time you get a chance, please /bug and /feedback about the chisel split ore recipes being bugged.  I.e. splitting a block of xyz ore with a chisel results in ONE large brick, instead of two.  Ditto for lg brick-&gt; small brick.  Very old bug, cause by the game &quot;poofing&quot; the identical 2nd item on your cursor... doesn't happen if the result item is stackable.<br />
<br />
I know that this is an old, known issue, but there's a number of ways they could fix it (i.e. have block = lg brick, small brick, and 2 pieces, lg brick = small brick + 2 pieces, etc.).  Very annoying to have a block yield the same number of pieces as a small brick does...<br />
<br />
Also, the new UI &quot;autoinventory&quot; function doesn't properly reset a returned item (like a chisel, file, hammer, etc) for re-use.  Have to manually re-inventory them to make the UI recognise that the tool is there, also very annoying...<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree the ore conversion sucks, and I've /bug'd it about a million times of the last couple years...<br />
<br />
However, the new UI DOES indeed autoinventory things like files, hammers, dairy spoons etc...<br />
<br />
It doesn't green it in the display, but you can combine again if you've inventoried it. This is more of a minor &quot;get to it when we can&quot; kinda bug, since the recipe's work. I've done a few hundred combines that returned hammer, file, dairy spoon, and corking device since it went live and they do work.<br />
<br />
Happy Tradeskilling. :)</div></div><hr />

When I was doing a run of small velium bricks -&gt; small pieces (which uses and returns a chisel), and some other combine needing&amp;returning a file (velium rings maybe?), when I autoinventoried it via the button on the tradeskill UI it did green in the display.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you use the button on the tradeskill UI, it will green it back out; if, however, you're like me and have a hotkey for /autoinventory (faster to hit a key with the other hand than move the mouse and click again) it will not green it out (as well as if you have multiple items on the cursor, the item graphic will not change to the current item on the cursor when you use /autoinventory)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorvari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/Autoinv is bugged slightly in that it puts things into inventory from the top of the stack down, while using the auto-inventory area in the Inventory window or the button in the tradeskill window put things in from the bottom up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arghargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">None of the tools I've used with the new UI reset back to green when I autoinventory them.  However, since the combine button still works even with the tool highlighted in red, I don't worry about it.  I have /bugged it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tanker posted elsewhere on the boards that the red/green highlight bug is a simple one due to not checking for items in inventory when you use auto-inventory.  He said it should be fixed with the next major patch.</div></div><hr />
