<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sinuuyanea Nocturne</div><div class="date">01-01-2003, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The main site (www.eqtraders.com) has all of the information you need.</div></div><hr />

Can you point it out for me? Just the location of its drop, not what it's used for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balkin</div><div class="date">01-02-2003, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the link to the POP section of the recipes.<br />
<br />
I personally didn't look for Planar Steel, but I assume you mean the sheets from each plane.<br />
<br />
Regardless, this is what there is, so good luck.<br />
<br />
http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_PoP.htm<br />
<br />
If you mean from Cazic Thule, then try this one for information<br />
<br />
http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_cazicthule.htm<br />
<br />
Note, these are both linked form the &quot;Recipe's&quot; section, on the main page, where all recipe's can be found.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naito</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If what you're looking for is &quot;what mobs do I kill to get xxxxx&quot;, I'm afraid that you won't find it on the recipes page.<br />
<br />
While there IS information on where to get the looted items for normal smithing tempers here (http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_temper.htm), there is no corresponding description for the Planes (that I have seen).<br />
<br />
Perhaps if we ask purty please, and have someone volunteer to track, collate, and present the data, Denmom might add such a page to the site.  Given how much effort this site takes just to keep running, I would not want to burden them with trying to put that together themselves.<br />

There is no such thing as planar steel; however, there is such a thing as Nightmare Iron, Electrified Copper, Immaculate Steel, Bricks of Ethereal Energy, etc.  And, if information such as what drops the item, or what the item makes, isnt listed on the site, it hasnt been reported yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naito</div><div class="date">01-06-2003, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah.<br />
<br />
The one place I did NOT look for drop information was the &quot;trade supplies&quot; link.<br />
<br />
Why?  Because last I looked, there WAS no drop information there.  It was all &quot;find x on merchant y&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thank you for pointing out this (relatively) new resource to me.<br />
