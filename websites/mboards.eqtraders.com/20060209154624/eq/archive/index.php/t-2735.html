<br />
Since the current market is still in pricing frenzy, I figured I'd post what items I'm looking for, and hope I can get a sane price on some of it.<br />
<br />
Things I Need / Want<br />
<br />
Tae Ew Blood Vials<br />
Midnight Stones<br />
Nightmare Mephit Blood<br />
Fetid Slime<br />
CHEAP Windstones<br />
CHEAP Blocks of Acrylia<br />
49+ Enchanter willing to enchant a few bricks of Mithril<br />
<br />
<br />
My current skill levels are listed in the sticky above, if you would like to trade some of the above for my services, or if you would like something combined, let me know  8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilosh</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to add that if you saw Caldyen's post, and thought<br />
<br />
&quot;Darn, he only needs Blocks?!?!  Who can I sell these small pieces and small bricks to?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then look no further. I am your man.<br />
<br />
Like caldyen, I am not looking to pay Bazaar prices.  I must stress the word &quot;CHEAP&quot;, like he did.<br />
<br />
At most, I will pay 25p per small piece, and 50p per small brick. I would prefer to pay less, but life is not always fair.<br />
<br />
<br />
And caldyen, if you wish I will send a smoke signal to my friendly neighborhood Level 51 Enchanter, and see if she can pencil you in.  No promises, but she is quite friendly, and a Koala Dal, as well.   So she may want to help you out.<br />

<br />
Thanks Noish!<br />
<br />
I always feel bad about asking people to enchant the metal for me, but I've got 3 whole BDs burning a hole in my bank, and I just know if I try that cultural, I'll get to see the 'lacked the skill' message that I've grown to love.<br />
<br />
 :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilosh</div><div class="date">01-24-2003, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you just need her to enchant mithril three times, no?<br />
<br />
Or would it be six?<br />
<br />
I have been having a hard time finding her in game, so I may have to fire off an e-mail to her.<br />
