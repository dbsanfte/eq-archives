<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">went to investigate an othmir shellfish collector the other day while fishing.  found two on the ground.  went back later and found 3.  appears the collector collects them if nobody else does.  either that or a very weird druid is swimming into the ocean and leaving very select droppings in a pile.  dont have loc but when the collector is in the water by the bloogy camp could someone else check to see if they spawn for them.  respawn is apparently a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moonlilly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its quite possible you were near a fishing druid that was jsut invis so the only thing you saw was his remains.  Lots of druids that have blown their faction with the othmir hide while they fish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">didn't see druid in zone.  wasn't alone though so might be.  will check again tonight.  if there again i think something is up.  will see invis this time though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ChaseFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Rangers, bards, all Feir`Dal, and all Iksar also get foraging (rangers and bards it's class ability, Feir`Dal and Iksar are racial (capped at 50 unless they are a ranger, druid or bard)). Any of the above could have been fishing, or working at the brewbarrel or oven there by Bloogy, and dropping unwanted forages on the ground.<br />
<br />
But by far the worst offenders are dr00ds, thus are such found forages often referred to as dr00d droppings.<br />
<br />
Chase<br />
Ranger<br />
Who would never, ever, drop a sell-able forage. Unless he was out of space. Which happens a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">didn't get back there to check last night.  was only mussels that dropped though and over several hours so didn't think it was dropping.  failed 2 hmp in over 20 combines so have lots of pie now though.</div></div><hr />
