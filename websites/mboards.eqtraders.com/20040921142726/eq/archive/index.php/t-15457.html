<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ancarett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While I know that King's Thorn can be vendor bought in Abysmal Sea, I don't have GoD yet (nor am I likely to buy this expansion any time soon: being thrifty).<br />
<br />
I'm working on brewing with my wood elf druid and wondering if, when I get to QAT, I can even buy the king's thorn from the Steamfont vendor (Ennixy Frennor). The EQTrader's guide says that he's on Bertoloxxus faction. Doesn't sound too Tunare-friendly!<br />
<br />
I'm at work so I can't log on here and check out (I&quot;m not too lazy to port over). But if she won't be able to pick that up, because of faction reasons, I'll need to grab my husband's account and start playing with some of his alts who might have better luck! Either that, or start bugging friends who might have the GoD expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaycie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if you can sneak (cant rember if WE's get it) you can buy from her, also if you are high enough lvl that you have the innate camo aa's you can buy from her, if not then id say bribe a newbie gnome to buy you 2 stacks that will last you for LOTS of combines (12 yeild per thorn lasts a long long time)<br />

You do have to dodge a few things, but it's not hard at all. I've made maybe 5 trips and never been hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>hyelaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a halfling druid and used wolf form with no problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My Half-Elf Druid with Wolf can't buy anything. I get one of the token messages saying I vacation at a resort on the banks of the river Styx.<br />
<br />
It was easier for me just to make a Gnome :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>hyelaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hmm.  Yeah I didn't have any problems with her.  But I did try to buy from the brownies in wolf form and it wouldn't work.  I then used sneak and was able to buy off of them.</div></div><hr />
