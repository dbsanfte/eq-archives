Other than the Geerlok, is there any decent +% mods for research?<br />
<br />
I hit 65 and spent all my training points over the years on basketweaving and asspicking, so I can't buy my way from 160 to 200.<br />
<br />
I'm buying up runes to get to 182.. but from there it looks like my only option to 200 is to make the level 58-60 spells which is going to be boring farm camps or lots of coin.<br />
<br />
So I was wondering if there was like a +10% research item that I could nab to make my skill effectively 200 so when I -do- research these nifty priest spells for my friends, I'll have less chance of failure..<br />
<br />
Help a poor wizzie out!  =)<br />

I knew it was here somewhere.. just couldn't find it in the obvious places.  ;)<br />
<br />
Guess I'll have to play master looter for some LDoN groups and keep the spell components in exchange for giving up my share of plat.  Luckily my friends will let me do that.<br />
<br />
I'd imagine a pickup group wouldnt be too keen on it tho.</div></div><hr />
