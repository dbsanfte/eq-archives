<br />
As part of my degree at the University of Salford in the UK, I am<br />
conducting a dissertation about online gaming. Part of the research for this project involves a survey of the players of the games. The survey is online and at the following URL &lt;http://www.mmogsurvey.com&gt; .<br />
If any of you could complete the survey it would be much appreciated,and as the website contains the results of the survey - hopefully interesting to you.<br />
<br />
I'm more than happy to take on board constructive criticism, and have already implemented changes based on feedback from various communities I have visited.<br />
<br />
I'd like to apologise in advance if the moderators feel I have posted this in the wrong forum, this seemed the most appropriate.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time<br />

Perhaps if you two started an email thing, you could end up with a resullt &quot;greater than the sum of its parts.&quot;   ;)</div></div><hr />

I'm aware of Mr Yees work, and if my end study can be half as good as his works I'd be well pleased :)<br />
<br />
Due to my course being more business oriented I've had to approach from a slightly different angle, but don't worry ~ I've been checking the work at Mr Yees site .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I posted to your survey... :) Made me think too. Just how much time do I spend in EQ? OMG! Like, one real life 24 hour period per week!<br />
<br />
One seventh of my time over the course of a week is spent online in EQ... :eek: :eek: :eek: <br />
<br />
And most of that is between 8 and midnight... hehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daefaroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/play on my main character (its probably touching 200 days now) - this is with no time spent as a trader in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Thats over a 3 year period, it makes me feel a bit queasy to be honest :)<br />

<br />
only 11pct of respondents so far are female. <br />
<br />
I guess.... I never really had a quantity put to how far I've 'come' since high school. At any given time, I had no more than 2 guy friends. Now, it seems that 90pct of the people I hang out with are guys. <br />
<br />
Given that I was one of two female-IRL core players in my guild on Sullon, I kind of had an idea... but now I really see. ^_^<br />
<br />
<br />
Right now, the answers for the PVP preference surprises me too. I figured people would either really like it, or really hate it. Heh. <br />
<br />
<br />
Very interesting ^_^ thanks for posting. <br />

I filled it out, it's up to 20 percent now  :bookworm:    The number of respondents is extremely low, so the results aren't terribly meaningful.  It's also heavily skewed to EQ, and I think other games might give different answers.   But I think I'll go poke my female game playing friends to go respond and see how badly we can warp the results :angel:   (hmm.  we need a devil smilie /evil grin).</div></div><hr />
