<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Past theories by others and recent comments by our good friend and resident Beer God, Brodder have lead me to believe (for certain) that hot sauce is a seperate item that will be used in multiple recipes, both brewing and baking.  Maybe this was obvious to some, but ya know what...working 17 hour days and going home to a 1 month old screaming child that won't let you sleep for more than a couple hours at a stretch makes one tired.  Too tired to be either smart or insightful.<br />
<br />
Recent comments by Mr. Foamymugs:<br />
<br />
&quot;Once I get info from yall on fan faire and NPC goes in for LEWENA and proper clues I might drop off the recovered sections of the emails with dan enright on Dah Brodder's revenge, Ogre Chili Pie, Nagafen/Dragon Chili, and how to make hotsauce....&quot;<br />
<br />
This pretty much tells us that hot sauce is a seperate recipe.  I believe hot sauce recipes were talked about in one of the previous major Brodder's Revenge threads, but never really pursued to any real extent.  I think it is time to do so.<br />
<br />
&quot;NOW THAT LOOKS PROMISING!!<br />
<br />
But where's the garnish? Mug of Ale and Hot Sauce???<br />
<br />
**whistles innocently**<br />
<br />
and why would ye put a mug into another container??<br />
<br />
*Humms and kicks several slumbering gnomes off his overstuffed eazy chair*<br />
<br />
So yall miss me?&quot;<br />
<br />
More clues for Brodder's Revenge.  Garnish is obvious, but Mug of Ale confuses me a tad.  We've been trying various ale's, but not all of them use a mug for the icon graphic, but rather a bottle or something else (2B2SDA for example).  This either indicates that the item in the recipe is an actual mug or we are reading way too much into &quot;Mug Ale&quot; and the ingredient is plain old simple Ale (which has a mug graphic).  Also the comment about another container pretty much shoots down cask, bottles, and shotglasses.  The mug of ale is the container.  We're mixing other various ingredients with the ale to produce the &quot;Revenge&quot; effect (think along the lines of a Boilermaker or Rocky's egg yolk concoction from the movie).<br />
<br />
Oh and yes Brodder, we missed you dearly.<br />
<br />
But I'm meandering away from the focus here.  Hot sauce.  We have obviously been barking up the wrong tree by trying to combine Brodder's Revenge using peppers directly.  The above quote again leads to the fact that hot sauce is a seperate recipe.  The question again is whether or not it is brewed or baked.  When I make hot sauce myself, it is done with jars, blenders and a pot on the stove.  As I finished typing that last line I realized how pointless it was as it could still indicate both baking and brewing.<br />
<br />
Common ingredients I use when making hot sauce (some borrowed from other recipes of course):<br />
<br />
Habanero<br />
Jalapeno<br />
Garlic<br />
Onion<br />
Orange Juice<br />
Salt<br />
Oregano<br />
Cayenne<br />
Tomato/Tomato sauce<br />
Vegetable oil<br />
<br />
Naturally there are those who will add different items to spice up or add flavor to their own sauces, but above are the basic &quot;base&quot; ingredients you will find in most good hot sauces.<br />
<br />
I couldn't find in-game items for Jalapeno, Onion, Oregano, Cayenne, or a tomato base.  Taking from the ingredients above and what I know are in-game, here are some possible hot sauce recipes.  Also when testing these as a brewing recipe, all will be combined with a bottle as I can't imagine someone trying to keep hot sauce in a shotglass or a keg.<br />
<br />
In a brew barrel:<br />
<br />
Habanero + Vegetable oil<br />
Habanero + Ground garlic + Vegetable oil<br />
Habanero + Ground garlic + Bag of Sea Salt<br />
Habanero + Ground garlic + Bag of Sea Salt + Vegetable oil<br />
Habanero + Bag of Sea Salt + Vegetable oil<br />
<br />
Also, Magelo has an item (#22559) &quot;Flask of Orange Juice&quot;.  I have never run across this item myself and don't know where it comes from or if it is combinable, but since I use orange juice in my homemade hot sauces it's worth a look:<br />
<br />
Habanero + Vegetable oil + Flask of Orange Juice<br />
Habanero + Ground garlic + Vegetable oil + Flask of Orange Juice<br />
Habanero + Ground garlic + Bag of Sea Salt + Flask of Orange Juice<br />
Habanero + Ground garlic + Bag of Sea Salt + Vegetable oil + Flask of Orange Juice<br />
Habanero + Bag of Sea Salt + Vegetable oil + Flask of Orange Juice<br />
<br />
I am not at home at the moment so I am not entirely sure which of the above items are tagged as combinable and which aren't.  I will test these recipes when I get home tonight.  If someone else would like to test them sooner than that and report back here, feel free.<br />
<br />
I have a feeling that the salt and OJ are not part of the in-game recipe, but I had to include them as I use them in my own recipes.  Gut feeling, but I believe the hot sauce recipe is going to be (or at least be very close to):<br />
<br />
Habanero + Ground garlic + Vegetable oil + Bottle<br />
<br />
Like I said, I will test these tonight when I get home unless someone else decides to test them today and reports back here.  Comments and ideas welcome.</div></div><hr />

Brodder's Baking Hint (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=11180) Brodder actually talks about Hot Sauce... or at leasts hints that he had created a recipe and it -might- be in the game.<br />
<br />

<br />
I did take a stab at tabasco sauce a few times, and I posted some ideas somewhere about how that would be made.  I remember digging up a site that described the process of making Tabasco (yes, the commercial stuff) as fermentation, which would lead me to think it's brewing ... but this is EQ, after all.<br />

Edit: OK, I'm stupid.  Either Krazick edited the post above while I was typing, or I utterly misread it and didn't see the link to the other URL.  Just ignore me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, yay on the orange juice.  The item image that I was looking at didn't list it as a drink/consumable so I didn't think it was an actual drink or player-made.  I must be more diligent in my searching in the future.<br />
<br />
I will also try the hot sauce recipes in an oven and a mixing bowl when I get home tonight (again, unless someone beats me to it and lets us know).  If it is indeed a baking combine, this may also shoot down a bottle in the recipe (or does it *cue suspense music*).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am going to roll with Habanero anyhow.  At very least it will fail and I will have discounted them completely.  There is the possibility that the hot sauce was added more recently (since PoP) than the rest of the discovered Brodder recipes.  We have seen several cases in the past where and item/npc/clue/etc. was alluded to but not actually in-game for a long time for whatever reason (*sniff* all those wasted months trying to find that cursed Ironforge girl).  Also, I may have been lax in my searching again but I cannot find any other type of pepper in the game.  If the recipes do not work with Habanero, I will try them again with regular Spices or maybe Hot-n-Spicy Toelings in it's place.  I will try to think of other possible ingredients as well that would give a kick to some sauce.</div></div><hr />

They are.  One of the tinker subcombines is 2 clockwork grease in a small jar, to make a Jar of Clockwork Grease.  IIRC it's a no fail combine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And even though tomatoes are considered fruit, they might also be considered a veggie by many...<br />
<br />

<br />
But I don't know how it was changed... that's upto current trade skill guru...I've been outta SOE loop for a weee bit.<br />

Cannot try it now but will give it a shot later today, in a brew barrel, oven and mixing bowl since Brodder dumped the clue in the Baking Forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just FYI, I tried the combinations from my original post above in a brew barrel (with and without a bottle), a mixing bowl, and a spit.

<br />

<br />
OK if we take these hints as non-misleading...<br />
<br />
Ingredients of Ogre Swill: cask, froglok meat, malt, yeast<br />
or<br />
Ingredients of Skull Ale: cyclops skull, short beer, spices, vinegar<br />
<br />
Tomatoes - Fruit or Veggie... but since no Tomato, then actually take a &quot;Fruit&quot;<br />
<br />
Pepper - Habanero Pepper<br />
<br />
Spices - Either &quot;Spices&quot; or &quot;Algae Spices&quot;... I think Algae Spices since it is a Cobalt Scar (aka Velious) item.<br />
<br />
So try:<br />
<br />
Froglok Meat + Fruit + Habanero Pepper<br />
Froglok Meat + Fruit + Spices<br />
Froglok Meat + Fruit + Spices + Habanero Pepper<br />
Froglok Meat + Fruit + Algae Spices<br />
Froglok Meat + Fruit + Algae Spices + Habanero Pepper<br />
<br />
Vinegar + Fruit + Habanero Pepper<br />
Vinegar + Fruit + Spices<br />
Vinegar + Fruit + Spices + Habanero Pepper<br />
Vinegar + Fruit + Algae Spices<br />
Vinegar + Fruit + Algae Spices + Habanero Pepper<br />
<br />
Try in Mixing Bowl/Spit... Brew Barrel with Cask/Shotglass/Bottle/Nothing<br />
<br />
(Why Skull Ale? Seems like an Ogre-ish type drink to me).</div></div><hr />

While Hot Sauce may be similar the stuff we have here on Earth in the end, perhaps on Norrath they arrived at the same end by very different means. My search has been focusing on a combination of different spices, rather than the habanero, as a result of these thoughts.<br />

That's true.  I mean, look at winter chocolate On Norrath, chocolate is made from brownies, rather than making the brownies from chocolate as we do on Earth.  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Sorry, Yurien.  We're all stumbling along in the dark here.  The whole point of this thread is to identify the recipe for Hot Sauce, based on the clues Brodder has given us (though they're scattered across four or five threads in two forums).  <br />
<br />
Once we nail that recipe, the Hot Sauce itself is in turn a component for another unknown brewing recipe called Brodder's Revenge.  <br />
<br />
In turn, Brodder's Revenge may or may not be the solution for an unsolved quest in Shadow Haven.  A female wood elf NPC named Lewena asks you to buy her a drink, in exchange for which she will tell you a secret.  <br />
<br />
The current theory (though unsupported by hard facts) is that Brodder's Revenge is NOT Lewena's favorite ale; rather, you give the Revenge to another NPC (a drunk in Shadow Haven) who then gives you clues (or maybe a quest item) that would point you towards Lewena's ale.  Brodder's Revenge is designed to be a sort of hangover cure, hence the bit about handing it to a drunk.<br />
<br />
Does this search kind of make sense now? :)</div></div><hr />

It would be worth going back to the thread Furyrpied linked and reading it over with a critical eye.  You might get a flash of insight from the speculation in there.<br />
<br />
Also, just to make sure folks are aware, Brodder posted a Hot Sauce thread in the Baking forum, of all places.  Read it here (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=11180).</div></div><hr />

Firewater<br />
Essence of Fire...however it sparked a thought or two.  <br />
<br />
First off, this may not be much help, but I wanted to point out that Flame of Vox probably isn't a viable component for any &quot;hot&quot; recipes.  Like Ice of Velious, this is a mage research component and it's only used in creating Water pet spells.  Because of this, I've always had the impression that the &quot;Flame&quot; of Vox is actually quite cold.  The fact that Vox is an Ice Dragon lends further weight to this idea :)<br />
<br />
Thinking about mage research made me start considering a few possibilities that might be worth exploring though.  Some of the components used in the creation of Fire pet spells seem not so far-fetched.  In particular, Breath of Ro, Breath of Solusek and Halas Heater (hmm, Brewed!) all strike me as worth looking at.  Flame of Fennin was added with LoY and thus seems unlikely and I can't see using a Jade Shard in any sort of liquid.<br />
<br />
Methinks it's time for me to spend some time down at my favorite spot in the Blind Fish :D</div></div><hr />

One of the other solved brewing recipes, from dropped hints by Brodder in another post in this forum, uses Ice of Velious to keep it cold.  It's called Frothy Frostbite (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9457&amp;menustr=035000000000).  So don't discount Flame of Vox, due to it's research use.  :)</div></div><hr />

So don't discount Flame of Vox, due to it's research use.  :)  I think you may have misunderstood the point I was trying to make.  Perhaps I was unclear.  I didn't mean to imply that Flame of Vox was an unlikely candidate because it's a research component.  I was simply pointing out that even though it has &quot;flame&quot; in its name, it is quite likely a very cold substance and therefore would be a poor ingredient for &quot;hot&quot; sauce.<br />
<br />
It's actually the fact that Ice of Velious is part of another recipe that made me consider Breath of Solusek and Breath of Ro for the hot sauce.  It's a longshot though and so I haven't had the inclination to see if I can concoct anything with it ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>adetia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">one of the most daunting issues with hot sauce is that it might be brewing, might be baking, could be a brew barrell, might be a mixing bowl, could possibly be an oven, (not to mention any permutation of the dozen baking implements and brewing supplies), or even a mortar and pestle.  not asking for a total give away but another tiny bone might be helpful.  while most seem to think brewing, it seems to strike me that the post in baking forum was for a reason.</div></div><hr />

It's possible you missed one particular combo, but we can't know what was and what wasn't tried unless you list every combination you tried and what container you used for each combine.<br />

I know it's a lot more work this way, but we need an accurate list of what was and wasn't tried.</div></div><hr />

Take a look over in the Brewing forum for the DNC List for Brodder's Revenge (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=11151) to get an idea of what we need -- item by item lists, including the container you used.<br />
<br />
Yes, it's insanely long and boring doing it this way.  I tend to spend more time writing lists of what I tried than I do actually testing.  However, unless we do it this way, it's far too easy to miss one particular combination, assume it's already been tried, and never find the final recipe.</div></div><hr />

I wonder if a more verbose combine message is a possibility for the future.  It would certainly be welcome in situations like this.  Something like:<br />
<br />
You attempted to combine vinegar, ground garlic, flask of water and bottle in a brew barrel.<br />
You cannot combine those items in this container type!<br />
<br />
You attempted to combine arctic wyvern hide, belt pattern, cod oil, velium studs and velium studs in a deluxe sewing kit.<br />
You have fashioned the items together to create Arctic Wyvern Belt!<br />

No I didn't , you're misquoting me. That's from the Frothy Frothbite recipe...not the current discussion.<br />
<br />
I can't discuss more or narrow things down anymore. sorry.<br />
EQ's guru's gonna have to check recipes (all of them) and verify tht drops, items, and subcombines are all properly tagged and do work.<br />
 On a live server not internally...hopefully.<br />
<br />
 Several of the missing recipe's indeed did work. THough I was supplied some things to do combo tests way back then.<br />
<br />
 and don't, please don't take every comment I make and dissect it like a lab experiment.<br />
 When I post a clue, I'll post a clue...<br />
 Finding distinction between one of my clues and a bit of Brodder humor, flavor is eluding some folks.<br />

 You're doing fine me ladds (n lasses), and you might get lucky and then pieces will fall into place.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>NogiliRazorclaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">After reading a few things, I've come up with my own idea for the Hot Sauce recipe.<br />
<br />
First, Brodder's post here (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=11180) makes me think Hot Sauce is baked.   Why else would it be in the baking forum?<br />
<br />
Secondly, to quote this post (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?threadid=8960&amp;perpage=25&amp;pagenumber=6) ,  Skull ale if ye remember was a legend I'd heard of...and used brains of their enemies, but since brains were in short supply in Oggok...well the skull alone was used. .  Hmmm...interesting that he mentioned that because he refers to the Ogres again in this post (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?threadid=11183) One might look to one of the ogre's favorite brewing ingredients to help with making hotsauce...<br />
And even though tomatoes are considered fruit, they might also be considered a veggie by many...<br />
Peppers and spices... one or other or maybe both... <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My conclusion is the Hot Sauce recipe is baked with the following ingredients:<br />
<br />
cyclops skull<br />
vegetables<br />
spices<br />
water? (i think water is needed to be &quot;saucy&quot;)<br />
<br />
Hope someone can try out my theory since I can't play for awhile : (<br />

That's a possibility, but since vinegar is one of the INGREDIENTS for Skull Ale (and a known ingredient for Tabasco Sauce in RL) and the skull is a container, it's likely that the combine is:<br />
<br />
vegetable or fruit<br />
spices<br />
vinegar<br />
possible other?<br />
<br />
I was so busy this weekend I completely forgot to test this :(<br />
...will try to take care of it tonight.  I have a skull too though, so will try that too if the above is DNC</div></div><hr />

I have been lurking for a while. I know you guys mentioned skull ale. But to me blood temper (cultural smithing) or ogre swill is the drink he is refering to. I think it will end up being a baking recipe with the components of Veggies+Spices+ the ogre ingredient. I think we have to make this before we make B.R.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Nepper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">I think it's definitely worth a try, but if you go back into the brewing diaries, all Ogre drinks there in have 1 common component : Vinegar.<br />
Broader even goes further in the diaries to comment:<br />
&quot;(what's with ogres and vinegar?)&quot;<br />
<br />
As far as the combine on hot-sauce:<br />
My best guess would be fruit/veggies (tomatoe based hot-sauce, like a salsa), spices, vinegar<br />
I'm at work and don't have time to hunt down list if it's been tried, but I'm sure it has.  Just my 2cp.<br />
When I get some time to zone back into game (rare these days) I'll do what I can to help in the hunt.</div></div><hr />
