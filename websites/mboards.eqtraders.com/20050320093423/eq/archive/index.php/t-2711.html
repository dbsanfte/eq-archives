My question is, are Ground Spawns static locations with random pop times?  Or is it random locations throughout a zone (with of course) random pop times?<br />
<br />
Mainly talking about Yew leaves, Oak Bark, Morning Dew etc. not about Perma crystals and that sort.<br />
<br />
If they do have static locations, my idea was to start a thread and list  locs.<br />
<br />
Thanks all.</div></div><hr />

I find this hard if not difficult to believe.  I only say this because after 3 hours of foraging and yeilding a result of *one* Yew leaf it's maddening to say the least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really want to start makign Kaladim Constitutionals, but I never have gotten to the zone to start looking for the ground spawn needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyrdlan</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some ground spawns are very static.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, it seems ALL ground spawns are static, it's just that some have such a large range of possibility as to seem random.  I know after months of writing down locs and drawing pictures I can find Misty Acorns fairly reliably.<br />
<br />
The groundspawns in Kaladim, Steamfont, and Lesser Faydark are fairly predictable.<br />
<br />
Yew leaves I just can't find enough of reasonably enough of to make a conclusion on, sorry!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimphe Wildwood</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I'm not crazy!  Thanks Wyrdlan  :D  Now if we could get a few others with locs on hmm let's say Yew Leaves in Waking Lands (Insert a different zone) and report back - possibly we could draft up a nice info. thread.<br />
<br />
Going thru some older posts, I was able to find a loc reported by Damion.  P 1061, N 2345.<br />
<br />
Last night I was able to find a ground spawn at P 1600.51, N 150.28 located near Lady Gelistial.<br />
<br />
I'm going to watch these two spots and report back any findings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ngreth Thergn</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It may be static... but they do something like, have 200 locations it can spawn... only 25 can be spawned at once.  Making it real dificult.<br />
<br />
But basically...<br />
<br />
if we put up a list.. and say... &quot;this spawns at X&quot;  then when something doesn't spawn there...  we get yelled at...<br />
<br />
Now there are some defenite ones that have static, or small area spawn.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not my intent on anybody getting yelled at.   :(   And don't understand why someone would want to do that in the first place.<br />
<br />
The idea only came about to try and help make Smithing/Tailoring/Brewing a lil more enjoyable.  <br />
<br />
I'll just make personal notes and not continue with this post.<br />
<br />
As always, I appreciate the feedback Ngreth.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pojodan</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Part of the Vah Shir Warrior progressive quests is finding a groundspawn in the pit around Shar Vahl.  A red mushroom, a blue mushroom, and a pinch of moss.<br />
<br />
The red and blue mushrooms are easy, just look for a red and blue dot.<br />
<br />
The moss... urgh...   There seems to be several dozen potential spawn locations of ground spawns only two or tree of whcih seem to be up at any given moment.  Some are right next to each other, one is right against the edge of a rock and, thus, hard to see, another is on the dark ground and since the moss appears as a little black dot, it's hard to see.<br />
The moss also seems to be very rare since after picking up about 20 chunks of clay I finally found my moss.<br />
<br />
Quite irritating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ngreth Thergn</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 09:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually...<br />
<br />
I know where the &quot;random&quot; thing on spawn locations came from.<br />
<br />
It is specifically Yew leaves.<br />
<br />
They randomly spawn IN tree's<br />
<br />
Yes it took people CHEATING to prove this (Show EQ), but it has been proven that they sometimes spawn in trees.<br />
<br />
They would not PLACE the ground spawns spots in trees since they cannot be accessed there. <br />
<br />
Some things DO have samll set spawn areas (the acorns are an example, the leaves under some of the tree's in luclin).<br />
<br />
And there are some defenite... set location ground spawns, (A few in Burning woods, and Skyfire for example), and for those we are willing to put in a loc.  Heck... the tradeskill containers... are a set location ground spawn :)<br />
<br />
But some of them (such as Yew Leaves) are random in a certain area of a zone.</div></div><hr />
