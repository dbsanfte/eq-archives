<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">On one post someone mentioned a Belt used for a Mod for Smithing that either drops in Santus Seru or is quested there. They mentioned the &quot;Belt from Santus Seru&quot;.<br />
Does anyone know if there is a dropped item or quest item that adds a Mod to Smithing from the zone Santus Seru?<br />
If so...what is it called and where can i find a link. I havent been able to find anything. Thanks</div></div><hr />

I forget which one.  Also, its only equippable by large races.</div></div><hr />

Don't really need a raid for this - just take nukers and pet classes and you can do it with a single group.  Only send in pets and have healers heal the pets.  Nukers can nuke but they need to watch agro because if they get agro they will be banished.  Sadly, melee make this fight harder.  I did it with Necro, Beastlord, Wizard, Cleric, and mage and I believe a shaman bot but don't remember for sure.  Was a LONG fight and I had mana issues by the end so bringing an extra healer would be good. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>crystilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">While working on my Seru key (have 3 of the 4 shards but 4th guy is in hiding  :irked: ) and helping others with their key, I've seen 2 or 3 of those drop.<br />
<br />
A cleric/mage can duo up all the mobs up to that room but you do need more, as the previous poster said, to kill the bosses.  Each of the 4 bosses have their own unique twists to the fight.  2 healers, mage, 1 other pet class minimum, DPS (1 group) can do him.  It's a fairly long fight depending how many folks you have there but isn't too terribly hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>filobeto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This fight was so fun, getting banished to jail, stand in line waiting for a TL back to bind (we bound in his room and had a Wiz in the jail), repeat.<br />
<br />
Only problem is we all became very KOS after the kill, and very bound in the zone.  Made for a fun recovery  :faint: <br />
<br />
Don't do that.</div></div><hr />
