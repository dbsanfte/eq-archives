<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Farnyr</div><div class="date">04-16-2003, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So tonight, I was going around, doing pottery and JC to get high enough to make my own artisen seals(I cant find any for 5k, which is what ill spend on them). <br />
<br />
So I go, and I get my skills high enough. Actually get up the nerve and mount the 4 jems, with no failures! Im on a roll now! So I head to the bazaar, shell out money for the mana, and pray to Innoruuk(I really did, ask the channel), and combine the unfired seal. Yay! Ok, now im scared, but the entire channel is egging me on, so I bite the bullet, buy the sheet, pray to Innoruuk again, and YAY! First artisen seal ive ever made.<br />
<br />
But does it end there? No! No, instead I now have literally the ENTIRE channel going &quot;Make the spoon! Make the spoon!&quot;, so to shut them up, I run to the bank, and grab out my dairy spoon, and head to my lucky oven. Meanwhile, darn Tenrin is sitting there doing voodoo against my success! I even screenshotted it, which ill post later.<br />
<br />
So of course I toss my seal and spoon into the oven, take a deep breath and.....and....ANDD!!! Fail  :?  Oh well. I had a ton of fun having everyone cheer me on. Thanks guys  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Back to MTP's for another 6 points eh? ;)<br />
<br />
Good luck on your next attempt, they say 3 times the charm.</div></div><hr />
