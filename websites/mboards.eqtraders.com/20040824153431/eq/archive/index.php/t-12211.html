<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>chmodux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Please, PLEASE tell me i'm not the only one to leave a corking device in the brew barrel only to remeber what I had done days later.  Oh welll had just paid back original investment guess its technically not a complete loss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was on the opposite end of that little problem once.  I sat down in PoK to make some Sea Tempers and found a corking device and 1 CE in the barrel.  Thought, &quot;Yay!&quot; and went about my business.  About 30 minutes later someone starts /ooc'ing to the zone if anyone had found a corker in a barrel.  Darn.  I gave it back to the fellow of course.  He tried to give me some plat for it, but I refused.  It was his in the first place.<br />
<br />
Other things I have randomly found in stationary containers:<br />
- Smithy hammer<br />
- metal bits<br />
- various blocks/bricks/pieces of ore of varying type<br />
- liquid rat<br />
- blue diamond<br />
- spiderling silk<br />
- swirling shadows<br />
- I'm sure more that I am forgetting.<br />
<br />
When I find stuff someone else left in a container I stick it in my backpacks and go about my business.  If someone shouts or ooc's that they lost something, I give it back.  If nobody says anything before I leave the zone though, the &quot;finder keeper&quot; rule goes into effect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I intentionally wandered off for 10-15 minutes to do other things, figuring the owner would come back for their items.<br />
<br />
They didn't.  Mine, mine, mine.</div></div><hr />

Before Shared Bank slots, one of the ways to transfer items from one character to another that I used was to use a stationary container, one that didn’t see a lot of traffic.  Rarely ever transferred expensive items this way, usually just tradeskill components like silks, meats, etc.  Once or twice I went LD and couldn’t log back in for more than 20 minutes.  This may be what you experienced (as the finder of the ‘goodies.)</div></div><hr />

just in case it makes you feel any better, a few days ago i bought several slargilug stuffed poppers for 400pp each (the other folks who sell them are 2450 and 2950 &gt;&lt;). Apparently, i used to sell them for 35pp each, pre-Party Platter days.... they just went into my trader's selling inventory, and of course I forgot to put them in my shared bank for the baker... So some lucky guy got my poppers for 35pp each. <br />
<br />
that's my most recent blunder. only cost me about 5k =) better than some of my other smart moves!</div></div><hr />

drop to get my needed toon. Sure as Shyte, that little load mouth Nililpus (sp) comes along and grabs it. I was about 10 seconds to late. To this day i nuke him every single time i see him.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I lost my Ragebringer and a Collapsible Sewing Kit in a NoRent GM Satchel about 2 months ago.  I almost cried when I realized it...  I got my Rage back about 3 weeks later though.  Thank god.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Maisie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I did 10 stacks of CE by hand, &lt; not bought in bazaar, and left in a no rent GM bag....I could have wept..<br />
Though I did hear of a woman who left 3 stacks of BDs in a no rent bag..now THAT hurts.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kritta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have on average a person every other week come to me and say &quot;I need another corking device, I lost mine...&quot;<br />

If you're on E'ci, gimme a hollar and I'll hook ya up if you supply the Blue Diamond. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I never use the summoned GM bags, for just the above mentioned reasons. I made some halfling really happy by stocking up on 4 of the 100% wr leatherfoot haversacks at 6k each, which with my permanent GM bag, and, and rallic pack, provide me with plenty of WR slots. Add my deluxe sewing kit, and one spot to put collapsables, and I'm full up.<br />
<br />
I did lose a whole bag of random junk loot one time before I learned this lesson. Thank goodness it was just junk like giant helms, heads and berserker weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kritta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My most painful &quot;OMG&quot; moment regarding NO RENT bags was losing a full bag of rebreathers... as I needed the giant size and didn't have another bag on me. I started chatting, then had to camp. Camped and &quot;poof&quot;. *sigh* 1k each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Buffine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I guess I'm a naive nice person.  If I find something in one of the commonly used containers, I stash it in a spare bag until I'm done with my combines, then I put it back for the next person to find, hopefully the owners.<br />
