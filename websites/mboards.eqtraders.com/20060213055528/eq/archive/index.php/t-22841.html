<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zabu</div><div class="date">08-04-2005, 08:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My son has a gnome warrior that is just shy of 52.  Now that he's got a few levels under his belt, he wants to team up with me and see the sights.  However, he's outfitted in a most ghetto fashion:<br />
<br />

<br />
Keeping him alive therefore sometimes proves to be, um,  challenging<br />
<br />
I thought we might be able to fix him up with some Expert's Autoactuated stuff and some Infestation symbols, but I haven't seen any in the bizarre bazarre for three nights running now.  Anyone working on these items to skill up and have some inventory you'd like to off-load?  <br />
<br />
I'm not looking to spend a small fortune (forgive the pun...) because I'm saving up for some Master's symbols for myself ;)  However, if anyone has any suggestions for alternate attire, I'm certainly interested.</div></div><hr />

Do a bunch of collections quickly and get a points for EC and South Ro.  They have some good armour.</div></div><hr />
