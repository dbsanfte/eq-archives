<br />
Even allowing for possibly sub-combines (I don't know, I'm a half elf rogue, I can't wear it anyway ;) ) that seems like a LOT of money per combine ...<br />
<br />
Did he happen to hit a few folks who gunned up and are trying to recoup losses instantaneously, or have prices really gotten that high for a combine ?<br />
<br />
(Or was there maybe a misunderstanding about what was being asked for?)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeani</div><div class="date">04-08-2003, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is that folks have started to use GM smiths as intermediaries for money-making -- they'd present materials to a GM smith for a free or nearly free combine, then turn around and sell the materials in the bazaar for profit, even undercutting the very GM smith that made the combine. I think most GM smiths would agree that they didn't go through the pain of skilling all the way up, just so that other people they don't know can make plat. <br />
<br />
This practice has led some GM smiths to simply not do combines at all for people they don't know. The ones that do still do combines now charge enough to discourage this practice, while still leaving the end user cost substantially less than retail.<br />
<br />
To avoid the 2-5kpp per piece charge, your friend is welcome to spend two months and/or 100kpp minimum skilling up his own toon...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ItienneEQ</div><div class="date">04-09-2003, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, combine charges vary widely because of just such dishonesty. When I got some heraldic made, the smith knew of me vaguely from past guilds, and I guess trusted me when I said the armor was for my twink frog, not for resale. He didn't name a donation, so I brough all ingredients and tipped 1k for each success.<br />
<br />
Personally, I ask for 500pp per success on tailoring combines, figuring that cuts into the profit margin of anyone intending to resell robes or whatever. If I know them there's no charge, and if I'm fairly confident they're not reselling, I may waive the 500 or just take whatever they offer. I really try not to charge people who can't afford good gear and have instead spent lots of time farming ingredients... people for whom the combine becomes a prized part of their wardrobe.<br />
<br />
I also have that 500pp number because it tends to weed out the people who want fleeting quiver combines. They trivial at 222, so lower skill tailors should really be given the chance to do those combines (for skillup, or at least for tips to fund more skillups). Also, for some reason, people who want quivers tend to be the most clueless about what they need to bring, and waste my time in the process.<br />
<br />
If I were you, I'd hope to find people who won't charge much... but your best chances of finding that are to look among your acquaintances or guild friendships. And I wouldn't be surprised or pissed if people say they charge what you quoted.</div></div><hr />
