For a  more &quot;up to date&quot; reading list... read the other 30+ threads (in the past cpuple months alone) asking the same question, that are in this forum.  All the info is there for the reading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Damudge Deeler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Itz, thanks for that guide. I was a bit confused as well, and am grateful to you for doing that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dharla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Personally, I would go to EK and hunt lions and spiders.  Save all of the HQ and MQ skins you get from the lions and all the silk you get from the spiders.  Then do studded masks (MQ pelts), cured silk (spider silk), quivers (HQ pelts), and then the Wu's fighting armor.<br />
<br />
The only items here that should be a problem are vials of viscous mana and the studs for the studded masks.  I would just smith your own studs, since all the ingredients you need are merchent bought and it has a really low trivial level.  To get the vials of viscous mana bring a couple of stacks of pearls and poison vials (can be bought in pok from a merchant in the western trader building) to a chanter that is past lvl 12.  It's a big hassle, so a nice tip for the chanty might be wise.  If they don't have the spell to summon it it can be bought from the brownie merchants in Lfay (use wolf form).<br />
<br />
This way saves you a lot of running around since you can basically stay in the same zone and hunt the same two things from 30 to 158.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Itz, I'd do Cured Silk Masks to 82 instead of baskets and greyhopper boots. In the first place, baskets return *10* on a success, so unless you want to be up to your ears in the stupid things (which was a mistake I made) I suggest you think about something else. Then skip quivers (PITA that they are unstackable and containers) and go straight to crystaline silk.<br />
<br />
just my two cents</div></div><hr />

From 76 to 88 i highly sugest Handmade backpacks (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1227&amp;menustr=035000000000) since you can by the pelts cheap in the bazaar and sell them back to players.  That way you can make some plat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well but quivers can now be turned into tokens.  Still unstackable but no longer a container.  Not sure how well they sell but if you have the stuff anyway....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kieroth_whiteleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I do tailoring on my alts as I level them, so most of the stuff I use is stuff that I get while XPing anyways, but I do:<br />
<br />
Tattered masks to 26<br />
Studded masks to 56<br />
HQ masks to 108<br />
Crystalline to 138<br />
Wus to 158<br />
<br />
Trivs might be slightly off, I'm doing it off memory.<br />
<br />
The reason I do it that way is that EVERYTHING needs spider silk, so I try to save it up until I need it for wu's to bridge 138 to 158. Later I'll be needing it en masse for things like solstice robes and such, so save it until it's needed. I generally do a lot of my leveling in the karanas up until 20 or so, so getting MQ/HQ pelts is easy. I also get a lot of them running to splitpaw (another favorite xp zone for me).<br />
<br />
I do a lot of farming in velks and my cousin levels in the low-mid 40s in thurg, so between the two of us we have more crystalline silk than we know what to do with, so throwing it away on those combines is not a big deal.<br />
<br />
The other nice thing about that route is that the studs and boning are easily (and quickly, with the new UI) made in PoK, so it saves me dealing with Qeynos to make heady kiolas. They're also stackable and only needed singly since I make masks, so a few stacks goes a long ways. Heady Kiolas are needed several at a time, so stacks go fast.<br />
<br />
This works beautifully if you level your alts in the karanas, save all the pelts you get on all your characters, and start while you're getting XP for stuff. If I was ALREADY 50 when I wanted to start it I'd be considering other methods. I like quietly soloing in EK because I can do RL stuff while I'm medding between sets of kills, my cousin prefers paludual for his teens so it wouldn't be a viable option for the more hardcore grinding characters.<br />
