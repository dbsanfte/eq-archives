Ok, stop laughing at me, lol.  I already know that this WAS a dumb question. Home sick and too much cold med can do that to ya.  Yes, I did turn around and hand in the scorecard.  ROFL</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you have at least two open slots in your inventory?<br />
<br />
If the answer to both of these is yes, then you need to /bug or /petition.  <br />
<br />
The the answer to either of these is no, then you may qualify as an inquistive idiot :D <br />

   Another possibility just occurred to me... what do you think the trophy looks like?  I think my beginner's one looked like a war hammer, not a smithy hammer.  My potter trophy resembled a misty thicket sickle, my tailoring trophy looked more like a fang, another trophy looked kinda like a fancy bottle cork and so on.  I did all seven basic trophies at the beginner, apprentice, or freshman level and always received at least a trophy when I did the turn in (and of course got one certificate along with each trophy for apprentice and freshman level tasks)</div></div><hr />
