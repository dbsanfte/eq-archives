At last count, we have eight that are active. Up until about 4-5 months ago, we only had ONE active 250 Tailor.<br />
I know we're one of the younger servers-<br />
<br />
How many (active) 250 Tailors are on your server?<br />
<br />
Just curious as to see if the number of GM Tailors adversely affects tailored item prices, or if there is a correlation...</div></div><hr />

I know Vaz has at least 4 250 tailors.  Of them, I don't know who all is active.  Ydris just got 250, so I'm guessing he is, but I don't want to put words into his mouth.<br />

Edit: I didn't notice the &quot;8&quot; snuck into your post there.  So disregard, please.  :)<br />

And my halfling will be there as soon as I round up a few more skill up attempts...<br />

<br />
To be accurate, I've been told there are 8 250's on our server, but I can only think of 5 or so when I list them, /shrug...</div></div><hr />

There are another half dozen or so still working their way from 200 to 250... some of those might have made it already.<br />
<br />
Only a couple of those have full time bazaar mules, so price competition is sporadic.  Set your solstice robes at 2k and you'll see maybe six people selling cheaper, with maybe 50 robes between them... but wait six hours and they've all logged off.</div></div><hr />

I know of 2 more people working their tailoring up.<br />
<br />
BTW I only knew of 1 on the server in the 220 range or higher before solstice robes.  I suspect a large portion of the GM tailors (me included) are GM because of solstice robes.<br />

After Nommus transfered to Venril Sathir I dont know any 250 Tailors on Kane Bayle. (Nommus was server first 250 tailor and his alt was first 250 smith)<br />

Damion has over 220 tailoring and I have 207 atm. Dont know any other people with his Tailoring skill on Kane Bayle. There are surely others but I dont think any have 250.</div></div><hr />

Actually, there are at least 5 that I'm aware of on 7th, though I can't name all of them off-hand.<br />
<br />
Starcryst was first.  Inflikta was second.  And in the time I've been trying to be third, I've seen at least 3 others post here or on-line that they've made it (edit: Finnlander and Ripsnorter have both announced their status on the marketplace forums.  I'm pretty sure I remember at least one more as well)<br />
<br />
** What I have not seen so far on 7th is a HALFLING 250 Tailor, which I would dearly love to find for my monk!**<br />
<br />
Being a casual player and member of a small guild, I do 90% or more of my farming on my own and only have the plat I can generate from selling tailored items to keep me going.  It's slow, but I WILL MAKE 250  :D  or go insane trying  :shock: (perhaps both!)<br />

I'll try not to be too insulted you left me out. However I never sold solstice robes so that might be why. Oh and it's Gravestone, Nekto and Kosokoso.  :P <br />
<br />
There is also Bryanstar and Mudcrush although I think Mud is just maxed out with mod (shei needle) and not actually 250 skill.<br />
