<br />
I've noticed a couple of times now that if I log in via the &quot;user cp&quot; button and do nothing other than leave the browser window idle for a while, then come back to the browser window and try to do something, everything is marked as &quot;all read,&quot; making me lose track of all the new posts.  To be specific, posts and forums that were marked new are no longer marked new, even though I didn't do anything other than sitting idle.  Going into a forum previously marked &quot;there's new stuff here!&quot; shows me no &quot;there's new stuff here!&quot; icons.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From what I can tell from trial and error, whenever you load ANY page on the boards (index, forum, post, post reply) it basically sets a new timestamp for your user.  If a post is &quot;[most recient post timestamp] - [your last user timestamp] &gt;= [a constant]&quot; then its marked as read.  The &quot;constant&quot; seems to be on the order of 5-10 minutes, I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Anyone know how to make my read posts appear as read? (Atm they don't change appearance.) I've looked around for a setting and can't see it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Helmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think he / she is looking for a make all forums as read to if she only read one or two forums, he / she can just make all others as read with out going in to them, not all are geeks like us there go trug each forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if you come to this site and then leave, in about 10 minutes, it automatically marks every forum as read.</div></div><hr />
