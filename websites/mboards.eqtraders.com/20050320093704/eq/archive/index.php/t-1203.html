<br />
What do you listen to while doing any common activity in EQ?<br />
<br />
Me - All activities: KMFDM, Nuit, Godsmack, Sneaker Pimps, Alice DeeJay, Gorrilaz, many more.<br />
<br />
    Farming - Spencer Davis Group, &quot;Coal Mine&quot; as covered by Devo, &quot;Takin Care of Business&quot; artist unknown, anything by the Spin Doctors.<br />
<br />
    Powerleveling/traveling in SoW - Anything you'd hear while seeing an 80's training montage (Eye of the tiger, etc.)<br />
<br />

<br />
While exping, I alternate between angry but encouraging, and mind numbingly depressing music.<br />
<br />
Occasionally, while fighting, I will put on Ironic music, like &quot;I'm gonna Knock you out!  Momma said Knock you out&quot;, or  &quot;Smack my Bitch up&quot; by Prodigy.<br />
<br />
And once, when I decided to take on a red con at level 30 &quot;It's the end of the world, As we know it&quot; by REM.<br />
<br />
And I felt fine.  (I lived, and beat it. :)  ) <br />

And I have used comedy Mp3 for tradskilling, (ie adam sandler, george carlin.) I have a lot of My cd's on my pc and theres a large asortment of groups and songs. So really depends on my mood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KyrosKrane</div><div class="date">12-19-2002, 05:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I must have the most eclectic mix of music you can imagine.  Anything and everything from top 40 to obscure artist pop-rock to classic rock to Christian rock to gospel to church choir to classical to opera to broadway to movie soundtrack to spoken humor to (at the appropriate season) Christmas music to kids songs -- and back along an alternate path through musicology.   :) <br />
<br />
My normal playlist (excluding seasonal additions) runs some 2200 tracks long, all played at random. <br />
<br />
Yes, I'm slightly insane -- err, eccentric -- in my listening habits.   :D <br />
<br />
My most amusing moments come either when something spookily appropriate comes on (like the D&amp;D soundtrack when dungeon-crawling or battling a con-red) or something utterly absurd comes on (like the Pink Panther theme when hunting cats for pelts, or Batman for bat wings).<br />
<br />
Random note.  Anyone remember the old D&amp;D cartoon?  It would be kind of neat if we could get the opening theme for that into EQ somehow.  Seems appropriate in an odd way.  :P <br />
<br />
Having said that, how many folks actually listen to the EQ music?  I've never switched it on to date.  Is it worth it?</div></div><hr />
