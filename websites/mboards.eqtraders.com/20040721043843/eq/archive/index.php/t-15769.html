<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I didn't see another thread, so I'll start one.<br />
<br />
New baord looks good, and vBulliten is very userfriendly, many boards went to them.<br />
<br />
Good job!<br />
<br />
I like the ICQ and AOLIM icons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Looks great guys! Thank you!<br />
<br />
Congrats on getting all the data moved over as well. =D /cheer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Awesome new boards, and THANK YOU for moving the names back to the left side. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Threads/forums marked as read! Yay!<br />
<br />
Like the new look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Question: Is there any way to lower the font size?  i explored around in the various optiosn and didn't see it.  I would love to have a smaller font version so I could see a bit more on the screen at any one time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Niellya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Could we possibly change the &quot;Hot thread&quot; criteria to not take number of views into account, or raise the threshold significantly?<br />
<br />
It's pretty pointless when every thread is a &quot;Hot thread&quot; even though it has only one reply to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heh, I'm still finding my way around the new admin control panel.<br />
<br />
Hot topic flagging was set for 250 views and/or 25 posts.  I've set it to 500/40 to see if that helps a bit.  If it gets too crazed, we may just remove the option totally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">and I moved it up from the original 10 posts 150 views :)  guess it was not enough :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gnormy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Should have launched this upgrade on April 1st and watched heads spin =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>munwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sorry, im on the other side...I hate this new format for many reasons. But good job moving everything over.<br />
<br />
Munwin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think the new board format is great  :cool: <br />
<br />
Good job :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Question: How do you edit or set your avatar in this boards system?  I tried clicking on the Avatar links in the Quick Links and the User CP, and both of them take me to the same page (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/profile.php?do=editavatar), which has just one option available for me: &quot;Do not use an avatar&quot;.  Am I missing something blindingly obvious?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I find it frustrating to tell a board with new threads in it from a board without new threads in it.<br />
<br />
I liked the old board much better. I have to stare and squint at those icons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I will repeat.<br />
<br />
If there is any artist that wants to come up with new board icons, I will be happy to look at it.  I am not an artist myself, I claim no artistic skills.  I also have no apropriate program to even do the ideas I have... so...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Could you pinch the icons from the older version of the board?  Those were reasonably clear, and presumably you still have copies of them around, at least on a backup somewhere.<br />
<br />
There might be licensing issues, though; I've no clue if the software is copyrighted or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Actually... I did manage to loose them :/  I made a huge error on the board upgrade where I basically lost all the OLD files... (the new files worked at least so it was not a disaster)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">What's the list look like, for board icons? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">One Idea I did have is that the OLD posts (no new posts) was &quot;blank&quot; with just the lock, participated...etc on it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jaasper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Like the look of the new board. Have a problem though. It takes me a long time to read through the new posts; Ok, I read while Im playing.<br />
<br />
In the time it takes me to go through 2 threads the remainder are marked as previously read. I suspect this is a time out issue, but it would be nice to be able to set the time out time myself; or even set it to infinite so i have to hit the &quot;I have read everything&quot; button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I moved it from 15 mins to 1 hour.<br />
 <br />
It does not allow me to put in &quot;infinite&quot; like some settings do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Corker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Is there a way to get a: &quot;Mark Forum as read&quot; option for each forum?  some days I scan a particular forum for useful topics and don't want to have to read each thread to get the forum marked, but I don't want to mark the whole board as read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Is there a way to get a: &quot;Mark Forum as read&quot; option for each forum? some days I scan a particular forum for useful topics and don't want to have to read each thread to get the forum marked, but I don't want to mark the whole board as read. <br />
click on the &quot;forum tools&quot; heading when you are at the forum level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Is there a way to get the Mark forum as read to return you to the &quot;EQTC Forums&quot; level instead of the one down level?  For instance if I hit mark forum as read for DenMother's corner it returns me to the Annoucements area which doesn't show most of the rest of the forums I want to read.</div></div><hr />
