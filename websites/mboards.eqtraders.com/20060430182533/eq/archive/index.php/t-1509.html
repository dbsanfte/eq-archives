<br />
Is cultural smithing still only able to be done by smiths of that race?<br />
<br />
Anyone else think that part of cultural is messed up?  To my knowledge, any other tradeskill can make any other deity/race item.  Why has smithing been limited as such for items that are realistically, still far than superior or equal to their other tradeskill counterpart?<br />
<br />
Why don't they just make cultural forges usable by all?  Or are they now?  <br />
<br />
Anyone give some enlightenment plz.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

And Smithing is not the only skill that has recipes like this, Halflings, Woodelfs, and Erudites all have cultural Tailoring, and Woodelfs also have cultural Fletching. <br />

Personally I like it this way. I like that the different races Have their own strengths and weaknesses. I like that some cultural is not as good as others. I like that some race/diety/class combos don't have a cultural option. It isn't always fair, but it is variety that is the spice of life. If we were all the same, and could use the same skills, and were liked by the same NPC's the game would get boring rather quickly(at least for me). I played several MuDs and other &quot;RPG's&quot; like that and they never lasted more than a week.</div></div><hr />
