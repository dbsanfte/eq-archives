<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kurwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can someone please tell me if making culteral arrows (Tunare) is a good way to skill up or are the skillups slower than bows?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Osprey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's time versus money.<br />
<br />
Cheapest but most work: Acrylia arrows<br />
Slightly more expensive, slightly less work: wood elf cultural arrows<br />
Most expsensiv, least work: Bows</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am a 202 fletchewr and jsut for experimentation purposes, I played around with Mithril Champion Arrows.  I did 12 tries and only had one success (and zero skill ups).<br />
<br />
Is it advisable to use bows to get a little higher before using Wood Elf Cultural, or should I just hunker down and expect a lot of failures at first?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Footsore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A relatively small sampling, mind you, but I did 97 mithril champion combines at skills 205-207 with a total of 2 successes (and 2 skill ups). 235 wis, no gearlok.<br />
<br />
I hate precombines (I know, I better get used to it), so I ended up going the darkwood bow route to 215. <br />
<br />
Have been getting ready for another session, but using acrylia arrows. Fewer pre-combines. (Just shafts and arrowheads, vs. shafts, arrowheads and fletches.) Haven't done the calculations to see which is cheaper. Buying condensed and acrylia in bazaar can be a bit expensive, but the mithril ain't cheap either.  And, I have had a very good success rate with the acrylia arrows.<br />
<br />
I sell the acrylia at 3pp each and can't keep stocked. (On Zeb) On the other hand, the champion arrows sold for 40pp each  (but only one and 2 at a time. Not sure why that would be.)<br />
<br />
Looking at the cost and sell back of Shadewood, I think I'll stick with arrows. Plus, I get a little extra joy from selling the arrows to players that would be missing with the bows. (No way I try to put that many bows up in the bazaar!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Demorphina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mithril Champion and Blessed Champion arrows sell single or in pairs to Endless Quiver Rangers.<br />
<br />
We only need 1 arrow, so its cheap.</div></div><hr />

Ah. Live and learn. Well, at least there seem to be a lot of rangers who need them. (so far)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kurwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Honestly I dont care about selling them I just want to GM fletching I give the arrows I suceed on away. Seems like a farmless cheap alternative to other combines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Footsore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Give away? Nah. Couldn't do it.<br />
<br />
I am a GM Merchant Miner before all else. Sell below cost, maybe, but never give away.  It just wouldn't be right! Merchant Mining financed all my fancy duds (see link below) - and whatever small tradeskill advances I've made.  <br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kurwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well I can say these are good to skill up off of I did 296 Combines and went from 204 to 216 which imo is awesome.</div></div><hr />
