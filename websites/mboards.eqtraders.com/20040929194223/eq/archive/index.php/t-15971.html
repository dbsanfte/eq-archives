This is a sweet guide, works great for people who want to be GM brewers with zero farming for the least amount of money spent. I used it to get to 188 so I could reliably make smithing tempers, but a friend went the whole way. If all you want is a trophy item, this is a great way to get it; if you just want to brew tempers and tannins, this works well in a very short time; whatever you want brewing skill for, this is GREAT.</div></div><hr />

Those same suggestions of what to brew, in that order, have been out there for, lets see... years.  It's all over the forums in the guide forum.  Plus Ngreth won't click outgoing links.   ;)</div></div><hr />
