<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nhin Impious</div><div class="date">12-08-2002, 12:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently found myself in possession of 12 pieces (i.e. 6 swatches worth) of Terrorantula Silk. This being used only for Erudite cultural tailoring, and me being a Dark Elf, it's about useless to me. :roll: <br />
<br />
I can sell it back to a merchant for a bit over 3 plat a piece, gaining me 36 plat and leaving someone else either farming it or buying it from the merchant for exorbitant prices. That just hurts my little cleric heart, though, so here's my proposition.<br />
<br />
If somebody WANTS this silk and will actually use it to tailor, I will GIVE it to you if you will come meet me in Plane of Knowledge or any zone that has a PoK portal in it. Send me a tell, I'm usually on late nights after 12 central, or early mornings...<br />
<br />
Oh, and I promise to post again after I give it away, so's to spare y'all the heartache of being told I don't have it anymore.  ;) <br />

<br />
Now back to making pies and *grumble* cured silk....and the occasional smithing failure as often as I can afford it. Failed twice today on my electrum chain tunic. Maybe tomorrow I'll get another shot...<br />
