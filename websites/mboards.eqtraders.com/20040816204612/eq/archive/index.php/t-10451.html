<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>drael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tried this off and on for about 20 minutes on my fishing shammy. <br />
First, /autoinventory worked beautifully when i typed it in all by itself. Methinks just a hotkey with that will aid my forager.<br />
<br />
Second - I have never been able to get the /pause command to work unless it was on it's own line....so....I had trouble there.<br />
<br />
It did work for me in the following format and pause lengths. Now if only I could convince that pause to work on the same line.....<br />
<br />
/doability 2 (for me was fishing)<br />
/pause 100<br />
/autoinventory<br />
/pause 10<br />
/doability 2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You have to remember where the pause occurs when on the same line.  The pause occurs after the command that follows it in the line.  It works great for me, always has.</div></div><hr />

The macro casts the line three times and bags the first two results. If you dont like to bag the third result yourself, use only the first four lines of the macro.<br />

foraging works the same way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As long as i'm here, though. I put together a macro for my forager, for when i'm doing other things. It doesn't quite work right. It appears to double the value of pause, and the macro will work properly ONLY when the window showing the script is showing.<br />
<br />
/pause 300,/do 1 (forage)<br />
/pause 240,/autoinventory<br />
/pause 300,/do 1 (forage)<br />
/pause 240,/autoinventory<br />
/r time to forage! (sends a tell to whichever character i'm on now)<br />
<br />
My timer shows forage refresh to be 1 minute 40 seconds. <br />
<br />
this macro does the following:<br />
<br />
forage<br />
pause 1 minute, drop into a bag<br />
pause 50 seconds, forage again<br />
pause 1 minute, drop into a bag<br />
pause 50 seconds, forage again<br />
/reply to whomever<br />
<br />
If i close the macro window, this script will forage once, eventually drop the forage into a bag, and then /tell me, without executing the second forage command.<br />
<br />
Any ideas? Only thing I can think of is, ever clock i've got is messed up =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dryanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You've just got the pauses wrong.  300 pauses for 30 seconds, not a minute.<br />
<br />
Each 10 in a pause is equal to one second.  Further explanation from sony is available here (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?id=46881) <br />
<br />
Hope that helps :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thanks for your reply Dryanna! I guess i was unclear.<br />
<br />
I meant to say, that the text as i have it written there, is not doing what i expect it to do. That 300 you see? Actually pauses for 60 seconds. That 240? actually pauses for 50 seconds. So, I can't tell if my clocks are all screwed up, or if there's been a change, or if lengthy pauses are different? I tried a shorter, test pause:<br />
<br />
/pause 20,/do 2 (hide)<br />
<br />
This actually waits 4 seconds on that machine, then /hides.<br />
<br />
That machine is a 4 year old computer, it lags to death with any &quot;features&quot; turned on. <br />
<br />
Is the pause function being severely slowed down by my poor, old computer?<br />
<br />
I haven't messed around with /pause on my main machine yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Twistagain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">/pause 20,/do 2 (hide)<br />
<br />
This actually waits 4 seconds on that machine, then /hides.<br />
<br />
It shouldn't. It should hide, and THEN wait 2 seconds. The pause command is the only command that can be added to another command on the same line. The pause is written first and is actually executed AFTER the other command.<br />
<br />
/pause 300,/do 1 (forage)<br />
/pause 240,/autoinventory<br />
/pause 300,/do 1 (forage)<br />
/pause 240,/autoinventory<br />
/r time to forage!<br />
<br />
This should do the following (as written):<br />
1. Forage<br />
2. Pause for 30 secs<br />
3. Drop item into inventory<br />
4. Pause for 24 secs<br />
5. Forage<br />
6. Pause for 30 secs<br />
7. Drop item into inventory<br />
8. Pause for 24 secs<br />
9. Send the message</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i made a mistake. On that Hide one? Here's what i actually wrote, to try to figure out what i was doing wrong:<br />
<br />
/pause 20,/do 2 (hide)<br />
/r hiding!<br />
<br />
what it actually did was:<br />
<br />
1. hide<br />
2. wait 4 seconds<br />
3. /reply to whomever with, &quot;hiding!&quot;<br />
<br />
on this one:<br />
<br />
/pause 300,/do 1 (forage)<br />
/pause 240,/autoinventory<br />
/pause 300,/do 1 (forage)<br />
/pause 240,/autoinventory<br />
/r time to forage!<br />
<br />
What it actually does is:<br />
<br />
1. forage<br />
2. wait 60 seconds<br />
3. drop into a bag<br />
4. wait 50 seconds<br />
5. forage<br />
6. wait 60 seconds<br />
7. drop into a bag<br />
8. wait 50 seconds<br />
9. send a tell<br />
<br />
Which is NOT what it SHOULD do, but that is what it DOES. Also, it ONLY works when i can see what i've told it to do. If i close the window with the text in it, it will not work.<br />
<br />
Should i just give up now? My problem here, is that the machine is NOT pausing the expected amount of time. I finally came up with the numbers for the pauses, on the foraging script, through trial and error. <br />
<br />
is it just me that's got these pauses all messed up? Apparently, pauses are working as expected for everyone else. /sigh<br />
<br />
/em bangs her head against the brick wall a few more times</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Hanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ndaara,<br />
<br />
Your pause oddness may have an easily explainable reason behind it.  As a cleric in a rotation, I was in a guild that used the /pause command on a regular basis.  Then get upset when clerics didn't get heals off on time or notify the next person in the rotation that their time was now.  <br />
<br />
So, we had all clerics set their hotkeys the exact same way, gathered us all in a busy zone, and set off our keys like we were doing a rotation.  As it turns out, your pause command is directly related to lag, the speed of your computer, and your internet connection (the speed at which it transfers information). <br />
<br />
During the tests, the keys of  those people with a high speed connection with high speed processors worked as they should have.  Timing perfectly.<br />
<br />
Some of the rest of us were not so lucky.  A delay of 4sec (/pause 40)  could actually last anywhere from 4sec to 10sec depending on factors involved.   A pause of 7 seconds actually lasted anywhere from 7sec to 17sec.  <br />
<br />
After the tests we stopped using /pause commands and started counting for ourselves, and things went much more smoothly.  <br />
<br />
My suggestion to you would be to actually time your /pause commands and set your hotkey so that your pause time matches the tasks that you need your hotkey to perform.  I've had to modify mine a time or two for myself.   And now have ones that work for ME!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">ah! Thanks Hanna! I feel so much better!<br />
<br />
I have been timing that other computer dutifully, and finding that the pause numbers do not match up to reality. Apparently on a 4-year-old machine, /pause 300 = 50-61 seconds. /pause 240 = 40-50 seconds. etc.<br />
<br />
The issue is one of inconsistency for me. I have the other system foraging in typically lonely zones (Plane of Growth right now) and while i expect lag to be an issue for the Bazaar, i didn't think it would be when i'm the ONLY one in the zone!<br />
<br />
Anyway. I have to re-check it for the first few forages of the night, but then it seems to work well enough. Better than me trying to remember to forage and drop the result each time =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>SauriaSoulfarer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've found that I prefer to fish in person, so I just make a single cycle...<br />
<br />
/autoinventory<br />
/do 1 (fish)<br />
/do 2 (forage)<br />
/pause 10<br />
/autoinventory<br />
<br />
that way the first time you press it, it fishes, forages (after fishing because if you did it the other way around it would give the something in your hand error) and pockets whatever is foraged before the fishing is done.  You end up with whatever you fished....<br />
<br />
If it's junk, you drop it....if it's fish you press the key, it pops the fish in your bag, and starts again.   This way you got time to see what you caught, and don't have trash filling your bags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>drael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Thanks for the info about /pause and differing results. My cleric is approaching the age of ch rotations and will greatly benefit from that information.<br />
<br />
<br />
It may also explain why none of my 3 computers can ever seem to get /pause command to work unless it is on a line by itself. My three characters live on three very different computers behind a router. Prior to now, I usually 2 box and have the forager stand at a zone and collect goodies each time a monster died. Once I began to use the /autoinventory command, I noted that sometimes it never worked.<br />
<br />
I logged in the forager and 2 fishermen. The forager did just fine with the above macro as long as neither of the other two were doing anything. Then, I used the /doabiltity command (only) with the 2 fishermen and still, the foraging macro worked fine.<br />
<br />
Then I added fishing macro and only one of the 3 would begin to do the commands. All would fish/forage but only one would follow thru the whole list of commands. Lag meters all looked fine and I even tried combinations of 2 acting at the same time, spacing out the initiation of action, etc.<br />
<br />
Love the /autoinventory command, 3 cheers for the powers that be.</div></div><hr />

/fishing (have it on my #2 button)<br />
/autoinventroy (have it on my #4 button)<br />
<br />
This way I fish and can autoinventory if it's something worth keeping or I ditch it if its not.<br />
<br />
Also noted, if you are full up with inventory (I unstack some bait and fill up the slots) and you autoinventory and it's not one of those fish you want to keep (already in your inventory) you automaticly drop it as you have no more space.<br />

<br />
in game, hit alt-m and you will have a window pop up. click the tabs at the top til you get the little tiny boxes.<br />
<br />
right click one of those little tiny boxes<br />
<br />
you have a title box in the upper left corner<br />
<br />
you have 5 boxes below for 5 lines of text<br />
<br />
enter commands on those lines, and don't forget to give your hotkey a title that makes sense to you. for example, <br />
<br />
FISHING<br />
<br />
/do 2 (fish)<br />
/pause 150<br />
/autoinventory<br />

congratulations! you've made a hotkey!</div></div><hr />

is there any command to auto drop something<br />
Fishing in pog only gets me fresh fish which i don't really want to lug around wound love to auto drop them after fishing them I haven't heard of an autodrop command.  One way of arranging to drop everything you fish would be to have all your inventory slots filled so that you get the message, &quot;There was no place to put this item,&quot; when you use /autoinventory and it gets dropped to the ground.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">My druid wanted to forage a yew leaf for a friend for one of the PoK museum quests, so she headed to the Wakening Lands to do some F&amp;F (fishing &amp; foraging).<br />
<br />
Here's the Fishin' macro I worked out (comments in []):<br />
<br />
[Line 1:] /pause 125,/doability X [fish and pause 12.5 seconds]<br />
[Line 2:] /autoinventory<br />
[Line 3:] /pause 125,/doability X<br />
[Line 4:] /autoinventory<br />
[Line 5:] /doability X<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
<br />
No space after the comma following the /pause command.<br />
<br />
The /autoinventory command has to be on a separate line.<br />
<br />
The pause length seems to be affected by lag.  Sometimes I could use a pause of 110 (11 seconds) and other times I needed to increase it to 130 (13 seconds).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Never thought /pause worked right, thanks for confirming.<br />
<br />
I use <br />
<br />
/autoinventory<br />
/dobility {fish}<br />
<br />
No need for pauses and lets me see what I caught. If I don't care I spam the button. Also I don't 2 box so don't need the /tell me command.<br />
<br />
Still can't get past 188 fishing, stupid skill ups :steamed:</div></div><hr />
