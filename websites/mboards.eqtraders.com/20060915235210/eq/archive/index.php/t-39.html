From 190 to 205-210 is pure agony (or was for me) -- burning through 200 plus wyvern hides for one skillup is enough to make you cry.  But eventually you get to 205-210 and somewhere in there the skillups start to get easier again.<br />
<br />
Once you get past that hump tailoring becomes more fun again.  There are enough different options now for tailoring post 200 (velious hides, luclin flawless hoppers, solstice robes, POP Nightmare if you can farm the mephits) that it isn't quite as painful to collect components.  Still painful -- just not as much. ;)</div></div><hr />

I have actually petitioned and spoken to a GM about this.  The GM stated that you are more likely to get a skillup on a successful combine than an unsuccessful one.  So, indirectly, it does affect your skill ups, no?<br />

I almost hate to say this, but I have noticed that Tailoring skillups are coming faster now.<br />

With 255 INT I got 9 skillups (162 to 171) with 33 combines of studded rockhopper masks (with a Tunic and cloak attempt, both successful, thrown in).</div></div><hr />

I've done from 194-209 since the change.. 16 skillups, in 303 combines (1 per 19 attempts).  Of those, i had 2 &quot;hell levels&quot; of 60 and 65... certainly a difference than prior to this change.   Now instead of looking for those skillups after 25 combines, i start looking for them after 15.... i'd say that's a decent change.</div></div><hr />

But ya know somthing. Try getting a Beastlord to 255 anything is damm near impossible unless you have a guild that can help you get the items from places like WW ToV HoT Sleppers ect...  My guild cant do those places at all. For them to try would be folly. So what is one to do when you dont have much pp 2k is as high as I ever have gotten there.

<br />
<br />
That said, here is a profile I made as an example that assumes you didn't put ANY points into wisdom, (Vah Shir Base wisdom: 80 ).  All the items are either in the 2k or less range, is what you are already wearing, or could be easily gotten by you.<br />
<br />
Test Beastlord (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=485027)<br />
<br />
Remember to add 10 WIS for Qeynos Tea and Misty Thicket Picnics and 25 for Kodiaks, bringing you to 240 from base 80 with basic non-uber gear.  It may not be 255 but it beats the heck out of the 148 you are working with currently.</div></div><hr />

You dont do tailoring thats what you do. Not until you have the money to afford the heavy losses and the gear needed to minimize those losses.<br />
Any way you cut it, it is one of, if not the most expensive (Except maybe smithing) both in plat and time consumption out there.</div></div><hr />

Being a druid, WIS is my main stat ... I also try to get INT as high as poss. There seems to be an ongoing debate about whether INT actually helps with Tradeskills if WIS is the main ... can anyone confirm whether this is true or not  :?:  Also does Dexterity help or not when Tailoring  :?: <br />

True. But there have been many times that VI has stated something and we've found out that it doesn't work the way they've stated. It's a complex game and not everyone at VI can know everything about every piece of it. Us as gamers focus on our little piece of the game and quite often know more about it than the developers do as they don't have the luxury of focusing to the extent we do.<br />

If you're not seeing people getting skill ups off  PoTC combines, it's because you're not looking. Per the above thread you can see that Kirasha was running 22.676 combines per skill up from 155 to 189 on solstice robes. 771 combines for 34 skill ups.<br />
<br />
Tailors have used Solstice robes.<br />
Smiths have used Sickles.<br />
Potters have used Steins and idols.<br />
Bakers have used MTP's.<br />
<br />
Yes, people hit hell levels with PoTC items. They also hit hell levels with Luclin or Velious recipes or even old world stuff like Fine Plate.</div></div><hr />

Actually, i have been looking.... there have been way more posts on using potc items for skillups, and various people saying how horrible their runs were using them, for skillups.  I have also noticed when i do large batches of potc robes, those points tend to require many more combines.<br />
<br />
The point of it is.. different combines have different chances for skillups.  Hound fur showed that.  My opinion, from what i have personally observerd, and have seen written here is, the potc items for all of the tradeskills, are set for a lower chance to skillup.  Now, it is just my opinion... but people can look at the one person doing ok with them, or the dozen that mysteriously have 300-400+ hell levels coinciding with doing potc items.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion, but don't think that i don't pay attention... as we used to say.. stay alert, stay alive.</div></div><hr />

People are a lot more likely to complain about something when it's bad. I.E. They'll come complain about skill up rates with anything but are less likely to talk about how successful they were. So for every one person having a hard time with a particular item, there's most likely 3-4 people doing just fine with it.</div></div><hr />

What other skills have secondary skills like Smithing?<br />

Fletching runs off Dexterity, Jewelry runs off Dexterity, Tailoring will run off Dexterity soon.  Basically that means whichever is highest of Intelligence, Wisdom or Dexterity will be the stat checked for chances to raise skill.<br />

From 190-200, I had bad results-averaging 65ish combines per skill.  During the 200-210 range I had pretty good results-averaged 20-25 combines per skill point.  Then from 212-215 it took me forever (aka about 100 combines per skill point).  216-217 were about 20 each.  I think just keep combining and it will average out overall to be a decent skill up rate (not what we want, but not horrible overall either).  keep at it and good luck :)</div></div><hr />

That being said, if you have the patience to work on it then it might be worth your while.  If you don't have alot of patience, then I suggest doing something else.<br />
<br />
Alot of people don't like wasting time and materials for almost nothing to gain from it.  Tailoring is either alot of TIME spent gathering your components, or alot of PLAT buying components.  Both will still force you to have patience because you are not guaranteed any skillups when you want to increase your skill.<br />
<br />
If you are like me and farm everything, you know what it's like to go out and kill green after green after green for the components, week after week... I love it :)  Tailoring 194, 233 Flawless Rockhopper Hides just waiting for me to do a big skillup run... it's just that Acrylia keeps holding me up as well as people requesting me to make them Acrylia Studded.  I seem to getting a reputation.  I'm not too concerned about making big plat when someone requests the armor.  Need another 10 more Superb Rockhopper hides for 10 more Armor pieces to make... which means I'll have more Flawless when I do my big run hehehe... I'll get to it some day ;)<br />
