So I would love to see it, because my monk has very few color options :(</div></div><hr />

Now there is dopropertinting but the nightmare part still stands. <br />
<br />
Since a dyed green patchwork tunic is a fully different object than a &quot;patwork tunic&quot;, someone has to go and input a new object for every possible color. That is just the way EQ is made. I think he said it took 3 people working full time for a couple months to put in dyed fine steel. At first it probably seemed worth it, but the novelty wore off pretty darn fast and now in retrospect it probably seems like a waste of time.<br />

&quot;READ MY LIPS: NO NEW TINTING, MARCH 29, 2001 <br />
Source: EverQuest Developer's Corner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can all crafted armor have tinting? In smithing you may use various dyes to colour a certain armor. I was thinking that maybe this could be expanded to all crafted armor(tailored also) And maybe eventually to all Store bought or crafted. I would allow for a greater customization of character.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately, each item colored in such a way is actually an entirely different item from others like it. This is an unfortunate limitation of the EverQuest engine. So creating such items would take a lot of time and would use up a lot of database space. <br />

&quot;TRADESKILLS: FROM THE DALLAS FAN FAIRE, FEBRUARY 1, 2002&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we ever dye armor or put a makers mark on items?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The problem is the way we do our items is on a global scale.  So if you were to dye your armor to a color it would actually be destroying item A and replacing it with item B.  The same with makers marks.  So to do every color combination with every item dyeable would obviously take forever.  It's simply impossible to add makers marks for the same reason.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Both of those quotes were a long time after fine steel dyed plate was in and referred to additional dying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Petercorbin</div><div class="date">01-13-2003, 03:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it would be cool to an extent for dyed armors and i agree dyed leathers makes a lot more sense than dyed platemail.. unless the platemail dyes were used at the creation of the object.. maybe that would eliminate that &quot;deleting an item and creating an item&quot; snafu...   But i kinda like having unique looks for haze panther and cobalt drake and black panther and dream haunt and wicker and other armors.. <br />
<br />
I can see the programming nightmare here from what was said above will make it impossible to ever see this with all the other stuff they need to work on to balance/fix/implement/upgrade/tweak etc.... <br />
<br />
I just wish the dev team would just SHUT UP about how little space is left in the data base for new items.  SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP PLEASE... this is the dumbest excuse i've heard from SoE for items players want and they dont want to work on.. If they were so worried about database room why do they keep making 15 different 12 piece set armors that have the same look and stats as cloth, and 10 different ones for ringmail and so on.. and omg the SCORES of useless and pointless (other than RPG &quot;flavor&quot; of allllll the stupid alcholic drinks and foods in Luclin.. I swear every bar on the moon has like 10 unique drinks.  <br />
<br />
They could delete several hundred of these items from the game and no body would really care.    And the HUGE assortment of &quot;cash&quot; loots gets out of hand sometimes.. Fungus grove mushrooms have it right.. 3 diff dropped parts, each one going up in value in relation to rarity.. and a nice mask that is very rare drop... just a lot of other areas in luclin and pop have this messed up pretty bad.. grimlings for example have like 12 different etched acrylia runes and 12 or so different luclin gem drops and 4 different types of acrylia and eyes and other body parts on their loot table.. The acrylia is fine but they could have done just 3 runes and 3 gems and it would have been fine... and THEN the couple hundred new mobs and items they made for all the new newbie quests from starting cities.. while this was a very good idea, many of the items for the quests could have been existing in game items and not new ones... <br />
<br />
/shrug sorry I just really hate hearing &quot;the database is almost full and we cant make new items like gnome rogue clockwork or cultural barbarian tailoring or dyed armor blah blah blah&quot; every time someone comes up with a cool idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Murias</div><div class="date">01-14-2003, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree Petercorbin. They would probably have enough space to make dyed leather if they had the grimlings drop 4 kinds of etched acrylia runes instead of a dozen. hehe<br />
<br />
I've often wished for dyed leather, just like a lot of people have. It doesn't even have to be huge array of colors, just something other than brown. :\</div></div><hr />

Oh and bless the success generator to give me more successes (don't need skill ups since i'm 250) especially on the good stuff like haze panther tunics.<br />
