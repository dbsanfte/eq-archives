<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>miseguy2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a 38 Rogue, Van Shir, working on Pottery skills.  I alread have received the Novice Runequill Set.  The problem I have is my Ayyad's clay bowl will no londer combine  2 lumps of gray mud, 1 xakra bile, 1 flask of water to make the gray clay needed to make many of the Van Shir specific pottery items.    Any ideas. <br />
<br />
I did double and tripple check my ingrediance.. I was quite miffed because I have just harvested 20 lumps of gray mud to continue working on my stats?<br />
<br />
I did petition a GM but in the three hours I was on, I received no response.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
