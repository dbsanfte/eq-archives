<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sansaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got bored tonight and decided to skillup instead of hunt XP or PP... so, I spent about 150pp or so (didn't count and had wonderful combine rate with high sellback... after I hit 135, every 40 combines only cost me 10pp or so) and skilled up from 133 to 162. Stopped there because n00bs in Kele started begging for bows... &quot;that do as much dmg as possible... btw, I can only afford 5pp...&quot; oi.<br />
<br />
So, the next time I get bored, guess I'll work on getting to 202 and then 250 is just a really long stretch of boredom and countless lost PP... but, hey, as a ranger, it is my duty to persue this goal. :)<br />
<br />
So, I know this question is the subject of every other thread in this forum, but what is the cheapest route from 202 up? I know it'll depend on how I acquire the parts... I'm just looking for personal experiences here. Which recipes do I need to concentrate on? Trying to parse through the trivial list isn't the easiest thing... especially when I still see arrow shafts and field point arrowheads combining in front of my eyes... hopefully, that'll disappear after some sleep. ;-)<br />
<br />
Also, lvl 29 here, so if you mention farming locations, keep that in mind and try to give me an idea of what lvl that farm is for. :) Not too much to ask is it? Next I'll be wanting someone to do my laundry and whatnot, but we'll see how this assignment fares first.<br />
<br />
As you see, I have gone a bit batty after a large number of arrow combines. Don't mind me.<br />

Don't despair, though your still too low for the major acrylia drop zones, if you spend the next ten levels in Dawnshroud Peaks in tribal groups you'll get some acrylia to drop, however, it can get fairly frustrating, as it tends to be a bit few and far between.  I started in tribal groups at around 29 or 30, and walked out at 39, only because a lot of the tribals I would hunt (the ones at the Grieg's End zone area seem to drop the best) were all starting to con light blue, there are other, higher tribals, but I was never thrilled with their drop rates.  This spot gives you the added bonus of being outdoors, and odds are, if you've followed what has become the norm for level progression, you've just recently come out of PC, where pulling is really no effort at all.  However, I found DSP to be an execellent zone to refine my pulling skills.  For that matter, as long as you've got a decently competent healer, you can be puller and MT, less time lost trying to have someone else pulls agro.  However, depending on your confidence, you may want to bring a chanter for mezzes.  Though, often, I never did.  One of my guild clerics is still amazed about the dozen tribal pull I did once... without a chanty, boy, was that fun.  :D  And you will eventually on almost every pull get adds, as tribals have a pretty substantial agro range, and your faction with them will just plummet once you start really hunting there, and eventually it's just not worth the time and effort trying to harmony every possible add, just root park or mezz.</div></div><hr />
