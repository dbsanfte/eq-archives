As I have returned from a 6 month break (yes, the real world does offer things as well) when i came back, the zones that usually are fully of newbies, tradeskillers, etc are all empty. No, i didnt get the SOL expansion yet, and now that i want it, stores dont stock it. Ok, enough excuses....<br />
<br />
I have started almost all of the tradeskills and am at Journeyman status in most of them (JC and pottery are still apprentice) and just wanted to know what course would be best at the moment.<br />

<br />
At this point, there are a LOT of people at or above 200 in most tradeskills.  There are fewer people capable of doing some specific cultural stuff (I'm thinking Troll Smithing, for example), but there's also probably relatively little demand for the items, compared to the cost to raise those skills.<br />
<br />
As far as doing tradeskills, do what you enjoy.<br />
<br />
As far as supplying stuff for tradeskills, take a look around the bazaar and get a sense for what is selling for what prices, then think about how much time it will take you to get an item to sell, and if you're getting exp or having other fun getting that item.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />
