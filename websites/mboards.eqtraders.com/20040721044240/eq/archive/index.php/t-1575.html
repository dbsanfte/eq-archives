<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kinare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Phuror (and no, not the guy from FOH, some person on RN's mule), you send my mule tells every day he is on about the Fulvous Darkscale armor he has for sale.<br />
<br />
Phuror tells you, 'Do you make Fulv armor by chance or just selling your old stuff?'<br />
<br />
You told Phuror, 'AFK Message: I can smith any of the Fulvous, Crimson, or Blackened Darkscale armor. Tell me what you want and I'll check my tells when I get back, make it, and put it up for sale.'<br />
<br />
Just in case you didn't see the afk message, yes, I have a smith that can make Fulv armor. The prices for Fulv are the same as the prices I have for other stuff. You have been asking my mule this since the dawn of time (okay, maybe like 3 months) and he still has the same AFK message. Post here, send me a PM, or send the mule a tell and your armor will be made if the materiels are available.<br />
<br />
Cross posting this to several boards because I have no idea who this person is.</div></div><hr />
