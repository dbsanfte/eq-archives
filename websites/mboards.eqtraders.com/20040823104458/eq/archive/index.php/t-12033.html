<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ranger_Lahru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">From my own attempts at finding the Fiend Gut and being informed that this only drops in a particular encounter in POF, which I think is Bogus (probably because I  am no where near obtaining it), I have gone in search of parts for the other bows.  So far it seems to me that the rare things to find on RN are:<br />
<br />
Stonewood Bow Staff (although more common than the following)<br />
Featherwood Bow Staff<br />
Primordial Driftwood Bow Staff<br />
Slarghilug Kelp<br />
Fiend Gut<br />
Chunk of E'cian Ice<br />
Chunk of WindMetal<br />
<br />
<br />
What do you know to be the hard parts to get?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arrica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm constanly on the lookout for Vegerog Vines in the bazaar on A Ro.  Most I've ever seen is one at a time, and at 30k to boot. :eek:   I had hoped to slowly afford supplies for a couple of attempts at making my own for when I hit 61 as opposed to actually shelling out for the bow itself (anywhere from 85 to 100k :( ), but at prices like that, I'm thinking I'll be best just saving, saving, and saving to buy one, and someday make one, and re-sell the one I bought (something about making my own implents of destruction makes me all warm and tingly :D ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Osprey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Quick Guide<br />
<br />
Fire<br />
1. Molten ore: drops off random mobs, not common but certainly not rare. You can get this off mobs at the zone in area, and some classes can solo there<br />
<br />
2. Obsidianwood bow staff: random drop, again, not uncommon<br />
<br />
3. Fiend guts: Can only drop from fiends (the big red demon mobs) These mobs do not spawn except for the Fennin Ro event or the named demon Blazzax. So figure a big guild takes them out and they keep what few guts they get. You might see 3-4 from a run on Fennin.<br />
<br />
Net result: you'll easily buy two parts and be stuck on fiend guts. Odds are you'll only see completed bows for sale.<br />
<br />
Water<br />
1. Chunk of E'cian Ice: drops randomly from mobs deeper in, mostly slarhilug from my memory. The thing is that it makes great armor - farwater plate, so it's in demand for that more than bows.<br />
<br />
2. Bow staff: again, random drop from slarhilug<br />
<br />
3. Slarhilug kelp strands: same thing.<br />
<br />
None of these pieces are rare, per se. The thing to realize here is that (at least on my server) people don't just go exp in water. It's a huge pain to fight in and nobody goes in and just happens to pick up bow parts. The ice is in demand for plate, so I guess that's the sticking point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Earth<br />
1. Immaculate Steel: random drop mostly from rockfiend type mobs. Easily obtained by a single group near the zone in.<br />
<br />
2. Stonewood bow staff: same, except substitute &quot;treants&quot;<br />
<br />
3. Vegerog vines: ah the rare one. This only drops from a certain type of mob - sometimes called compost heaps, or vegerogs or whatever. They look like the Construct of Nightmares at the end of the hedge maze. There aren't many of these near the zone in, and in earth the zone in is really the only place without mobs roaming close by. On the far side of the zone there are lots of vegerogs on a flat platform, but it's part of a ring event and if you pull them you could mess it up for days or longer. So people rarely mess with them, unless you're doing the ring which is in fact where most vegerog vines come from.<br />
<br />
Air<br />
1. Wind Metal: random drop from turkeybirds and some other mob types<br />
<br />
2. Bow Staff: random drop from a few different mob types<br />
<br />
3. Air arachnid silk: drops somewhat commonly from spiders. But there are a few catches. First, air is arranged in a mostly linear fashion. There are no stable camps - you get roamers pathing up and down the islands, so it's not much of an exp zone. Also, the spiders are way way way up top on the last island, so the only ones you see for a long time are the ones that roam. Did I mention that the spiders are nearly invisible, and brutal mobs that will shred people quickly? When a guild is working on the avatar of dust, then they'll get lots, but otherwise nobody goes near the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>lonewylfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">slarg kelp isn't that uncommon on RN...I find it on vendors a good bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Osprey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">True - I guess the entire thing should be prefaced by &quot;Your mileage may vary&quot;  I can only really speak for the kind of things that happen on my server.  So on some servers some things may be more commonly hunted than others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Greymantle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sticker for most of them seems to be the string componet. Is either a rare drop or requires a raid to get. I am even haveing trouble getting strings for nightmare bows, no silks for sale and no drops after severl hours of hunting spiders. Is there any special camp for the spiders in PON?<br />
 Have been selling cams in the bazaar, molten sells quite often and the steel one went for 20k, has been financing my equipment upgradeds heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The consort spiders in PoN are the ones you need for the silk.  The yard trash spiders do not drop the silk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aavar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I thought one of the mini named in fire is also a Demon and can drop fiend guts.<br />
<br />
forgot the name though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Galain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Blazzax is the mini you are thinking of, and the above poster mentioned him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aavar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">no blazzaz is not the mini im thinking of its one of the mobs you can kill with 1 group.<br />
Blazz is not a mini named he takes a raid to take down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Malodium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">basically you can forget obout ever getting enough items to make a few bows privately for sale, unless you have some powerful friends<br />
The only elemental bow stuff I have ever seen anywhere is stuff we get on raids, which of course means that the bows I make with em go back to the guild.<br />
<br />
The only elemental bows I have ever seen for sale are being sold by big guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Abazagaroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It simply requires waiting and searching the bazaar all the time. My server has a situation where few tradeskill items from elemental planes ends up on the market, as there is a cartel like situation and an embargo on selling tradeskill components. But, I have seen almost all the different parts for sale at one point or another. Just today I picked up a stonewood staff and have the stuff to give the stonewood bow a try *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Malodium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lately I have been seeing a stonewoord bow staff or two up for sale.  but 50k!?? sheesh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bregalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">On Xev, there's pretty much never any water or air bow components for sale.   fire stuff is dirt cheap, except for the guts of course.  Those are never there.<br />
Stonewood...   staves are often seen for 5-20kpp, immaculate steel is anywhere from 500 to 5000.  Vines are the rub, seen them only couple times so far, at about 40kpp each.   Given that stonewoods go for 190kpp+, spending ~100k making one is not a bad deal...   unless you fail, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Malodium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I saw some Stonewood staves at 22k the other day.  Cheapest ive seen em.<br />
I bought some immaculate steel for a few hundred plat, pretty good deal I spose.  <br />
But yeah, the vines are the tough part.<br />
Havnt seen any yet.<br />
Went hunting in PoE the other day, seems like it would be possible to get a group over to where they drop, although a bit scary.<br />
Problem is this event.  We wouldnt want to trigger it, anyone know of any vine mobs that can be killed without starting the event? And that a single group could get to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ianthe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You don't really trigger the vine event per se... You have to kill all the vine mobs in X amount of time to spawn the named.<br />
<br />
In my mileage the bows staves are rare compared to the vines.  Course being in a raiding guild we rarely kill the trees and have killed the vine ring several times.<br />
<br />
For rare parts on the bows I'd go:<br />
Fire - Guts, but the least wanted bow<br />
Air - Silk - Spiders are a pain and can't really xp in air easily<br />
Water - Ice - For us is just plain the rarest drop and all the people want the armor<br />
Earth - Staff - Vines drop fairly common, and if you find the spot, the camp is very easy to get to and keep to kill them</div></div><hr />
