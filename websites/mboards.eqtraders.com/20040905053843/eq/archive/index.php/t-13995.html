<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>evilsofa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't know if anyone else has noticed, but the Yttrium Steel Sheet recipe is preloaded in the new UI, and lists the trival for the recipe as 335!<br />
<br />
Perhaps we should be starting a sticky thread for each tradeskill, noting which &gt;250 recipes have their trivials listed in the UI.  This is what I would call valuable information.  Some recipes may show up later once they have been learned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dandolo1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Maybe I've missed this in another thread, but does this also mean that +mod items stack??<br />
<br />
ie. XTC hammer + VT gloves + Seru belt + GM trophy all increase your effective skill??<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bregalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No, confirmed it now, they don't stack.<br />
<br />
I have two +5% research items, and it showed my skill as 210 regardless weather I equipped one or both.<br />
<br />
And 252 skill is still max - I have 250 JC + trophy, and UI shows my skil las 252.<br />
<br />
I know this is not a straight - line correlation, but think of your skill to trivial ratio as success chance:  so at skill 252, you got about 75% chance to succeed an Yttrium sheet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daikoku Ashikaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think the sucess rate I have seen with 250-252 skill on the sheets is like 1 in 8, it is far less then 3/4 from anone that has done them that I know.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Annalina Romanov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Unfortunately, unless there's a way to gather around 500+ trials, we really won't know for sure. On the other hand, we CAN figure out what the trivial failure chance (that we all love to hate) is, though somebody's going to have to around 500 combines or so. (Why 500? It's a statistics thing, don't ask.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Abazagaroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am 0 for 3 on the sheets, and absolutely disgusted with spending 5-7 hours in the deep for 1-2 saps.<br />
<br />
From people in guilds that have done a lot of these, it seems its a 1/3 chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daikoku Ashikaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Seru bane is really not needed anymore for the fight, especially concidering he is  SoL and has the sandard  AC associated with mobs there, devaluing melee damage as it is.<br />
<br />
Unless there is one smith that was detailed with gearing his/her whole guild back in the day,  there will never be a true statistial run.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>evilsofa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I happen to have done a fair number of Yttrium Steel Sheets.  I did not keep records of this, but I did about 50 or 60 in rather large runs of a dozen to 20 at a time, and it always seemed to average out to a 50 percent success rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heraldic also trivials at 335, and I run about 40% success on over 200 pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valatar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hi Toad!<br />
<br />
Anyways have done around 50 sheet attempts at 250 skill+trophy and seem to be just above 50% success.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Baldaek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In a similar vein, MTP's triv at 335 and I'm succeding at about a 60 to 65% rate with a 252 modified skill.  So maybe the Yttrium actually succeeds at a 60% or so rate and your luck was not so much so that particular time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gaell Stormracer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think the 50% number is right, which may be why we've seen a number of other recipes flagged at 335 trivial....<br />
<br />
Have there been any trivs verified (via UI) at higher than 335?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Reph</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Remember, as per the dev's supposed remarks, although an item has a certain triv - the harder items have an inherently higher failure rate than normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Seani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">On a total of 556 heraldic smithing combines I have done, success rate is 47.8%</div></div><hr />
