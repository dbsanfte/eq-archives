<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>hyelaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I really want to make the new Iced White Wine.  I see on the main page that this item is sold on Tallik Jaggedfire in EC.  When I went there to purchase it, there was none...  Does he really sell it or did he just buy some off of a PC?  Has anyone tried to make this yet?  Is my only option foraging in MM?<br />

Any help would be greatly appreciated,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>YurienStonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">none of the new drops in LDoN are static sells on merchants. i think that was jsut a mistake by one of the site writers. if you cna find them on the emrchants they will cost roughly 11p per item and you should prolly check all the camps in one trip</div></div><hr />
