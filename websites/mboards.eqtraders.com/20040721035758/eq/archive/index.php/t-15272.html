<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">At lvl 55 I have not done AA's to raise my WIS cap, so with KEI it is about 255. I was told that I should wait till lvl 65 to do skillups post 200 at Tradeskills since the Tradeskills at 200+ will need a WIS or INT of 300 to 350.<br />
Let me ask.......how much quicker are skill-ups at Tradeskills from skill 200 to 250 if you have a WIS/INT of 350 vs 255?<br />
Is it much quicker with 350 WIS?   Would I get to Tradeskill GM 250 twice as fast with a WIS of 350?<br />
Should I not attempt to go for GM 250 in a skill if my WIS is only 255? I was looking to get Tailoring to GM 250 first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If there is a difference it isnt by any means HUGE. The skill up rate pre-PoP (when cap was 255) was considered by many to be roughly 1 in 20-25 combines. While this did vary somewhat between the different trade skills, it was a commonly held belief. Post-PoP when Wis can get MUCH higher the 1 in 20-25 combines skill up rate hasnt changed much. While sometimes I got lucky and got 1 skill in 17-18 combines over a few skill points, it all panned out to about 1 in 20ish combines. <br />
<br />
Note: I am a ranger thus all my stats cap at 305. If skill up rate was pretty muc the same between 255 and 305 I would have to assume there isnt much difference had I been able to hit 350.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Itek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There seems to be a difference, but it's not what you would call huge.<br />
<br />
In some baking thread (search baking, by author Itek) there were a couple people who posted big data from the 200 to 250 range on baking on MTP (misty picnics) with various Wis/Int scores.<br />
<br />
Going from 255 to 355 might save you as much as 10% or so total combines. So if you can, or would anyway, blow the 25 AA points on Planar Power-5 and Innate Enlightenment-5 for the extra 75 stat points I'd say &quot;GO FOR IT&quot; .... but if 25 AA is prohibitive I wouldn't lose any sleep over it. <br />
:cool:<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
Oh, you CAN NOT raise your WIS cap till level 61+ and CAN NOT have a 355 WIS till level 65. Period. You are NOT ALLOWED to buy those AA powers till then. Sorry.<br />
<br />
You can get a tradeskill up to 250 before level 51. (My wife did it with brewing, and had a trophy even, and had a WIS well under 255 to boot. It just took a while, but it was brewing so it was still cheap.)<br />
<br />
You can get the other 6 up to 250 once you can buy NTCM with AA points. But spending 18 AA on tradeskills at level 51 .... is NOT advised. Level up. Getting AA exp is much easier at higher level. I didn't believe it when I started, but I learned the error of my ways.<br />
<br />
I spent a good deal of time and energy collecting data on how much exp it took to gain each level compared to gaining an AA point. Level 51 I put 50% into AA. Each following level I spent 20% of each level putting 50% and seeing how fast the level went up as a ratio of the AA. I have a xml mod to my player window that shows percentage AA and Level exp constantly.<br />
<br />
Here is a chart showing how many AA points it takes to go from &quot;just dinged into&quot; a level to &quot;dinging out&quot; of that level. Numbers are a little rough but close enough that most people won't notice the difference.<br />
<br />
51 = 1 AA (exactly)<br />
52 = 1.5 aa<br />
53 = 1.5 aa<br />
54 = 2.5 aa (first hell level)<br />
55 = 3 aa<br />
56 = 3 aa<br />
57 = 3 aa (closer to 3.125 but who's counting)<br />
58 = 3.5 aa<br />
59 = 4 aa (second hell level)<br />
60 = 2.5 aa (yes, 59 -is- harder than 60)<br />
61 = 4.5 aa (nope, 61's harder than 59)<br />
62 = 5 aa<br />
63 = 5 aa<br />
64 = 5.5 aa<br />
65 = 6 aa<br />
<br />
So 49 AA points is the difference between &quot;just dinged 51&quot; and &quot;maxed bar 65&quot; .... And 18 AA is practically the difference between 51 and 59. 25 AA is the difference between dinging 61 and a healthy bit into 65. Ask around... going from 61 to 65 is MUCH faster than 51 to 55. (Cause you can fight stuff that gives loads more exp.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">First off, congrats on posting that list and the work involved in getting it. Gives new insight for me into the what I'm doing.<br />
<br />
59 = 4 aa (second hell level) <br />
<br />
Amen. I just finished 59. I level slow, but 59 was a nightmare.</div></div><hr />
