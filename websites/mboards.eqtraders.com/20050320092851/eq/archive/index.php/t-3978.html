<br />
There up, and some are rather cool. Looks like what some people wanted with a new version of the Kedge people. Look at THIS (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=3736&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0) link to see my poll about it.  :D <br />
I like them, they look nasty...<br />
<br />
EDIT: Adding text from the sight;<br />
<br />
Broken Skull Rock is the home of a clan of trolls that sails the seas and takes what it wants from those they encounter. This has attracted the attention of certain members of other races that wish to join them. While those of other races never become full-fledged members of the clan, some do become a part of the crew of their ships.<br />
<br />
~PIC<br />
<br />
Humans can be found on Broken Skull Rock. Just like any member of the clan, recruits wear tattoos to show their loyalty to the clan.<br />
<br />
~PIC<br />
<br />
Trolls do not distinguish between the sexes of other races very often, and a female recruit can be just as successful as a male.<br />
<br />
~PIC<br />
<br />
Ogres make desirable crew members for their strength and cunning. Ogres that come to Broken Skull Rock with plans to become ship's captains or even rulers of the clan have encountered difficulty. They have discovered that not only are the trolls insular, but they are advised by the powerful and intelligent luggalds.<br />
<br />
~PIC<br />
<br />
These luggalds are always seen lurking in the shadows of the island or in the depths offshore. No one is sure how many of these creatures are on Broken Skull Rock, for rarely is one seen without their concealing robes or armor.<br />
<br />
~PIC<br />
<br />
Luggalds veil themselves in dark robes when traveling among the lesser creatures that dwell on the land. At times this is to allow them more freedom, making them less recognizable for what they are. But they also value the effect such garb has on those that see them. Many creatures hate and fear what they do not fully understand.<br />
<br />
~PIC<br />
<br />
But the luggalds are also prepared to fight. Their armor, while primarily meant for use battling foes under water, serves them well enough on land.<br />
<br />
~PIC<br />
<br />
The trolls of Clan Broken Skull do not doubt their own power, believing themselves to be in control of all that happens on their island and in the seas as far as their ships range. Their shamans have gleaned powerful knowledge from the luggalds and have combined that knowledge with their own ancient traditions. And so it is that on Broken Skull Rock, a troll never ceases to be a productive member of society. Even after their lives have been given in service to their clan, unless their bodies are claimed by the sea itself, their corpses continue to make the clan strong.<br />
<br />
~PIC<br />
<br />
Only the very strongest, quickest and smartest members of the clan avoid such a fate to become ship's captains or leaders. This clan leader has earned his right to rule in numerous battles at sea. And if you believe that the loss of his hand has reduced his ability to lead or to hold his position... well, he is quite prepared to prove otherwise.</div></div><hr />

It reminds me of all of the cartoons where a giant fish partially swallows a person head first.     And, um I am gonna get in trouble for this one, it has that androgynous anorexic supermodel look to it.  (Has to be a male character all things considered.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velikij</div><div class="date">02-19-2003, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I think its a bit weak.  All they did was post pics of existing mob types with new skins (besides the Lug folks) and some story line behind them.  Kinda like the Vah Shir - human model with a few skin tweaks is all they are.  You'd think that with all the money they're making, they might be able to get some fresh talent/ideas for the imagery.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really kewl look though for the troll and female human pirates though.</div></div><hr />

True, it could have a little more infromative but what fun would it be if they showed you everything before the extension even comes out? They want you to discover it for yourselves, and I think we can agree thats more fun anyway.  :D</div></div><hr />

That's all.</div></div><hr />
