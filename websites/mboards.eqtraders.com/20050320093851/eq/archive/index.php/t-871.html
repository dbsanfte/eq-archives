With EverQuest having been out since May of 1999 it was bound to happen, someone broke 500 played days and discovered something interesting, apparently your name color changes to Gold. <br />
<br />
Congrats goes to Behemoth of FoH for announcing this fact to the public in general. It takes a real hard core player to get that many played days i mean that is 12 Thousand Hours of being on EQ. <br />
<br />
i bet there are literally dozens if not hundreds of people that will break the 500day mark soon since EQ is a way of life - a pasttime for us like baseball - heck you can listen to baseball in the summer and play eq.. <br />
<br />
the next question everyone is dreading the answer for.... <br />
<br />
What happens to your name at 1000 played days? <br />
