Actually, www.eqtraders.com &gt; Recipes &gt; GoD &gt; brewing lists the new recipes. <br />
<br />
What it doesn't do, however, is list a source for the tea leaves, which was my question, not where the recipes are.</div></div><hr />

That sort of sucks, because I just found out that after doing the progressive brewing quest I could combine a Taelosian tea leaf in a brew barrel and get one Taelosian Tea back. <br />

Kind of sucks that I can get two by handing the component to an NPC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where did you find them? :D <br />
<br />
Recipes are here (http://www.eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=229&amp;rsa=Brewing&amp;sb=item&amp;sub=GoD&amp;menustr=080030039000).<br />
<br />
The combine is probably 1 Mountain Tea Leaves by itself in a brew barrel, like it is with Taelosian Tea Leaves. However, you may have to do the progressive brewing quest (http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q142&amp;menustr=120037000000) before you're able to make the combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Diirk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">They drop (very rarely) in the deeper in zones like kod`taz etc. Apparently the other brewing vendor will take 1 mountain tea leaf and give you 2 mountain teas, too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm becoming more and more convinced that the drop rates on these teas is way too low. <br />
<br />
No one will care enough about the results of these teas to bother brewing the teas, except as a novelty. <br />
<br />
Bah. I really wanted more teas to choose from as stat food/rp stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kemie Dreamshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I would agree that the drop/forage rates are more than a little messed up, so far as I have seen in Natimbi.<br />
<br />
Surely the developers did not NEED to make hynid meat and cragbeast meat the common forages in Natimbi (considering the prolific fish tables already available for bakers).  Perhaps they would be open to the suggestion the brewing and baking forages be flipped, with more brewing components turning up than baking in an effort at some balance.<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, tea OIL, which is used only to treat shimmering thread for tailoring, is far more common than moldy tea leaves or the twigs as a forage, or at least on the runs I've done so far.<br />
<br />
Scarcity of taelosian tea leaves as well as the hynid blood needed for tailoring and the aligned ore for smithing and the stones for fletching in the loot drop tables is also something that needs to be addressed.  It's nice to see so much for the bakers among us, but the extreme contrast of overflowing abundance for them and paucity for the rest of us shows a certain carelessness on the part of the programming.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Taeloasian Tea Leaves drop off trash mobs, not sure all zones but got one in Natimbi.<br />
<br />
Hand in will give 2 Taelosian Tea back<br />
Self preparing (after having done the quest) will give 1 to 3 Tea back. Note that this is &quot;skilled&quot; seperately from your actual skill, I get a blue message when I combine the tea as I am still &quot;learning&quot; how to do it. <br />
<br />
But I do think they are too rare, especially as they are not that great. Kaladim's are better in some respects and a whole lot easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Taelosian tea leaves (and as far as i know, any of the level 1 GoD components) can drop off more or less anything  in pre Kod`Taz zones (Natimbi, Qinimi, Ferubi, Riwwi, Barindu, snlair, snplant, sncrematory, tipt, vxed, and the other sn zone that i forgot the name of)<br />
<br />
The level 2 components (mountain tea, shimmering ore, aged scales, etc) only drop in Kod`Taz+ zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>draethor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I think the drop rate is fine, if the reward would be worth it.<br />
<br />
Consider smithing: the drop rate on the shimmering nihilite and the shimmering ore is around 1:200. Makes some very rewarding items, so if you did a couple xp groups there 1 or 2 would drop. Makes it very well worth the time.<br />
<br />
However, for every other TS the reward does not justify the time. The best JC item I've seen made, for instance, is not as good as a black sapphire necklace. Go figure.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Emptybuckets</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The deal with processing those leaves is that in order to process them on your own in a brew barrel without having to turn them into the npc's in Abysmal Sea, you have to go through the process of actually turning  them into those npcs anyway.  You have to be taught the process of refining the leaves on your own, and those npcs will do it if you turn in a fairly large number of the leaves.  You aqquire invisible brownie points with the npcs as you turn them in, and once you've accumulated enough points, they teach you the skill.  As your skill in brewing increases, your chances of getting back more teas per leaf increases.  Lower skill lvls will give you at least 1 tea back, high lvls sometimes give 2, and at very high skills lvls there are always 2, and chances for 3 returns.  Careful though, each trainer in any of the skills has a freebie quest, in which they give you supplies to combine and return to them, and one which requires you to go out and collect the items from mob drops and return them.  With the freebie quest, there's 400 turn-ins needed, the collect ones requiring only 120 (still takes much longer than the freebie quest).  However, since the collect ones are harder to do, you will get more out of them.  You can only do one or the other, freebie or collect... once you complete one in its entirety, the other quest for that tradeskill will become unavailable to you. In this case, the reward for completing the collection quest for the brewing skill gains you the skill to process both regular and mountain taelosian teas.  The freebie only grants you access to the taelosian tea.  <br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">In this case, the reward for completing the collection quest for the brewing skill gains you the skill to process both regular and mountain taelosian teas.

<br />
Hmm, I can make both normal and mountain tea and I only did the freebie quest. Unless of course I can process both, but will only get better at normal tea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Emptybuckets</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Really??  Well then, err uhh... they lied to us!  The NPCs themselves even tell you that you only learn the one skill by doing the freebie quest and the other one allows for both types.  I been had I tell ya, it's a bum rap...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Xerelise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Ahh but if you had read the quest section on the site you wouldn&quot;t of been dupped :P<br />
<br />
Stolen from the quest section:<br />
<br />
The freebie version of the quest will take just over three times as many successful handins (400 total) to complete as the collect version (120 total), to make up for the fact that you don't have to collect any mob drops.<br />
<br />
In each case, you are earning invisible brownie points with the two quest NPCs for that specific tradeskill. The points from both versions of the quest can be mixed and matched, but there are limits. When you earn enough brownie points (400), the NPCs will teach you how to handle the raw material on your own, without their intervention. Once you complete the quest, you are &quot;taught&quot; the process of converting the raw material on your own. Basically, this involves putting 1 unit of the raw material in the proper tradeskill container (forge, brew barrel, etc.) and hitting combine. When you first learn how to convert the material, you will receive, on average 1.5 units, for every unit you convert. (Half the time you'll get 1 back, the other half the time you will get 2 back.) While this is less, overall, than you would receive from the NPC, the more that you work with the material, the better you get. Eventually, you will always get at least 2 units of the material back, and once you have become highly skilled at working with the material, you have a chance at getting 3 units of the material back. Until you have completed one of the quests, however, you will be unable to perform the applicable conversion on your own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Emptybuckets</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Looks like I didn't read closely enough, I didn't see the part that said the freebie quest teaches you both.  <br />
<br />
Although, no need to be condescending... assume that maybe I made a mistake and I'm not just so ignorant as to post information that I haven't read anything about.  /bow  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>EQForager</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I can wholeheartedly agree the rate in which the Taelosian Tea Leaves come into Norrath is entirely too low.<br />
<br />
While working on my Forage Percentage Chart, I spent quite a bit of time foraging in Barindu. To say the least, in 550 forages, 19 of them came out to be the Taelosian Tea Leaves... while 160 of them were various Hynid and Cragbeast meats.<br />
<br />
I have saw one person selling the new teas in bazaar... and she only had a stock of 5 of them. I occasionally see the tea leaves themselves up in bazaar, but they have an average going price of 250 to 500p each.<br />
<br />
For something that produces an item worse then the Qeynos Afternoon Teas, they sure make it fairly hard to get...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The fact that they are &quot;worse&quot; than QAT is a matter of opinion.  Up until GoD came out there was nothing drinkwise that gives +HP/mana.  Granted, it is only 10, however, to someone with maxed stats, and as far as INT/WIS goes this is far from difficult to do, the +mana/hp are wonderful to have, and I am happier to use the GoD tea than QAT.<br />
<br />
(also, it appears that the developers wanted to take the extreme advantage foragers had away from this expansion.  Those leaves drop quite often in Tipt/Vxed trials, a typical clearing will yield 2-5 of them, it stands to reason that a forager should not be able to find an item that is rare for a mob to drop, if the mob can't find it to eat it, why should a ranger be able to =P)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Pointee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">My bottleneck is the ginseng and mint.<br />
<br />
I find plenty of tea leaves for sale at 20-75pp. When I dont get enough drops from exp/farming. I am receiving 2 everytime I process my own now with the occasional 3. <br />
<br />
I have a few stacks of processed tea but it takes me a while to get enough mint/ginseng to go along with them.<br />
<br />
I dont like to make the non mint/ginseng teas....although I probably should since I would guess 99.9% of the people who buy my tea are doing it strictly for the +hp/mana.<br />
<br />
Moldy/twigs arent too bad either. I usually have extra stacks of those as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kilzadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Pointee, you say you get 2 everytime and the occasional 3 when you proccess your tea leaves. Is the processing the leaves themselves that raises your chances of getting more or making the tea? I've processed at least a hundred leaves now and I am still getting about 1.5 tea per leaf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Pointee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Yes,<br />
<br />
As far as I understand how the processing works the more you process the better you get at it. I think Ive processed in the neighborhood of 250+ leaves so far. It wasnt until recently that Ive gotten 2 on a consistent basis and the ocassional 3 instead of 1 and the occasional 2.</div></div><hr />
