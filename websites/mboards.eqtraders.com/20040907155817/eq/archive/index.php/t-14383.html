<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sitting in the bazaar in trader mode, you switch over to the EQ screen and you see a list of:<br />
<br />
So-and-so is browsing your wares.<br />
So-and-so2 is browsing your wares<br />
ThisPerson is browsing your wares<br />
Thatperson is browsing your wares<br />
Kitchen_Sink_01 is browsing your wares.<br />
<br />
OK, there is a bazaar search UI so you don't have to search each trader.<br />
<br />
While typing this, two more people came up and &quot;browsed&quot; my wares without even buying anything.<br />
<br />
No, I'm not complaining, just wondering if anyone else gets a little fustrated with this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Eh ... I wouldn't say frustrated so much as slightly irritated.  I think this results either because people meant to click on the person next to me, and instead clicked on me; or else people just like to window-shop and browse a little.<br />
<br />
Either way, I don't mind nor care too much; but since I have a program that makes audible sounds whenever someone browses my trader or buys something, it can be a slight distraction when I get the &quot;knock&quot; of a new browser without a corresponding &quot;cha-ching!&quot; for a sale. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heh, it bugs me.<br />
<br />
Especially since I sit in the back of the bazaar, and they're rarely anyone packed in around me. We keep our distance in the back...<br />
<br />
So, I know they're just randomly browsing... ACK! LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Annalina Romanov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">*shrug* . . . here as in the real world, it's hard to earn money. What more can I say?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mileron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had someone browse my wares seventeen times, all the while spamming me  with tells about how my price on an item sucked.<br />
<br />
Then he bought it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Here's the main reason why this happens to me.<br />
<br />
*TRADER MODE ON*<br />
You have placed 42 items up for sale.<br />
...<br />
(15.) Golden Idol of Tunare (1250p)<br />
...<br />
Someone can right click(blah, blah)<br />
<br />
(about fifteen seconds pass)<br />
<br />
XYZ is browsing your wares.<br />
XYZ bought Golden Idol of Tunare (for 1250p)<br />
PDQ is browsing your wares.<br />
FNU is browsing your wares.<br />
GNP is browsing your wares.<br />
USB is browsing your wares.<br />
USB tells you, 'Got any more idols?'<br />
<br />
I guess the going rate for the other eight golden idols was a bit high.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Silvarri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I always found it interesting to see repeat spammers, but they are 1/2 of an hour or more apart.... its like.. hey.. you gonna buy that or what, punk?!<br />
<br />
Its only fruesterating for me because I just get excited over the little things... Oooooo someone is gonna buy.. someone is gonna buy! Then its kind of a let down when they walk away.  <br />
<br />
But.. I have to admit (please don't shoot me!) that I click on the wrong person on a semi-frequent occasion.  The stalls are so crowded sometimes... and well, I just can't quite click properly :zombie: must be all of those brewing extras I 'just have to get rid of' Haa haa<br />
<br />
Ok.. time to go make something!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">LOL.  That reminds me.  A while back, I got bored and decided to have some fun with my customers.  I whipped up a stack of Candied Cockroaches and stuck them as the first item in my inventory.  Then I made a hotkey:<br />
<br />
Hi there, %T!  You look like you could use a Candied Cockroach! =)<br />
<br />
Whenever a buyer would click on me, I'd target him and click the hotkey.  The responses ranged from nothing (I guess the buyer didn't notice) to a smile to shock, confusion, hilarity, and one query by a nearby vendor how I did it. :)</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
But clicking on the wrong person is quite understandable if you're in one of the crowded areas, like by the Nexus side bank (and why does 50% of the traders feel they have to be there?).  Traders are standing on top of each other, sometimes I have to try to click them 2 or 3 times before I get the right one (and by then, I'm about to go to the second cheapest person if the price diff isn't too huge).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rhyianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i am notorious for running to baz, banking all my money cause i cant move (for some reason i seem to forget to bank each day lol), doing my search.  winding my way around till i find the vendor, click....you cannot afford that item /sigh  back to the bank, get money... lol<br />
<br />
daftness at its finest!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Axterix EnObelix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Doesn't bother me.  Some people like to wander around, checking what different vendors have.  It's a way for them to kill some time and maybe find something that they didn't know they wanted.<br />
<br />
Now, they could do it with searches by trader name, but if they click on me, I'm fine with it.<br />
<br />
At the worst, it is a minor bit of spam.  At its best, it's more plat for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sulkano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Doesnt bother me at all...I'm rarely watching my trader anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There are only a few things in the bazaar that really annoy me:<br />
<br />
1) mass mod rodding, to LD traders. Way uncool.<br />
2) bards with aoe songs<br />
3) beggars <br />
4) scammers (the money is on my wife's account, can I get the weapon then log her character?)<br />
5) casinos who spam<br />
6) people who PLAY at the casinos, then spam when they get ripped off.<br />
<br />
People browsing my wares doesn't bug me a bit. I've seen someone browse, then come back several WEEKS later and buy. No biggy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Arrica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I had a rather odd one today.  I got home from work (I hate these 5 AM shifts btw), turned on the monitor, and sat down to see what all had sold, and also to run through my list of usual items that I window shop/market watch for.  Maybe a minute or two after I started, a barbarian ran up right in from of me, turned to face me, and just stood there.  After a few seconds of thinking &quot;Oh, goody, someone's gonna buy&quot;, with no results, I got to thinking that maybe he was just making sure he was at the right trader before clicking.<br />
<br />
He was still standing there when I camped out to my main 30 minutes later...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I've &quot;lost out&quot; on some great deals this way.<br />
<br />
I'm no fool.  I don't careif you're offering me a BoC for 6 copper.    No item, no sale.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even after the shared bank slots, people still try this.  What's sad is, I bet people still fall for it.<br />

Hmm, he replied awfully quick that 38k is a good price for Ornate Vamb mold...<br />
<br />
Hand 38k, he puts up a Plate Vambrace Mold.  <br />
<br />
*CANCEL*<br />
He camped.<br />

muhahah Gonna have to check your wares tonight ;) Hope you sleep heavy*Snicker*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Libbie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I've run into a problem where the item for sale is displayed but I can't buy it off the trader.<br />
<br />
I have the right amount of money to purchase it, but somehow it gets bugged and becomes unbuyable.<br />
<br />
So the person I'm trying to purchase from will see 4 or 5 of me &quot;browsing their wares&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Carmaris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Nah, what annoys me is when they buy stackable items one item at a time...get all excited thinking I must've moved just about everything in my inventory just to discover I sold 1/2 a stack of KC's.  /sigh</div></div><hr />

<br />
This can happen if the item is somehow removed from a trader satchel after /trader was set up. There are folks on my server who think it fun to put up, for example, a BoC for 50k and then take it out of satchel and watch to see how many folks come and try to buy it. <br />
<br />
It can also happen sometimes I think when folks consolidate thier wares from one satchel to another to make space</div></div><hr />
