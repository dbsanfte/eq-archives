I do have a valid question that I was unable to find on the code writing explaination page.  I had done no posting to get it as far as I have so far, which is almost done, I just want to center the sig.<br />
<br />
I see some people have centered signatures.... I tried just typing in [center]...sig...[/text]  but that didn't do it.....<br />
<br />
Anyone know how to do this?<br />
<br />
And those nifty pop down boxes with all your skills listed....that may be out of my realm of ability, but how do you get those....if someone wants to make a brief explaination.  If it has anything to do with transporting files I'm most likely not going to understand, just say so and don't bother.  But if it is a linkable or writable option i could probably figure it out.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input to the computer impared   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verdandi</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the first part of your question, you need to use html, so:<br />
[code:1] &amp;lt;center&gt;your text here&amp;lt;/center&gt;[/code:1]<br />
which then looks like:  <br />
&lt;center&gt; your text here &lt;/center&gt;<br />
For the second part of your question, this is explained in the FAQ: How to use Signatures (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=63).</div></div><hr />

I was using the help page from profile page, it leaves out centering heh.   I got it all down now I think  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like a speed dial entry of 003 to call 911. <br />
<br />
Nice sig though, hehehe</div></div><hr />

I wasn't done, had just updated to see if I had gotten it entered right.  Though I am no where near as uber as some folks here, I do possess a few more skills   :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delfontes</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, yes, very impressive ;)<br />
<br />
Does make my skills in both Sig and Tradeskills look like a newbie :)</div></div><hr />
