<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faelyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you go to any of the TP NPC's at the LDON wayfarere camps and say &quot;Nedarias Landing&quot;, you can go to the new zone for the next expansion. Its up now. <br />
<br />
Its very similar to Jaggedpine and I found griffon meat and anaconda meat. The mobs are much easer than JP with no faction hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oualawouzou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually, Nedaria's Landing has been up for some time, even before the Wayfarers offered a free ride there. :)<br />
<br />
Unless I'm mistaking, you can access the zone from the Brell worshippers Gnolls in Jaggedpine.<br />
<br />
Those of you with a borderline system, be warned: I can somewhat run around ok with clip plane at 100% in Jaggedpine.  I can barely turn around in Nedaria!  Shrink your clip plane and stare at the ground before attempting to move!</div></div><hr />

You can indeed access it through the Brell Gnolls caves in Jagged Pine. The clip plane problem you report is something that I've experienced as well, though in my case it seems to be worse in the areas with running water, especially the waterfalls, or when you're pointed in the general direction of the waterfalls. I had to turn my clip plane down to 0, yes, that right 0 in order to be able to do anything in this zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Latumofis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nedaria's is also a great place for cat/bear/dog pelts as none of the mobs drop 'ruined'.<br />
<br />
The only thing I don't kill there are Basilisks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">um.  basilisk eggs are great for baking.  do they not drop off mobs in nedaria?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>iasmin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've only heard rumours of such and no confirmation. I've spent two levels in Nedaria on occasion, killing many a basilisk, but not a single egg has dropped that I've seen. Just meat and quest items. Doesn't mean they don't drop, I suppose, just that in those two levels I haven't seen one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Do the cats and bears there give faction hits?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">not supposed to in the landing.  dont zone into jagged though.  i keep meaning to try out this zone. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Inyidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No faction hits from killing animals so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Diania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've been in and out of Nedaria's Landing for a few days, leveling my ranger, nice spot for high 20s to low 30s, killed quite alot of things.  So far I've gotten a few various hides, griffon meat, foraged up quite abit of plant shoots.  Have yet to find anaconda meat, but I haven't been killing the anacondas much, too many green ones on land, and I dont feel like swimming to get to the dark blue cons.  As far as basilisk eggs, i haven't found any off the 2 dozen or so shore basilisks i've killed.  Can't find griffon feathers off the serene griffawns, but I've gotten a few griffawn feathers, not sure what to do with those yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>cannyar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">our of curosity, does anyone happen to know if the anaconda there drop skins? i need one more to finish my last necklace quest from JP. can't run around JP much any more as everything there aggro's onto me. :(<br />
<br />
thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Only things I got off anacondas there were fangs and meat (and the meat is just stupid rare).<br />
<br />
Also some Wayfarers give out quests, and almost each creature has a no-drop piece used in one or another (basilisk hides, silverfur pelt, griffon beak, cove frog eyes all readily come to mind).<br />
<br />
Rewards are a little disappointing, a smidge of exp (to my 35 druid, might be better for others) and some cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sithehenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Anacondas do in fact drop skins there.  Saw four of them drop in about as many hours last night (09Jan04) on Quellious  :detectiv:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>OutcastAssassin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Do you need LDoN to access this zone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Elyssanda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You can access the zone through JP. Port into JP, go south of the town, into the tunnels, behind the throne of the gnoll leader and zone into Nedaria's... I don't know if LDoN is required or not. I've had it since before this new zone was added.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Elinea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">FYI for those with faction problems in JP...wolf form makes you non-kos, if you can illusion  yourself or someone in your group can.</div></div><hr />
