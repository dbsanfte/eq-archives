<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lorudce MacLeod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hehe  I'm still working on these.  I have the beastlord component: toughened sinew lashings and am working on building a stockpile of them.<br />
<br />
I still need:<br />
from Warrior: Porous claw blade (smithing)<br />
from Shaman: reactive sealant soak (brewing)<br />
from rogue : sonic wolf bane poison (baking)<br />
<br />
I have my component but others may need:<br />
from bard: ceramic sleeves (pottery)<br />
from beastlord: toughened sinew lashings (tailoring) I make these</div></div><hr />

Looks like you've had better luck than me. Still trying to get friends to boost up tradeskills and make these.<br />
<br />
I'll trade you my Shaman component for your Beastlord component. I have 5 completed reactive sealant soaks sitting in the bank. Drop me a tell in game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lorudce MacLeod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Will do!  I have one on me so I'll send ya tell.  I received the bard component when  a bard, sorry I didn't write down the name, shouted in the bazaar.  I have never had luck doing that, but it worked that night.<br />
<br />
I also began a rogue to try and make that component myself.  I still don't have the level to get components or the skill in baking yet.</div></div><hr />
