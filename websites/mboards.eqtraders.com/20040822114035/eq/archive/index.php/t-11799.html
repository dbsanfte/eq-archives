<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yes, the main site is having problems.  No, we don't have an ETA. Yes, we've paged the owner of Racknine.  No, we've not had a response yet, after several hours.  Yes, I'm starting to gnash my teeth.  No, there is no chocolate in the house.<br />
<br />
Hopefully that answers all the pertinent questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">**HUGS**<br />
<br />
Sorry, the chocolate is at home, and I can't ship you any of it via FEDEX... I would if I could.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ACK!  No chocolate in the house?!<br />
<br />
Call 911! This is an emergency!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ack! Here, best I think we can do!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">First you get some brown algae, then some cream.  Wait, to make cream I need the database.<br />
<br />
Well, you know what I was trying to do.  Anyway, where does one get Benzoin in real life?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Raskii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey, getting closer!<br />
<br />
The page no longer shows up as the Successful Install message for Apache's mod.ssl module. Now it shows up as some control panel thing (says that there's no web site configured for this address, but it's still an improvement)!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Azirux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have a site with Racknine also that is down. I just got the exact same Hosting Info email I got when I first signed up, and the user interface is different than before. Looks like they were updating their interface and things got messed up. I'm too old to get worked up over it; things happen and I'm sure they will get it fixed eventually.<br />
<br />
Update: Logged in with the new User interface and all my files are gone. Hopefully they are still trying to restore items. Not too worried - I'm a firm believer in backups and have copies of everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zacatac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What!  You ate all the Halloween candy already??  <br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Arunhah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The reason you are having problems is because someone was removing paying customers accounts through some form of hack.  I was told this when I called them a few minutes ago about my own site.<br />
<br />
They are fixing the problem, and will re-upload the sites as soon as they can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, as of a couple minutes ago, things were starting to look as though a restore is in progress for the main site, so hopefully it'll be back up before the patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The word we got was that someone was using our server to mail spam or somesuch, and they had to move everyone to another server.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it seems we were one of the last to be moved over, and they sorta forgot to finish setting the rights back on everything.  Hubby went so far as to page the owner this morning, and is on email number three, to no avail ... and it's now well after business hours, so ....<br />
<br />
{shrugsigh}<br />
<br />
Not the first time we've been unintentionally left in limbo longer than we should have, and probably not the last, either ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We have a host that gives us a price that allows us to still offer this site just on donations... without constantly bugging people for donations :)<br />
<br />
While the server hardware and technology is sound, even good... Defenitely amond the good to very good providers out there.<br />
<br />
But... We are getting the Tech support level that we pay for :/  We pay relatively VERY little for the bandwidth we use... so we get.... very little tech support.<br />
<br />
Realistically I think it is worth it.  Yes tech support could be better... but the price is unmatched anywhere that I have seen... So I am not ready to leave just because of this inconvienience.<br />
<br />
Oh and we have a &quot;Virtual Server&quot; so no-one hacked EQTC and used it as a mail spam server... somoene bought a Virtual server on the same server as EQTC and used IT for mailspam (there was no security break on EQTC)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It appears that the site is back up and working normally.<br />
<br />
At least, I can see the home page and browse about to pages I've never visited before (so it's not cached).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Arunhah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sorry to bump the post, however I just wanted to say that in the time I have used racknine I have recieved great customer service (I always call rather than email).  Granted, it's odd to call tech support and talk to the CEO though (who is the one who fixed my permission problems that were created when they moved my virtual server back after that little downage).<br />
<br />
And like you said, you just can't beat those prices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ah.  But I do not have a number to call tech support :)  I could not find it on the site anywhere.<br />
<br />
I do have pager access though :)<br />
<br />
I Guess I just believe I should be able to go through the normal tech support channels instead of going directly to the owner every time there is an issue :)<br />
<br />
Again.  I like racknine, and have no plans on leaving :)  I am jsut being truthefull about what *I* have experienced with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Arunhah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I can give you their tech support number:<br />
<br />
edit: number removed to prevent them from getting flooded with calls from other than the site owners ... thanks for getting it to us!  --Niami<br />
<br />
And the servers are back up but completely wiped as I unfortunately found out when I tried doing some fixes /sigh<br />
<br />
Needless to say, they are pretty swamped right now.  Software issue last week and hardware failure this week, can't be fun.  The tech I talked to a few minutes ago sounded like he was about to lose his mind, he wasn't rude (quite the opposite actually) but you can just hear the strain in his voice as he tries to help lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Serenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I would poke them for a better answer on data recovery though.  I am stunned at the thought that *they* don't have a backup of your website.  I know both my current web host provider and the one we are moving to have both stated that they do weekly backups of all their web servers, which would include website data.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>gnormy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">After being sat on by Ngreth, I can understand DenMum's affinity for crawling into a pack.<br />
<br />
For the record, my question about backups wasnt so much prophetic.  You see, my HDD at home had fried out on a machine I had for 18 months without ANY backup.  Oh the woe and gnashing over the lost files.  So it made me think of how much EQTC data means to everyone and how much blood, sweat and tears the EQTC family has put into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Destyni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I never realized just how dependent I am upon your site!  I love tradeskills and am constantly referring to EQTraders more than daily.  I was horrified when i realized what had happened, but I am quite relieved to see it's progressing back towards operation.  I can not imagine all the work that has gone into compiling such a database.  I'm impressed, amazed...Staggered.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, if nothing else, I can offer you some encouragement?  Know the site has been missed.  The creators and maintainers are respected...<br />
<br />
And, no chocolate is definately equivalent to the end of the world.<br />
<br />
Hope things get worked out soon.  Hang in there!!<br />
