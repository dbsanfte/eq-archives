<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zeddas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What zone are you foraging in?  Some zones have larger loot tables (WW,EW) so you have less chance to get one.  I have the best luck in Kael.</div></div><hr />

Random thought... wouldn't it be cool if Dire Wolves had a chance of dropping Tufts of Dire Wolf Fur?  Doesn't that make sense?  <br />
<br />
Or if we could carve tufts out of the &quot;quality&quot; dire wolf furs? ;)<br />
<br />
On the subject here though, I reported a few weeks back that a friend was having trouble foraging tufts in Thurg. He has since reported the same thing a few times, that after much time foraging with his alt in Thurg while he was on his main on a second account, his alt wound up foraging &quot;mostly&quot; roots, in the order of 60%+ of the total number of items foraged, and practically no tufts. That was with a Ranger with 200 forage. He went to the exact same spot with his Druid on the primary account and is able to forage tufts normally. This has happened for him on more then one occassion.</div></div><hr />

It would only be cool if you want the cost of the bags to fall to about 2000 plat.  If something drops off of mobs, no matter how rare, they can be farmed.  The fact that they're a rare forage puts a real time limit on the number of tufts you can pull in an hour.<br />
<br />
Think on this scenario.  A high level guild decides that it wants to gather parts to get many haversacks for its members.  It could assemble kill squads for the necessary zones, and they'd spend a weekend flattening the zones where dire wolves show up.  By the end of the &quot;raid&quot;, it's reasonable that proper planning would result in hundreds or thousands of dead dire wolves.  Even with very rare drops, that's be a big pile of dire wolf fur, especially with all of the foraging classes/races foraging away during the hunt.  Now, the market for haversacks is significantly reduced, so the price falls.  The other scenario is a few macro-hunters or flunkies farming dire wolves nonstop for weeks, with predictable results.  The glut of dire wolf fur would seem like a boon to begin with, but when seven people have haversack tokens by the dozen to sell, the price is going to start dropping.<br />
<br />
As grumpy as it makes me that I can't personally forage them, I think it's a good limit on the number of bags out there, which stabilizes the price.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Samoht</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I dont have problems foraging the tufts.  I was in Thurgadin for like 10mins last night and foraged about 3 of them.  The last 4 or five times I've been there for about same amount of time, I've accumulated a stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Foraging mostly roots? Now that's weird. In all my Thurg foraging time (a lot) I think I've gotten roots about three times total.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I’ve not had any problems foraging Dire Wolf Tufts. As far as what Silver is talking about, most likely they would make the drops as rare as excellent quality saber hides or brute hides. <br />
<br />
To me its just as easy to forage them in Thurgadin, its safe and cozy. If you have a 2nd account you can just park a n00b Ranger or Druid there to forage for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kharakid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I thought I saw on Allahkhzam's beastery that tufts of dire wolf fur ARE on the loot table for one of the mob's at least.  Not sure if it is a dire wolf or not .  Have never hunted there yet to see for myself though.  Is that old news?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tshesebe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This is purely anecdotal &amp; I don't have any hard data, but for those of you who are not on vazaelle, WW is pretty good.  For those of you who ARE on Vazaelle, the tuft forage rate stinks and and and...they aren't found here, yeah, that's it, and Dragon eggs can't be foraged here either.  These aren't the droids you're looking for, You can go about your business (in another zone), move along, move along.  That's the ticket! :p <br />
<br />
In all seriousness, in the 7 or so hours I've been knocking around WW, I've probably foraged about 10 tufts, 7 Dragon eggs, 15 Drake &amp; wurm eggs, and a host of other stuff (eg water &amp; claws), which I think is pretty good, and the forages seem more worthwhile than the EW forages (where one could hunt &amp; exp at the same time too, but is feeble at 59).  If You're of sufficient level (and have good faction w/ CoV &amp; can Invis), You might consider Western Wastes....<br />
<br />
....unless you're on the Vazaelle server. :D</div></div><hr />
