<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, last night I did not have enough time to really do anything, so I was scouring the vendors in PoK and various zones.  While I was in PoK, I came across a nice NPC that was selling some lacquered peridots for 8g and change.  I bought them all, 39, and stuck them on my trader mule for 15pp each.  Granted, I probably could have used them to try and make a few, as it is still above my skill level, but, oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hehe, this weekend I picked up 12 unfired opal steins @ 2cp and 15 lacquered opals @ 1.259pp off a vendor :)<br />
<br />
For the miner, firing the steins has a cost of 0.043pp, and they sell to vendors for 3.048pp (and naturally more to players, ~25pp on Tunare currently).  The opals should save me a nice sum on my next run of those steins for skill, too.</div></div><hr />
