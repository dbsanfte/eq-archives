<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arhallia</div><div class="date">12-31-2002, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">its a cheap cast nowadays.  if you're paying the same per mana as C3 (a spell which costs a heckuva lot more than enchant brellium -- I'm assuming 100p for a single person's C3), you should pay no more than 11pp per casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teyvan</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 01:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">...as I like making stuff...just send me a tell when you see me on (and non-anon/roleplay), and have everything ready by the time I get there.  The most I'll ask is some armor for a twink, or somehting along those lines (rare dropped Tailoring/Pottery/JC items are always good trade (hint, hint):-)<br />

See you online...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SerpentMage</div><div class="date">01-09-2003, 07:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you, Teyvan and Arhallia.  I was asking because my brother has a dwarven smith (skill 187, also has a geerlok), Dalein (Clr-43), wearing temple of Sol Ro armor, and I thought it might be a good idea for him to attempt to make Enchanted+Imbued Dwarven Plate (at least, Breastplate and Leggings) as an upgrade.  He was able to try once already (since my posting), but unfortunately failed in the attempt (I footed the bill, so it didnt hurt him much other than the disappointment, hehe).  However, it appears as though it might be best to get his skill up further before attempting again (~245pp per attempt, plus the cost of enchanting 10 large bricks, is rough on the pocket book unless success rate is decent).<br />
<br />
So, it looks as though the dwarven plate idea is on hold for a while, but hopefully not for too long.</div></div><hr />
