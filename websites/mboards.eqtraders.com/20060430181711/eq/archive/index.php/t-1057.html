<br />
I've seen a lot of info on how to skill up and waste 10k-30k just to skill up fast but what i'm looking for is the opposite.<br />
<br />
I'm looking for info on what would be the best item to make for sellback for a profit to NPC merchants (sell back to players can take alot of time and if no buyers u make nothing). I'm lvl 6 and i have my smithing up to 40ish now. I just started on a new server and have little to no cash so i was wondering if any of you could share some info on making low to mid end items that actually make you 100p-200p an hour just from making the same thing over and over then selling it back to a NPC merchant. I was experimenting on skewers and scaler that sell back for about a gold, but i spent my 12p i saved up fast on making the metal bits and trying about 12 combines. So now its back to hunting to make a few more plat so i can try some more smithing. I'm not too worried about skilling up fast and loosing money. I would like to find something that turns a profit so i can buy spells and have cash to buy stuff then with profits skill up later on. Starting out broke on a new server makes you appreicate all those rusty weapons and gold coins again!  :D <br />
<br />
Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!<br />
Thanks in advance~<br />

What's more, your skill at low trivial has to be significantly higher than the item trivial in order to reach the max 95% success rate.<br />
<br />
As far as I know, your best bet for making money - unless it's been nerfed since I did this a long time ago) is to hunt certain newbie mobs (skunks in butcher come to mind) which drop items sellable for about 3 plat.  Not the best cash rate in the universe, of course...<br />
<br />
Once you get mid-teens, depending on your class, you may be able to handle wisps in Erud's Crossing.  You should not only be able to cash up from this, but get some xp for it, too.  Still, the drop rate of greater lightstones - and the fact that you have to head to NK to cash them out at the best price - limits your income here.<br />
<br />
You really don't have a very good cash option until the (low?) 30s where you can do hill giants with a group (Unrest in late 20's for fine steel weapons isn't the worst in the world, though).  And you *definitely* don't have a good cash option if you're expecting to sell back tradeskill-made items to NPCs.</div></div><hr />

Emphasis on marginal.</div></div><hr />

I've never had tarnished sell for more than the rusties.<br />
<br />
Definitely not the 3cp you paid for the stone (assuming you aced it on the first combine).<br />
<br />
Not like you're losing hordes of cash, but you won't make a profit off it. And if you've got a really high CHA where you CAN make a profit, we're talking copper here.<br />
<br />
It is the intent of Sony (as far as everything I've read has been concerned) that tradeskill produced items NOT be sellable to merchants for more money than the supplies cost. The idea is that you trade them to PLAYERS :)<br />
<br />
Tailoring, however, seems to be an exception, and I believe baking might be as well..<br />
Patterns: 5 sp<br />
Ruined Hides: essentially free<br />
Sellback on tattered items: 1.2 gp with my low CHA, v. the sellback of roughly 8 copper per hide.<br />
<br />
There's also a loophole in tarnished weapons that is *WAY* more work than it is worth - <br />
<br />
If you combine a tarnished weapon with a flask of water it yields ore, which can be recombined into other things - essentially shaving the ore costs out of your combines. I've made almost a dozen sheets of metal that way.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER - the time that took to do, I probably could have farmed the 12 or so plat those sheets would have cost, and god only knows how many flasks of water I went through at a silver a pop.<br />
<br />
Fine steel can be farmed and turned into HQ ore to make the rings for Ornate chain, if you're hunting an area like Paw or Rathe it MIGHT work out for you.. but both of those places are dreadfully far from a forge.<br />
<br />
PERSONALLY, I've done this a few ways and I've found it's just better to level. Save as much of your plat as you can as you go, wait until you're around 20 or so and THEN start your tradeskills. At level 10 I spent an hour at a time in BlackBurrow to get 10 plat which I burned pretty fast in ore and molds. At level 40 I can go to RM with a small group, kill a ton of HGs, and end up with a couple hundred PP, which goes a LOT further for smithing. Although I might be a bit outdated.. I haven't really played BB much since the May 8 patch, now they drop a bunch of stuff that's worth multiple gold per drop. I could probably farm 50pp there in that same hour, maybe a little more (assuming appropriately leveled chars - a level 65 could probably mop the place for pretty good cash and no risk.. I'm assuming you're a relative newbie or at least the character is)<br />
<br />
Tailoring is good to do as you level, because it's relatively cheap up until you hit around 108 skill and your supplies come from things you're killing anyways. Baking is pretty cost effective, and if you've got forage brewing is amazing.</div></div><hr />
