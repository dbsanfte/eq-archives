<br />
I'm looking for a quick (non-farming) and cheap way to get the aprox 180 in smithing needed to make the velium armor for the Blessed Coldain Payer Shawl quest.  I know the AS freebee can get 54, and I've read that Embroidering Needle can get to 122, at about 3pp per combine (if you make the CE's yourself).  Any suggestions after that?  I'm a Troll Shaman, so the troll sewing kit is a posibility at 162 for 20pp each combine, but I would like a cheaper way.  Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

All the high-end smithing recipes require farming of some sort; Mistletoe Cutting Sickles are the only exception that come to mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mallissah</div><div class="date">04-25-2006, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But buying Leather padding in the bazaar at least on my server costs more than 20 plat each and some of those combines require more than one leather padding.  But if you're willing to farm and make the leather padding it might save you money and since you're on the last shawl I'm sure you have higher than the 31 trivial for those.  However this will be VERY time consuming.<br />
<br />
You may also wanna look into the DoN armor quests for post 162 smithing.  I'm not sure what the drop rate on Globe of Fear is like but you may be able to make some of the plat back on the expert wrist augs / armor in the bazaar and they will take you to 180.</div></div><hr />

The only annoying part is going to abysmal sea or CC to buy the gnomish heat sources:-(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fine Plate is the most efficient route to 188 or so.  It's entirely store-bought except for the padding.  Successful combines will sell back to vendors for about the cost of the stuff you bought, minus the padding.  If you farm your own, you'll more or less break even on fine plate, paying just for failed combines.  Note that all fine plate takes a single leather padding per attempt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mewkus</div><div class="date">04-30-2006, 02:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Freebies to 54<br />
Banded to 115<br />
Embroidery Needle to 122 (save them for next step)<br />
Bile Spine (troll cultural needle) to 132ish<br />
Troll sewing kit to 163ish<br />
Then it's either Enchanted Velium Bits, Fine Plate, or search bazaar for LDoN tempers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wood elfs can do the fier'dal fletching kit, which will take them to like 163.</div></div><hr />

The armor pieces for the shawl are no drop, are they not? If you change one component they are sellable, but combined for the shawl they are not useable, and no drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BeltiraBelkira</div><div class="date">05-02-2006, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">true but to do the crawl for the final turn in you hand the finished and approved box and the orders to the dwarf to get him moving  then hand in the shawl. just make sure you have the preflags of handing in shawl 7 to the dain and that other guy and have someoen else hand in the approved armor and the orders and you turn in the shawl.</div></div><hr />
