<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Euphorion</div><div class="date">01-16-2003, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there :-)<br />
<br />
Well until now I always rejected the possibility to learn any tradeskill. (well I raised my pottery to 122 for Thurga Gate potions and have tailoring and fishing at about 20 each, but I guess all that doesnt really count ;-) )<br />
<br />
But lately I found out that I want to have an item that is made by Tailoring, it’s the Shaded Hide Tunic.<br />
So I first tried my normal route to acquire tradeksill items: to buy them ;-)<br />
Failed badly on that. Couldn’t find anyone who sells that item on SolRo,<br />
<br />
So I might have to face the challenge to get my tailoring up ;-)<br />
<br />
Now with an trivial o 212+ that’s not easy to make I guess.<br />
Anyway I got a few questions:<br />
<br />
To what lvl would I have to get tailoring in order to have a somewhat ok chance for a success on the combine (let’s define  “somewhat ok” with 33%)?<br />
<br />
And what time would have spend on raising the skill to that lvl?<br />
(Of course I know that depends on if I want to buy all ingredients or if I arm most of it by myself and whatever, so some kind of orientation would be enough, like “50 hours” or “100-200 hours” or something like that. ;-) )<br />
<br />
As I said...I never really attempted to get a tradeskill up so I’m pretty clueless here, esp. Since tailoring is supposed to be a harder tradeskill...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velurian</div><div class="date">01-16-2003, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'd have a 33% chance around the mid-to-high-150s.  So if you're willing to accept those sort of odds, you can just skill up to the high end of Wu's armor.  Skilling up beyond that becomes drastically more expensive unless you're high enough level to farm all of the components for some of the Velious armor or acrylia.<br />
<br />
Time and expense, of course, depend on your stats (specifically, the higher of INT and WIS).  With maximized INT or WIS, if you decide to Bazaar-mine for most of your components, I'd expect you could get to 158 (the high end of Wu's) in no more than 10 hours, probably a lot less.  However, this probably means finding a LOT of spider or shade silks in the bazaar, so availability on your server might become a limiting factor here.  (If you can find cheap ruined or low quality skins in the bazaar, you might want to skill up on the armors that use those at the lower end -- notably, if you have a good supply of LQ skins, I'd try to skill up to 31 on leather padding, and then sell your successes to smiths for 20+ pp each -- but MQ and HQ skins are generally expensive enough that I'd just skip from silk recipe to silk recipe, whenever possible, if you're looking to maximize speed.  Raw silk to 36, cured silk to 82, crystalline silk to the 120s or so -- or until you run out of easily available supplies of it -- and Wu's to 158.  This also minimizes the need to skill up other tradeskills -- like smithing for studs or bonings -- though you might want to skill up brewing to 70 or so and make your own Heady Kiolas for cured silk and Wu's.  Cost to make them yourself is around a quarter-plat per success, cost to buy them in the bazaar will be 4pp each or so, and you'll need hundreds.)<br />
<br />
So the quick answer is: buy as much cheap INT or WIS gear as you can, buy every cheap silk you see, and you should be done, if you can get all the supplies, in 10 hours or less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbuegel</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would recommend going to stonebrunt mtns and collecting some pelts.  Everything there is LQ or better (no ruined pelts) and the cats almost always drop one or two.  So, collecting 5 or even 10 stacks of pelts is just a few hours work.  Pelts usually sell for 10pp-15pp each on my server, so you might be able to buy a few stacks for 200pp-300pp if you have the bucks.  And, buy some studs and boning, and make masks.  Burn up the MQ's first to make studded leather masks, then go to the HQ's for reinforced leather masks.  When you trivial or run out of supplies close to trivial, then start collecting silks (or buy them).  Best place for standard spider silk is crag spiders in EK.  Although, there are a few other places where you can get them.  Again, make masks.  Also, you can use HQ pelts to make quivers, which are containers so they are somewhat awkward to deal with.  But, I did notice that quivers seemed to increase my skill a bit faster than silk masks when above 100 in skill.  Could be a fluke.  Anyway, once above 115, start making Wu's masks, which means buying viscous mana at 10pp each or so.  One vial per attempt, so this part can get a bit pricey.  That will take you to 130ish.  After that, I just make Wu's tunics up to 158.  That should be high enough to try a few of your combines.  Of course, you could stop at 115 and try you combine then too... you never know.<br />
<br />
Note:  Your WIS or INT (whichever is higher will be used) is VERY important in skillups.  Don't even start with WIS/INT below 150, and there seems to be definate difference once you pass 200.  KEI will buff your WIS a bit, and you can just buy STAT buffing armor/jewelry in Bazaar.  Pretty easy to make 200 unless you're like a Ogre or Troll or other &quot;dumb&quot; race.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Euphorion</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 02:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh :-) doesn't sound all that bad :-)<br />
I was expecting worse, that's for sure :-)<br />
<br />
Hmmm...so I might need acrylia? ;-)<br />
What a pity that I have sold at least 20 stacks of it during the last 10 levels...doh :-(<br />
<br />
But still...doesn't sound as bad as I was expecting :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kronepsis</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 03:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try the following Euph:<br />
<br />
Shadeweavers:  Farm Shadeling Silks.  Get...oh...8 stacks.  Won't take you too long.  Ignore the psychopath in the Bazaar selling 1460 spiderling silks for 4p 9g (a.k.a. 5 p) each.<br />
<br />
Move to Marus Seru.<br />
<br />
Farm...oh...4 stacks of LQ Rockhopper Hides.  Won't take you too long either.<br />
<br />
Keep all Greyhopper hides you get.<br />
<br />
Combine up the Shadeling silks into Shade Silk Threads.  You should hit 15 by then.  :P<br />
<br />
Combine Shade Silk thread and LQ Rockhopper Hide into Padding.  4 Stacks should be more than enough for you. <br />
<br />
Take the truckloads of Greyhopper Hide you most likely have and buy Boot Patterns.  Bazaar's a good place to get them.  Combine 1 Boot Pattern + 1 Greyhopper Hide.  Trivials at 95, but I don't know how many you'll farm up.<br />
<br />
Then look for Silk Swatches or Spider silk.  Farm East Karana if you want to, or if you want to spend in the Bazaar now, I see 113 Silk Swatches for sale at 9 plat right now.  Then look in the Bazaar for Imbued Emeralds.  Someone's selling 69 of them for 20 plat right now.  There's a truckload of Celestial Essences for sale too.  Buy Imbued Emeralds and Celestial Essences on a 1:1 rate, so if you get 60 Emeralds, get 60 Essences, then hit Satael Deirosap and buy the same amount of Jars of Acid.<br />
<br />
Since you already have Pottery up, time for you to make Blessed Dust of Tunare.  Put 1 Jar of Acid, 1 Celestial Essence, and 1 Imbued Emerald in a Kiln.  You'll hit a few failures, but oh well.<br />
<br />
Take what Blessed Dust you made, and then buy the same amount of Celestial Essence again (i.e. if you have 50 Blessed Dusts left, buy 50 more Celestial Essences).  Then go to a loom with your silk.  Stick in 1 Blessed Dust, 1 Celestial Essence, and 1 Silk Swatch.  Combine them ALL up.<br />
<br />
Use whatever leftover silk swatches you have for Wu's.  When you run out of those, go get a Gem Studded Chain from someone (*cough* me *cough*), buy Tunic Patterns from the pattern vendor in the Bazaar, and throw in 3 Sacred Tunare Silks, the Chain, and 1 Tunic Pattern in the loom and repeat till you're out of silks, or unless you get a success.<br />
<br />
I won't guarantee 158, but you don't want Wu's...you REALLY don't want Wu's...</div></div><hr />
