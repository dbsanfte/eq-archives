<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elmzerfudz</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering if anyone could tell me what stormreaper chainwoven armour looks like ? the reason i am posting is because on Trade Skill Fashion it shows that on Halflings it appears as green plate which would be like Thorny Vine from fear and EQ Fashions doesn't have a picture and i did do a search before posting but no luck <br />
<br />
So what does Stormreaper Chainwoven look like ? is it green plate or green chain on Halflings ?<br />
<br />
if it is plate i would be so excited ) but somehow i don't believe it is LOL</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll try to remember to shamble over to the site in question and see what image they're using. There may have been some confusion between the chainweave (chain) and the steelweave (plate) images or such.</div></div><hr />

<br />
