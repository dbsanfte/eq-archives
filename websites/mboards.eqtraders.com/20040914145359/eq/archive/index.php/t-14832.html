<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As some of you know, I headed off Stormhammer and over to Tarew Marr. Now, on stormhammer I had 5 other people that logged in at the same time and made a balanced group.  LFG? Pick up group? What's that?<br />
<br />
So, I log in yesterday, nhinx is feeling sick, phabos is no where to be found, noisey isn't on my schedule and sanna is at anime club.<br />
<br />
Sigh.  I sort of felt like playing.<br />
<br />
/lfg on<br />
<br />
natter natter.<br />
<br />
/ooc 65 shaman buffs with 30 percent EE at bank<br />
<br />
XXX tells you, &quot;need you at BC&quot;<br />
/ all XXX<br />
[62 warlord] XXX - plane of valor<br />
<br />
So off I ramble, invis, figure out where BC is (it's IC or inner, not that I've ever exped in Valor anyway - but I'm not going to tell these yahoos I'm just moved from SH and don't know camp names, because they're going to be thinking &quot;ebay!&quot;).<br />
<br />
So, they rez the ranger, I buff, the ranger asks if I have STR.  I point out that focus is 75 STR and is that not enough? He asks for &quot;the stackable str.&quot;  What? Well, I don't have IoS, so I throw diaku, which it turns out is &quot;stackable str.&quot; I guessed right.<br />
<br />
Well, this is the lamest camp ever (that is, easy and fast exp), so I decide to avatar everyone.  I tell the ranger to tell me when avatar drops because I'm not timing it.  He replies, &quot;I just dinged, I don't have all my spells.&quot; Um, avatar is my... never mind, I have SCR3, I'll time it off my pet.  the ogre says he doesn't need avatar.  I say, really, you are at worn ATK cap (he's a 63 warrior)? You know that's *250* right. He replies, &quot;that's like a lot of AoB and veng stuff, right?&quot;  &quot;Yeah, vengeance 50 or so&quot;  &quot;Oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
I avatar him.<br />
<br />
Well, the cleric, the ogre and the ranger all leave.  The warrior that invited me repped them, and after a train or three ($%#$% see invis mobs that wander) we get settled in.<br />
<br />
The replacement cleric CHed at 60 health and called med breaks.  The beastlord windowed out and forgot he was playing, so he just sat there for 20 minutes then ninja looted the metallic liquid that dropped.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the monk did a great job pulling, the warrior that invited me was a good tank and knew how to use a shield hotkey, which I don't really need, but since I'm an agressive slower he used it a lot and the wizard ... dunno, did wizard stuff.<br />
<br />
Wasn't as bad as it could've been and I racked up an AA in 2-3 hours of the most mindless playing I've seen.<br />
<br />
Wasn't terrible I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stormhammer must have been nice (wistful sigh) with a regular group and a lower population density.   <br />
<br />
Pick-up groups tend to be pretty hit-or-miss.   That's just the way it is when dealing with unknown quantities.   Some will be great, and you'll look forward to grouping with those people again.  Some will be so vile you'll wonder why you play EQ. <br />
<br />
You'll make some new friends ( :) ) , and likely some new enemies ( :( ).  Some days you'll be the only competent person in the group, and some days everyone will think you're the idiot.  But on the whole, pick-up groups will get you there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pick-ups really are a dice roll.  I've hit groups that made me feel like I'd just wasted an entire gaming night, but on the other hand I've also hit pick-ups that were more efficient than some of my regular groups (though the latter is far more the exception than the rule).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cantatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I got pretty luck in the guild/alliance I was in on Karana.  Most of the people knew their roles and it was fairly easy to put together a group = even an unconvetional one - and do very well.<br />
<br />
I look at pickup groups as a challenge.  You never know what you're going to get.  A lot of times, it was more fun for me to join a pick up group because almost assuredly someone would train the group and I'd get to do crowd control.  Despite this, I haven't joined any pick ups in months.  It just got boring for me to not be in groups where I had no one to talk to.  In other games, I'm having a harder time with pick ups since no game has done crowd control as well as EverQuest.  If someone screws up, there is no fail safe and I die too, so I can definitely relate to the frustration a lot more since I've stopped playing EQ.</div></div><hr />

I just thought the comment sanna made about you with no pants fit with the &quot;see more of noise&quot; theme.</div></div><hr />

You know, I don't really remember saying that... Let's see... if Kiztent was screenshotting stuff I say, then it was most probably after... October? And if I were still playing Iroke, it was before January. No, I do have vague recollection of that exchange, so it was probably sometime in Nov-Dec. &gt;_&lt; <br />
<br />
<br />
So, um, yeah... noish naked = not good....<br />

Ok, so that exchange came in early January, and, er, referres to a lot of Sanna-drama I know you don't want to hear about ^_^.  Noish naked would be bad. End of, um, that.<br />
<br />
why am I even more confused than I was... what started this? How did we get here from the original post? Did I vicariously derail another thread, from two months in the past and through the channel? I then /vote that I get the custom title of &quot;Derailing Queen&quot;... heh.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I actually got the LDoN bug yesterday, and started meandering around camps.  Seems BB is the happening place for groups, and lots of people LFG, but no invites (for my shaman).<br />
<br />
Well, ok.<br />
<br />
61 paladin - you're my tank.  64 druid to heal.  Paladin wanted a &quot;real tank&quot; so the druid grabbed a 65 SK (who turned out to be **** good at his job), a 65 mage was LFG, a 65 wizard wandered over (I think the druid knew him too) and after everyone got KEI :rolleyes: we headed off for a collect 22.<br />
<br />
Once everyone got over the &quot;we may not get single pulls&quot; thing (the paladin couldn't pacify so I would use my AA root and cut it down to a doable state until the SK got comfortable with just going out there and pulling) we settled into a good clip.  The paladin tanked the second one well enough, the druid despite having no PR and spending half the advent dotted from hitting traps (and she won a PR aug) healed well enough that no one died and we walked off with the win in 60 minutes.  I got a spiffy pair of legs to replace the thurg quested that were getting a bit old, 150pp and some portion of an AA.<br />
<br />
Overall, I'm pretty happy with Tarew.  I know the idiots are out there though... watching... waiting to group with me.  So far I've been impressed with everyone I've grouped with (well, except that ranger, but he did a good enough job).</div></div><hr />

I've got mammoth in the bank if you'd like some HMP's.<br />

But as for the punch, I'm a cleric. It's 4 points at a time, so you'd take foreeeeever to take any damage from it. And my H2H is only 50, so you'd kind of have to duck INTO it.<br />
