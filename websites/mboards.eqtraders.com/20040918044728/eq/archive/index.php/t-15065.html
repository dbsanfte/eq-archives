<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>grumpinzel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been foraging with my lowbie druid in Misty Thicket for acorns, and in several days have yet to spot a single ground spawn.   Do they still exist, or were they removed ?  I'm going batty staring at the ground as I run around.  <br />
<br />
I've read the previous threads on ground spawns, looked at all the locs, no go.  What gives?  Just bad luck?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Furyrpied</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They do seem to be a bit scarce right now, but i've been thinking..  What time of year is it in EQ? Fall? Winter? Spring? or Summer?<br />
<br />
Maybe (now I'm reallly streching here) the number of ground spawns relates to seasons?<br />
<br />
/e prays to Karana &quot;Please give me the wisdom to acheive this next FLH*#Y_*G{UEHBG{UOH (* skill up&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
You couldn't prove it by me that they exist at all. I've looked for the silly things for hours when I was the only one in the zone, and I have never found one.<br />
<br />
That's not to say they don't exist, but if they do, they're @#$% rare on Veeshan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Furyrpied</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh they do exist... I have seen them and picked them up myself, and then carefully marked my map on the locations....<br />
Then my wife downloads updated maps....<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
**Note, even when I still had the marks on my map, I never could find another one in the same spot... strange....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Picked up a couple over the past few days myself. They are very rare. My impression is that there are only two or three spawned at any time, and those spread all over the zone. Sometimes they spawn half into the ground, too, making them that much harder to see. <br />
<br />
Of all the items I buy in bazaar, these are the ones I'm happiest to pay for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>storywalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They do still exist.  A careful combing of both sides of the wall will usually net me 3 or 4 acorns.  Scored well the other night and picked up a cluster of three at once off the edge of bat hill...near the goblin camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Velvett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wolf Form - get lower to the ground<br />
Adjust your gama - makes them stand out more<br />
<br />
Those hints might help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Benthair Dunthat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Got one last nite, in about an hour of running my little short halfling legs off. Still there, but seem very rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Giddo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Misty Acorn ground spawns do exist. Run around Misty and look for small squares on the ground colored light green. The color is akin to the green of the local snakes. <br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Healblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I can verify that they exist at least on Erollisi Marr server.<br />
<br />
Been doing Halfling Cultural armor (the 228 trivial stuff) to skillup on, and been farming the acorns myself.  It is much faster to find them than forage; I do both, about a 9:1 ratio.  In other words, I'll find 9 acorns on the ground in the time it takes me forage one.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kharakid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">These I have given up on looking for my self except for the few times I am running thru MT to RV or runnyeye.  There is a ground spawn loc to right of runnyeye tunnel near far right goblin camp near a tree I check when ever I am in zone.  I have taken to buying them in the bazaar,  can find em for 20-50pp each and your helping out a newbie usually.  It's frustrating, I bet I forage 3 of the no drop epic foraged roots for every acorn I get!  Seems the less I actualy try to get them the more often I do.  Have been hoading these things since I was lvl 10 or so, have 20 stacks on mules waiting for the day I can do the cultural tailoring and the haversacks!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I found the pattern that Misty acorns follow, so finding them isn't bad at all, and this might save you a lot of running into trees as you stare at the ground.<br />
<br />
If you observe the map of the Misty Thicket, you'll see that the Wall splits it into east and west halves.  Draw an imaginary line across it from the west side to the east to split it again into north and south, and you'll see four quadrants.  The acorns spawn one in each quadrant when they spawn, although it's rarely if ever in the same place within the quadrant.  So, start your search in one corner of a quadrant, and scope across it in a search pattern.  When you find an acorn, move to the next quadrant and keep looking.    This way, you don't end up searching a lot of ground in a quadrant you already cleared, so you can spend more time in the others.  I often find three in fifteen or twenty minutes this way when the zone is empty, and sometimes all four.<br />

Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">They exist.  I've seen them from time to time.  Usually near the goblins SW in the zone.</div></div><hr />

start your search in one corner of a quadrant, and scope across it in a search pattern.  Thanks for this post, Silverfish. Could you clarify a bit when you have a moment? I understand the quadrant partitioning of the zone, but what do you mean by &quot;scope across it in a search pattern&quot;? My search patterns have consisted largely of running around like an idiot and being pleasantly surprised when I've found one. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nanndas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I did a few runs with my 52 druid, Naelaan. I used wolf form and walked, not run. I had foraged an acorn, so I dropped it and adjusted my gamma until it stuck out like a stoplight. It seemed to be better with a darker gamma. I then ran around the perimeter of the zone as well as the stone wall dividing the zone. On 2 different occasions I located one in front of the entrance to Runnyeye. I have also located one other if you follow the wall to the left as you exit Rivervale about 1/2 way to the stone wall.<br />
<br />
Last night with my 24 druid, Lenann I was running to RV down the path and there was an acorn next to the path as you entered the big clearing in front of the entrance to RV. <br />
<br />
Seems to be a random drop to me..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Binkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I just ran through Misty earlier to kill Fabled Mooto (I was messing around on my baby halfling druid and he slaughtered me, hehe).  Picked up 2 misty acorns in the same small area between two of the gob camps while I was looking for him.  So the quadrant theory may not be accurate.</div></div><hr />
