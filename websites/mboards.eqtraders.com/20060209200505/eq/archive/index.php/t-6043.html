<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vordok</div><div class="date">04-14-2003, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am open for orders on imbued field plate. My idea for pricing is that the buyer supplies the imbued gems and on successful combine, pays the following 150 pp for 1 sheet items, 250 pp for 2 sheet items, and 350 pp for 3 sheet items. Failures cost the buyer nothing but the gem.<br />
<br />
I am currently at 189 smithing, and based on the three complete suits I've made at this point, I have about a 90% success rate (failed 4 pieces in 43 attempts).<br />
<br />
I am also willing to consider temper materials for Human, Elven, Dark Elven, and Acrylic as well as (additional) imbued gems as partial payment.<br />
<br />
If interested please email me at vordokdarkelf at yahoo.com (best general bet) or in game. I am most likely to be on as Rhysla (usually in the bazaar and AFK in trader mode), Mysophilia, or Mistletoe.</div></div><hr />
