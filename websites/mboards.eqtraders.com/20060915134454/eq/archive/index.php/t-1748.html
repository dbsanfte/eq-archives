<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gello</div><div class="date">01-01-2003, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1-158 route everyone else uses, maybe if you've got an inexhaustable supply of misty acorns you can dabble in vale studded masks (I forget what triv is and main site is not loading for me at the moment).  I wouldn't use any HQ brute hides before 158 tho, save them all.  No matter how painful heady kiolas become, you'll look back with fond nostalgia to the wu days.<br />
<br />
From 158 to 215 you can do the same things everyone else does (whatever you can get your hands on), and vale reinforced masks.  These use HQ brute hides+acorn oil+steel boning+pattern.<br />
<br />
At very low levels (1-20) you can hunt in Warslik's Woods for brutes.  In mid-high 20's you can hunt the brutes outside Dalnir in WW.  At 29+ you can hunt in frontier mountains for brutes.  At 39+ (or 35+ depending on class/groupability) you can hunt in DL for brutes.  Levels vastly depending on class, gear for some classes and whether you're grouped or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pehaps with recipes, trivial levels, and a guide to pelt drops?<br />

NAH, Its just a pipe dream....<br />

Acrylia, Veliuos or Solctice robe is the way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aenadil</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I prefer a different route than what the guide suggests.  I'll explain why at the end<br />
<br />
1-66: Woven mandrake (2 mandrake combined, about 2pp per mandrake)<br />
66-88: greyhopper armor (greyhopper hide + mask pattern, farmed in MS)<br />
88-95: greyhopper armor (2 greyhopper hide + tunic pattern)<br />
95-135: owlbear tunic (2 owlbear pelts + 2 shade silk threads + tunic pattern + acrylia thimble and needle set; destroy the tunic)<br />
136-144: Wu's shoulderpads / mantle (vial of viscous mana + shoulderpad pattern + 4 heady kiola + 1 silk swatch)<br />
144-151: Wu's sleeves (same, but 2 silk swatch)<br />
151-158: Wu's tunic (same, but 3 silk swatch)<br />
158-220: CEREMONIAL SOLSTICE ROBES<br />
(this is where I am right now, so I won't speculate what works best at higher skill)<br />
<br />
Why the above instead of the usual items?<br />
<br />
1.  mandrake is storebought.  Speed is your choice right?<br />
2.  greyhopper hides?  For a few reasons:<br />
    a.  because if you get spider silks, you want to save them for Wu's<br />
    b.  because spider silks are bought by a lot of people, and hence more expensive than they need to be.<br />
3.  owlbear tunic??  This is untested by me, but I've looked at the viability a few times.  I've seen owlbear pelts selling by the dozens in the bazaar anywhere from 1pp to 5pp.  Considering that the alternative is quivers (requiring HQ cat pelts, and an inflated price easily 3-5 times more than owlbear pelts because everyone and their mother makes these), or Wu's (and Wu's takes a lot more)<br />
4.  Wu's.  self-explanatory.  :)<br />
5.  Solstice robes, at 158??  Yep, and welcome to Combine Hell.  :)  Since you get the most expensive component back on failure, it costs you roughly 80pp (counting sub-combine failures) per attempt to raise skill.  People would argue that they can farm acrylia and flawless rockhopper hides rather easily, making it practically free, but they forget that they could also SELL those things in the bazaar.  On my server, the prices of small pieces of acrylia are 45pp and the pelts are 150-200pp, making it easily around 300pp EACH ATTEMPT to make studded acrylia armor.  Sell it, spend a few (more than a few) hours doing combine after combine.  But the end result is that every 20 attempts you'll get a solstice robe.  And 80pp x 20 + 650pp (price of a chain in the bazaar on my server) = 2250, for a robe you can sell for 1200 (again, bound to fluctuate due to server).  That will help offset your costs by a large amount.<br />
Oh, I forgot the catch... you need a decent supply of imbued emeralds.  But even paying bazaar prices (my server is 25pp, cost is over 13pp) you still come ahead over studded acrylia.  If you can imbue them yourself, keep in mind it takes roughly 3 hours with KEI to imbue 200 of them, and you end up needing 3 per attempt.  ouch.<br />
<br />
BTW, I've sold every single solstice robe I've made, and thats almost 50 of them.  Each batch has sold out in either a day (when I drastically undercut) or within a week.<br />
<br />
The market will get saturated sooner or later, but hopefully not before I sell the results from my next 185 attempts sitting in my inventory (555 sacred silks.  UGH!)  My skill is at 201 (probably 206 after this batch), and it still seems viable to do for another 10 points or so.<br />
<br />
After this, I'm probably going to do arctic wyvern masks, and I'll be sighing in relief when I don't have to spend hours doing sub-combines.  :)</div></div><hr />
