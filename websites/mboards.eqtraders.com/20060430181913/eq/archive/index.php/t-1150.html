<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fredre</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can personally verify that the Trivial for Freeport Field Plate Girdle (non-imbued) is equal to or less than 195, two points lower than listed in the cultural recipie section.<br />
<br />
Now my question:<br />
<br />
I am currently at 197 smithing.  I can get tempers and padding at a decent enough rate, however, HQ folded sheets are my slow component.  Rather than moving from 2 sheet combines to 3 sheet combines after Helms become trivial (202&gt; &amp;lt;=213), I am considering doing 1 sheet imbued versions (Imbued Collar = 219).  I have a geerlok so I will be smithing at about 10 points higher than my skill (~212 or higher), so should be in the range of succesfull combines.  <br />
<br />
For those that have done this, will it greatly impact my ability to garner skill-ups (knowing that skill-ups are more common when approaching the items trivial)?<br />

With the imbued field plate you need to acquire imbued gems.  However if you can find an amenable druid/cleric/shammy, this very well might be cheaper.  Note the selling price on imbued vs unimbued to NPC is the same.  I'd suggest errolsi (rose quartz) or rallos zek (jade) since those are extremely cheap gems.  Now I smith with 255 str, and past 210 (I was 209 on may 8th) I get 1 skill up per 20 combines.  So, if you're looking to advance your skill to the gm point you better put away any silly notions of saving money and resign yourself to the fact that it's going to cost an arm and a leg.  Heh why just last night I went through over 300 HQ folded sheets with which I gained 5 skillups.  And that is *exactly* what I had expected to skill up.</div></div><hr />

BTW, I have no silly notions about saving money.  I farm FS weapons and buy HQ blocks and its still the slow component to gather for me.<br />

First, farming FS weapons for ore is SLOW.<br />
That time would be better spent farming for unrefined ore, with which you can restock the HQ ore vendors.  Even buying up the lg bricks and combining those together to make blocks would be faster.  There are HQ merchants in the bazaar, Qeynos, PoK and Kaladim.  The first 3 are your best bet as you can't SoW or JBoots or Selos etc in Kaladim and so you can't move with one agi.  Also check for unrefined ore in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annu</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whenever the  vendor in PoK runs out of HQ ore, I just hop down to Highpass Keep via Misty Thicket, Rivervale, and Kithicore, buy 4 blocks of unrefined ore from one of the vendors in the keep basement (close to pickclaws.. they almost always have them from players selling them) for 7 plat each, put em in the box, combine, and gate back to PoK to turn them in.  I even make money doing it.<br />
<br />
I have actually been thinkin about /auctioning in the basement to see if I can buy the blocks from players cheaper than I can merchants and just running back and forth all night.... dunno if its worth it for 20 plat per trip though.  If one were a wizard though, I bet you could make some pretty decent coin doing it though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fredre</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Money is definately in short supply.  I have enough unrefined ore to do the quest at least five times, but have yet to need to restoack a vendor before being broke.  Since I can restock the vendor any time I want, I see no need to sink my money in HQ ore until I am ready to do some skill ups.  Better to hang onto my money to buy temper ingredients, padding, etc.  Then I can nearly deplete my funds (need to save enough to buy molds, water, and make chain jointing) buying HQ ore to maximize sheets.  Trust me, I do know where to get material, how to get material, and how much that material will cost.  HQ ore is still my rate-limiting component for combines.<br />
<br />
My main question is, am I hurting myself to try a higher trivial recipie if it conserves the rate-limiting component, thus allowing me a higher number of attempts?</div></div><hr />

Just building up a stack of them to start on Imbued helms</div></div><hr />

Could you do me a favor and skillup on imbued visors instead of imbued collars?  I was hoping to nail down all the trivials for imbued field plate.  The website currently says visors trivial at 220 or 221 (&gt;219 &amp;lt;=221).  However, I tried visors starting at skill 218 in order to figure this out.  It turns out visors were already TRIVIAL.  In other words imbued visors are trivial &amp;lt;= 218.  <br />
<br />
Since they have a lower trivial than collars, I would suggest using them anyway.  In addition to more success, you could help figure out the real trivial on visors :-)<br />
<br />

<br />
PS in answer to your original question, in my mind skill up is much more important than success rate.  Success on these items is 95%+ with or without geerlok in my experience.  If you need the slot to get to a higher wis/int/str then do it! :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fredre</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can skill up on Visors then.  INT shouldn't be a problem.  I'm at 249 without KEI, and 259 with KEI and geerlok.  I will let you know what I find out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fallwell</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I stopped doing non-imbued field plate after 1 sheet combines trivialled.  I did this for a number of reasons.  Firstly, those 9 sheets could be used on 9 attempts rather than 3.  Also, the money I lose from every combine adds up fast with the poor vendor resale prices.  I have also found that I rarely fail on combines, seemingly far less than even 5% on the field plate...even counting breastplates and greaves far below their trivials (although I have only made a few of these for friends.)<br />
<br />
One thing I figured out a bit late is that I gain about 1 plat each on bracers over gorgets on sellback.  Not much by itself, but adds up over the 700 or so field plate combines I have done.<br />
<br />
When i did pottery, for example, I tried an experiment to test out skillups based on trivials.  I made large bowls which trivial well over 100 from point 1.  I skilled up at a comparable rate as I did with other tradeskills.  Only difference is I failed on almost every combine until I broke 100 or so.  (been a long time, so sorry about the lack of good pottery triv info)<br />
