<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>xazn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My fishing is 200 and was fishing to get cooking up on breaded salmon.  I now have good supply of Hero parts (14 stacks) for hero sandwich and wonder if I should do salmon until trivial (think 205) or start on hero sandwich now?  current skill is 195.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naeadiene Needsamap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd use the lower trivial item first.  Might as well use it up before it becomes trivial.  <br />
<br />
Happy Combining! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">can do breaded salmon til 215ish as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>branagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Definitely do all the salmon til it trivials.   Much easier to simply fish for more ingredients, than buy or farm hero parts.<br />
<br />
Also if you have access to Plane of Water, you can fish there to get to 222 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>salomeasillverfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Okay, I am flagged for water but have never zoned in, is there a safe spot to fish like there is in PoS and where is it from zonein?<br />
thanks  Sal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>miseaujeu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">PoWater zone-in DOES have a spot to fish ... but it is NOT safe.  There are two mobs that are within aggro range if you move close enough to the water to fish.<br />
<br />
Luckily these mobs DO NOT see through invis!  So, you can invis yourself and fish as long as that lasts .... just be sure and get out of their aggro range when the invis fades :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>xazn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Is the drop rate in Po Water better than Storm for the fish? Or is it best to wait on Water until the fish in Storm become trivial?<br />
<br />
Edit:  talkin about using the bread crumbs and 2 diff combines sorry for the confussion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Different fish in both zones, PoStorms has salmon and PoWater has snapper and halibut.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>branagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Definitely wait on Water until after Storms is trivial.   Fishing invis is a pain in the butt.  Storms you can fish right at the zone in and watch TV or something while you are doing it.  Fishing in Water I had to really pay attention to make sure I didnt miss the message about my invis dropping :)</div></div><hr />
