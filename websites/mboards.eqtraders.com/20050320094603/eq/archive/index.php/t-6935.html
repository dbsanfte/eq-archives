<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zyrtryx Conjureblade</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got an idea and was wondering if anyone is in a guild that has done this. And I think this would be something that guilds should think about doing, if they don't already:<br />
<br />
I suggested to one of the officers in my guild that we should set up sort of a research library\exchange. What this would mean is that one or two of the officers would use an alt to store research words, pages and runes in the bank, and if someone needed them they would have to provide another component on a 1 for 1 basis. Meaning if you need two words from the bank, you'd have to provide two words to go into the bank at the time you collect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is this a good idea?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grenoble</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We just added a mule specifically research-only in my guild, and I put up a tradeskill mule for silks, pelts, etc.  We had it all lumped in one guild bank before.<br />
<br />
It's not an exchange.  You need something, just ask.</div></div><hr />

I control the armor/weapons, spells, tailoring, smithing, and baking mules for my guild. Looks like  a new mule will be created. Thanks for the suggestion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barraind Faylestar</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have several mains who hold research components in the bank or on mules, plus Barrforge and Aamulee (mine) to hold everything smithed/brewed that is for the guild (sheets, rings, tempers, tanning agents, ect)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Faymar</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 06:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a very well organised research mule where half a dozen people hold the log in; this makes it easy for anyone who has research parts to drop them off. If we end up with more than 20 of anything, the person is given the remainder to sell.<br />
<br />
Never needed to do it as an exchange; the only issue we ever had was someone wanting the full stack of something to get research skills up (they were given 10 as we had a full stack) but taking all the words was not seen as reasonable.<br />
<br />
I will say we did the same with a tradeskill mule which did not work very well at all after the early days (you just need too many of any given item, I think).</div></div><hr />
