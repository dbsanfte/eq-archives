<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a few ingredients to make hurricane armour. I want to make it as a goal in my smithing career. Tae Ew, Heraldic, Planar.<br />
<br />
But, I'd also like to sell it afterwards. I don't know anyone who would make great use out of it. Which piece would you say is the most sellable of the Hurricane armours? Or shall I try some chain because it is easier and wait to do plate later?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frerin the Smith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In my opinion, Hurricane Plate is such a little upgrade from any cultural plate, that it's not worth making.  It is a darn fine chain suit though and I sell chain tunics and leggings on a regular (1 or 2 pieces a week) basis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nalien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've found that the Hurricane chain sleeves and gloves sell pretty good. The tunic and legs don't seem to compete very well against tae ew chain though (tae ew tunics go for like 3k any more on Xev), so I've always edged away from making them.<br />
<br />
I agree with Frerin though, the plate just doesn't seem to be worth it, unless you're filling a specific order. It takes four times as many copper bricks (and double the hurricane tempers) to make a copper sheet as it does to make one copper ring. Basically, plate just gives you more chance for failures with scarce components and gives not great competition against other plate items.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/agree Nalien.  Stay away from Hurricane plate and the Chain Tunic and Leggings for the reasons given.<br />
<br />
I have had good success with chain arms, gloves, boots and helms in about that order of usefullness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frerin the Smith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the advice.  I have some sales for the tunic and leggings every once in a while, but the tae ew stuff is now being sold dirt cheap and about on par.<br />
<br />
I guess I'll investigate the sales of chain arms and gloves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you are looking to make some Money then everyone else is right the chain route is the way to go... However I personally have made Hurricane plate arms and bracers, some folks in my guild are asking me to make them some as well. <br />
<br />
As with ANY player made item you really need to pick and choose what you wear and who you target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Since Hurricane Tempers are also needed for the Aid Grimel quest (albeit not too many per tradeskiller), the price on Drops of Pure Rain tends to get unreasonably high at times.  This often makes it much harder to justify the cost of Hurricane Plate armor compared to cultural plate.  If you can get Drops at a sensible price, though, you should be able to provide some serious competition to the plate sellers in your local bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Abazagaroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hurricane Plate arms are the only plate that is worth making to sell without a pre-order. You can make a greater profit on them than you can for any chain piece. They are pretty much the second best droppable arm slot for plate classes, particularly for paladins and clerics. Let me put it this way, it is extremely close to elbow spiked armplates in terms of stats. Almost negligable differences. So what do elbow spiked sell for?<br />
<br />
I don't actively smith anymore, just buy components when I see them very cheap, but I have made like 20 pairs of the plate arms and none have taken more than 24 hours to sell. Chain arms, gloves, and coif all generall sell as well, just tend to take awhile.<br />
<br />
Plate gauntlets and helm will sell too, but no faster than the chain and with slightly less profit.<br />
<br />
I will post the caveat though, that on my server there are almost no high end tradeskill stuff available due to an agreement between elemental guilds. So if you are on a server with livestone plate generally available, then this may not hold for you as much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>FeroceFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I wear a hurricane plate BP I made myself.  Was a big PITA to make, but I liked making it; it's probably the only one on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My shaman wore hurrican chain gloves, helm and boots until I replaced them with ornate.<br />
<br />
My SK wore plate arms until I replaced them with elbow spiked arm plates.  The arms went to a warrior who is, as far as I know, still wearing them.<br />
<br />
I'd never waste the tempers to make a BP, especially not with the windworn chestplate dropping in the same area.<br />
<br />
Overall the chain is very nice for shamen - the pieces I had sold overnight for ~5-10k once I got my ornate.  Sure I could've got more too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>B_Delacroix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Tunics of any type aren't selling well now on Karana.  Legs, however, and other parts do.  I'd go with chain unless you just have hurricane temper to spare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Windworn chestplate sell for 45k on Cazic , Hurricane sells for 20-24k.<br />
