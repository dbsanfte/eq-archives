<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaneau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I  really need some help here. I am currently at 219... coiled springs are going for 250+ each on Torv - so I have been living in Gunthak for the past two weeks farming quills, waterlogged rigging and roots. I use a Clockwork contraption.. my stats are: <br />
<br />
STR 260 <br />
STA 210 <br />
AGI 167 <br />
DEX 185 <br />
WIS 141 <br />
INT 157 <br />
CHA 138 <br />
<br />
All of my combines are successful however I am not getting ANY skill ups. In all the other tradeskills I have never seen this happen. Is this common after 200? Has anyone else experienced this? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Goresmash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First try and get your WIS or INT higher if possible.  And yes I have seen this happen before in other tradeskills, I recently did 4 stacks of pottery combines for no skill ups and only 4 fails.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hehe i vendor mined 5 coil springs now and gave to a guild mate for some collapsed stuff.  1 skill up and no successes on the first 2 and haven't found them for the next three yet.  dont mind losing them at 1pp each off vendor.  :D<br />
<br />
some ppl get over 600 combines before a skill up.  i have gotten almost 100 just last night with 255 int.  you really need to get int gear.  what class are you?  gnome warriors will probably have the hardest time with getting int/wis up.  (yes i do know one and she kicks butt.)  int caster should be easy and wisdom pretty easy too.  any of the sandblasted plate from ldon gives wis if your a plate class.  <br />
<br />
worst i have ever heard is 1000 combines without a skillup.  you are doing fine but extra int/wis would be wonders for you.  these are hell levels for a reason.  average of 1 skillup per almost 50 combines for me atm in baking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaneau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, I am a warrior. It wouldn't be so bad if the combines didn't cost a fortune. I will pilfer int gear off some alts and see what happens. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gnomtrix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Coiled Springs going for 250pp!  Wonder if I should sell the 12 stacks I have!<br />
<br />
That price is crazy - even at the height of the collapsed container sales they (springs) were around 25-50pp in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They regularly sell for 100-150+ (I did see 250 a few times) on Quellious. I just have friends save them for me or farm them myself.</div></div><hr />

Yah, but at that time, a lot more people xp'd in PoP.  Now, with LDoN out, there's a lot less supply.  Figured that would happen at some point...stocked up 10+ stacks myself back when they were dirt cheap in anticipation of the day the supply would drop.<br />
<br />
250 still crazy though;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arrica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Heh, every now and then I'll drag my butt over to PoI and get myself into a group, even though at 57 the exp from entrance mobs has tailed off considerably (at least it's pseudo-decent AA :rolleyes: ), rather than even try to buy in the bazaar.  I do however constantly watch Tranquility merchants for the springs, as I'm much more comfortable paying 1pp per spring than I am the 50 to 100 in bazaar (that, and if I can get it myself, I do my utmost not to buy it in the bazaar).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaneau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Went garage selling and picked up some Int gear... boy do i look bad. lol Got my stats to:<br />

WIS 122<br />
INT 190<br />

Still in Gunthak (heavy sigh) making geerloks... <br />
<br />
220-221 44 combines<br />
221-222 22 combines<br />
222-223 11 combines<br />
223-224 27 combines<br />
224-225 65 combines<br />
225-226 55 combines</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gnomtrix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That looks about right for INT 190.<br />
<br />
With INT 255 I was getting around 1 skillup per stack, rarely 2, and sometimes 0.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kritta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Those look better. As a warrior, unbuffed and wearing my tinker'n clothes I can get int to 210. It makes a big difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaneau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Got int to 233.... went from 226 to 236 skill  in 152 combines.  not too shabby... PLUS I finally get to leave GUNTHAK!! WOOHOO!!!<br />

<br />
LOL, I'm a monk, and every time I ask for KEI, feel need to explain why...<br />
<br />
Though a lot of KEI vendors know who I am by now, hehe, and are no longer suprised.  The rare times one of my guild KEIers is on, then don't even ask why anymore.  In fact often I don't even have to ask for KEI from them, they just automatically give it to me, hehe.</div></div><hr />

The company would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Coiled springs sell for almost 400pp a shot right now on my server... so :( My gnome is just about ready to start combining his third deluxe toolbox full of quills and riggings (five stacks each).  I have found that the Silver-tipped Quills and Waterlogged Riggings are much more commonly found on NPC vendors than the Maneater Roots and Scorpion Venom Glands (remember, only the stackable glands can be used for tinkering).</div></div><hr />
