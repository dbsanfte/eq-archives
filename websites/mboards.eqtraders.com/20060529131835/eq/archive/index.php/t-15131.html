<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zori</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the cheapest way I have found so far. I have not tried any of the GoD fletching. Most was bought in the PoK Till a 204 skill. I farmed everything possable and when I was at 240 I had made plat off of fletching<br />
<br />
1-36 Buy your skills or make class 1 wood point arrow (bundled wooden arrow shafts, field point arrowheads, medium groove nocks, several round cut fletchings)<br />
<br />
36-68 class 1 bone point arrow (bundled bone arrow shafts, field point arrowheads, large groove nocks, several round cut fletchings)<br />
<br />
68-102 class 1 wood hooked arrow (bundled wooden arrow shafts, hooked arrowheads, large groove nocks, several round cut fletchings)<br />
<br />
102-135 Class 2 Ceramic Point Arrow (bundled ceramic arrow shafts, field point arrowheads, large groove nocks, several parabolic cut fletchings)<br />
<br />
135-182 Class 1 Wood Silver Tip Arrow ( bundled wooden arrow shafts, large groove nocks, several round cut fletchings, silver tipped arrowheads)<br />
<br />
182-202 Class 1 Steel Point Arrow (bundled steel arrow shafts, field point arrowheads, large groove nocks, several round cut fletchings) For that part I went to the high elf town to buy the arrow shafts<br />
<br />
202-240 Shadow Tipped Acrylia Arrow (bundled acrylia arrow shafts[SMITHING arrow shaft mold, small brick of acrylia ore, water flask<br />
], condensed shadow arrowheads[SMITHING chunk of condensed shadow, file, water flask], several shield cut fletchings, small groove nocks)<br />
<br />
<br />
When I started on the Shadow Tipped Acrylia Arrow it was a nightmare however its the cheapest route I have found heck I even made plat off of it here is how. The source of my Acrylia was Tenebrous Mountains. Basicaly load up on back packs and go kill the grimlings in the caves near the zone loot everything but the no drop stuff when you are full and have to run to Grimling Forest to sell you should get anywhere from 200-800 plat off the runes and gems. The arrow head ore you get in Shadeweaver's Thicket go into the cave system there the condenced shadow drops off of the black aliens there I never found out how to make them spawn basicaly I kept the back 4 or so caves clear and they would pop every 3-4 cycles. Well I hope this helps those that wish to become a gm fletcher feel free to email me with any updates you wish me to add and I will consider it. <br />
