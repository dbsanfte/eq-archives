<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Escian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">anyone done the abysmal sea smithing quest to unlock the recepie for shimming aligned ore?  I tryed both the aligned ore and the noobie quest where they give you the items, and i cant get past the first step, i've done 160 combines on the skewers which ya only do 30, and done 200 combines on the studs which ya need to do 100, at least thats what it says on the quest page.  Any info would be helpful.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">One thing more . . . make sure you're handing them in one at a time, not one stack at a time.  Heard of people making that goof; doing 200 combines and handing in 10 stacks in stack form instead of as 200 individual items, only counts as 10 items.</div></div><hr />

You only need 100 of each combines. Read this for further question:<br />
<br />
http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q142&amp;menustr=120037000000<br />
<br />
Couple of things, make sure you turn in one at a time not stack. Second, after the 5th stack turn in (100 combines) you get the same quest for 6th stack, finish up that stack and re-hail the NPC to clear the bug. They should give you the next level after the hail and the dialog.</div></div><hr />

For the JC quest, I got the next step unlocked between 88 and 101 for 3rd wave (successes, 160 combines) and 80 and 92 for 4th wave (successes, 140 combines).</div></div><hr />

You don't have to succeed on 100 combines but you do have to attemp 100 combines. You can turn in less than 100 to get the next level but you do have to do the full 100 combines at least. That is mentioned on the link above if you read it carefully.<br />

<br />
Holy cow.  You need 200 hundred combines.  Let me see if my math is good today.  200 hundred would come out to be twenty thousand.  Wow.  That's a whole lot of combines.   ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
What in the world are you concerned about 400 combines for?<br />
It's 100 attempts per wave, four wave total. Recipie is learnable<br />
hand 'em in unstacked 4 at a time, it takes 15 minutes to do.<br />
<br />
Freebies are fun to be honest abysmal sea ALWAYS deserted on my server<br />
(Rallos......ah the power of Zek!)  I was only one in there for about two hours.  Which is the time it took me to find the freebi vendor people, do the combines and then move on.  Including the poison maknig freebie.  I really do hate the DNC message btw.<br />
<br />
Smithing guy is straight up the stairs all the way until you hit the big landing with lot of buildings, head to the left rail until, then follow it away from the stairs.  You'll find a forge.  The building beside you is the one with the vendor in it.   PS click the link in the above posts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then lean back and enjoy the fun of smithing items that most people haven't seen before.</div></div><hr />

Explain then how I did 160 combines for a wave.  Read what *I* wrote carefully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jarak_akn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It takes a little less than 100 sucesses per wave.<br />
These have to be handed in UNSTACKED<br />
In order to get (almost) 100 sucesses you have to attempt at least 100 combines (or at least be given the ingredients to attempt 100)<br />
If your skill is low (e.g. if you are using the quest to skill up to 54) then you will attempt many more than 100, but will still only need (about) 100 sucesses.<br />
<br />
I have done the 7 core trade skill tests. <br />
For JC I was already 242 + Trophy so it took me only 100 attepts per wave.<br />
For the other skills I was mostly sub-10 skill before I started.<br />
Generally I was taking between 160 and 200 attempts per wave.<br />
<br />
I may be able to get the exact numbers if people are interested.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jarak_akn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ok here are my numbers for Fletching. (the smithing stuff is a bit more garbled but the principal is the same)<br />
<br />
I started at zero skill.<br />
I got skill ups as I went. <br />
When I got to skill 54 during wave 4 I then skilled up to 170 before doing the final combines for hand in.<br />
I had 255 Int throughout.<br />
<br />
Wave 1 took 180 attempts and 104 successes<br />
Wave 2 took 160 attempts and 105 successes<br />
Wave 3 took 140 attempts and  93 successes<br />
Wave 4 took   20 attempts and  11 successes before 170 skill<br />
and             100 attempts and   96 successes after 170 skill<br />
<br />
I got 33 skill ups on success<br />
and 21 on failure <br />
<br />
337 of the 600 combines were trivial so it took me 263 attempts to reach 54 skill<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Maddoc-the-Wayfarer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I had figured that you guys would figure this out sooner, rather than later, but, here's a little secret or two:<br />
<br />
1. The freebie combines will give you a set base amount of &quot;tradeskill-favor&quot;, so to speak.<br />
2. The hand-in combines will give you significantly more favor for the combine/hand-in. Basically, they really like having you do their dirty work (gathering raw materials). You work, so they don't have to! <br />
<br />
 :cool: <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Duncan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Maddoc: Would you be willing to comment on the refining quests that seem to have no point, ie. no recipies utilizing the refined item?  Taelosian Wheat, and the Poison item (Muramite blood?) come to mind.<br />
<br />
I for one was VERY excited when you first quoted the total number of recipies in the new expansion.  Can you say if there are still whole lines of items that have not been discovered?  Or were there recipies that just &quot;didn't make it into the game on time?&quot;<br />
<br />
Would help lots of us to know if we:<br />
<br />
1) Have a lot of work ahead of us, scouring the gameworld for reference material, NPC text, clues, etc. - something some of us really enjoy<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
2) Would be better off focussing on some other aspect of the game as the GoD well has been plumbed out...at least as far as new recipies is concerned.</div></div><hr />

If you read it, it says there are two ways where you can do more than 100 combines. <br />
<br />
1. If you turn them in stacks rather than individually.<br />
2. There is a bug that makes you do more than 100 combines per wave. There is a way to clear this by hailing the NPC and doing the dialog again. That gets you to the next level.<br />
