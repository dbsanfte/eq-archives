sorry no idea on details, I'm not a farmer :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ranger_Lahru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">no arrow that will take you past 202 trivials ... Meaning they are all &gt;250 ... the above listed recipes for bows  are the only recipes that do trivial prior to 250, but post 202.  You can also look at the new LDON recipes for sedgewood, but those require farming in the EF LDoN encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">acrylia arrows are over 202, as well as cultural arrows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">wood elf gets cultural and can use if follow tunare <br />
or karana, any race, for your god required to do deity fletching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>intertex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Keep making Mithril Champion Arrows  should be able to get yourself to 250...if u're wood elf (which luckily is my race)<br />
Quite expensive compare to the arrows before 202...but lot cheaper than darkwood bow<br />
U may try making Steel Guardian Arrows if u worship Karana, more expensive then Mithril, but still cheaper than the bow<br />

BTW, i'm new to this board. Greeting~~~:D</div></div><hr />

200-250 on arrows.... real cheap, if you take the time to farm the items yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>albeishere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Where is the best place to camp the acryila at I have been to Acryila cavers yeilds the best but been there for 2 hours and got like 2 peices ans 1 small brick.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Do a search for &quot;acrylia&quot;.. there's a couple threads that have pretty in depth discussion on where to get it.<br />
<br />
Personally, i do AC.  Mobs in the entrance section all have a chance to drop it, and it's a bit more common than what you've gotten.. probably the rng jumped on your back.  In 3-4 hours, i usually fill my packs with acrylia, weapons, and shards.   I've farmed roughly 280 shafts worth of acrylia, and gained roughly 12k plat doing so... mind you i've spent probably 50pp of that making those shafts... certainly cheaper than buying you're way to 250 on bows, or through the bazaar.  I figure going from 200 to 250 will put me up about 60-75k minimum.. plus experience, assuming i don't sell any of the arrows i make.<br />
<br />
Trackers might get better results in TM, but i'm not positive of the abundance of the aliens that drop it... i just usually stumble around till i find one.</div></div><hr />
