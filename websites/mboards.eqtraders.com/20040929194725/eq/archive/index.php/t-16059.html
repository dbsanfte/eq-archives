<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>burnttoastv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Did a search, and just found references to the stats.  Is there a website that shows weapon graphics on the player made weapons?  Couldn't find any at eqfashion.com.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nimphe Wildwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Firebrand Weapons (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemlist.html?searchtext=firebrand) <br />
<br />
Although not wielded by players, still it's something to look at. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Malathos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I made a couple of these in my early smithing days, and from what I recall the graphic is exactly the same as the standard rusty/tarnished/fine steel weapons you have.<br />
<br />
I was kind off annoyed at this - they could at least have given them a red blade or something  :irked: <br />
<br />
*sigh* another dead end set of seapons that are almost totally useless now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I too seem to remeber them having the generic look as well.  And they were pretty much DoA, not a matter of &quot;useless now.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cherryflavour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Scimitar looks like a Bone Handled Scimitar / Jeldorin<br />
<br />
The Halberd looks like a Black Acrylia halberd<br />
<br />
The Morning Star looks like a velium morning star (Not too sure on this one)</div></div><hr />
