<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bakamon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bess (bazaar mule Beena) is a 250 halfling tailor.  She has made a number of haversacks for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ambrya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bess, to my best recollection, has not been on for many months.  I used to collect tufts for her, and eventually gave up.<br />
<br />
However...I started a halfling alt and have been working on tailoring with her.  Her name is Dryandra.  Her tailoring is only 210 so far, but she is 6 successes out of 6 attempts on Haversacks.  Either the RNG loves her, or the Haversack combine has a small chance of failure.<br />
<br />
If you are willing to take the chance of being her first failure, she will be happy to help you.<br />
<br />
You may contact Dryandra or Ambrya or our bazaar mule Rykambra at any time.  If I am afk in the bazaar, leave a message and I will respond as soon as I check in on the mule.</div></div><hr />
