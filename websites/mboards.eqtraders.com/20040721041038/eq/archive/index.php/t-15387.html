<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>treyna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been doing tradeskills a long time now. And tonite, I think I have hit the wall. 147 combines, 80 of ShadowScream Bracers, and 67 of Enchanted Velium Bits ... my results:<br />
<br />
5 SKILLUPS<br />
<br />
YES, 5!  4 in 80 combines of SS Bracers and yes, 1 in 67 combines of EVB. Talk about the debil. That's like 12 hours of farming for 5 skillups ... I think I'm just gonna crawl back in my hole and weep a little more ....<br />
<br />
/sigh  thanks SoE ... can't bottleneck it enough on supplies ... I guess the RNG just hates me.<br />

I love it!  We should have that one added to smilies here.</div></div><hr />

I'm looking for some sympathy here, but I'm probably all tapped out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Maelina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bah Trey!  Quit yer whining... and go farm velium faster in Skyshrine.  It won't take more than 2 hours to get together that many combines =)  Just hope CoV faction isn't TOO important to you LOL<br />
<br />
P.S.  The RNG hates you because you are ebil :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thicket Tundrabog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What's wrong with 1 skillup every 30 combines?? It's slightly below average for skill level 188+ combines, but certainly nothing to be upset about.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>treyna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Guess I'm a sucker cuz I won't farm an area for supplies when peeps start fussing at me for *taking their exp camp* ... oh and Mae, ditch CoV faction? nawwww ;p too many peeps ask me to go get lil things like velium hound furs and mastodon furs for them ;p would HATE to have those nasty dragons dislike me ;p<br />
<br />
I dunno, 1 skillup per 30 combines .. I seem to remember a patch message saying they slightly increased skillups in smithing, guess they weren't kidding on slightly, prolly sumthin like a .0000001 % increase hehehe<br />
<br />
Prices on my server for velium, swirling shadows, acrylia are just mind boggling ... oh well, back to farming for another day I suppose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Frerin the Smith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Had 226 attempts between 196 and 197.  I would have loved to have had 7 skillups in that period rather than 1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, they did increase them slightly...trust me, 1 in 30 isnt bad at all. I would have killed for that ratio, especially after 220</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kcalehc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thats better than I have been getting.<br />
Skill 223, making regent plate, 1 skill up in about 80 combines.  Thats alot of blue diamonds burned up (especially when you consider my success rate)...<br />
<br />
I would kill for 1 in 30.  I really would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cleetis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">btw what was your skill level starting before the 5 skill ups? if it is past 215<br />
switch to boots. I got killer skill ups with<br />
max str dex and int as high as I could get<br />
it. Once got 3 skill ups on 12 combines<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Maelina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The faction decline in Skyshrine is very very slow... I farmed enough velium to get from 188 to 222 without being KoS.  I think when I was done I was maybe indiff or dubious =)  You might try it for a while, see how fast your faction is going down and adjust it next time you hear there's a ring war.  That's what I'm planning to do to get mine back up a bit.  I'm still ally to Coldain though... didn't change that at all... and really Dain faction is the only one that's hard to re-raise after you lose it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>dmuerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What do you kill in sky shrine to get velium?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Cubwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">*tempts karma* 5 skillups in 52 combines. 205-210 :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I think I'm gonna have to pay for this later.<br />
<br />
3 skill ups in 7 shadowscream boot combines, going from 222 to 225.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I only had enough for 7 combines, bought the swirling shadows because I was too lazy to farm them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Maelina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">@dmuerte - Kill the see through looking mobs, there's lots of them, mostly golem models but not all (about 7 at ZI and probably 20 more along the circuit I was running).  Don't bother with the other types of mobs, as far as I know they do not drop velium.  I wasn't able to make it back around to ZI before repop even with a 65 cleric friend helping me kill.<br />
<br />
Also, there's a FORGE IN THERE OMG~ :)</div></div><hr />
