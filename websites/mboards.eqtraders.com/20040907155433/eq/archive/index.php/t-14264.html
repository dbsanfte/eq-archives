<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quesci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I go through a lot of Celestial Essence.  Many of us do.  I try to buy them in the Bazaar when I can.  Usually I'll pay 5pp each, sometimes 4pp if there is some competition going on.  I've seen them as high as 7pp each, which I snickered at and moved on.  (All prices are Quellious, by the way).<br />
<br />
I've been saying all along that the new UI would lower prices on the mass-produced items.  It is so easy to make these with the new UI, that there should be a ton of sellers all fighting for the best prices.  At 5pp each, three seconds per combine, the hourly profit is more than 3kpp.  Even at 3pp each you can make over 1000pp per hour.<br />
<br />
So why is it that CEs are listed at between 15pp and 25pp each in my Bazaar?  One guy had over 1000 of them at 25pp each.  Is he insane?  With the new UI, it is more likely that people will make their own.  So are prices going up because the cheap people are making their own and only the rich people are left?<br />
<br />
I thought I understood economics pretty well.  Infinite supply and lowered demand should result in lower prices.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh and if this should go in Primal Scream, I apologize.  I am not really ranting so much as looking for a discussion on pricing with the new UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Alarien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What I can't understand is buying something that's a no fail combine of 2 items. It takes a few minutes and like what? 3pp? to make your own.<br />
<br />
So yes, the guy selling 1000 at 25pp each is insane. The scary part is that there is probably some overrich guy out there willing to pay it. Just like the people who pay 15pp for a spider silk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If I only need 1 CE 25pp would be well worth saving me the time to buy a mortar and pestle and running to pok to make the one combine. If I only needed one or two Id go for it. (Course I keep a stack or two in the bank for just such an emergency.)</div></div><hr />

What I can't understand is buying something that's a no fail combine of 2 items.  <br />
<br />
Because I need more than 180 of them for a run of sickles and more than 120 for a run of robes.  If I am in the Bazar and just bought 120 imbued emeralds and 120 acid, then it is super easy to just buy some CEs and make the blessed dust right there.<br />
<br />
Naturally that is just my opinion.  I can certainly understand the belief that &quot;if you are going to be doing combines anyway, why not just make some CEs?&quot;  My only real concern was wondering why the price went up when combines were made easier.</div></div><hr />

If you buy up the components that are cheaper (words of bondage come to mind), or use the drops from the field, it can be a bit cheaper. <br />
<br />
<br />
Taking the idea of 'I'm in the baz anyway dropping massive quantities of plat anyway, may as well just buy the CEs too'... The 1k-25p guy is probably capitalizing off of that. With the new UI making combines easier, people will be clicking faster and need MORE CEs. So even though it's easier to make em, demand for them is higher. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">First question: Are they SELLING for 25pp each or FOR SALE at 25pp each?<br />
<br />
Big difference. <br />
<br />
Next, who else is selling CE in the bazaar? Is this person actually trying to force up the cost by buying everyone else out?<br />
<br />
As for why. People with 2mil plat and no idea how to make CE. People wanting 100 CE's and don't want the extra hassle of the combines. If they would all pay 25pp I'm not sure but it does seem a stupidly high price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Haven't looked at CEs, but on the Rathe there are still people selling Coldain Velium Tempers for jacked-up prices, even though the Temper can be bought in Thurg again. I'd think the price for the Temper would have gone back down to what it was before that vendor was removed, but it hasn't.<br />
<br />
I've got plenty of extra research items rotting in the bank that can be used to make CEs, and I'm going to do that when I get the time.</div></div><hr />

trying to raise pottery at the time, i was surprised and annoyed by the fact that unfired ceramic linings do not stack. i found the fired version to stack though, and said to myself: &quot;self, you're going to the bazaar and buying 200 - 300 of the fired ones, what much more than 5 or 7 pp can they possibly cost&quot;.<br />
<br />
uh-huh.<br />
25 pp. i forgot the exact numbers but that's roughly 1000% profit right there?<br />

MTP are at an all time low.  :(   I have been selling them for five or six months.  I have seen prices as high as 50pp.  (do people really buy them that high??) and generally not lower than 10pp.  Currently the low in the bazzar is 3pp!!  3pp!!  ACK!  I won't be lowering that low.  <br />
<br />
I know that I made more because it was easier with the new UI and I'm still working my way to 250.  I hope the person selling them that low stop when they reach 250.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ancarett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Put a stack of leather padding on sale yesterday at the price of 20pp per padding. (Which I thought was too high, but mine was the lowest price in the bazaar).<br />
<br />
Another merchant came by and bought out my stack, adding it to her own stock selling at 100pp per padding. Ye gads!<br />
<br />
Hey, I can probably double my price or more and still get her to instantly buy up all my padding. Go me!</div></div><hr />

Your average elemental/time equipped player has all NO DROP equipment, and no possibility of purchasing an upgrade, so what do they have to spend money on but food, reagents, and tradeskill supplies.<br />

People know this and will try to sell their trade supplies for as much as they can get, and why shouldn't they. They don't care if the person who is buying their 100pp leather paddings is a 34th level druid or a 65th level time-equipped cleric.</div></div><hr />

heh, CVTs often sold for pretty ungodly prices before the vendor was ever taken out - 50-75pp, often.  Some people didn't even know they *could* be vendor bought.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup, and to further boost this, there's SOE's trend of using tradeskill raising as a time sink to make quests harder and having some of the nicest tradeskill items (for smithing, tailoring, and fletching) all require multiple drops from elemental zones.  Combine nothing to do with the money and the incentive to raise tradeskills...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Serenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Picnics have sold for 20pp each on Tribunal for as long as I can remember.   Someone has them out there for 15 now, but the day after the UI went live I sold 25 stacks to a single person at 20 each, so that's apparently still a valid price for now.   Of course, I've been selling CEs at 7pp each for over a year now, and for the past week they've been flying off my vendor at that price as fast as I can put them out.  The only ones still out there are at 10pp.</div></div><hr />

I often bought CE's just to save myself the time and effort of doing an extra 100 combines.  But if they are going to charge way too much, I'd probably go back to making my own.<br />

<br />
If you're in a guild, ask a rogue in the guild if he'll do the combines for you, pay him 75PP per stack if you buy the ingredients, or 100pp-125PP if he buys them.<br />
<br />
(The reason I say rogue is because I've noticed the new UI for the M&amp;P doesn't open up for the non-rogue classes, so he'll just have 2 clicks per combine instead of 2 CTRL-click and 4 clicks).<br />
<br />
I agree, most of the prices in the bazaar are ridiculious (sp?).  Vials of Vicious mana at 50PP each?  Magic clay at an insane 50PP each?  Sorry, I'll keep my prices at a (respective) 10-12PP and 3-5PP each.  Each one still has a nice profit margin, and I will at any time (that I'm free) make them for guildies and friends at cost.</div></div><hr />

Silk and leather padding are *always* insane.  The new Nerdia's landing (I think that's the zone's name, port in from any LDoN camp), bears and wolves drop quality pelts about 50% of the time, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're below level 50 (cats do, too, but I think Stonebrunt is better for cat pelts).  Prices haven't dropped yet.<br />
<br />
Silk swatches on mine are 10PP each now (not bad), and no leather paddings, bt I've seen them as high as 50.  (Maybe I should sell my 4 stacks in the bank?).</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I just need 1 or 2, I will easily pay that kind of money in bazaar rather than trudge all the way to Thurgadin and back. After all, I can always include that excess in the price of whatever I am making with the CVT. Of course, if I want stacks and stacks I will go and see Nimren.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The reason they went up, is very simple.<br />
<br />
Supply and demand.<br />
<br />
Ok, you say, the TS interface makes them faster, so supply should be higher. Perhaps, but the TS interface also makes Sickles, robes, BD cultural, and all the other recipes that REQUIRE these, easier to make. SO yes, supply MIGHT go up a bit, but I suspect DEMAND has gone up more, as many people who never did the prayer shawl, or aid grimel (depending on level of player) suddenly decided that with precombined subcomponents, and the new UI, its worth doing tradeskills.<br />
<br />
For a lot of these folks, the time associated with the combines was more of a hinderance than the price of CEs even at 25pp each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'm inclined to wonder if there are a lot more people making stuff to sell that didn't bother before, and that aren't bothering to really price check before putting their own stuff up.  <br />
<br />
There are also some people who just don't pay attention to the prices on the stuff they're selling.  Back when blue diamonds were ~2k each there was someone who put a handful of them up at 2.5k.  Six months later the going rate was ~400pp and that same handful was still sitting there at 2.5k.  If it's an item that sells in large volume, like CE, I can see how having just one or two people with ridiculous prices would skew the thinking of other sellers.<br />
<br />
If my theory is correct, prices should settle down eventually as even the slowpokes get around to checking, quit playing, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Reflan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I would commission runs of CE's from lower levels who loved the money in runs of 500 and more.  <br />
<br />
In tailoring and smithing you can go through huge amounts of them very quickly when trying to skill up.  Some recipes require you to use several per combine.  <br />
<br />
Why not make them all yourself?  Well, some people have more money than time, and vice versa.  Most people don't have the physical stamina to do thousands of CE combines in any reasonable length of time.  For many people, paying a plat or two per over cost per CE and thereby avoiding the running around and massive time sink of making CE's is very economical in terms of money as well as time; they could use that time spent on CE's actually making far more money than they're spending on someone's minor CE profit.<br />
<br />
I knew with the new UI, people with tons of money to blow who wouldn't consider doing tradeskills until the new UI took out the horrible time sink of dragging and dropping would leap into the market to buy goods you use to advance tradeskills.  The stuff you actually made would be made much more often, but the ingredients you used to make the product in the first place would have their prices go through the roof.<br />
<br />
Just for a laugh, a week or so before the new UI I put the last of my sacred tunare silk(for making ceremonial solstice robes, a near worthless item these days for selling), up on my mule overnight for 125pp each.  Prices were so outrageous on so many things lately in the bazaar, well, what the heck.  Well, not overnight for 125pp really.  I put them up on my mule and they sold out before I could get stand up to get out of my chair and hit the bed.  Well, I still had ingredients for more that weren't combined into final form...made them into a stack and a half at 150pp to see if it was a fluke.  Nope.  <br />
<br />
I had done the same thing with dyes, which you need for tailoring the LOY robes.  I put some up for 50pp.  I had a lot, because I always have saved weird forages and anything tradeskill related.  They sold out so fast I scoured the EQ world for the items you need to make the dyes, and put them up at 100pp each.  I absolutely cannot keep them in stock!  <br />
<br />
Now they are on bazaar sellers at 200pp each and more.<br />
<br />
Some other prices I see lately in the bazaar:<br />
<br />
Spider silk 10pp(freak ocurrence) to 30pp each and sometimes more(much more common)<br />
Silk swatches 30 to 68 (!!) plat each<br />
Spiderling silk 10-20pp each<br />
Leather padding 40(rare) to 70pp each and occasionally more<br />
Things you brew to make the LOY dyes for tailoring that I couldn't believe I sold instantly for 100pp each -- up to 500pp!<br />
The dyes themselves -- up to 250pp<br />
Nightmare silk strings(for nightmarewood compound bows) - 2k to 3k each<br />
Innovative bow cams for them -- occasionally as high as 850pp each -- you need two per bow<br />
Finished Nightmarewood bows themselves?  3k<br />
<br />
This will all end, inevitably, when enough rich uber-types have used the new tradeskill UI to blaze through tradeskills 10 to 20x faster than every tradeskiller before them and simply don't need to skill up anymore.  The bubble could burst easily at any time.  <br />
<br />
And this stuff doesn't always sell that quickly.  For a rich enough guy who has no alternative but your vendor, though, your price eventually seems better than nothing, I guess.  <br />
<br />
But there is a limited number of people willing to blow unlimited amounts of cash.  Once they're used up, prices may stay stuck stubbornly up for a while as people refuse to sell at less than the gargantuan profits they've heard about or experienced.  But sooner or later, when you get very few buyers, the prices will have to stabilize at less than a hallucinatory high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sylphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Reflan, I don't know what the deal is with the dyes for ribbons.  I still find them reasonably available at reasonable prices, but also sometimes 150 plat.  That's probably temporary, especially if the forage-bots get interested in that market.<br />
<br />
As for the rest, prices have been like that for months now, long before the new combine window.  Certain supplies (which I shant list) have started to sell out and get expensive the last two weeks, but all the prices in your list are normal.  Berzerker-usable items too.  But just wait... if your server starts to run out of padding or silk, you'll see what real price inflation is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Reflan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Padding there's plenty of, but the prices have doubled and sometimes tripled.<br />
<br />
Spider silk -- sometimes unavailable.  That's why silk swatches have sometimes gotten around 70pp each.  Strange when I compare spider silks selling for 3 years for 1pp each to 10 to 20pp for a while before GoD to sometimes over 30pp per silk now.  One heck of a differential.  <br />
<br />
Spiderling silk -- starting to become unavailable in the last week, price doubling to 20pp each.<br />
<br />
Dye components -- only available from the occasional newbie forager who will put a single maneater bud up for a plat or six plains roots up for 1 plat each, like his foraged vegetables and other foraged goods.  Very hard to find though - a rare find.  Between the rare 1pp sale and the 500pp sale for a plains root lies a vast and empty desert.</div></div><hr />

I saw MTP's on an NPC vendor in a relatively high-traffic area.  Just over 3gp each.<br />
