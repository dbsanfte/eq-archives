<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thom</div><div class="date">12-31-2002, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings fellow Povarians!  I am in search of an armorer on POVAR who can make the Fierce Heraldic gear.  I am in search of 3 pieces only; Greives, Pauldrons and boots.  I have made 2 attempts to acquire these last 3 pieces to utter failure and loss.  One piece of advice..  go with tradeskillers or they may sell someone else the gear they told you failed on combine.  Anyway, I am requesting combines done on those 3 pieces and  would like to pay an adjusted price for obtaining all the ingredients needed and will give several extra ingredients/pay cash as payment.  If anyone is able to or willing to assist me in this I'm not looking for handouts and will pay for the 3 combines on top of the ingredients.   After the last 2 unsuccesful attempts I have squandered away most of my savings specifically for this armor.  **Slaps himself**  Sorry to ramble.  If you can assist in anyway in this manner it would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Many thanks again<br />
