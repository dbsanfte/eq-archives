When you open a kiln now, you can find the recipe for firing the urn.  Unfortuntely, I do not have access to my potter to check the recipe to make the unfired urn.</div></div><hr />

Now where the hell can I get an urn sketch? *sigh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eumerin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That recipe has been around since the Kunark strategy guide was released (iirc, it was included in the guide).  Unfortunately, the sketches have never been seen in-game, and the only acknowledgement that it ever existed within the game itself was a mention of it in an ancient patch (can't remember the details of the message - just that the urn recipe was in the text of the patch message).<br />
<br />
No one knows where to find a sketch.  No one knows what exactly you'd use an Onyx Urn for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>scaevola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Isn't their a sketch from the gunizor's revenge quest that requires a sketch found in howling stones? or maybe its the warrens..maybe i got it backwards..just thought I'd put my 2cent in it...<br />
<br />
Could it have an alternate use for a quest no one's ever done.. Some sketch on some table in hs is all I remember.  Need to ask a friend who did his just needs the dn battle for his sword.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Telorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Garizor's Revenge sketch found in Howling Stones is a Mandela sketch.<br />
<br />
The sketch could be anywhere in Antonica of Kunark I guess, since it was mentioned in the Kunark guide and it was the first expansion.</div></div><hr />

Urn Pattern (not sketch)<br />
<br />
appear in Lucy.  I remember this from Kunark (everyone looking for it) ... my suspicion was always that some vendor in Cabilis must sell the Urn Patterns but who knows.<br />
<br />
Edit: Lucy also has the finished product - a Sacred Urn - which is a 4-slot container which I'm guessing must be for some quest involving collecting remains or something.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dyllwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Originally posted by Candien <br />
Sacred Urn is for Aid Grimel  <br />
<br />
It does bring to mind the question though, why name the template for Aid Grimmel an &quot;Urn Pattern&quot; when most pottered items use &quot;sketches&quot;, unless there was already an &quot;Urn Sketch&quot; in the database somewhere...</div></div><hr />
