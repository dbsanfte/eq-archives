<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is sickening.  Rewarding the new expanision by saving new alchemist thousands of plat to hit 200.  Just not right, as if us legit alchemist that learned the skill as a labor of love didn't have a hard enough time selling our stuff to the limited market SoE has provided us via nerfs and giving our abilities to gnomes/vendors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Otty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">While I am happy for all the shamans that can now easily get their alchemy skill up easily. I do have to cry over all the money us old alchemists had to pay to get to the same place. 5k to get to 200 is just sick. We had to spend 10-20 times that much to get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sindace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At first I was pissed that they made Alchemy a skill that any shaman with a few k and some levels could do.  I wasted 55?k raising it, but then 200 actually meant something.  When I thought about it though, Alchemy has still been the least useful tradeskill and least profitable (on my server).  Its only use to me is being able to make friends some gate potions with minimal failures.    Personally I dont know if knowing what I do now if I'd even bother raising it to 200 again for 3-4k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mogley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Isnt 200 in alchemy supposed to be Grand Master? I have 200 skill but it still says Master</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Azirux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Master is the max for any trade in the game. Grand Master is a term assigned by players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Saleani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This makes me sad. <br />
And for all you who are disappointed....<br />
<br />
These are for potions that will actually get used. 8pp for a single cast of snare is rather steep, but making them, I know they have a real use. I have tons of 10-dose mystical infusions laying around that will never get used or sold (costs 200pp to make and the vendor offers 9pp). I give them away as tips for rezzes. Maybe I should visit that tribute guy.<br />
<br />
Will they get nerfed? Like the ethereal recipes that were changed for PoP? Where before you can press combine, you need a higher skill than the trivial level of them? I hope not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mogley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ok thank you Azirux wasnt sure on that. I hit 200 in Alchemy last night. I thought that if you hit the 200 mark it would say Grand Master was kind of disappointing in a way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ledce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">=o(<br />
<br />
It cost me well over 50K and a lot of time to get my Alchemy to 200.  I bet in a month we will see Alchemists that spent 4k and 30 minutes complaining about how hard they have it, like most of the newbies today.  Paying hundreds or thousands of plat for a potion that sells back to the vendors for 9p was not fun, and I think everyone else should have to suffer like I did!<br />
<br />
*kicks the new Alchemy prices*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mogley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yea I know what you mean Ledce I have been working on my alchemy for a very long time just don thave th eplay time like others have an dI too have spent well over 50k plus to make potion for 293p and it sells to NPC for 9g what a slap in the face</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Being angry that they made it easy is, in my opinion, just a little bit spiteful.<br />
<br />
Don't fall victim to the insidious malady known as &quot;curmudgeonism.&quot;  That's people who endlessly complain about &quot;Back when I was young&quot; and &quot;In my day&quot; and so forth.<br />
<br />
I too did it the old fashioned way.  I lost track of how much plat I burned on alchemy, how many hours I farmed components for old alchemy potions for combines because I couldn't afford to make the standard potions, and I just sighed and carried on when I burned artisan's seals as I tried for GM trophy at 180 skill, then 185, then 190 (where I finally got it).  Then came the expensive grind to 200, most of those potions which were fed to the tribute master when GoD went live, to get them out of my bank.<br />
<br />
Now I'm 200 skill, GM trophy, and all I ever make are SoW potions and gate potions.  It was expensive investment in a tradeskill that has virtually no practical use, but I'm PROUD to be a GM Alchemist.<br />
<br />
Am I upset they made it cheap?  Heck no.  I'm just glad that new shamans won't have to go through what I went through to reach 200.<br />
<br />
Now if they'd just do something like this for tailoring...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ledce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yes, I am proud to be a GM alchemist as well, but it is no longer anything special, anyone that can powerlevel to 65(just about anyone) can now get to 200 alchemy skill provided they have GoD.  That also makes the skill that much more useless if anyone can make a character to make the potions they need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm just disapointed that over 2 years later I *still* have over 3k worth of potions leftover from skilling up on that I haven't been able to sell, and now people are maxing their alchemy for that much.  Not to mention the loss that I'd still be taking if I sold them at cost or at a semi decent price.</div></div><hr />

:rolleyes: :rolleyes: <br />

 hmmm soo i guess also everyone should have to buy all items one at a time (instead of stacks) everyone should have to use boats(instead of pok books or spires) everyone should worry bout all thier items being lost if they hit the combine button  when using a tradeskill container to store stuff .. ect ect ect ..<br />
<br />
  ... <br />
<br />
 besides we all know that  all you  people who  did alchemey the hard way and got yer skill up to 200 already got all your money you invested back right .... cuz of course we all know that alchemey is one of the most profitable  tradeskills there are .. <br />
<br />
/sigh <br />
<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
 GETOVERIT..<br />
<br />
its about time they took a good look at this skill and made it to where it was actually  pheasable  and affordable to  spend the time to do ..<br />
<br />
 seems all the complainers are just jelous ..<br />
<br />
  i'm sorry if you sunk 55+k to master alchemy ..  as we all know someone had a gun to yer head and made you do it ..  ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Right.  And when they make it easy to get to 250 tailoring with storebought components for under 10k, I guess more ppl will be yelling blue murder...<br />
<br />
-Fin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>karamilbarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">actually  tailoring never was a skill that you could get far pureley by buing ingredients fer combine from vendors ..<br />
<br />
<br />
 to make a more accurate annalogy you should have used tinkering or JC..<br />
<br />
both of them are rediculously expensive(well not jc as much as tinkering) and can be basically mastered through means of vendor buying ..<br />
<br />
<br />
 would i care if they made ALL tradeskills able to be mastered for under 10k ..<br />
<br />
<br />
 shure  i'd be as happy as a clam ..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kungloa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">snare III has been hit by the gods of nerf... its now 111 triv</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>unoeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I did alchemy to the 190's the old fashioned way and I managed to sneak to 200 before the nerf bat hit.<br />
<br />
I 'm very sorry to see the trivials changed.  Why couldn't all of the version III's been upped to 227 instead of brought low?  Alchemy is a very unique tradeskill (being class dependent).  It is also a huge cash sink for very little return.  I think it is enough that the potion costs are so out of balance with regard to usefulness.  The ability to finally get skill ups relatively cheaply was a little bright spot in a long and gloomy history.  Thank goodness the Grow potion trivial wasn't nerfed.<br />
<br />
To all those that moaned that others got something easier then they did, hope you're happy.</div></div><hr />
