<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lanedori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why are they making them trivial at 227 if we cannot go beyond 200, can someone explain this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fionna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Setting trivials to higher than 200/250 allows them to fiddle around with the failure rate to put it where they want it... Having everything trivial at 200/250 or below would give high chances of making even the hardest to craft items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grumpf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well, there are recipes for other tradeskills that have a higher trivial then 250 too.<br />
think 200 isnt a hard cap for alchemy btw.<br />
as: you can get to 230 with a 15% mod.<br />
<br />
with 200 alchemy and no mod item equipped i had a failrate of<br />
1/10 for the snare3 potion, not that bad after all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lanedori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have the Grandmasters Bag, have been doing alchemy and doing and doing beyond 200 and have not skilled up in over a month and maybe its been about 10K spent trying.<br />
Ok so now what is wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">200 is the hard cap on alchemy.  You cannot have an actual skill any higher than that.  Your modified skill (with a geerlok or trophy or other skill modifying item equipped) can go over 200 but not your actual, raw, naked skill.</div></div><hr />

Will keep posting as I learn new ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've added these all to the database.  For future reference,  updates should really go in the Database Submissions (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=86) forum. <br />
<br />
Thanks! :barb:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Umbagumba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As the Database says atm: Potion Of Mystical Aptitude trivial at 255...<br />
<br />
Oh man... what is Sony doing to us shamans? <br />
<br />
I think they really need to remove the hardcap on alchemy soon or there will be not many highskilled alchemists in the future... :boggled: I will not belive that this is the aim Sony is pointing to...<br />
<br />
/em goes berserk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Even if they took out the cap we'd only be able to get to 205 skill currently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Why make anything trivial over 252? So youll fail more. Money sink. Pure and sumple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes, as a matter of fact, they make things trivial over 252 so that we fail more. That is the point pure and simple.  The regulation system on manufactured goods prior to your 250 skill was lack of supplies/skill.  Now that crafters can make items of such good use (i.e. jewelry, grandmaster trophies..etc.) the only way to regulate them is to give a systematic failure rate, and it works! Thank you for controlling the economy, without this addition our servers would be overrun with highend tradeskilled goods that we wouldn't be able to sell for even cost.</div></div><hr />
