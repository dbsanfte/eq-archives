<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LinaInverse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...do the &quot;Dark Fungus&quot; and &quot;Underfoot Mushrooms&quot; spawn?  Can someone give me an exact /loc (or at least a general area) of North Kaladim these spawn?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They are ground spawns near a farm close to water. I think its in the north east corner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LinaInverse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">OK, Thanx!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jpathomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Has anyone found the ones that are supposed to be in South Kaladim? I think I've looked everywere, but I did not find them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brodder FoamyMugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">More than likely someone dropped some there just to throw off campers in the farm area. <br />
<br />
 Take the ones they don't need and drop a few in spots that might look like a spawn spot...announce it in chat/ooc  about the time they go public.<br />
<br />
 Then you've thinned out your competition for shrooms in Kaladim, as they have to zone to check for the shrooms there.<br />
<br />
 Occassionally drop the other shrooms you don't need again in same spot, along with the more desired one. Then go back to picking mushrooms in peace.<br />
<br />
 Do this enough times and folks will be absolutely sure that they spawn there.<br />
<br />
 I did something similar in Thurgadin. Where the drunk sleeps I'd drop bottles of brews not many had seen yet (from diaries especially).<br />
 Did it while working on cooking in area (while meats were handy and cheap at butcher/baker shop).<br />
<br />
<br />
 After a week here, there were druids parked near him foraging and watching for the &quot;drunk&quot; to drop some ales that were rare.<br />
<br />
 Funniest spam in Thurgadin- &quot;Who is this Brodder NPC? I've seen his diaries in all the bars, and when he walks near drunks booze appear near them. Should I try to kill him to see what loot he has?&quot;<br />
<br />
  Me-  &quot;LOOT? Did you say Lewts? DIE! &quot; and charged the druid.<br />
 Who in his surprise gated out.<br />
<br />
 Okay I was wearing no player armor at time, just stat jewlery and cloth to help my cooking and some chain pieces that had high charisma. Mug in one hand and Velium hammer in the other I looked alot like a NPC in the Zone and was walking the same path over and over and over for a week. And dropping brews and food all over. I was unguilded at the time and had RP flag on. So my name would have been a different color to the viewers in area.<br />
 I had the &quot;peek&quot; by others turned off and have a macro &quot;Glares at you. What would you like your Tombstone to say&quot;<br />
<br />
 Funnier even was when that same druid came back with 12 friends to kill me.<br />
 A fight prepping for the Dane came out to see this and laughed them into the ground.<br />
<br />
<br />
 so sometimes it's just a joke...and sometimes, fools get fooled because they want to be fooled.<br />
<br />
 So who's to say a Dwarf can't have a chuckle about it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jpathomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That's an interesting tale, but I'm not sure it's the case here. The reason I'm not sure is that this site says they spawn in South Kaladim as well as North. Of course given that no one has found them the site could be wrong.<br />
<br />
Tell me Brodder, do you still play EQ? I'm only asking because there are a lot of folks who are still involved in the online fourms but who don't play any more for one reason or another.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brodder FoamyMugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Brodder is still active.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jpathomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That's good to know, thanks for answering my question. I do have another one. How is it that you came to work with the dev team on creating new brews? If this is covered somewhere else please point me in that direction.<br />
<br />
I'm interested because it seems so few people who play the game every get to contribute to it in a meaningfull way. I know they name things after the people who first figgure out the recipe, but to be allowed to have some input on the creation and effect (dispite the fact that they obviously didn't really listen too closely) is really exceptional.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brodder FoamyMugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Back in the day of whineplay boards- EQ's feedback boards I used to make in character diatribes that for the most part were hilarious.<br />
<br />
 GM's from Bertox loved my guild (all Dwarf RP guild with a couple gnomes at the time) Champions of Brell. <br />
 The guild split to 7th hammer on first split from Bertox then to Terris Thule on second (I went with second split).<br />
<br />
 Meanwhile I was very active in the tradeskill boards posting in character recipe ideas and such.<br />
<br />
 Eventually I came up with the Diaries about my travels about Norrath in the name of the BREW.<br />
<br />
 The boards soon went elsewhere. (cost and high profile bitching publically was removed to preserve illusion that EQ was still good).<br />
<br />
 I started a dialogue with several GM's in game, many came to my events in Butcher Block that me n the Champions of Haggerfel ran for youngsters.<br />
<br />
 The Skunk Wars drew an impressive 12-15 staffers in the guise of newbies from what I am told.<br />
<br />
 Soon I received direct tells from Dan Enright and we worked on clarifying the diaries and organizing them. To honor Catbik Tinkerton my gnome friend and sidekick (we went everywhere and did everything together, some of it deemed impossible by even veteran uber guilds at the time- ie farming castle in Neriak with mage and pet and Brodder dah Cleric o'brell).<br />
<br />
 Eventually I submitted a small library of well thought out, list items, trade skill upgrades, suggested levels, breaking down needed in game current items and inventing a few new ones.<br />
<br />
 I broke down balance and usefullness on some. Others I included in a flow chart multi-tradeskill spanning quest format. :D <br />
 That became &quot;flavor of the release&quot; with Scars of velious.<br />
 Many of my quests were re-adapated.<br />
 More than 90% of my gnomish pirate jokes and quests though were deemed Ummm...too impolitically correct, slightly off color, but funny as hell.<br />
 about that time I got an Online NDA similar to the Beta versions and an email version too. Both were signed.<br />
 We continued to correspond and talk.<br />
<br />
 Sometimes I'd find Brodder in use...(and no never shared my acct info with anyone) for a &quot;event&quot; type thing.<br />
<br />
 Eventually I migrated to playing other games more when guild and expansions no longer provided a vehicle for my ideas.<br />
<br />
 The changes in the top at EQ canceled any chance of an &quot;Outsource&quot; contract for a freelance writer.<br />
<br />
 But I still stand to this day as the First writer ever published inside a a MMORPG. :bookworm: :D - so it's in gnomish.<br />
<br />
 Lot's of other things occured that I can't discuss, and I was privy too. The Lewena's tea thing threw me as only about 30% of what I had figured surviving to this expansion did. And even that changed.<br />
 But you will notice that the Spiced elven tea uses cinamon extract/schnapps in a form sort of.  Though the recipe is much changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brodder FoamyMugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">FYI  BRodder things in game--<br />
<br />
  Priest for youngster's armor quests in Cleric hall last name FOAMYMUGS.<br />
 Brodder's Brewing Diaries.<br />
 Brodder's Revenge.<br />
 Brodder's brewing Bib- someone won this on TT once someone else got Brell's Apron. <br />
 More than a few quests...<br />
<br />
 Think some dialogue in several bars might have him mentioned too. (I know the Irontoes dislike him for bringing back Dwarven ale to Kaladim&lt;--- this is what started me on the path)  Tumpy used to curse the FoamyMugs name when it was mentioned near him or why he didn't have Dwarven ale. (this was before any expansion). <br />
 Brodder received Brell's Battle Mug during this quest set up by Bert's very own Dwarven Head Gm.<br />
 My move to TT made it go POOF...well actually they took it about a month before that because the proc was an unresistable &quot;spin till you hurl&quot; to mimic the mug making all it hit raging drunks. Mobs couldn't do anything while spinning, nor could players...<br />
 When I used it to take down the King in Runnyeye it received an addendum - Brell's Battle Mug with a Gobling face shaped dent in it.  Was an event run by same GM for dwarfs, gnomes and halflings in Runnyeye.<br />
<br />
 I miss MY MUG!!!</div></div><hr />
