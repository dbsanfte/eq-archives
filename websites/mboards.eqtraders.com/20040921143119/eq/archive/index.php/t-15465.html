<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am starting an alt just for smithing. I was debating between an Ogre Warrior since I thought he could max out Strength at 255 easy (I will have a Druid buffing him)......or should I create a Dwarf Cleric and try to get Wisdom to 255 (without buffs).<br />
Is it easier getting Strength items, especially since the Ogre starts high in STR and will have STR buffs from a mid lvl 40ish Druid. Or are the Wisdom items easy enough to get to 255?<br />
***Do any of you have a Tradeskill alt who is maxed at 250 with trophy....yet is only still lvl 1?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Elder Neodoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From Playing a Shaman I have found it much harder to find +wis gear compared to +str gear that isn't rec levels</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, I concur that getting Strength is much easier then Wisdom. Aside from the ease of non level restricting gear, it's also much easier to find a class to buff your Strength as there are so many that can. Any high level shaman or beastlord can easily push your strength over 100+ points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I will go with the Ogre Warrior than as an alt to do Smithing and get STR to 255.<br />
So did anyone ever get to skill 250 + Trophy in a tradeskill and was only at level 1?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lots of folks have.  I've seen many a post of folks uber pushing their tradeskill mules to GM status at level 1, though you will spend a LOT of money to do it.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For some reason I kitted out my monk with a set of WIS gear, and I've been gathering WIS augs to add to it. I can get her to about 235 with KEI ;)<br />
<br />
:boggled: <br />
<br />
Or does STR only help with smithing? I forget... (sorry, I don't want to open up a whole dead horse thing again)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I believe that for Smithing ONLY......you can have INT; WIS; or STR.....you get a choice of these 3 to see which one would be the highest. Am I correct on this?<br />
btw- Am I correct in thinking that the reason STR is allowd for Smithing is because Tanks will have low INT/WIS and are the most in need of Smithing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Str was added for Smithing so Warriors (and others) could achieve reasonable results when skilling up.<br />
<br />
Dex was added for Fletching so Rangers (and others) could achieve reasonable results when skilling up.<br />
<br />
Dex was added for Tailoring so Monks (and others) could achieve reasonable results when skilling up.<br />
<br />
As for Wisdom...  I found it pretty easy to get 255 Wisdom on my High Elf Cleric.  So much so that I regret giving her a base 130 Wisdom now!<br />
<br />
It's gotten to the point that any upgrade I want for +Mana also gives me more (useless at this point) +Wis... and ends up hurting my other stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Myrron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just to clarify, as far as we know, dexterity has no influence on tailoring, just fletching (and poisonmaking?  I forget).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">HoS is a 75 point STR buff.<br />
<br />
Brilliance is a is a 14 int buff (insight is 14 wis).<br />
<br />
Either will stick on a level 1 and if you are paying for components, it's way cheaper than the cost of components.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HoS is a 67 point str buff, it's much better if you can find a shaman that can stack IoS and Str together. That equals a 117 str boost that can land on a level one, much better then even focus for the raw str. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zeralenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Also. you need to think about which you should be working on anyway. Face it ... an ogre warrior needs strength more than wisdom. Twink for strength, then get a strength buff.<br />
<br />
Wis gear is easy to get but not nearly as easy to buff for. You can bridge any gap easily with buffs. (Have the shaman slap a CHA buff on while he's at it to improve your buying and selling)<br />
<br />
...Zera</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Silound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Being a bard I'm a bit biased, but I think a human bard is the best tradeskill class of all. We get songs to augment whatever gear and spells we already have on us, so maxing one of int/str/dex isn't difficult. Hoever, it requires leveling the bard, which I presume you don't want to do.<br />
<br />
In said case I would go searching and see what kind of gear you can gather for twinking before you make a decision. A dwarf will probably be better imho because in the long run you have two stats you can try to get higher based on whichever is easiest to gather gear for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Daikoku Ashikaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I went with Int over STR ehrn I first got into smithing,  now it does not matter.  TS for alts is t just do low level subcombines<br />
<br />
<br />
Dai</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you havent already created your smithing alt, you may want to think about what cultural the race you are creating can do.  This may have quite a bit of impact on your high level skilling.<br />
<br />
Being a Halfling i have never payed much attention to cultural smithing, so I cant offer much advice.<br />
<br />
I am sure there are people here who would be happy to put their views up tho!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If smithing is your only goal, have you considered an Ogre Shaman.  <br />
<br />
High starting Str, <br />
Self buffs (self only rage line adds str and stacks well) <br />
Easy to solo, easy to find groups<br />
Easy to farm with, <br />
Imbue spells for cultural.<br />
<br />
Tough combo to beat.  I play a Vah Shir shaman myself and maxxed str easily without trying long before I could get to 200 wis.  Ogres have a significant advantage in starting str over Vah Shir.</div></div><hr />
