<br />
But now I'm torn.  The Vambraces have already been made by someone, so the prestige is gone.  Plus, I've made myself some Livestone Plate Vambs.<br />
<br />
Sure, the Inferno Plate Vambs would be more mana... but I could make an Inferno Plate BP instead.<br />
<br />
And it doesn't help that I've got the supplies and am only a few combines away from attempting another Livestone Plate BP...  :boggled: <br />
<br />
BTW, anyone looking for Chunks of Windmetal anymore?  I've got 9...</div></div><hr />

Btw at 65 they were like 2.5 blues of aa, and at 66 or 67 (forget which) they were a tick of main per kill which is great exp though they do take a while to drop =( Would take a 1/3 of my mana per kill with buffs on and I have a huge mana pool and regen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks to the fellow wanting 60k for his Metallic Substance, someone was asking 55k for one last night.  They've dropped down to 25k now, but that's still way overpriced IMHO.<br />
<br />
The problem, I think, is that the Chain stuff is so good for so few tempers... I'm afraid someone will buy that one for 25k.  :irked:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tried to make the Inferno Plate Vambraces this morning, and failed the combine.<br />
<br />
It would take me another 4 Metallic Substances to try again...  Don't think it'll happen.  :grumpy:</div></div><hr />
