I would like to just buy what I need and do the combines as quickly as possible to get the skill I need. <br />
<br />
I did read the smithing guide and just wanted to check here for ideas. Thanks!<br />

Otherwise, should be able to buy CE's in bazaar, and possibly metal bits to save yourself all the sub-combines.  Water and Needle Mold available in PoK.<br />
<br />
Otherwise offer some newbie some armor upgrades or plat to make a few backpacks of both CE's (no failure) and Metal Bits (trivial 18) while you play normal.  Come back in an hour or so when their done doing all the tedious work for you, and just sit clicking and destroying the needles until hit 110.<br />

Embroidering Needle<br />
<br />
Smithing Components: celestial essence, metal bits, needle mold, water flask<br />
In: forge, tanaan forge<br />
Yield: 1<br />
Trivial at: 122</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">04-04-2006, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, banded is the way.  Fill a backpack with water, walk into the SE traders building in PoK and stand between Kaleras Darkanvil and the forge.  You won't even have to move and you'll walk out at 110 about 20 minutes later.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tokkyl</div><div class="date">04-06-2006, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah - support the newbie population by making em work for it instead of begging.:rolleyes:   Plus, this also brought down the average price of CE's in bazaar from 10pp to 4pp when some realized they could make plat just by clicking a no fail combine.:D <br />
<br />
And for some reason I just hate banded - maybe it's because my mothballed ranger lived in it for so long I can't stand the sight or smell of it anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Diani</div><div class="date">04-07-2006, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My favorite methode for lvl-ing smithing fast is looking if there are enough embroiding needles and fetid essence on vendors in PoK and buy those to make the troll cultural needle........now if someone could teach some oggre ts dev how to stack needles then this combine would go from ok to super :cool:</div></div><hr />

If money is a concern this may not be the best method.</div></div><hr />
