To each their own...  My friend Gamgan, with 216 skill and the +15% hammer from the Creator failed 8 times in a row on Ykeshas &amp;amp; 5 times in a row on Shields...  Way too expensive, especially since the market is still pretty steady on Xegony for Sickles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The majority of traders on AB have them for between 500 and 1000. There are a few idiots selling at 1500 and over. Maybe I should pass on the ones I got for 350 to guild mates and start looking for the 300 ones. At that price it does make a big difference as to deciding whether to attempt BD cultural for a skill up.</div></div><hr />

I recall way back when, when we were skilling on Fine Steel Plate that everyone shuddered just thinking about skilling on &quot;Old Style&quot; Freeport Cultural past 242. Freeport Cultural is now a common skillup path to 242 for human smiths (though they did, of course, change the trivial levels of Fine Steel).  <br />

The only attempts I've done for skill recently have been with it (actually I was just clearing smithing junk out of the bank).<br />

Given that it would be not great effort to get 4k in an evening, I don't particularily care about the cost of blue diamonds at even 500 each.  Prying an enchanter loose from casting KEI for cash is infinately harder.<br />

Given that at max skill I just went 0 for 6 at Artificer's Ringmail Bracers, I think you'd lose tons of money  :? <br />
If you have that much money to spend why not just do sickles :)</div></div><hr />

I wish BD's were so cheap on Vazaelle.  Thus far I've seen one or two at 1K a pop, and most of them are up around 5 figures...<br />

  If you are honestly saying that BDs are near 10k on your server, then that is almost as much pain as tech support.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Well, maybe not that much.  But at least 10% of the pain of tech support.<br />

<br />
Sickles require a cleric or druid of tunare.<br />
<br />
Given that I see imbued emeralds for 50pp each in bazaar and a sickle takes 3, BD isn't that much more of a money loser, and BD armour sells for way more than sickles.</div></div><hr />

I've found 56 of em of vendors so far.  Of course my skill is only 205 (with geerlok 215? 216?) But if it takes me 20 tries to make one bracer that's okay, sell it for 10k and start all over again.  I'd likely only make 2 out of the ~50 attempts I'd have (assume I'd lose at least 6 possibly more in turning them to tempers) I'd still come out with more money than I put into it and possibly get a couple skillups in there.  <br />
<br />
Of course it would make more sense to skillup on something else and be able to make even more armor at a higher skill, but those BDs are burning a hole in my &quot;pocket&quot; LOL<br />

<br />
For me, it would be more practical to try and skill up on BD Cultural rather than sickles.<br />
<br />
Sickles just don't sell very often on my server anymore.  Plenty of them sitting on merchants in the bazaar.  But I haven't seen a single piece of Ogre BD Cultural for sale ANYWHERE.  Plus, being on Ogre SK (Rallos Zek Worshipper) the only cultural armor available for me is the Ogre BD Cultural.  I'll attempt to smith it, and whatever armor I manage to successfully combine I can either a) sell or b) wear myself.<br />
<br />
I agree it's not the most efficient method of skilling up, nor is it the cheapest.  But for me, after trying various alternate methods to raise my skill, this is my personal road to madness.  It gives me a chance to skill up as well as smith a piece of armor that I would normally not have access to under normal (ie buying from a merchant) circumstances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veril</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm, BD looking like more and more a route, I can buy BD's at 400 each or so.  Sickles require so many combines along the way that it's not fun.  BD cultural seeming a lot better because of the far fewer sub combines needed</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kronepsis</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 03:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BDs on my server are 500...probably my fault since I auction for them at 500 and amass something like...um...enough.  :)  They ARE looking tempting though, considering that it is not only more MANA efficient, skilling up on Artkeepers would be more Morning Dew efficient than anything else!  Just one problem.  VERY little market for it.  Someone on my server is selling Blessed Artkeeper's now and I'm sure not touching it...the only pieces being sold that I even LIKE I already have.  :D  I also don't relish the thought of trying to skill up on Blessed Mithril armor since it chews 2.5 extra Morning Dews an attempt, and the Dew vampires in the Bazaar charge from 50 to 100 plat.  While I CAN buy them out, the fact that they will raise the price more if I do makes me decide that it just isn't a valid option for skilling up except on whim.</div></div><hr />

Each guard drops a fs ss (6pp) and up to 6pp. They are pathetically weak, like 1khp, and on a 6 minute spawn timer. Bad faction with freeport, but its a ghost town on my server at least, so who cares?! Plus you are a sk, be EVIL for a change! :P<br />

I'm always surprised when people claim they cant raise money, so SO many opportunities available for those willing to work a tad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd rather gouge out my eyes than level yet another character.  I already levelled a cleric to 53 to help 'soloing' (I 2 box), working on a shaman because of the sheer ownage of slow versus CH as I level, plus the obligatory enchanter for doing anything tradeskill related.<br />
<br />
I'd just like to be able to practice my tradeskills in peace without facing the choice of levelling a dozen supporting characters or getting severely gouged by the tradeskill bottleneck classes.  And on stormhammer, the only gouging you see is severe.</div></div><hr />

Ok, 4k a night might be a bit much, but not too much so. I probably do in the area of 10k a work week, plus any weekend farming I might do.<br />
<br />
My big money making activity is Kael armour MQs, which drop rarely at the bank, which I can 2 box easily (plus I get exp in a radical change from smithing activities).  Average MQ is 2k, prices run up from there (40k for a tunic/robe/bp if I ever get one to drop).<br />
<br />
I also clear a fair amount of money selling drink and food - having GMs in both of those- as well as dumpster diving (hm, acrylia reinforced wristbands on a vendor for 1gp, let me resell those for 50pp each) and foraging (dire wolf furs - 10pp each, branches of sylvan oak - 25pp each), plus twink turnover (upgraded robe, sell old robe).</div></div><hr />
