<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>crystilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been sitting around for almost 2 weeks of (several times a) nightly checking the bazaar for ... Justice Fruits.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, I just NOW realized they changed the darn name on them.  Not 3 weeks ago I did the first Grimel ear so had the recipe down and hadn't tossed it away yet (so didn't have any reason to look it up again) and never knew that in the last 3 weeks sometime they changed the name of the darn foraged fruit.<br />
<br />
What was the rationale behind changing that again?<br />
<br />
/smacks herself<br />
<br />
4 Planar fruit pies away from Grimel ear #2 ~ the 5HP regen ear (have the final ear and  the 3HP regen one now).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Heartsong_Steelsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Apparently it was a name based on Dexter's lab or something like that and they were, um, asked to please change it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Serenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don’t feel bad, I never saw any notice of the name change either, I don’t think it was widely publicized.  Someone on the message board made a side reference to “Justice, I mean Planar, Fruits” a few days ago, and that was the first indication I had that they had changed.  I had wondered why the Pies had dropped off the bazaar list :o  Sure enough, I checked my forager and she had still had a couple Planar Fruits on her from her last run to Justice /laugh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">HAHAHA, I was in PoK and found one of these fruit on the ground that someone had dropped...why they imported them from PoJ to do this is beyond me. But I was so proud of this new found item, I linked all over the world and back, and no one had a clue what it was...<br />
<br />
I am so dissapointed, I thought I had something important =/<br />
<br />
As a side note, if you are using the new UI (who am I kidding, you all are =(, including me, wish I could make it go away...I want bloodied finger stumps for everyone from brewing again!!!) the Justice Fruit Pie still shows up as the recipe in the search after you make one, yet yields Planar Fruit Pies.  So, if you are having trouble finding it to add to your Favorites list, this is why =)</div></div><hr />
