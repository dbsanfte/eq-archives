----------------------<br />
<br />
Headlines!<br />
<br />
- A new storybook has arrived! Make sure you read it to find out what Tondal is up to now.<br />
- A new adventure zone is live on Stormhammer!<br />
- A new adventure zone has moved from Stormhammer to Live!<br />
- What are the &quot;HOT SPOTS&quot;?<br />
- Plane of Knowledge open to everyone!<br />
<br />
<br />
New Adventure Zone goes to Stormhammer<br />
-----------------------<br />
- We have added a new adventure zone which should be a challenge for 2 groups of about 50th level.<br />
A party of adventurers is missing and was last seen working with the undead. Will you brave the catacombs to find them?<br />
<br />
<br />
New Adventure Zone moves to Live<br />
-----------------------<br />
- The adventure zone currently on Stormhammer will move to live servers. You can visit the Lost Pyramid of Galuuk Korr. This midlevel adventure zone will allow you to explore a monument from the lost elvish city of Takish Hiz! Now you must find what was left beneath the sands. Good luck.<br />
<br />
Hot Spots<br />
-----------------------<br />
Try out the new Hot Spot zones which give a boost to Experience while adventuring in them, in a similar manner to Paludal Caverns. The current Hot Spots are:<br />
<br />
- The Castle of Mistmoore (20th to 30th level)<br />
- The Lair of the Splitpaw (35th to 45th level)<br />
- Dulak's Harbor (40th to 45th level)<br />
- The Tower of Frozen Shadow (30th to 35th level)<br />
- The Gulf of Gunthak (35th to 40th level)<br />
- Hate's Fury (55th to 60th level)<br />
- The Crypt of Nadox (50th to 55th level)<br />
- The Torgiran Mines (45th to 50th level)<br />
<br />
These Hot Spot zones are generally aimed at characters level 20 to 51. The Hot Spot zones will shift from time to time, so watch for messages giving clues as to where the new ones may be.<br />
<br />
<br />
Plane of Knowledge<br />
-----------------------<br />
All EQ characters can now access the Plane of Knowledge whether they have purchased Planes of Power or not!<br />
<br />
General<br />
-----------------------<br />
- We have decreased load times when zoning.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gates Sewers and Vxed<br />
-----------------------<br />
- Rare NPCs in the Gates sewers and Vxed will not spawn at the creation of the expedition zone. They will now spawn after the zone has been occupied for some time. <br />
<br />
Um...well, the PoK being open to all is nice for any tradeskillers who haven't bought PoP yet (all three of you! ;) ) but, um...<br />
<br />
<br />
/lfg in Nadox/Hate's Fury.  :cool:</div></div><hr />

- Skill percent-mods now work for Ammo slot items.<br />

You will be able to swap the items back and forth with Garath for your desired look. (Lungi? Lungi?  What is a Lungi?)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zephaus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm... I expected a little more exciting patch on CoH launchday   ;) <br />
<br />
 :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They took away the ability to repeatedly spawn expeditions, hoping to find a named.   I had never tried this, but it seemed efficient.  I know a few people who will be upset.<br />
<br />
<br />
They opened PoK to EVERYONE?  That's.... Odd...<br />
<br />
Aug Slots on the Oracle Chest Slots.  Woot!<br />
<br />
And they added &quot;hot spots&quot; to the LoY zones.  Wonder if people are going to come to Nadox and start griefing me now. :-/<br />

Actually, my patch message got cut off in the middle...mind you, I was patching fairly early in the downtime. Thanks for posting the rest of it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>hamilia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">has anyone found the new adventure zone on regular servers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xodar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As I understand it the new adventure zone is one of the instanced Takish missions now, with a chance of getting it when you obtain a NRo adventure.<br />
<br />
I also understand the zone is capped at level 50, so if you are above that level you will not get that instanced dungeon whatsoever.  I am not sure if that apllies to your average group level, or if 1 person 50+ would preclude that instance.</div></div><hr />
