<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gezmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I figured someone should post something to the boards here as we haven't had a single new post for our server since we moved message boards. Does this indicate there just aren't that many tradeskillers on Mith Marr? Considering that there is a guild dedicated to TS's I can't believe that. Maybe we're just not a very communicative group? C'mon people, let's get some activity going here.<br />
