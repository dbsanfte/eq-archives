   <br />
Look what happens when a President gets elected in a <br />
year with a &quot;0&quot; at the end <br />
   <br />
1840: William Henry Harrison (died in office) <br />
1860: Abraham Lincoln (assassinated) <br />
1880: James A. Garfield (assassinated) <br />
1900: William McKinley (assassinated) <br />
1920: Warren G. Harding (died in office) <br />
1940: Franklin D. Roosevelt (died in office) <br />
1960: John F. Kennedy (assassinated) <br />
1980: Ronald Reagan (survived assassination attempt) <br />
2000: George W. Bush ???????????? <br />
   <br />
And to think that we had two guys fighting it out in <br />
the courts to be the one elected in 2000. <br />
You might also be interested in this. <br />
Have a history teacher explain this if they can. <br />
   <br />
Abraham Lincoln was elected to Congress in 1846. <br />
John F. Kennedy was elected to Congress in 1946. <br />
   <br />
Abraham Lincoln was elected President in 1860. <br />
John F. Kennedy was elected President in 1960. <br />
   <br />
Both were particularly concerned with civil rights. <br />
Both wives lost a child while living in the White House. <br />
   <br />
Both Presidents were shot on a Friday. <br />
Both Presidents were shot in the head. <br />
 <br />
Now it gets really weird. <br />
   <br />
Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy. <br />
Kennedy's Secretary was named Lincoln. <br />
Both were assassinated by Southerners. <br />
Both were succeeded by Southerners named Johnson. <br />
   <br />
Andrew Johnson, who succeeded Lincoln, was born in 1808. <br />
Lyndon Johnson, who succeeded Kennedy, was born in 1908. <br />
  <br />
John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated Lincoln, was born in 1839. <br />
Lee Harvey Oswald, who assassinated Kennedy, was born in 1939. <br />
   <br />
Both assassins were known by their three names. <br />
Both names are composed of fifteen letters. <br />
   <br />
Now hang on to your seat. <br />
   <br />
Lincoln was shot at the theater named &quot;Ford.&quot; <br />
Kennedy was shot in a car called &quot;Lincoln&quot; made by &quot;Ford.&quot; <br />
Booth and Oswald were assassinated before their trials. <br />
   <br />
And here's the &quot;kicker&quot;: <br />
   <br />
A week before Lincoln was shot, he was in Monroe, Maryland. <br />
A week before Kennedy was shot, he was with Marilyn Monroe. <br />
   <br />
Lincoln was shot in a theater and the assassin ran to a warehouse; <br />
Kennedy was shot from a warehouse and the assassin ran to a theater. <br />
<br />
Creepy, huh?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've seen that list before, but it must have been child-friendly-ified, because that's a new addition to me. <br />
<br />
It is quite amusing to think about things like that, tho, the whole list of similaries. Sometimes life is just as strange or stranger than fiction. <br />

Ugh... presidents... politics... this came up at dinner last night... I'll worry about it later....</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Media actually uses all three named of murderers to help allieviate confusion in the masses of people with similar names.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Example:<br />
<br />
Altho not a murderer there were 2 known people names Monica Lewinski. One was err umm &quot;with&quot; the president the other (more attractive one) lived in New York and was NOT involved in the scandel. She did however receive many phone calls ;) A middle name may have helped to relieve some confusion.</div></div><hr />

I've heard a bit of theory on that:  When you were younger, and were doing something you really shouldn't be, and got yelled at, how did your dad or (especially) your mom address you?  &quot;John Baker Doe!  Stop that right now!&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Funny I always got LEIGHANN BARNEY CODY ANGIE.....JOE YEAH THATS YOU GET IN HERE NOW!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cantatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Snopes.com discredits a lot of these:<br />
<br />
&quot;Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy.<br />
Kennedy's Secretary was named Lincoln. &quot;<br />
<br />
Lincoln did not have a secretary named Kennedy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Both were assassinated by Southerners. &quot;<br />
<br />
John Wilkes Booth was born in Maryland.<br />
<br />
&quot;John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated Lincoln, was born in 1839.<br />
Lee Harvey Oswald, who assassinated Kennedy, was born in 1939. &quot;<br />
<br />
John Wilkes Booth was born in 1838.<br />
<br />
Lincoln was shot in a theater and the assassin ran to a warehouse;<br />
Kennedy was shot from a warehouse and the assassin ran to a theater<br />
<br />
John Wilkes Booth was actually found (and killed) in a barn.<br />
<br />
A week before Lincoln was shot, he was in Monroe, Maryland.<br />
A week before Kennedy was shot, he was with Marilyn Monroe.<br />
<br />
Marilyn Monroe died August 6, 1962.  Kennedy was killed on November 22, 1963.  There's more than a year gap between the two.<br />
<br />
You can read the rest here (http://www.snopes.com/history/american/linckenn.htm) which just sort of points out the trivialty behind a lot of the coincidents.  I just posted the ones that they said were incorrect (and found the actual death dates.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cantatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1840: William Henry Harrison (died in office)<br />
1860: Abraham Lincoln (assassinated)<br />
1880: James A. Garfield (assassinated)<br />
1900: William McKinley (assassinated)<br />
1920: Warren G. Harding (died in office)<br />
1940: Franklin D. Roosevelt (died in office)<br />
1960: John F. Kennedy (assassinated)<br />
1980: Ronald Reagan (survived assassination attempt)<br />
<br />
<br />
Just wanted to add that this one is confirmed (http://www.snopes.com/history/american/curse.htm) as being true from Snopes.<br />
<br />
If you look at the facts though, it's stretches a little.  I always interpretted this to mean that they were elected for the first time in the years divisable by 20, but that is not so.<br />
<br />
William McKinley was elected for the first time in 1896, but then re-elected in 1900.  Franklin Roosevelt was first elected in 1932 and reelected in 1936, 1940 and 1944.<br />
<br />
Also, this also fails to point out that two presidents didn't die in the year divisable by 20, but in their second term.  Lincoln was elected in 1860 and again in 1864 and died in 1865.  Roosevelt died during his 4th term which started in 1944.<br />
<br />
So:<br />
<br />
1840: William Henry Harrison - Elected in 1840, died in that term.<br />
1860: Abraham Lincoln - Originally elected in 1860, didn't die until his second term in 1864.<br />
1880: James A. Garfield - Elected in 1880, died in that term.<br />
1900: William McKinley - Originally elected in 1896, didn't died until his second term in 1900.<br />
1920: Warren G. Harding - Elected in 1920, died in that term.<br />
1940: Franklin D. Roosevelt - Originally elected in 1932, didn't die until his 4th term in 1944.<br />
1960: John F. Kennedy - Elected in 1960, died in that term.<br />
1980: Ronald Reagan - Elected in 1980, assassination attempt took place in that term.<br />
<br />
My thoughts are that Reagan was saved only because of our technology.  Had he been president in even 1960, he likely would've died.  Contrastly, the other presidents might not have died had they had the technology back then.<br />
<br />
However, if this &quot;curse&quot; is actually true, from reading the facts Bush won't have broken the curse until he is out of office - either in 2005 or 2009.<br />
<br />
Snopes does confirm it's true, but after reading the facts, it just seems like the facts were streched to fit the curse.  When you consider that one president is either elected or re-elected in a year divisible by 20 every 5 terms, it isn't that huge of a coincidence that these presidents who died in office were in office in a year that was divisable by 20.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Melinia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Kind of a personal note:<br />
Recently, I have been doing my Family History. I came acrossed an interesting story regarding my Great-Grandfather. Apparently during the turn of the century he was working as a roofer. He happened to be working on a roof in Buffalo when Pres. McKinley was assassinated... According to the story I read he was one of the witnesses of the assassination. <br />
<br />
Digging up ones roots can get mighty interesting!<br />
:shocked:</div></div><hr />
