The Foucs Effects help a lot so I got a few; Spell Haste 2, Affliction Haste 2, Mana Pres 2, Affliction Effic 2 and a few others. It's great, I cast faster, harder, longer, all for less mana. With KEI/Ageo and Canb I'm at 100% mana almost 24/7.<br />
What's the problem you say? Everytime I cast a spell now I get spamed with 3-5 focus effect messages;<br />
<br />
You're Runed-Mithril Tunic shimmers (Spell haste 2)<br />
You're Chipped Bone Bracer shimmers (Affliction effic 2)<br />
You're Kobalt-Hide Boots shimmer (Extended Affliction 2)<br />
<br />
That's just to name a few, then cast a heal, and a buff or two, good gods! I'm sorry for all the Uber WIS/INT casters who have every slot full with a focus!</div></div><hr />

I envy you your spam ;)<br />
<br />
Just dinged 49 a week ago, and no more spam on my nukes.   Only get the extended range thing on my sole II item.   Heck, I even replaced my Mana pres. II BAM a while back for other goodies.<br />
<br />
I need ID 3, Extended range 3, mana pres 3, spell haste 3, and I'll be happy for a few months ;)<br />
<br />
When I got the spam in my 20's, when I had stuff that worked on the spells I was casting, I loved it :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know what Druids get exactly at 49... but for a wizard, it is quickly showing me what class I chose.<br />
<br />
Before 49, best nuke = 622 fire based<br />
<br />
At 49, best nuke = 1110 Cold based <br />
<br />
Also got 768 damage magic based.<br />
<br />
So basically I can now put out well over 50% more damage, and can choose magic or cold and still do significantly better damage than before ;)<br />
<br />
The new spells also have a better ratio and Ice comet just looks awesome.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the Ooohs and Ahhhs killing Giant skeletons with 1 nuke... go away, you bother me ;).<br />
<br />
2 ice comets and a finishing little nuke now = dead HG... with ID 3 I think the 2 comets would do it... here is to saving up 20k for a Jungle cap at lvl 51.<br />
<br />
/em does a happy derailing dance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilosh</div><div class="date">03-19-2003, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">49 is an AWESOME level for druids.<br />
<br />
<br />
At 34 we get Lightning Strike, our first quad spell, that does 188? 200? Damage?<br />
<br />
At 49 , we get Lightning Blast, that does 477 damage.<br />
At 49 , we get Skin Like Nature.  :-)  We also get group versions of Cholorplast, and Form of the Great Wolf.<br />
We get 3 Nukes.  Fire, Ice, and Starfire.   Moonfire is an awesome 650 point nuke. Fire and Ice also lower the opposite saves. :-)<br />
We also get the 24 point DS that 99% of druids use for PLing people.<br />
We also get Endure Magic, a 40 point MR Buff.<br />
And we get a new root that does 150 damage. :-)<br />
<br />
I may be forgetting other spells, but those are the big ones.<br />
<br />
4 casts of my new quad spell, and a quad of spirocs is almost dead.   Maybe 4% health left.  Usually one of the four will be dead already/<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lonewylfe</div><div class="date">03-19-2003, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only spell you forgot (that I can find) is succor:north<br />
<br />
Maybe at 49 I'll finally learn to quad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delfontes</div><div class="date">03-19-2003, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That reminds me, I also got Supernova...<br />
<br />
Insteresting story that one, I had a few runes from ME, and knew they had to be for lvl 49 spells (before loy)<br />
<br />
I combined them randomly (with 4 runes or so there aren't that many combinations).  I made Supernova, and failed on another spell I never looked up, hehe.  With a research skill of 42 ;).<br />
<br />
I think their trivial is in the 150's, so it was pure luck, just had extra runes and was going for a skill-up chance.<br />
<br />
Supernova is a Point blank AE that does 856 damage. I want to learn to quad kite, and it turns out I needed a staff of temperate flux, or everyone says you do.  <br />
<br />
So I go to permafrost with a friend, we are the only 2 in the zone, so we go where the wizards spawn, and he pulls Everything.  1 cast, 20,000 damage...<br />
<br />
That was sooo awesome, really felt cool killing 30+ goblins in 1 blow.  Took so long to loot them that he had another train ready for me before I was done.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, 20 minutes and 200 ice goblins later I had all backpacks full of FS, unrefined ore enough to do the restocking quest twice, lots of spare change, and I got my heart ;)<br />
<br />
Also got a few more x-locs and stuff like that, but it isn't quite as exciting as this was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilosh</div><div class="date">03-19-2003, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, you have a Nice PBAOE!<br />
<br />
<br />
Druids get Upheaval at 51, which does between 648 damage, and increases by 10 points per level, until it caps at 718 damage at level 58 or so.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Accepting the fact that he got involved in a hijacking,<br />
