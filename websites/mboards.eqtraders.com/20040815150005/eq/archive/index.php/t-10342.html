<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Idara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I use Frostwolf's EQ Tradeskill Companion which has been wonderful for me, but I found a small error. The recipe for distilled mana on the companion says that it requires 2 opals, when actually it requires 2 sapphires. Although I managed to only lose about 500 plat on sell backs, it still hurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I truly love Frostwolf's guide (UI enhancement, actually, but that's just being picky).  Unfortunately, he last updated it nine months ago, and as you noticed, there are a couple of errors in it.  Also, all the recent discoveries (new recipes from LoY on, updated trivials, etc.) are not reflected in it. <br />
<br />
Despite all this, it's still a really nice enhancement that gives you a one-glance look at many recipes.<br />
<br />
I sent Frostwolf an email at one point asking if he planned on updating it, but I never got a reply.  His boards are also effectively closed, as there is no forum open to the public for posting.<br />
<br />
For the curious:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Finae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Anyone know if there is way to get this to work since the august patch, i try to load and get messed up ui, before that it worked :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anything that used alternate windows (Journal or Story) could be pretty munched.  Those windows have had to change significantly. <br />
<br />
For most UI needs, you can see www.eqinterface.com for mods and help with making/fixing mods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Idara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have my recipes and vendors loaded into the /bug and /feedback windows, and I haven't had any problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Finae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I tried to run it in /gems and /help windows and it would mess my UI up, did /feedback and /bug and it works woot thanks for the help. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Odd.  I have the windows running in my Pet (hey, I'm a paladin!), Help, and Gems windows without a problem.  Leaves my Bug and Feedback windows free for their original purpose.<br />
<br />
Don't know what to tell you. =/<br />
<br />
Then again, I basically use the default UI with a few minor mods for some windows; and I haven't changed the UI in several months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Finae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well seems i am getting error code in Ui now for /bug window grr, wish they would leave things alone on UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kathara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am thinking of reviving Frostwolf's mod.  If you read the credits, he orginally got the idea from me and got the code from someone that changed my orginal mod.(not that I am in any way trying to take credit for his wonderful work. Heck I still use his mod most of the time heh)  Well the last 2 days or so, Ive been messing around with copy/paste and the code that Frostwolf put out and I think I could do an updated version of it without too much trouble. It won't look exactly the same, but similar and it will be up to date.  My question to you guys is...<br />
<br />
Would anyone want it?<br />
<br />
PS. If Frostwolf still reads these boards, please send me a PM if you would rather not have me doing this or you wish to speak to me.  I have no intention of stealing your hard work, but I would like to help the community if its something they want. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Finae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I sure would love this thing, way better than having to search web for info lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If memory serves, all the actual information is stored as a JPG file that is simply displayed in the window of your choice.  The other files simply make EQ display that JPG in a particular window.  Assuming that only the raw data is incorrect (that is, if the mod itself works on a technical level), then you should be able to update the data just by making a new JPG file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kathara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Firstly, the image files are in .png format and not in .jpg(file sizes are smaller for .png therefore less load time and memory use).  <br />
<br />
In essance you are correct, I will have to change the code for some pages because since the last update was done there has been many more added recipies.  I worked out the baking tab yesterday and had to add code to show all the recipies(they now take up 4 image files as opposed to 3). <br />
<br />
I also have my own way of doing things so the image files will not look the same as Frostwolf's image files.  Now that I have figured out the way to present the image files in much the same manner as Frostwolf(instead of my text only version that came out a long time ago) it would not take a huge amount of time to update all the tabs but we are still talking several days of work.  <br />
<br />
Thus the only reason I have posted this up here.  I wanted to see what the interest level was. If everyone was happy with the current storyline/other mods that there was, no need for me to commit the time to work on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Idara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would VERY much love to see an updated version. As it is right now, I've gone back to using the default UI and just windowing out of EQ if I need to look something up, but I hate having to do that, especiallly when I'm running somewhere or in the middle of a fight, and just need to look at one quick thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ditto here.  It's far more convenient to have all the info directly in EQ, and I've found the story window to be awkward to use.  I much prefer this static chart, nicely laid out, with many recipes visible at a glance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aethia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">OH yes please!!! I would LOVE to use an updated version of his work.  I still use mine (in the gems window), and while I have the mods in the storyline window, I mostly use the research one.  <br />
<br />
I usually know what I am making and find it often times easier to go to a tab and search down (since I have been using it a LONG time).  That or looking up how to make a recipe for an apprentice tradeskiller (I've had some really interesting requests for recipes).<br />
<br />
Just a side note on the storyline - just wish there was a way to 'clean' it up and at least have all the tradeskill mods together - those stories make it less easier for me to use as a TS mod.<br />
<br />
Just my two cents but 110% support for this project.</div></div><hr />
