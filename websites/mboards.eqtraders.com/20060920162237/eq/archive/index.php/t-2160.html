<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ixiola</div><div class="date">01-13-2003, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can confirm that these started dropping in Chardok after the patch.  They unfortunately don't stack.  Was hoping they were for a new tailoring recipe.</div></div><hr />

They're not commonly seen outside of Chardok, because people usually don't bother to loot them.<br />
<br />
They still have no known use, as far as I've ever heard (they would have found one by now, if there was one, I'm sure...)<br />
<br />
Just one of the many items in the game that have no use other than to sell to NPC merchants for cash, quite likely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
my thought is that the recipe, if any, will be forthcoming. maybe from hail text from an NPC in the zone where they drop?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Itzena</div><div class="date">04-20-2003, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the theory was, last time this topic came around, is that the chokidai hides were simply a vendor loot items which was added to replace the old item looted from them - which was a FS longsword.<br />
<br />
They have identical weight, resale value to vendor, and so on...it's just slightly more logical for a chokidai to drop a hide rather than a sword. :)</div></div><hr />
