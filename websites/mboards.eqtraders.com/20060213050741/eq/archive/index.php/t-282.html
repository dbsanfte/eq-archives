<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angelsyn</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm semi-seriously looking for the following items:<br />
<br />
Glittering Ring of Judgement: AC 10, WIS 20, HP 50, all/all, wt 0.2, tiny, recommended level 60, required level 46<br />
<br />
Valorium Ring of Gallantry: AC 5, STR 8, STA 8, DEX 8, AGI 8, HP 65, mana 40, sv fire 5, sv cold 5, wt 0.4, tiny, all/all, magic (no recommended/required level)<br />
<br />
I realize that these are extremely nice items and that most Jewelers probably have back-orders on these items from Guildmates &amp;amp; Friends... as well as total strangers.  :D <br />
<br />
Since I don't expect the Ring of Gallantry to continue lacking the recommended/required levels, I'm only seeking one of each of these at this time.<br />
<br />
To help facilitate my request, I will be &quot;enchanting&quot; a couple bars of Valorium.  I am also seeking a few White Diamonds of Justice (if you can Imbue Justice, please contact me) and a few Yellow Diamonds of Valor (if you can Imbue Valor, please contact me).<br />
<br />
If you make or know someone who makes these items, please let me know.  I'm also looking to find out the approximate cost I can expect to pay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oznoyng</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a 250 skill jeweler with Jewel Craft Mastery I.  Yes, I actually bought a level of that pre-PoP.  I would be happy to combine those for you, but the hard part on them is getting the parts.  <br />
<br />
On the Valorium Ring of Gallantry, valorium bars are VERY common, the razorfiend claws are uncommon, and metallic liquids are insanely rare.  Good luck on getting metallic liquids.  If you want one of these, you need to go get a group and hunt down some metallic liquids.  I killed about a half dozen Animated Soldiers in PoV and gotten ZERO drops.  I have killed numerous armor guys in HoH and have gotten ZERO drops as well.  If you manage to get any, I'll make the ring for you and pay pretty handsomely for any extras you manage to get.<br />
<br />
On the Glittering Ring of Judgement, I am not so familiar with the drops.  You need a raw diamond, an alkaline etched stone, a glittering ring, and  2 crystallized cloudy eyes.  If you can get those, I will be happy to attempt a combine for you.  If you manage to get any extras, I'll pay pretty handsomely them too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who knows, maybe I'll get these Rings one day!<br />
<br />
As for collecting the parts myself...  Heh, I'm only level 51 and don't have the time required to do the long raids it seems are needed to get anywhere in PoP.  :cry:</div></div><hr />

It seems VI has moved or spread the drops on this to another mob.  My husband got three last night while hunting in PoV with some guildies.  They were off the crystalline golems I believe he said.<br />
