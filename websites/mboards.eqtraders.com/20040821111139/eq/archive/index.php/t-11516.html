<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Domono</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greets all, just wanted to ask a few fletch related questions:<br />
<br />
Ok, I am a lvl 51 de sk fletching skill is at 139, I can make all sorts of 150 range arrows, I make up a ton, go to bazaar to sell and no one buys them, they seem to be buying the 50 to 75 range arrows. I have set my prices to the exact same os other trader selling them, so in fact im loosing money, still dont sell any, people keep buying arrows that are 50 to 75 range, I cant even give them away.<br />
<br />
Have you all had this problem or is it because im a DE Sk?<br />
<br />
I have decided that today was make or break day, if I can't shift any stock, I'm done with the trade.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that a range 150 arrow for the same price as a 50 to 75 arrow would go like mad. <br />
<br />
What am I doing wrong?<br />
<br />
<br />
Domono...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">people are using a 250 range bow and then who really cares?  its farther away than all but bolt spells with er at 300 range, 250+50. if they are suing it to pull they dont really need the extra range often or they will aggro something else bringing the mob back in tight places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When I make the easy 1 damage 150s, and I price them at 5gp (versus the silver it costs to make), they sell so fast I cannot keep them in stock.  I would do this more except the profit, while huge from a percentage point of view, is small on a per-click basis, and my click time is increasingly valuable to me.<br />
<br />
This is on E`ci, btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My opinion, for whatever it's worth, is that people who need arrows either 1) have the fletching skill themselves, 2) have the click bracer or 3) are rangers and have endless quiver.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what if any money can be made on fletching by selling in the bazaar. Maybe when the Tunare bows came out, yes...but even now, the current price in the bazaar is hardly worth making a bunch to sell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Domono</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, last night in game I got berrated for &quot;trying&quot; to sell any arrows. Someone in ooc said there not even worth a copper piece per, sell them to vendors as trash, and do more skilling up.<br />
<br />
So, all in all, I am trying to decide if its worth it to stay doing it or dump it cold and give up on all trades. I fugured, and this is just logic dictating here, but people need arrows that don't have a clicky, or an endless quiver, so therefore those people must need arrows.<br />
<br />
How wrong I was, they either just buy the crap from a vendor, or spend up to 6pp per arrow for a slight increase in damage.<br />
<br />
Not sure how tradeskillers do it and make a profit, but my 2k spendature in fletching was a total waste of time and pp.<br />
<br />
EQ and tradeskills mix like oil and water.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Malodium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You make money in fletching by making and selling bows, not arrows.<br />
<br />
Some of the high level bows go for 50k+<br />
<br />
Course you either need elemental access, have a friend who does, or have some cash to invest in buying the stuff for it.<br />
<br />
However even some of the lower level planes have some tsuff for nice bows, like the nightmare bow.  Still sells for 2-3k on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">saw someone selling arrows last night in pok hawking wares.  200pp donated for all she had made so far and a name to send tells to whenever she had extra cause he hated clicking.  just the standard weak with range arrows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">E`ci must be totally different.  Raiders (non-rangers) come to me for pulling arrows all the time.  They want max range, minimum damage.  They want hundreds.  They might be good fletchers, but they don't want to waste the time, so they throw 10pp a stack at me, when it costs me 1p to make them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: I need to add, I never spam these.  I just put them on my trader and go to bed or go to work.  In those two chunks of time, people buy them and sent me /tells asking for more.  But it's a specialized audience, and they want 100+ at a time, they will not run around grabbing one here and two there.  Volume and convenience are what they want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oh Domono, I'm so sorry you feel that way about tradeskills. True, it isn't for everyone, but people shouldn't be bagging on you for trying. =P<br />
