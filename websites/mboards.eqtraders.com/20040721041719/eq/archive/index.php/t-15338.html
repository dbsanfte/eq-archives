<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chaoticevil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone let me introduce myself, I am Chaoticevil. I am a level 65 Erudite necromancer on the E Marr server. I wanted to post on a severe loss not only to gamers but to the people she has touched. This is how I am to know it to happen:<br />
<br />
    John ( who plays the toon Sasfai on E Marr server ) and Jenn ( his wife who plays Aeonn on the same sever ) were watching a movie Saturday night and she had a heart attack and passed away in John's arms at the early age of 30. She will be missed and our prayers go out to her.<br />
<br />
    Jenn was always nice to everyone from the lowest level person to a 65th level person. She would stop whatever she was doing at the drop of a hat to help anyone in need. She was a great guildmate and person wether it be in real life or in game. She was always full of good natured conversation and banter.<br />
<br />
    We on E Marr have set aside time and plat to make dyes to show our appreciation for her life, the sorrow of her sudden death, and hole left in our hearts from her passing. We are asking that all people that would like to show their respect to please dye their hands and gloves red as it was her favorite color. VoE has also set up a section to send your condolences, prayers, and a donation page to help John with the cost of passing of Jenn. Also if you would like an address to send gifts or cards you can also email Jexibella on the same page. Thie link is below:<br />
