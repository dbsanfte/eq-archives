<br />
After 4 weeks of no sales, I'm going to go ahead and bomb out the Dwarven BD market at stupidly low levels. I have around 30 pieces of BD cultural in stock that I cannot sell. <br />
<br />
I'm not going to be making any more armor, I just want to sell my current inventory. I'll probably only make armor by requests through word of mouth or if I happen to have a need for more plat.<br />
<br />
It just seems clear to me that problem with all cultural execpt for the Rallos Zek which has massive Hit points, is that the cost of the armor makes it so that a) People that would want to use it can't afford it b) the people that can afford it don't need it and c) too expensive for the people that would want to twink with it.<br />
<br />
Hopefully I'll be able to price low enough so a) and c) will buy what I have in stock and just get out of the bussiness. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyrdlan</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know there are some peices I still want but I just haven't been willing to pay the prices they are &quot;worth&quot;.  <br />
<br />
What prices are you looking at charging?  I've been collecting components to have a 220 friend try them, but if you can do cheaper than that I'll be happy to shop with you.<br />
<br />
What is best price on one bracer, one leggings, one breastplate, and one shoulder ( I think, with magelo down /pout).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimdar</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm going to be pricing like this initially:<br />
<br />
6k for 1 sheet<br />
9k for 2 sheet<br />
15k for 3 sheet<br />
<br />
You'd be looking at 45k for those 4 pieces. I won't be lowering my prices until friday night sometime. So look for the armor you want then.<br />
<br />
If the 3 sheet items aren't low enough, let me know what you'd be willing to pay for them. Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ilona</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those prices are about what I've seen the Blessed Mithril sell for recently.<br />
The Tunarean Soldier/Scout armour goes for less, unfortunately for me :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyrdlan</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I sent you a private message Grimdar, at least I think I did.  It didn't show up in my &quot;sent&quot; but I haven't played with the PMs here before so I'm not sure if that's normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimdar</div><div class="date">12-19-2002, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just responded... when you send PM's with this PHP board, they first goto you're &quot;Outbox&quot;. Then after they actually get sent, they show up in the 'Sent Box&quot;. I got the same PM twice from ya.  :)</div></div><hr />
