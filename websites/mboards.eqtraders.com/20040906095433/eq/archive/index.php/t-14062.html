<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>IrrikEndil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, so I'm on the Mac server, meaning we are basically frozen in time right after PoP was released.  My skill in smithing is currently at 150 something (just finished making ornate gold tunic) and I'm starting to worry about windstones...  The reason I took up smithing is because there are very few smiths on this server, so basically all good crafted armor is very very expensive (like 900+ plat for acrylia chain bracer, and my goal is full suit of acrylia chain (except for the stuff I have that is better of course) so I decided to make my own.  Well I spent around 4 hours hunting air and earth elementals in twilight sea and I got 11 essences of wind and some nice items, but no windstones...  Now windstones rarely appear in the Bazaar here, and when they do they are around 200-300 plat.  My only source of plat so far is aqua goblins (they aren't nerfed on this server) and that makes about 2 hours of farming them per piece of armor...  My question is, once I get to 188 (I got like 200 leather paddings in the bank though I suspect I'll need more) will it be better for me to farm money to get the windstones or to farm them from the mobs that drop them?  I suspect I could get to level 35 with my current equipment, but thats really pushing it, my equipment is extremely bad and there is very little good stuff in the Bazaar...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I haven't watched Acrylia chain/plate markets for quite some time, but classically it was the windstones that were the bottleneck.<br />
<br />
I farmed elemental island from ~25-31 on my mage, and only walked away with a handful of windstones.<br />
<br />
I believe some of the aliens can drop them (dunno which type) and the grimlings in the two &quot;caves&quot; in Tenebrous can, although very rarely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Silound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What class would help first off. Obviously you're either a Shaman, Rogue, or Ranger (or zerker if they're chain, not sure yet) so depending on which you are as to how easy you can farm them. I'd personally avoid even farming them, cash is probably faster, even at a very slow rate. Most spots where windstones can drop at any reasonable rate are upper 30's to top level zones. I found the best spot is killing wandering aliens in TM, they drop about one in 30, plus other tradeskill things and sellable gems. If you want windstones before that, I'd start saving your money :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>IrrikEndil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm an Iksar Shadow Knight...  So a lot of low-mid level plate I can't use.  Which is why I'm getting Acrylia Chain.<br />
<br />
So is there any better place to farm money than the aqua goblin camps?</div></div><hr />

You can also camp the green goblins elsewhere in bbm. The green goblin blood, and their heads, etc sell for 4pp+.<br />
<br />
Also, at 31, you should be able to solo the crazed goblins, which drop fine steel daggers, and ringmail, plus up to 4pp each (also in bbm), plus a piece  for ghoulbane, which you'll need if you are crazy enough to tackle the SK epic.<br />
<br />
Have you looked into the Gothic Steel armor? It's Iksar wearable, and the gargoyle granite is much easier to get than materials for acrylia chain (plus you get plate look)<br />
<br />
Gothic steel BP = 27ac, 3 str, 4 sta, +6 sv magic.<br />
Acrylia chain mail = 22ac, 5 str, 15 hp<br />
<br />
If you ask me, the gothic is better anyway. Plus the ingredients drop in any 20+ Mistmoore LDON (and also can be foraged there).<br />
<br />
Hmm, just noticed the Mac server thing, if you don't have LDON ignore the second part of this message.</div></div><hr />

might try for hill giants.  i don't know what the pp drop on the goblins were pre nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ChaseFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Around 35, you're hitting the bottom end of the right level to farm the grimling caves in Tenebrous Mountains. In two nights of non-stop clearing of one cave (that's all the faster I could go solo before the repops started), I came away with less than a stack of windstones. This is also an excellent place to farm acrylia (which was my real goal), so you'd be killing two birds with one stone.<br />
<br />
The grimlings will be tough at your level, you'll probably want a group. Make sure you have MR/FR/CR if you're facing a geomancer, and watch out for the foreman, which will be tough for you at that level. Stay in the caves, unless you're running away: bat or wolf adds can be deadly. Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>IrrikEndil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks...  Gothic Steel is unfortunately a LDoN recipe, so I can't use that.  I got my skill up to 150.  Once I trivial plate I think I'll level to 35 and then go to the grimling caves...  There are some other people in my guild that want acrylia chain once I get to the level to make it so it shouldn't be too hard to find a group for that...</div></div><hr />
