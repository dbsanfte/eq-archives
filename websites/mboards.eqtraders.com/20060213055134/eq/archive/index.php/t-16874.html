<br />
2 Metallic Substances... willing to pay 13k each now.<br />
<br />
Ginsing... foraged in GoD zones.<br />
Moldy Tea Leaves... foraged in GoD zones.<br />
Taelosian Mountain Tea Leaves... foraged in higher-end GoD zones.<br />
<br />
Thunder Salmon... fished in the Karanas.<br />
<br />
I've also got some Taelosian Mountain Tea Leaves and regular Taelosian Tea Leaves that I'd like get refined... I'm willing to let some use my tea leaves to help work on their refining, but I'd prefer to get the guaranteed 2 teas each from the turn-in on the Mountain Tea.<br />
<br />
Also... if anyone has any Earth Mephit Blood and/or Liquefied Earth laying around for cheap, I'll take it.  :D</div></div><hr />

I can also do the turning in AS some time if you catch me when I am not raiding....which means later in the evenings or weekends.<br />
<br />
Someday If I am bored enough i just might try those substances for you but considering how many HP they have I'd have to be REAL bored to try it solo :)</div></div><hr />
