<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I was talking with my wife, the one who will soon be joining me playing EQ, and she wanted a horse to ride around on.  I mostly know about targeting on horse vs lizard, concerning the head in the way.  Well, she is going to be playing a gnome cleric.  Should I get her the little white lizard, like the black one my druid is sporting, or should I get her the horse.<br />
<br />
Input, please.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lizards bounce and make you sea sick, horses' heads get in the way.<br />
<br />
She &quot;should&quot; be using F keys to target, but most people I know use lizards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have not noticed the sea-sick effect everbody talks about.  Even if she is using the &quot;F&quot; keys to target members of the group, what about movement with the horse?  Will the neck and head obscure her view making it hard to manuver around?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The head is always in the way on a horse :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>sumamael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Depends what do you want to use the mount for, if you will be using it for riding around like a noble did in the medieval times then go horse, if you want it for the mana regen and no-sitting-aggro benefits then buy lizard.<br />
<br />
See? No one cares about targeting problems when riding a horse proudly for fun or roleplay purposes but the horse head does get in the way if you need it for combat use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye.  Horses look better standing and much, MUCH better running.  But that head filling the bottom of the screen is terribly in the way during combat.  I bought a speedy horse for travel (and fun) before LoY.  When LoY came out I loved riding her too much to sell her (her name is Vespers, btw) so I bought a slowpoke lizard to use for medding so that I'd be able to see and target readily.  Hmm, never named my lizard, I ought to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Maisie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am a halfling cleric and I use my group/raid window to target so I never see my horse head.... but I also shrink while on the horse and is removes a lot of the head from my view and makes it easier, I personally think the lizards are super ugly looking so I wouldnt ever get one.. but it is personal choice :) I have no problems healing who I should while mounted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've got a horse, and I've never had any major problems with targeting or maneuvering while on it.<br />
<br />
The only real problems I've had involve trying to hand something to someone who isn't mounted or trying to loot while riding it.<br />
<br />
When I get the plat together, I may buy a lizard, but I'll just use it for mana regen and continue to use the horse for travelling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>caena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">She wants a horse to &quot;ride around on.&quot;  Not a mount for mana regen.  <br />
<br />
She's gonna be a cleric.  It sounds like she doesn't want to melee or even nuke.  She'll be fine with the F-keys.<br />
<br />
As a gnome enchanter, I don't find the horse's head obstructive.  I do generally dismount during fights because I need to be able to run around and STOP and cast--the glide-to-a-halt thing that mounts do is just not conducive to the way I dash dash dash during battles.<br />
<br />
I love my pony, Eque.  I didn't get her for the mana regen.  I got her because *I wanted a pony.*  Nowadays, I do like being able to med without ganking and move at normal speed even if encumbered.  But the initial appeal was a pony.  I suspect that's what your wife wants too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Itek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It depends.<br />
<br />
I have a love / hate relationship with Hobble (my lizard mount)<br />
<br />
The mana regen and &quot;no sit agro&quot; are the PRIMARY reasons I bought the lizard. I have JBoots for speedy travel. (JBoots are faster than the slowest horses. Hence &quot;Hobble&quot; the lizard.)<br />
<br />
If you want one strictly for fashion, then race takes a part in the discussion. Evil races and frogs look better on lizards. (I'm a dark elf, so I bought a black lizzy.)<br />
<br />
Light races look better in general on horses. But a gnome on a huge horse might look pretty silly.<br />
<br />
As other's have pointed out the head DOES get in the way for horses about 100 times more often than for lizards. (if you are facing UP a very steep slope even the lizard head gets in the way) <br />
<br />
If you are LOOTING the horse and lizard BOTH get in the way. It takes a little practice to get used to how to loot from the top of a mount. (in most of my groups either the cleric wouldn't deign to loot or INSISTS on ML'ing to cover peridot costs... there seems to be no middle ground)<br />
<br />
Targeting with F-keys and /assist are the normal way for people who aren't pullers or enchanters. (please do NOT /assist the enchanter until s/he tells you to... *spits out several feet of small intestine he apparently no longer needs*) I personally have no problem targeting and casting from the mount, even as an enchanter.<br />
<br />
I -do- know a fellow enchanter who chose a horse cause it LOOKED better for her High Elven Female Enchanter. She repeatedly uses a minor &quot;trick&quot; to get the horse to disappear while she's in combat situations. I believe they have FIXED this trick, and even if they haven't I won't publish it here. (She's still got the buff, but the horse doesn't appear on her screen.)<br />
<br />
Best bet. Let her see what each one looks like. Some people, unaccountably, like the brown horse better then the black or white one. Ditto the red lizard instead of the black.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ilona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ponies are MUCH cuter than lizards.<br />
The ponies gnomes get are really sweet (they're very small!)<br />
<br />
I really think she'll like a pony much more than a lizard.<br />
<br />
As a cleric, she will mainly use her F-keys for targetting group members (show her how this works!).   After learning how to do that, I doubt she will want to click on people to target them.<br />
<br />
My cleric has a pretty pony, and loves it! (Two times shrink will also remove the head from your view unless looking &quot;uphill&quot;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">For what it's worth, Niami has a little white pony named &quot;Imp, Pony of Mischief&quot; ... long name for a little pony.  He's purely for show, but back when Niami wasn't retired, he was partly for show, partly for spellswapping and medding outdoors.  It's &quot;cute&quot;, because she's so tiny, and therefore the horse is tiny.<br />
<br />
My enchantress has a red lizzie. My shammie has a black horse.<br />
<br />
None of them will ever, ever be speed demons.  None of them are meant to be used for travel - they're just convenient for times when I can't sit and I need to med, or need to spellswap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Farnyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just going along with others have said. Horses look alot better, clerics mainly use F# to target members, because its faster and less chance youll mistarget. The only time I ever have click on something to target while on horseback is to target the mob to stun/nuke, so its rare. Shrink machines run about 1k on Vaz(probably the same on other servers) and they are rechargable and 20 charges per battery, so they go great with horses.<br />

Plus you know....chicks dig guys with horses, thats why I got mine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get her a horse and show her how to use the F keys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sylphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">For gnomes the horse's head is only barely in the way.  It's much more of an obstacle for larger races like humans.  Get her whichever she likes.</div></div><hr />

My best friend owns 2.5 Chincoteagues(Male and pregnant female), which are considered a rare bread here on the West Coast.

Not doing a third horse. Drogmor, maybe... and I want a spotty one. Red, preferably.  Don't know when that will be either.<br />
<br />
I didn't have targeting issues, but then I could /dismount at 90 wpm or the speed of a hotkey, too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'd suggest a few things.  First of all show her what both sets look like so she can see if she has a definate preference in looks (also try to show her what other people look like on their mounts if you can).  Explain to her the disadvantages of each (head vs bouncing).  Let her see what the bouncing is like on your lizzy to see if it really bothers her.  And see if you want to afford shrink potions or a minimizing device so she can get rid of the head if she gets a horse (2x shrink gets rid of the horse head).  Then let her make a decision. :)</div></div><hr />
