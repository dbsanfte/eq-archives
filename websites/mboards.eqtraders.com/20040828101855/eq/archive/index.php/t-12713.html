<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maisie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for options for fletching skills ups, I came across this recipe (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9627&amp;menustr=080060010000) .<br />
<br />
It doesnt say anything about being Karana restricted, so I then looked to see what is was made in and it is in Karana kit, so I assume, it is restricted, but I wanted to make sure. as it was not specified on the recipe.<br />
<br />
/em prays this is a path she can use<br />
<br />
edit: I also noticed that the final product was not tagged as being deity restricted, though this may just be an error :(<br />
<br />
edit v.2 I also went back to the list, which has a header stating it is the list of all non cultural arrows, but then I noticed Blessed guardian arrows with a restriction tag of Karana only, should I assume the karana arrows are in this list for now ? darn I was hoping it was another option :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aradyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From what I understand, all recipes (like this one) that are combined in the Sure-Tel Flectching kit are restricted to Karana worshipppers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dazma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep! The surefall fletching kit needs a Mark of Karana to make.  Only followers of Karana may get one.  This path is still plenty expensive though!  I've been buying out the bazaar of condensed substances and making arrows cheaper that way.<br />

Im guessing i should be ok to do the arrows even tho i follow tunare. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Mark of Karana is a No Drop item. <br />
<br />
It can be obtained by hailing the proper NPC in Surefall, but only if you are a follower of the dierty Karana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sesa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Its not no drop on FV thanks, so its not deity restricted there.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dazma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">NOT diety restricted?  huh, kinda defeats the purpose of having &quot;diety&quot; fletching.  I picked a halfling to be a ranger for this reason.  (not only this reason but it was a high factor)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If thats trtue, it sounds like a bug to me. Cultural should be cultural, even on FV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sesa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Was able to make the Surefall fletching kit, Steel working knife  and Steel Guardian Arrows, will try and do the other Blessed Guardian Arrows later if i can find some plane's pebbles in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Im pretty sure it will let me, on this one why didnt they just make a cultural forge like for other deity stuff seems lazy on sony's part with the mark.<br />
<br />
Splunge FV is full of bugs gave up feedbacking as nothing changes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">no flecthing kit is stationary.  <br />
<br />
its a bug and was probably just missed.  also its diety fletching not cultural.  any norrathian race could do it theoretically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>FentFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Personally, I don't consider those arrows to be the best skill path.  The Large and Small Bricks of Steel can only be vendor-bought, so you can't save yourself any money by gathering the components yourself.  To me, that's the drawback.  If you can handle Acrylia Caverns, then you've got the ability to collect all the Acrylia and (since it's much easier) the Chunks of Condensed Shadow to go that route to 250.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">To you thats a drawback... to some thats an advantage. Different people value their time differently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>FentFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">That's why I said &quot;To me...&quot; ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">actually only being vendor bought is a drawback.  being vendor bought is a +.  being both is ++.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>uncleshmoozo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hmmm ...<br />
<br />
I play a halfling Druid as my main.  He worships Karana so I've been dabbling in a little bit of the Karana fletching recently with some success.<br />
<br />
I tried to make some of the Steel Guardian Arrows (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9627&amp;menustr=035000000000)  today using the recipe as given on the page I linked there but got a DNC result on it.  I did use my Surefall fletching kit as required and I did double check to make sure I had all the correct materials.  My current skill is 204.<br />
<br />
I was able to make the  Blessed Guardian Arrows  (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9613&amp;menustr=035000000000)  by simply adding my Mark of Karana to the recipe (which seems to be the only difference in the two recipes as far as I can tell) but without the Mark of Karana I was never able to get anything other than a DNC result.<br />
<br />
Is there something I'm doing wrong on this combine?  Is it a recipe that requires a higher fletching skill than my 204 before it will even let me try?  Or is it possible that the recipe listed is incorrect?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Oualawouzou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It might be a bug with your fletching kit too.  As a Half-Elf of Karana, I successfully attempted the combine you linked but that was before GoD.  2 days ago, I tried to use my Surefall kit to make me some regular arrows and got an error message stating that &quot;Only Wood Elves may use this fletching kit&quot;.  Needless to say, I /bugged it.  *shrug* I'll probably avoid using my Surefall kit for a few days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I 'think' i see your problem.<br />
<br />
If you were able to make the BLESSED Steel Arrows, by just adding your Mark of Karana...... then...<br />
<br />
...you are using Blessed Steel Arrowheads!  (use a plains pebble to make)<br />
<br />
The normal Steel Guardian Arrows use normal Steel Arrowheads!<br />
(no plains pebble needed.. thankfully)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Crystal Thrall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">From what I've seen (outside of the FV server, that is), only Karana worshippers can do the combines on the &quot;Guardian&quot; arrows, as I call them.  While I don't really mine the fact that the materials are all merchant bought (well, other than the plains pebbles if you go the take the 'blessed' path), but I DO have a problem in the difference in price between the small bricks and large bricks of steel.  Small being 6pp and then jack the price up to 55pp per large brick?  Granted, it is hard to tell the REAL size difference but does anyone else think that is rather ridiculous a price jump?  :boggled: <br />
<br />
I'll probably use the Guardian arrows to get up to 250, but that large brick price hurts when you have limited plat.  Might have to switch to acrylia arrows if the skill ups don't go as well as they have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Just to let you know how the pricing is on Karana arrows....<br />
<br />
I can make 8slot backpacks full of each part (arrow head/shaft/fletch) and buy the nooks for 5500k.<br />
<br />
That is 160 attempts at the arrows.<br />
<br />
and in 4 sets of 160, i have gained 17 skillups (215 to 232)<br />
<br />
stats for 215-232<br />
<br />
Total cost - 22000k<br />
<br />
cost per skillup - 1294k<br />
<br />
1 skill per 37.6 combines.<br />
<br />
<br />
pretty lousy stats, but I would rather spend the cash than farm greens.</div></div><hr />
