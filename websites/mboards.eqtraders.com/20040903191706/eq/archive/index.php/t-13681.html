<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vymdraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Almost done with wu's(155 atm), just need apx 4 more stacks of swatches, should take 1 day of pb aoe farming to do and want to immediately(as in not doing other skills) take tailoring up to at least 200. Guess my first question is, can I make other races' ribbons for LoY skill ups? I am a level 58 dark elf wizzy, so I can't forage, and am not rich, so I have to farm my own stuff. I also want to increase my FV faction (kos still), and am very kos to OT (from being a wizzy trying to get epic). So would it be in my best interest to pb aoe the dogs in FV (never hunted there before) for both faction and LoY dye stuff, or would it be better for me to just go to luclin and do the whole marus seru hopper quads and grimling forest acrylia farmage, or do something else entirely? Btw, I am trying to GM all tradeskills, and all are 151 - 200 now, so getting higher end TS materials for other skills is great too. Thanks in advance for your input :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">would suggest ribbons.  steamfont spring water is supposed to be the easiest to get but if you want to make some ribbons for your de go for it.  good luck.  ribbons are supposed to be good skillups and cheap compared to the other options.  go to 187 then have your wizard quad hoppers or wyvern or cobalt drakes.  good luck.  let some little wizards exp there though.  been to cs 4 times this week at least once per day i played and overcamped every time and nobody sharing.  :(<br />
<br />
oh yeah how big is your bank roll for this?  it takes lots of money to do it quick.  like start with 1 million and hope for some luck if you are really going for immediate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Niellya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hehe . . . he said &quot;immediately&quot; and &quot;Tailoring&quot; in the same sentence.<br />
<br />
Yes, you can do other races' ribbons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">lol.  :hug: niellya</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vymdraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">lol, I didn't mean immediately as in &quot;ok, I think I will GM tailoring in 8 hours&quot;, meant it as in not working on other tradeskills until my tailoring gets up there more or doing the whole xp grind / raid thing. I know I'm insane, but I don't think I've hit the insanely stupid point (yet, give me some more time, and I'll be there, hehe). Added edit to original post to help clear up the confusion. On a side note, god how I wish tailoring was as easy to skill up to 250 as brewing, or as easy as fletching to 200. As for my bank roll, it has got to be bitter cold outside, because it has shrunk to a very small size, like 400 plat.<br />
<br />
And to Eniamn, if you are a level 50-54 wizzy, go to Marus Seru and quad the stonies and hoppers (haven't found a way to just get the hoppers, stonies also seem to pop on me). Its harder than the CS wyverns, but in addition to your xp from it, you also get more HQ, superb, and flawless hopper hides than DSP. Plus it is very largely uncamped, due to the difficulty of add management (only lost one corpse there myself, so I consider myself good). And if yer on the Bertox server, feel free to get some free xp with me while I quad for tradeskilling items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>blewstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have just reached shawl quest 6 and such i need to work up on my tailoring skill. <br />
<br />
I have saved near 4 bags of small acrylia pieces, but now heard about this ribbon that will advance me from 158 on...my current skill level is 163.<br />
<br />
I have 2 accounts and can forage/kill as needed.. My main  is a 65 ranger and my druid is 50..both have maxed forage skill. So my question is:<br />
<br />
1) will foraging be quicker than killing?<br />
2) what mobs do I need to kill? I have heard of steamfont water, but after reading several post not sure for what ribbon they are used for. Perhaps someone has a guide liked i used for smithing that really helped showed the different paths. I have looked at recipes, but still not sure of way. could use any help. Thanks for your time<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Healblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">1)  Do both at the same time.  Killing will be much faster (with the Steamfont Spring Water, anyway), but the extras from foraging are great!<br />
<br />
2) Golden White Ribbon and Platinum White Ribbon<br />
<br />
From here, the little search box from the main site will be a godsend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kanielle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">OMG~Eniamn!!  Did you just say that he better have 1million (as in 1 MILLION PP!!) in order to level up tailoring fast!?!  I don't know much about this but I have been asking around and that's about 100 times more then I was led to believe!  Are you serious?<br />
<br />
I doubt I'll ever see that kind of pp (unless they come out with an EQ Powerball on Luclin.....)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I haven't counted exactly, but I've certainly spent hundreds of thousands of plat learning tailoring, and I'm not nearly done yet. And I have done parts of my own farming and so on, so haven't taken the fastest route. If you have to buy everything in the bazaar, then one million plat wouldn't surprise me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thicket Tundrabog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How much does it cost to get tailoring to 250?<br />
<br />
It really depends, but I'll give you my personal experience. One caveat is that tailoring was my first tradeskill at 250 and I got there over a year ago. Some things have changed since then.<br />
<br />
I kept track of how much I spent. At tailoring skill of 204, I hit a low of 60k out of pocket costs. I farmed almost all of my own components (Velious fur and wood-elf cultural). I sold most of my product. Part of this was in the days I sold arctic wyvern masks for 400pp each in GFaymart before the Bazaar. It was a good return but it took a lot of time sitting in Kelethin and auctioning.<br />
<br />
After 204 tailoring, I made more plat than tailoring cost me.<br />
<br />
It took me over a year to get tailoring to 250. The 180 - 215 levels were hell.<br />
<br />
Things have changed today. Tailored products don't sell very well anymore, and prices are lower. Components are fairly rare and expensive in the Bazaar. On the other hand, there are more recipes, vendor diving possibilities are better, and component farming has less competition.<br />
<br />
Could you spend 1 million plat to get tailoring to 250? I suppose so, if you want to buy everything from the Bazaar and vendor sell your product. A couple hundred thousand plat seems more reasonable if you put some effort into it.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kanielle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks for the advice/info guys.  I think you just talked me out of tailoring though :(.  I'm not a tradeskiller at heart I just didn't like the idea of spending 2900pp on a black pantherskin tunic and thought that instead of spending all my money on purchases like that I could learn enough to equip my own characters and thsoe of my friends.<br />
<br />
Sort of a &quot;give a wood elf a fish and she eats for a day, TEACH her to fish and she eats for a lifetime (or until she gets sick of fish at least)&quot; theory.  In this case I may be &quot;sick of fish&quot; already and I haven't even gotten started yet!<br />
<br />
I appreciate the help though.  It looks like I will be focusing on JC instead as it seems a bit more to my temperment.  I really respect you grinders though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Or in this case the advice may be to focus instead on digging the grubs to sell to the fishers and then buy the fish with the profits.<br />
<br />
Meaning, if you want a black pantherskin tunic it's probably easier to either find one of those combine sellers. (I know on my server there's at least one guy with 250 skill who'll do combines on armor for a fee if you bring all the components) Or, farm the items for it, then sell the individual parts to tailors until you have the money to buy the finished items. If the goal is just to make some armor for yourself then either of those two paths will get you the armor a lot faster and a whole lot cheaper than skilling up to make it will. If it's a matter of pride, well, not much one can do to sway that.<br />
<br />
The 1 mill is a high number, I'd say not that off though if you go with all bazaar bought path considering some of the rip off prices there. I should know, I'm one of those rip off pricers. ;) You can take a much cheaper path however, I know I am. It's much much slower and requires more farming but it can be done. It's all about balancing plat in vs plat out. It's not about having 1 mill at any given time, just making sure you can skill up slowly but steadily by having more money coming in than you have to spend. Once you know what to make to keep the plat in at it's highest it really cuts down on any stress over money needed for a tradeskill. Unless you're in a rush. If you are, don't consider tailoring, go brew or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Doubled</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">hehe the cost is exhorbitant for most tradeskills! But tailoring? oh wow. My total cost for a non-foraging class to 230 has so far cost just over 713,000pp! A million doesn't seem all that far off the mark, it seems I have lived and breathed the game for my tradeskills in the last 12 months, everything done in the game revolves around &quot;how much will I make to put toward my tailoring skills?&quot; lol<br />
<br />
If you want to take the ribbon road for skill ups beyond <br />
wu's, this is what my experience has been:<br />
<br />
159 - 167 Golden xxx Ribbons<br />
approx 32pp for the ribbon, approx 50pp (average) for the dye component (if you don't/can't forage). <br />
32+50=82pp <br />
82pp* 40 attempts (again an average, with being random based you need to take stats across a couple characters over 200+ levels, I remember seeing a post in another thread that mentioned the figure of 39.something attempts per skill level, so this looks pretty close) = 3,280pp per skill level<br />
3,280pp x 9 (159 -167) = 29,520pp (approx).<br />
<br />
168 - 187 Platinum xxx Ribbons<br />
approx 105pp for the ribbon, approx 50pp (average) for the dye component (if you don't/can't forage). <br />
105+50=155pp <br />
155pp* 40 attempts (again an average, with being random based you need to take stats across a few characters over 200+ levels) = 6,200pp per skill level<br />
6,200pp x 20 (168 -187) = 124,000pp (approx).<br />
<br />
Total cost for 29 levels of ribbon tailoring 153,520pp and this is (on TP) much cheaper than the Acrylia road.<br />
<br />
Of course a lot of the cost can be minimised by being a forager or starting a foraging class (approx 58,000pp savings).<br />
<br />
Anyway just thought I'd mention this as a bit of extra info, it's not definitive just a record of my own experiences.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Benthair Dunthat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Doubled --- you can save a bunch of that by making your own dyes, without having any foraging skills. I am sure this has been posted here before but you can farm Steamfont Spring Water from some very low level Kobolds in Steamfont. My druid has been farming these with MELEE skill only with some success. There are approx 25 kobolds in 3 little close together camps. These are Krikbar Kobolds, they do not aggro on me so just plow through them one at a time. They seem to average about 90-100hp each so pretty easy mob. I am getting about 15 waters an hour with non-stop killing. Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Healblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Also, 40 combines per skillup seems a bit much.<br />
<br />
Khoren Stonefall, the first 1750 serverwide, averaged 26.74 combines per skillup in the 200-250 range (yeah 1337 combines... leet yet freaky at the same time)<br />
<br />
In the pre-190s area, you should have a bit better skillup rate, especially if Mr. Needs-To-Lend-Me-Money (just kidding) has or can get a decent level or WIS or INT.  Being a leel 58 wizard, I expect he can get 255 INT with int gear and VoQ.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dalren Fieryblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Acrylia Studded Mask's. Seems like it would be much cheaper as long as you can farm the acrylia and hides. Will take you to 188, 6 points past platinum white ribbons, and it wont cast you 2.1k a stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>falkahnhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">159 - 167 Golden xxx Ribbons<br />

3,280pp x 9 (159 -167) = 29,520pp (approx).<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how you're getting your numbers.  With 310 int I went from 158 to 167 on about 2-3kpp.  I averaged about 1 skill up per 7-9 combines and made gold ribbons.  I'm not sure why you're assuming 40attmepts per skill up.  I've gotten from 158 to 173 and I'm still in the 8-13 range.  The best thing about the ribbons is that 2-3k I still have to make robes.</div></div><hr />

If you want to take the ribbon road for skill ups beyond wu's, this is what my experience has been:<br />
 <br />
<br />
Was just sharing my own experience, as I saidit's not definitive just a record of my own experiences.<br />
<br />
And yes you can minimise your costs - forage, make your own dyes and save approx (from my own stats) 58k pp.<br />
<br />
/shrug wasn't meant to be a definitive expert guide.<br />
<br />
As far as 40 combines average per skill up, the RNG is a wicked thing! I have read several posts on these boards and many other boards that show that  others have had the same or similar experience. In contrast though I've seen many posts stating that they can achieve a 5 - 10 combines per skill up average. /shrug I don't have the answers. Maybe its a cultural thing? Maybe its a deity thing? Anyone have the answer as to why some of us have an average of 40 and others 10? Would love to learn more about the whole RNG thing and how it applies to tradeskilling. Is there a maximum number that can be generated, is there a minimum? Is it all just luck? If it doesn't come down to luck how do you tweak it so you get that 10 combine per skill up average?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fundin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I had an interesting experience with the RNG this weekend. Did about a stack of Gold ribbon combines (various ones, had a mixture of dyes) and got one skillup to 158. Then I had enough fur to make two lemming fur backpack combines. Not only did I succeed on both, but I got skillups on them both! <br />
<br />
Now 160 tailoring (and have a geerlok), I have decided no more plat is gonna be spent skilling up, time to do the 6th shawl combine til I succeed (I failed twice at around 155 tailoring).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>grumpinzel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It's not a controlled study obviously, but I *have* noticed that my skillup ratio for arctic wyvern masks is much better than on ceremonial solstice robes.  It's not unreasonable for me to get no skillups for 60 robe combines (4-6 successes at this point), and yet get 2-3 for 40 mask combines.  They are the same trivial, why has that been happening for the past 14 skill points?  My wisdom is at 355 so I've been hoping (praying!) for the 20-27 combine per skillup ratio but that hasn't happened so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tingteng</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hmm that makes me want to use the 300 combines of arctic wyvern masks I have sitting in the bank...........<br />
<br />
Currently (190)<br />
<br />
Keep doing the cultural (slow) or do the masks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Duncan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Don't the completed ribbons (Platinum-White or whatever) have a sellback to vendors?  Or do you have to Bazaar them off to an INT casting race for robe making?<br />
<br />
Just thought the recovery of PP from sellback should be included in the ribbon equation...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>tibbwini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yeah, you can sell dyed ribbons back to the vendors, for about 2/3 the value of the undyed ribbon, IIRC.</div></div><hr />
