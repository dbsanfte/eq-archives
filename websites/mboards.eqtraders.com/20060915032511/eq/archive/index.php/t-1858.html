It's particularly cool since it's one of the only all/all robes in the game, and I would like to have it for my bard 8)<br />
<br />
I looked in the recipes section of this site and didn't find a recipe for it.  It's not listed at all.  Or maybe I missed it?<br />
<br />
Anyone know the recipe and/or trivial level?<br />
<br />
By the way, the graphic of the robe is all black, AC6, AGI+1.  Not great,<br />
but it's all/all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">data9724</div><div class="date">01-04-2003, 05:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Easy enough to make, but since a lot of races dont get the robe graphic anyway (trolls, dwarfs, ogres, wood elves /cry) you might wanna be sure you get the graphic before hunting the stuff for them. Spend 2 hours getting silks, and then found out i could not get the graphic.<br />
So ended up giving some to guildies, putting one on my monk, and selling rest.</div></div><hr />

If it's anythng like the shade hide armor then all you will see is tunic graphics when you equip.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry it took me so long to reply.  Yes, I missed the recipe in the tailoring section.  My bad.  Thanks.<br />
<br />
I do get the robe graphics because my bard has several illusion masks of races that can wear robes (iksar, erudite, dark elf).</div></div><hr />
