I have a few ideas but I'm looking to help fund my tradeskill progression by doing all of those nasty little sub combines for tradeskilling. What do you secretly always look to find in the Bazaar? Heady Kiolas? Heady Paelas (shade silk is soo much faster to farm for the cured/raw silk phase of Skilling up)? Celestial Essences? Ceramic Linings? Leather Padding? What do you keep looking for and never see that you would want to buy to ease your skilling?  What would you be willing to pay for these things.  i'd like to setup a mule full of these things to make myself a little bit of money to skill on you to make things easier on y'all.  I just need to know what you want to see on there?  I'm asking specifically on the Tunare board because we all know that every server is different.  I'm 51st level (also working on bringing an Enchanter up for mana vials and such).  I have no access to anything higher than the first tier planes but suggestions from higher might give others ideas as well.</div></div><hr />

Coldain Velium Temper at less than the Coldain charge for it<br />
Leather Padding at at most 25pp<br />
Enchanted (HQ) Ore, since my supplier seems to have vanished :( at anything up to 100pp (your chanter will need to be 49+ for this, though...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm working on the chanter for Enchanted Ore but that will be a while of course :)<br />
<br />
I'm working on adding the other requests here :) the Clay is an excelent one and i should be able to get that up on the trader shortly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niami DenMother</div><div class="date">03-04-2003, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I *used*  to carry enchanted ores on my bazaar mule.  Unfortunately, they don't stack, they were only selling sporadically, and I was seeing far better returns on alchemy goodies.<br />
<br />
I'd be more than happy to stop carrying enchanted clay if someone wants to pick up the production for that.  I can generally sell from 2 to 20 stacks per week (many, many, many hours in that week in zombie trader mode) for 1pp per magic clay. It's become quite the bother to keep restocking it, and while I like to keep tradeskillers supplied, I'd rather not deal with the clay anymore.<br />
<br />
Other ideas: <br />
 noodles &amp; dough if you have a forager handy for higher yield eggs<br />
 various tools and utensils (file, embroidery needle, pot, pie tin, nonstick frying pans, etc.)<br />
<br />
The embroidery needles especially are more needed these days, as they're consumed when making the needles for the new robes, among other things, and I can't tell you how many files, pots and pans I've lost in the last couple years.  ;D<br />
<br />
A quick check in the bazaar shows dairy spoons, files and non-stick frying pans on sale, one lonely set of skewers, and no pie tins or cake pans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaephod</div><div class="date">03-05-2003, 04:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great! Thanks for the suggestions :) i plan on getting my Enchat Clay spell for my enchanter in the next day or so.  I can pickup stocking Clay so that you don;t haev to mess with it.  I'll look into teh other implements as well.  I've been meaning to make a run at smithing but haven't gotten up the steam to do so yet ;)<br />
I do have access to a druid for foraging and have no problems slaughtering Basalisks in Lavastorm for those coveted Basalisk eggs for dough.  I'll have to look at the noodle recipie again as well.  I seem to recall that using Basalisk eggs for it was blasphemous...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which mana vials are you looking for and what sort of prices are you expecting to pay?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aks024</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't need mana vials anymore, as I'm a GM potter now (250 woohoo).  However, when I was progressing from 200-250 there were 2 main things often missing from the bazaar:<br />
<br />
Magic clay<br />
Vials of clear mana<br />
<br />
I could make the magic clay myself, so not a huge deal there.  However, to save myself the pain I would have paid up to 2-3pp per clay, which would be a 40-60 pp profit for anyone in the bazaar.  Considering you can mass enchant clay now, this would be an ez thing to do.  <br />
<br />
The vials of clear mana I was willing to give chanters a 100pp profit per stack (so sell for about 20 pp each vial).  Aaastro stocks them from time to time - no idea who that is but he/she made me very happy.  But...Aaastro was about the only one.  <br />
<br />
Also, if you can imbue the cheapest of the gems, those are always appreciated for skill ups.  I could do emerald myself, so never worried about buying, but if I were a class that could only imbue a really expensive gem I would buy the cheaper ones already imbued in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
From a tailorers perspective, heady kiola is always a nice thing.  I HATED making that when doing skill ups, and usually bought it in the bazaar.  <br />
