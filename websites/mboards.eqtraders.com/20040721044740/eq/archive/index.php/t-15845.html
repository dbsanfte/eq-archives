<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Redbones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Below is a quote from necro forum... just trying to figure out what item he may be talking about?<br />
<br />
There is one other benefit I use that I'd like to share. There is a merchant in Chardok who sells jerkey and nectar that, if I recall, is a &quot;miraculous meal/drink&quot;. It's VERY cheap! I go to Chardok and fill a backpack with it, then run it to the Chardok bank. Lasts me months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xerelise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think thats what he refers to :<br />
<br />
Louie's (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20631) <br />
<br />
I don't remember the name of the food though :(.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is the man you are looking for.  Yes, he does sell some interesting things.<br />
<br />
Foraged Javelins are a popular purchase among knowledgable monks as AFAIK they are the longest range throwing weapons available that don't require you to have either tradeskills or odd drops from raid level zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">And people with good Chardok faction arent too hard to come by, being as how the Spirit Wracked Cords is a very nice item to quest.<br />
<br />
I factioned up Splunge to get the cords (still wear them), and i factioned up my monk so i could park her safely by the Iksar Betrayer spawn point for epic niftiness. (Shaman getting the faction was jsut a side-benefit of working with my monk)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Redbones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thank you for your help here guys. Will return when I found out more to share.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Iannyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not to pour salt in an old wound, but has anyone tried giving this to lewena?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>JMorgana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We've already found out what to give Lewena, although the name of the item escapes me.  It's cinnamon spiced tea or something like that and when you give it to her, she gives you the Brodder's Revenge recipe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Iannyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">!!!!!<br />

Man, I've been away too long :/  Thanks!</div></div><hr />
