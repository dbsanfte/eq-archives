<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>filobeto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am not EP flagged, nor plan to be anytime soon.  However, I do wish to attempt some stonehide wears.<br />
<br />
I have acquired, via the bazaar, the items for an attempt or two, except for the liquefied earth.  Is this a silly rare item that I will have to pay through the teeth in order to make the studs?<br />
<br />
I have yet to see any for sale in the bazaar, I however have only been shopping for them for a couple of days.  How often are these available on other servers and what are the going rates?<br />
<br />
Chips of Granite used to be hard to come by, but now are fairly common for a couple K a pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Liquefied Earth is probably the most rare of the hard to get items for Earth Armors. On Veeshan Chips of Granite run 5-10k in bazaar (5-6k actually sells), Earth Mephit Blood 1.5k-4k (1.5k-3k sells), and Liquefied Earth Runs 7k-50k (7-10kish sells). Per my time experiencing in Earth I have seen about 25 Earth Mephit blood, 4 Chips of Granite, and 1 or 2 Liq Earth drop. Of course this is about 70 hours of EXP groups NOT RAIDS! Things tend to drop differently on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Liq. earths are stupidly rare...to be honest, it would be cheaper to buy ornate patterns, even for legs and tunic, than to buy liq. earths.<br />
<br />
Even if you don't fail anything, you need 4 (or is it 3?) liq. earths for one tunic attempt. At 75kpp (the only ones I've ever seen for sale were 125kpp), that's over 200kpp JUST for the liq. earths - and I've tunic patterns for less than that.<br />
<br />
Oh, and then there's the little bit where it's triv is 300+, so more than likely, you'll fail.<br />
<br />
And as you said, you're not elementally flagged, so you can't try to farm for them (I've never seen any drop during grouping - only on raids).<br />
<br />
So, my recommendation: buy ornate. Sorry. =(<br />
<br />
<br />
(Btw, The granite and bloods are nothing - grouping and raids drop tons of those. I'm my guilds tradeskiller and I got a bag of earth meph blood - just nothing to use it on since I never can get liq. earths.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Best bet is to auction to buy Liq Earth and stand firm on your paying price. I would GLADLY pay more for Livestone Chain armor for my ranger that buying ornate. That ornate is covered in a glue that wont let you get rid of it once you get a better item. The PoP gear is resellable ;) <br />
<br />
Personally I would add up all the prices for the items needed to make a specific piece. If the armor wont sell for 3 times the cost to make it then dont make it. On PoP armor I run a sucess per 2-3 tries. Some times I get lucky and go 3 for 3 other times I run 1 for 5 ;) In the long run you will make a profit over time but they key is to set a buying and selling price and STICK TO IT! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BuilderOfCastles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On Fennin Ro, we have  a lot of guilds in the elemental planes.<br />
<br />
Liquified Earth is about 15k each while all the other items range from 1-5k and I would be surprised if any of it sells, because you need a Liquified Earth to use it.<br />
<br />
Yes, the drop rate is insanely low.<br />
<br />
Doing the 'Stone Ring' we get better then a stack of 'Chips of Granite'.  Doing the 'Mud Ring' we get 1 or 2 'Liquified Earth'.<br />
<br />
For farming I suggest hunting in MA's tunnel.  (yes you need  a key)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>elty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">you only need 2 LE per attemp on tunic/leggling. 1 LE give 1 temper, but 1 temper give 2 studs. <br />
<br />
however, the only worth while leather stonehide is leg, boot and helm. Ornate tunic is about on par with the stonehide, while leggling is slightly worse. For all other peice there is something better available from LDoN hard, and often they cost less than stonehide.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You need 3 tempers since 1 temper = 2 studs and leg/tunic needs 5 studs.<br />
<br />
5 tempers per 2 attempts ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>NVekRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've pulled 3 liquified earth off of vendors in PoT in the past couple months.  Spent less than 200 p, made about 150k p on totems of the Rathe.  Ahh I love people who don't know the value of tradeskill items.  :)  Some of my best PoT merchant finds have involved some merchant mining (i.e. keeping them clear of junky stuff), but even if you don't feel like doing all that you can sometimes get lucky.  I have about half a bank full of the more rare PoP tradeskill items simply from merchants, and only started trying clearing the merchants a couple weeks ago.  Catch them right after a patch and check them often - you're likely to find some good stuff.  No, you're not going to get piles of liquified earth this way, but even if you buy them for several thousand plat you're unlikely to find piles of them most of the time, so why spend all that cash? <br />

Double the price of the player-made as there is only a 50% (roughly) success rate.<br />

<br />
From a monk perspective the bracers are very nice. Stonehide Tunic is currently the 4th best tunic in the game counting no drops. Legs are ok, but with 60AC on the flayed barbarians leggings they aren't really worth making. Kingly boots are a very cost effective alternative to the stonehide boots.<br />
<br />
For farming liquid earth I have set up camp right outside the mudman temple on the zone wall. just be prepared for the wandering Dillo and you're gtg. Expect to get one liquid every 3-4 hours of constant grinding. They are indeed stupid rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>OberonMiM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">only thing rarer than liquified earth from my experience is the &quot;an elemental stone&quot; and the &quot;cracked crystals&quot;<br />

but the liquified earts are insanely rare compared to the steel, blood, and even all the bow parts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Note to self: vendor mine the PoT vendors more often. I would be beside myself if I found a liq earth on a vendor. =P</div></div><hr />

The lique earths are very rare drops, hell I have seen more &quot;an elemental stone&quot; drop than I have lique earths.  I have a hotkey I usually click once I get in game and sometimes get lucky and net a lique earth every few days.  I end up paying 5k, if i am lucky, but close to 8-10k each.  They are rarely found doing teh bazaar search and if they are people try to sell them at ridiculous prices.  BTW I am on Rodcet Nife and teh stonehide tunics usually sell for 100-125k.</div></div><hr />

If you do the mud ring then you will DEFINATELY see how much rarer the elemental stone is than the liquified earths</div></div><hr />

I dunno how many times my guild has done all of eartha rings, 4 liq earths in one hour is insanely high. Four liq earths over the entire event is a great haul.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>lamini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">on a good day ive had 5 elemental stones in less than 2 hrs.  On a good day ive had 4 liquified earths in 2 hrs.  Know that the liquified earths drop from the mud mobs, I think they more commno of the yellow cons.  15-20k on CT each, easily the rarest piece, since these mobs are farthest from zone in, where chips of granite drop right near zone in.</div></div><hr />

15-20k each for liq earths..../sigh...I need to take my cash and go cross server shopping...</div></div><hr />

Hmmm, well I feel better about paying 10K x 2 in the last couple of weeks, then. Especially since I vendor-mined 2x Shattered Cystals.<br />

Failed 1 of 2 Ceramic Totem of the Rathe, but I'm still happy  :D</div></div><hr />

Only place I have seen them drop is Mud,  get 2-4 per mud ring, about 45-50mins kill time.  at least when we did mud ring.<br />

<br />
Earth A ring events only spawns the loot dropper every 3 days. Killing the mobs any other time doesn't make the slightest difference. If you're masochistic, you can run Mud ring repeatedly, you just won't see the A Monsterous Mudwalker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Ah, thanks Jannelle. On the Rathe, I think there's a general moratorium for staying away from all the ring event mobs so as to not blow them for anyone.<br />

Bought 4 liq earths this weekend for 45k each and went 1 for 2 on earth tunics.<br />
<br />
Lemme rephrase...<br />
<br />
<br />
I FINALLY MADE ONE!!!!<br />
<br />

(This now puts me at a career of 1 for 7 earth tunics)</div></div><hr />

Yes. Certifiably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>filobeto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Took 2 tries, but I did make something new!  Stonehide Tunic.<br />
Paid 15-20k for the Liquefied Earths and it took a good bit of time to find them for sale at that price, suppose I could have gotten them quicker but I had a limited budget after my first failure.</div></div><hr />

The cynic in me has to comment that this moratorium may be for the ‘noble’ reason of saving the ring event for those who need it (to progress)….but it seems awfully convenient in limiting supplies of liquefied earth so that people are even willing to pay 45K each. :boggled: <br />
<br />
The rest of me will just say Congrats! on the tunic :D</div></div><hr />

Circle gets a square!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Kaaba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">You can do the ring events with no loot up and still spawn the Arbitor for progression, and there is no time limit, every 4 times ANY ring is completed the Arbitor will spawn (loot version every 3 days).  In fact if you wanted to, you could do 4 mud rings in a row and spawn the Arbitor.  People don't properly understand the way the events work so they tend to be cautious.  On our server we have some nuts spreading the rumor that the timer of a Planar Projection starts when you hail him which is incorrect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Abazagaroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">It has to do on our server with ALL the rings being on rotation as a single entity. Every 3 days a guild does all of them (that they can complete). The rathe just works differently than most other servers.</div></div><hr />
