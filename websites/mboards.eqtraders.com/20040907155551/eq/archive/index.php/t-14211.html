Honestly I see no reason to nerf the Pale Velium Inlaid Cestus. It should have efficiency at level 65 about equal to an Entwood mace (which, on prexus, can be acquired for 2-3k). Not to mention it's suicide if you attack during enrage by accident (does happen now n then).<br />
<br />
If anything, I would say give a boost to the other pale nihilite / velium weapons to put them on a par with this. Make the 2hs a 30/30, not a 24/30, that sort of thing. The trivials are high enough that a 3-5k selling price wouldn't be obscene. (232? smithing for the cestus, not to mention the JC combines, which you have to do a quest to get the required bag for regardless).<br />
<br />
 If you do that it's possible that smiths will be able to break even / get a little bit of profit of off smithing, assuming you are friends with an enchanter and snag the drops yourself.<br />
<br />
I would LOVE to see smithed weapons become a viable market, would give a new breath of life to tradeskills.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading, I hope this will make you reconsider your decision to change the weapon (and perhaps revamp the GoD smithed weapons in general).<br />
<br />
Edit: Keep in mind please that it's also a decently heavy weapon (2.0 weight  on a monk is heavy.) And that the efficiency goes down greatly with lesser levels, as it's main draw is in application of damage bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i wasn't sure by his post if he meant to change the ratio up to a 10/20 sort of thing instead of 5/11 or a 20/20 sort of thing.  it might not be as bad as your thinking.  a 5/20 would sure hurt though.  <br />
<br />
the omds kinda frown on posting stuff directly to soe peeps.  they visit us out of respect and tend to be scarce when you post stuff directly to them.  maddoc seems cool though.  the alchemy stuff alone has assured him a home in pot to skill up and avoid the give me plat messages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ohverweit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, Maddoc seems to be a good guy, and I hope the mods don't have a problem with the message being directed to him.<br />
<br />
I took his message to mean it would turn into a 10/22 or equivalent, as that's what the 1hs weapon is if I recall. And if so, it's a waste, as you can get a better ratio than that for 50pp nowadays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">he also said that there were better weapons we could make.  <br />
<br />
(sorry if that's a misquote maddoc.  its what i thought from reading what you said at least. the &quot;real market&quot; or something like that comment.)<br />
<br />
i think they will probably have a better ratio.  after the last batch of player made weapons though these are pretty good.  missing the hp from the tae ew but but other stats better.  uber next to fiery and acrylia weapons.  i'm looking for something i can make to use on a level 3 warrior twink.  trying to keep him in only stuff i've made.  so far he's in fine plate with a drakkel bastard sword.  the sword because i was disgusted with the other weapon options i could make and he could use for the price.  <br />
<br />
what i would like is something like 2k for centi longswords.  i wouldn't mind something similar for 1k cost and decent farm rate of non-store bought components.  selling for 2k can still make profti as long as its not a 335 triv.<br />
<br />
found quote <br />
<br />
I suspect you'll be retracting that statment when you scratch more than just the surface of the Gates Smithing recipes (You did know there's roughly 700 new smithing recipes, right?). <br />
<br />
I think some of you will be pleasantly surprised when you get to making the better weapons with the higher quality ore. Others won't be impressed at all, but overall, you should get a nice market for yourselves with these weapons.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daikoku Ashikaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are a couple of threads on this in the smithing forum  a one directly about the cestus and one &quot;God Info&quot;  as well.<br />
<br />
Boils down to a couple of things:<br />
<br />
By the time you get time flagged, time geared and enough GoD geared to effectiveley farmed the higher level ores, there is no way that you would ever use what is likely to be made. (While in to early, pre elemental  pop for example, guilds were using BD cultural armor as baseline gear.<br />
<br />
What is currently being produce has production costs (Velium bars) that will make it totally un profitable to produce, yet are too expensive to use on skill ups.<br />

<br />
First off, this is already being discussed in this (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=14061&amp;perpage=25&amp;pagenumber=3) thread.  This one will only split the discussion into another unnecessary one.<br />
<br />
Secondly, there are proper routes for submitting feedback to the developers.  You can use the /feedback function in the game or submit an email through the Developer's Corner (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_feedback.jsp).<br />
<br />
Considering the fact that Maddoc already responded twice to the other thread that deals with this issue, I'm sure he's reading it for feedback, but if you'd like to submit him further feedback, please go through the proper routes as there is no garauntee he'll read this one and we generally frown on people trying to get the attention of the Devs in this way.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
