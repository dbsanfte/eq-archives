would this be a cheap way to get to  252?</div></div><hr />

One of the Subcombines is Celestial Temper which requires a Blue Diamond (Barters for 350+ on luclin I think). You also need to do this quest for each combine I think.. http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3275</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillanu</div><div class="date">04-19-2006, 08:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, you only make the Cleansed breastplate, not the Imbued one. The cleansed breastplate (227 triv) is made with acid wash (triv 151) (around 5 plat per and brewed with storebought components) and filthy breastplate. The filthy breastplate I think is just a hail, or phrase to an NPC in PoK, and he give you one. You combine it, destroy cleansed breastplate, go back, get another, combine, destroy, etc.<br />
<br />
The only problem with cleansed BP is that you need (i think) bertox flag from PoP.</div></div><hr />

This quest originates in the top of the Plane of Knowledge Library, with Aid Grimel. {Boy do I hate that Elevator}<br />
<br />
Smithing Part 1: Need 220 Smithing.<br />
Flags needed - Grummus, Carprin and Bertox Completed. <br />
Zones must visit (or have visited) - Plane of Disease, Crypt of Decay</div></div><hr />

In the original version of PoP, there was no way to get to Bertox unless you had your Carprin kill completed.  However, that was changed later.  There's an alternate flagging quest now that lets you bypass the Carprin kill, if I remember right, and you can piggy in (using the 83% rule) to kill Bertox without ever having done Carprin.</div></div><hr />

Ahh true, but think the orignal write up just included it was the route that had to be done. Hmm see a request from someone who only has Bert &amp; Grum (knowing that the never did Cap) to verify this fer ya. :)</div></div><hr />

This was only true for a very brief period when the backflagging quest went life. It was changed back to the state where everyone wanting to enter the Bertox area needs to be keyed from the carprin cycle. <br />
<br />
So unless you did bertox in the brief time the 83% rule applied you cannot do Bertox without Carprin</div></div><hr />

*edit whups - saw the pottery thing not smithing, nm on the trivial :p<br />

The velium weapons now break down into pieces, and bricks etc, so 1 run through should be enough. Head to Thurgadin. You will need a copy of enchant velium and a coldain temper, both sold in Thurgadin.</div></div><hr />
