<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>NewNugget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello folks...I'm looking forward to sharpen up smithing for the 8th shawl quest, and my smithing is currently at 169 atm. I will need tons of leather paddings since fine plate armor seems to be the most economical way to skill up. However I'm looking for a place to farm spiderling silks. I have tried EF (close to the PoK book) where tons of spider spawns but there are also tons of PHs, and the drop rate seem to be poor. I'm a 61 wiz and I usually gather ALL the mobs in the entire alley than do AE, so I kill all PHs in massive quantity, but even using this method the yield seems to be poor, as I usually net about 40 spiderling silks in less than 2 hours. Is there a better place? I heard about Ferrott, but I tried there and spiders are just plain scarce, unless I'm at the wrong location of the zone. Any help or comments will be greatly appreciated, thank you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bear in mind, however, that the drop rate in the Feerrott has been cut by over 60%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">While you're hunting for spiderling silks, don't forget that shade silk thread and a LQ rockhopper hide makes leather padding too.  Go to Shadeweaver's Thicket and the pit under Shar Vahl, and nuke the heck out of the xakra worms (SWT right near the PoK book, and all over the place under Shar Vahl).  Once you've gotten a pile of shadeling silks for shade silk thread, go to Marus Seru and AE the greyhoppers until you have LQ rockhopper hides to match.  Stitch 'em up, and you're on your way!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Greklak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I like Feerrott the best personally for spiderling silk.  I'm a warrior and obviously have no ae abilities and no track and I can get 60 spiderling silks (still sucky) per hour even with the decreased drop rate due to junk silks for new ogre quests.  Making your padding from shadeling silk is the best way to go if you can get rockhopper hides.  I can get well over 100 shadeling silks an hour in shadeweaver's so it's at least twice as good as Feerrott for that type of silk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I mostly farm the &quot;a lesser shade&quot;s in Shadeweavers - they drop shadeling silk (for rockhopper-based leather padding) and swirling shadows (for Shadowscream armor), which you'll probably need tons of later.<br />
<br />
As for spiderling silks, I used to do Steamfront - then the newbie revamp killed that - then I switched to Ferrott, and the newbie revamp killed that too :P  I still tend to go to Ferrott anyhow, as it *seems* to have the best drop rate per time invested still, even though it feels painfully slow.  (and I'm a paladin, so I'm running after each one individually, too ;) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am a sk who runs of out bone chips from time to time and heads to kurns.  On my way I always stop by the little dungeon underground in Field of bone.  <br />
<br />
Running to Kurns with the bowl on the right, there is a little hillside with mounds sticking up.  Where the grass starts and sand ends outside of the underground entrance about 6 to 8 bonebinders and bonecrawlers spawn.  Inside there are about 20 to 25.  Not the fastest respawn, but at least 10 silks or more per visit.  <br />
<br />
It keeps my supply up for casual use of leather padding if I smack them on the way in and out of kurns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Reflan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You can get spiderling silks outside Gukta too.  The respawn is pretty quick, but if you're an evil, the good guy guards are scary.<br />
<br />
The drop rate isn't too exciting, but it's there at least.  <br />
<br />
Feerrot spiderlings sure have a ton of junk on their loot table, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Every knows there is a empty crypt to the left of Field of Bone POK book.  The crypt spawns many spiderlings and you dont have to chase them down. That is my suggestion.<br />

In a 4 day period, as a 60 bard I gathered 15+ STACKs of condensed shadows (sell on my server for 50p each-- I gave to 2 friends maxing fletching at the time)  and SOOOO many stacks of shade silk and shadeling silk, that even after making 5 stacks of padding I still have stacks of shadeling threads left. Sooo need to farm hoppers again.. but was busy concentrating on finally gm'in baking after a year of working on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IMO, it's much better.  You can farm shadeling silks very quickly in Shadeweavers, and also pick up some swirling shadows for shadowscream armor later on in your smithing life.  There are hoppers in that zone that drop pelts, but the best one seems to be Marus Seru, where you can kill tons of hoppers for the pelts.  Keep the high quality ones for tailoring backpacks, and reduce the MQ ones to LQ.<br />
<br />
One thing to note, is that a low quality wolf pelt and a shadeling silk thread will not combine to make leather padding.  You need to use low quality rockhopper pelts instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>NewNugget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok...perhaps I'm wrong, but I went to shadeweaver and cannot find any xarxa silkworm at all...perhaps I was at the wrong part of the zone. I also visited the cave and all I could find were Gor's...no Shak's at all. Any suggestion? Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Elyssanda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Gor's and shaks are a cycle.. kill one to pop the other</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rerashyaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A daytime/nighttime cycle, to be precice. Which bugs me because you can't tell day from night on the moon (never mind that you can see Norrath by looking up, and should be able to tell the time, depending on what time zone you're looking at, etc :rolleyes: ).  Only problem is, shak dratha are MUCH more likely to drop shade silk (tailoring trivial 81) than they are to drop shadeling silk.<br />
The heaviest concentration of xakra silkworms spawn in the area right by the book, but they are on a cycle with the bugs and little rockhoppers. This can be handy, especially as more seem to spawn if they are being actively hunted, because the hoppers will occasionally drop hides, silkworms will drop silk, and the bugs will (rarely) drop bloodling carapaces that you need for the shadowscream quest.<br />
And of course, there is skeleton hill (very close to the entrance to the caves) where lesser shades live... unlive... something.  Skeletal hunters and nusiances spawn there, so be sure to wipe them out, especially since nusiances will pick fights with shades.  Lots of shadeling silk, some swirling shadows. It's a good place to play during the 'day' if you're farming substances.<br />
You can't tell I spent much of my newbie-hood in shadeweavers, can you? :p <br />

I did this for 4 straight days of 10 hours a day, it's not ONLY a day/night cycle. it can be POPPED kill one set, other set should pop.. every now and then you may have to *clear* the Gor group twice before the Shak appear, but then you get shak twice so it evens out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">This is an alternate method of getting paddings.  Farm Rockhoppers for hides, you can generally find the LQ, and MQ rockhoppers hides cheaper than the others in the bazaar as people farm the hoppers for the Superb and Flawless, and the rest is junk to them.  Then farm Shadeling silk for shadeling thread in Shadeweaver's Thicket. It drops by the ton of the little worms and the Shak Dratha (yes, silk drops off alien creatures, don't question, farm!)<br />
<br />
Shadeling silk + Rockhopper hides = leather padding.  I much prefer this padding, its so much easier to come by</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Arcturos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have found that spiderlings don't spawn in Feerott as much as they used to.  East Commonlands has plenty of spiderlings.  But Shadeweavers Thicket is awash with Xakra Silk Worms.  I have noticed that the worms spawn in batches, though.   I can run around the zone with my bard and track worms, kill them, and loot them for about 15 or 20 min. Then I won't see another worm on track for 10 to 15 min. Then, suddenly, the zone is full of them again.<br />
<br />
Maru Seru is a great place to farm LQ Rockhopper hides. They are a common drop off the Greyhoppers.  Anyone who has ever been to Maru Seru can tell you that there are more Greyhoppers in that zone than there are players logged onto your server at any given point in time (ok I exagerate slightly).  Most folks hunting in that zone are level 20-30 types looking for experience only.  They could care less about the hides and would be happy to let you loot them.  They are just going to rot anyway.  I have a level 25 alt I keep in that zone and group. When I explain I want the hides for tailoring the other members are happy to let me have them.</div></div><hr />
