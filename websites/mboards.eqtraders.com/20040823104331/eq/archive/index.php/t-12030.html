<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Windru Peacekeaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings fellow Potters :)<br />
<br />
Pottery was my first tradeskill up to 190, over two years ago, but I haven't touched it since.  As a Karana halfling druid, making the first Idols was pretty inexpensive since the pebbles were all foraged (from 188 to 190 after finishing the 188 vials).<br />
<br />
But, while checking my inventory, I found that I had about 20 various Faithstone essences on my bazaar mule.  I decided to try a couple of them...<br />
<br />
First off, I was bad.  I forgot to swap in my CHA gear to get the best price on sapphires for my enchanter.  I was also lazy because I had all the money and didn't want to transfer cash to the chanter.<br />
<br />
So, my next few tries I WILL remember to get my gear on.  I can easily harvest enough plat from HG in RM to afford a few more sapphires.<br />
<br />
So, my point is nothing really.  I know I'm 190, and since the Unfired Faithstones trivial at 250, I expect failures.  As I did last night on my only 2 attempts.  I only hope that the RNG likes me sometime, and decides that my halfling belly and feet are worthwhile of a few skillups and/or successes.<br />
<br />
I guess I needed a break from all the smithing I have done;  I am stuck at 190 there also, but LDON has helped me a little.<br />
<br />
Thanks all, <br />
