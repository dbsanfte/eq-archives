I’m looking to set fair prices for all this cool stuff I’m foraging, some of the stuff is really rare and I’d hate to have it go to waste. Also, since I’m relatively low level, I’m looking for a small income source. I plan on doing trade skills later, say around 40, but my stats really aren’t high enough to start that yet so I want to put all this cool stuff back out to the trade skill community. Here are some of the prices I’ve set; I’m looking for feedback on what they should be.<br />
<br />
Morning dew            30pp<br />
Misty acorn              15pp<br />
Oak bark                 30pp<br />
Veggies, fruit, ect.      2gp<br />
Foraged avack eggs   5pp<br />
<br />
More to come I’m sure, again just checking to see if these are fair prices for our server. <br />
BTW, is there a website that has prices for this kind of stuff?<br />
Thanks for the help<br />

Thank you VERY much. I’d love to see the spread sheet. Maybe I could help fill in the blanks, there's someone right now selling 5 griffon eggs at 50pp each, I guess that sounds reasonable to me remembering how hard it was to get them for my 52 druid on Saryrn. Also, I would think the morning dew would go up a bit, the asking price in kelithen when ever a n00b sells then to a higher player is 25pp and the vegetables should go down from 1pp, they are common in almost every zone. Anyway, thank you VERY much.<br />
<br />
<br />
adjustments to my own prices are<br />
Misty acorn 20pp<br />
Brownie parts 5pp<br />
sylvian berries 5pp<br />
(Rule of thumb is that for less common forages 5pp and rare forages 20pp)<br />
or something like that<br />
<br />
Thanks again, and I’d love to see what you have so far on the spread sheet even if it has holes<br />

I think that would have been me...  ;)<br />
<br />
Still haven't sold those guys yet, which is why there ar eno other prices other than a 'max' (but the 'max' is what I've seen, doesn't mean they sell for that much!)</div></div><hr />

That is what I have so far...</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
That's where my Rogue's Corner board is.<br />
<br />
Only drawback - have some sort of poop-up stopping software (but the board is free)...<br />
<br />
If anyone else has an answer or suggestions, please let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iuviene</div><div class="date">02-20-2003, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if someone would just advertise the message board in a couple of links form here and castersrelm and allakhazam's the board would become active. Would be nice to not have popups though. If a board did get started I wouldn’t mind leaving messages on the guild forums to get the word out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draggar</div><div class="date">02-21-2003, 06:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since noone here, nor in my guild knows about one, there may not be.<br />
<br />
I'll ask around in /ooc over the weekend and if I can't get one, I'll put one up though Aimoo, but they do have popups for the &quot;free&quot; boards (I can't afford the pay ones yet, but I'll have it set up for donations!)...<br />
<br />
Worst case, it'll be up by Wed of next week.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iuviene</div><div class="date">02-21-2003, 07:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I’m having the same luck.<br />
If we can just get an active board going then we can get people to help with it (graphics, and coding, n' stuff). Maybe and EZboard would be good, there are lots of people out there with global EZboard accounts, and as “ebil” as EZbord is about charging for bandwidth I don't think there would be enough people on to get us into trouble. Well just a thought.<br />
If you need any help with it I’d be glad to lend a hand.<br />
