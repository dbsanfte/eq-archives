<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aquila Swiftspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Like so many others, I've been working on Enchanted Velium bits for smithing skill ups; in my pharming, I run across a fair number of Blocks of Velium.<br />
<br />
I've been storing some, selling some on my vendor.  But I'm wondering if it might not be better to break it down a few times into two small pieces?  Or would it be worth while to smith it into velium sheets, perhaps, to sell those?<br />
<br />
Is there something worth smithing it into for tailoring, if not small pieces?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help; I've looked around some, and am a bit stumped.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">tailoring uses studs and i think boning.  <br />
could use it in shawl 8 armor.  then make the droppable version to sell.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Personally, I am going to break every block or brick into pieces for EVB skill ups.  Velium is pretty easy to come by, so it's not a big deal to me.  When I get to tailoring, then I'll just farm more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm starting to save up to make some Infused Sheets of Velium for BD cultural. To make that, I need blocks of velium, so personally, I'm saving my blocks to use for BD cultural, however, most people I know who are farming velium are breaking down everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>drtyaty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tailoring does indeed require velium bits, which uses pieces of velium.  Therefore, you can never have enough.<br />
<br />
The recipe is for arctic wyvern hide armor and is one of the easiest post 187 tailoring combines to find components for.  However, you will require a lot of velium; likely more than you will need to raise smithing to 222 or whatever.  <br />
<br />
Break the velium down.  When you are through raising your smithing to 222 or whatever go ahead and smith the velium into bits and then studs; that way you are taking up way less space in your bank.<br />
<br />
Forgot to add that the velium recipe does not use boning, that is acrylia armor.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aethia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm currently working on smithing (212) and of course following this board closely as smithing is my weakest skill in terms of knowledge.<br />
<br />
Balkin, what race are you? I searched for Infused Sheets of Velium, because I too have been getting lots of blocks and want to maximize my velium. <br />
<br />
I couldn't find any infused sheets of velium (searched under Infused).  I am human and for my cultural I need velium rings, so I break my blocks down to large bricks and make the rings to use later.  Anything smaller then large bricks gets broken down to use for skillups on enchanted velium bits.<br />
<br />
Just want to make certain I'm not missing out on another use.<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Iannyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I buy blocks of velium, and folded sheets of velium whenever I can fnd them, starting with the sheets first.<br />

I use them in BD smithing, and love finding someone that has put some on their afk vendor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
arctic uses stud but some of the other uses boning.</div></div><hr />

Velium also drops in Skyshrine does it not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">from golem mobs.  most don't farm there though.  i like my faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>drtyaty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">And, why is it important?<br />
<br />
I've only been in that zone two times when I accidently clicked the tower in C.S. while killing wyverns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">oh.  i thought the golems actually had faction hits instead of just being on that faction.  my bad.  i port for money there sometimes and make cvts sometimes so i like not being kos in cs.  planning on starting wyvern quadding next level though once i get kei.  <br />
<br />
its not really important but you asked.  just a comment while answering a question.  :D <br />
<br />
commented on need for velium boning in case someone wanted to make those peices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Raytheon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Anything with a tranluscent model in skyshrine will drop velium, either golems or gargoyles.

Sorry, that was supposed to be Infused sheets of Brellium!<br />

DOH! Need blocks of velium to make them.</div></div><hr />

blocks --&gt; folded sheets of velium --&gt; infused adamanite<br />

and the blocks are disgustingly priced in the bazaar right now, but I snap them up whenever I see some at a reasonable rate.</div></div><hr />
