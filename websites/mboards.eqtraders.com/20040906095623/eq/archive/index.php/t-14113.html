<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>xyndra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">seems like this might be a bottleneck (at least for skilling up with these recipes)... unless someone knows a good source for snake eggs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>xyndra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">can't believe I actually posted this... since there are only about a million snakes in Norrath at any given time... spoiled by using basilisk eggs. Please disregard.<br />

Yeah, I couldn't believe I was in newbie zones smacking baby snakes around.  REALLY thought those days were behind me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqNichola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Best place for snake eggs is Paineel newbie yard. Any character over about 20 (I think) won't be hassled by any of the NPCs nearby, and being a newbie yard it's on insta-respawn. Everything shares a spawn table, so go to town. Let any real newbies there exp, of course :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">tox forest is dead.  i go there to fish for slamon to make my fish oil with.  if you see a newbie, just buff them some.  they are likely pure newbies to not have left yet.  nobody but me seems to like tox.  i was there pre-velious and post-Kunark.  you couldn't get around and away that easy at all.  it was good up to about lv 8.  now giant fire beetles could probably take you to ten or more slowly.  <br />
<br />
you can ae most of one side of the river.  don't steal from a newbie and let them loot whatever you don't want.  i did it for ling silks for padding.  person was more than happy to give me pading for the few dozen other corpses i left for him.  buff them and let them loot extras if you ae.  you will have no problems in tox.  i almost never see a beggar there either.  its a nice quiet zone to fish in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>arturio emerys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">East Karana is great source of tradeskill items.  If you get there early in the morning when no one else is there you can farm it quite well if you have a pbaoe char.  Gather the snakes, spiders and lions and wipe them all out in a single hit of upheaval.  The most I've done is 40 mobs at once.  Snake eggs drop frequently from the chasm crawlers there and they are place holders for the crag spiders.  Here is a break down of what you can get in zone:<br />
<br />
Chasm Crawlers source of snake eggs<br />
Griffawns, Griffenes and Griffons source of griffon meat<br />
Lions, Lionesses sources of cat hide in a variety of quality, expect lots of ruined though.<br />
Crag Spiders source of silk and spider venom sack<br />
Carrion Spiders source of silk, spider venom sack and halfling parts<br />
<br />
Foragers can forage tea leaves and plains pebbles.  Other standard forages apply too.<br />
<br />
While you are there, if a hill giant, Tarbul Earthstrider or Theoris Bladespur spawns, take em out.  Nice cash for all 3 plus fine steel for selling or to the tribute guys if they are ever brought back.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Laoghairre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Also vendor mine in Qeynos and Neriak for snake eggs.  Don't even try elven cities as no snakes spawn there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LalitaPancakes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">newbie area of paineel is great area for snake eggs. also EFP and WFP are great area's too for snake eggs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I merchant mine most of my eggs. *shrug*<br />
<br />
when I need them in quantity though, Butcherblock newbie area, or East/West Freeport are my usual areas. I'll have to give the paineel newbie area a try too... :) Once my Cleric gets Upheaval, he'll try EK. Two of my Characters are at 158 tailoring already, but the rest are all 115 or lower, so spiders here I come! LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nanndas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I hit the vendors in EC and WFP and not an egg to be found. Seems like a lot of people are doing Vendor mining atm. Not one thing I could use, be it eggs, skins, silk etc. Killed about 20 snakes on my way to NFP and not one egg.<br />
<br />
Logged my trader on and did a quick search on eggs and sure enough 2 traders were selling them at 50pp each.. 100pp a combine for the new GoD recipes. :mad: <br />
<br />
So needless to say I will continue to wack greenies to death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm keeping Zyrtryx camped in Abysmal for a while, so I logged my lvl 15 Monk to check for snake eggs. I didn't find any on vendors, either, so I started whacking stonesnakes in East Freeport. I quit when I got 8 (I plan on doing the recipes that only use 1 egg for now), but got kicked to the server selection screen when zoning back into West Freeport and didn't feel like logging back on.<br />
<br />
I may go kill a few more snakes in West Freeport before xfering them to Zyrtryx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Was finding a lot of snake eggs on the FP vendors when the berserk frenzy was high. Now that that's died out.. now I just /feedback for a recipe to let us make snake eggs by combining other type of eggs in a mixing bowl. It would make more sense than to have to make us either kill whole lot of newbie critters or make 10 different versions of each recipe in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Teaamillie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Maybe what they could do is use something like whipped eggs and then any egg could be used.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is how I've become much more financially secure, by living by illovich's corollary definition to the definition of tradeskills  (&quot;Tradeskills: a method of amassing a small fortune by expending a large one&quot;)<br />
<br />
Tradeskill Items: A means by which a large fortune can be made by exploiting lazy, rich tradeskillers. See padding, leather, Steamfont Spring Water, silk, silk thread, acrylia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Madriu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I was in Paineel newbie area last night (while there were no actual newbies) and found that spamming F8 and pet attack brought me about 2 stacks of snake eggs pretty fast.  The moss snakes in that zone can drop up to 3 eggs at a time, and rarely drop 0, so the eggs were dropping like lightning.  After that, I had to leave as an actual newbie showed up, but vendorfarming was much slower, IMO.<br />
<br />
Got 4 stacks of eggs in all last night, and out of those, got 2 skillups.  So bring sacks and sacks of those eggs if you're looking to get a lot of points!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Madbakerhobbit2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I just KNEW no good was going to come of that never ending moss snake thread in the newbie zone at EQ's main site....<br />
<br />
Poor snakes.  They have been pretty much left alone, and here I come, trailing leaves in my need to try the new GoD recipies....<br />
<br />
East Commonlands is not a bad spot for eggs.  The zone is pretty much deserted, and there are lots of snakes there to round up and beat to death.  You got rattlers in the desert part, and the green ones in the grassy part.  Have fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>illovich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My baby necro (ok, she's 51 now) was able to get around 2 stacks of eggs in Paineel in between 30-60 minutes, which is not great, but certainly not as horrible as some other farming endevors (silks in EK and acrylia come to my mind).<br />
<br />
I'm not sure that Paineel is THE sweet spot for eggs... snales are a rather rare spawn (I'd guess if they can spawn from any spot, they're an 5-10% mob, and they don't spawn in waves like bats, skellies and beetles). <br />
<br />
I'll need to try the karanas and commons to see what they have. Butcherblock sucked pretty bad (it was hard to find snakes).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>grossbottom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I don't know if this has been posted before but...<br />
<br />
In Gukta, there's an NPC merchant near the soulbinder, just past the zone to Innothule. He's called the Dar Forager.<br />
<br />
He's there maybe 50% of the time. When he's there, and no one has beat you to it, he sells snake eggs. 15-20 is the max he seems to carry.<br />
<br />
When he's not there, as far as I can tell, he's out wandering the swamp, foraging new stock. He aggro'd my troll once when the troll was sitting down at the PoK book. I assume if he's killed, it takes time to respawn him.<br />
<br />
It's possible that newbies are selling him the eggs, since he buys like any other merchant, but I don't think so, since the eggs are at the top of his inventory along with some unique swamp-style food items.<br />
<br />
I don't know how long his trips take or any other info, I just keep a baby frog parked next to him with some plat. Every once in awhile, I log on the frog and buy whatever eggs he's got. Adds up pretty quick.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that's my egg supply. I'll prolly regret posting it, but oh well. =) <br />
<br />
(Apologies if this was common knowledge).</div></div><hr />

The info on Dun Forager Lumun and his Snake Eggs (down and dirty :p):<br />
-He spawns at noon and midnight game time.<br />
-He carries 10 eggs.<br />
-The spawn spot listed in the DB is good (90, 56).<br />
<br />
My original post on the subject:<br />
http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=66332#66332 <br />
<br />
I find that a lot of info has to be recycled for the new to find.  So no prob on the post Grossbottom.  Hope this helps anyone else looking for Mr. Lumun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Traydex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">This may be a dumb question to ask, but I'll risk it all the same.<br />
<br />
Does backpack placement have anything to do with what gets eaten when? I had some eggs placed in one backpack in the top left, and food in another pack in top left slot, and when I got through hunting, I discovered I had lost/eaten? about 5 eggs.<br />
<br />
I moved them to the bottom stack and ran to the bank as fast as I could before any more dissappeared.<br />
<br />
Is this a common thing, or am I unlucky with my eggs..:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dregor Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The way food is consumed, it will eat any food in a general inventory slot, then it will go through the packs in the following order:<br />
<br />
<br />
1   5<br />
2   6<br />
3   7<br />
4   8<br />
<br />
It also goes through the packs slot in the way as well.  Hope that's clear enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Anaxo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hah, I had completely forgotten about  Dun Forager Lumun and his snake eggs. Time to poke the little froggie town. ;)</div></div><hr />
