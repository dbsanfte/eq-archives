<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kamino</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Let me know if anyone is interested in making these pieces, unfortunatly this diety seems rare on xegony so I'm not able to find it in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wystie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you gather all the junk, I'll hit combine for ya.<br />
Oh, *and* I have a druid that can imbue the pebbles :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamino</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Being the lazy bastard I am, I'd rather just buy it, ready to wear, but I guess you can't have everything. :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for your offer! ....I guess my question now would be what items do I actually need to get?  I glanced at the recipe and it looks kinda complicated, with items that need to be combined for the final ingredients.  If you could list out what items I need to fetch, that would be very helpful, thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wyst is an enchanter, so she can enchant the HQ Bricks herself.<br />
<br />
The big items to collect are:<br />
<br />
1. Essence of Sunlight.  You need 2 of these per attempt.  Drop primarily in Skyfire, though they do (sometimes) drop off Sand Giants in the Oasis &amp; SRo.<br />
<br />
2. Bricks of Velium.  Fairly easy to find in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
You will also need Griffenne Blood, Rain Water &amp; Plains Pebbles (1 each per attempt), but those are very common.<br />
<br />
You can save a step by trying to buy Royal Tempers in the Bazaar... if you see them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamino</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks Angelsyn for the pointers.  I'll try to gather these components to make it easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamino</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Gathering and creating these components is going to be much harder than it looks unfortunately.  Is there anyone willing to make these for sale?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kamino</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">edit - pls disregard this thread, i found one finally :)</div></div><hr />
