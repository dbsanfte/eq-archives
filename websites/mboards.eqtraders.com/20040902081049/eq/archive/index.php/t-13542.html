<br />
I stopped doing tailoring about a month ago to work on baking and fletching.  Now that I'm back in it, I remembered how horrid farming the silks was in ec and everfrost.  So I went to the Bazaar, only to be greeted with the insane cost of 15pp per silk (it used to be about 2-6pp on my server)!  So my only option is to farm these things until I can get a few more points with Wu's.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

I will try there, thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the spider in ek can drop up to 8 silks rarely.  good luck.  i'm killing drachnids and yetis in dl.  not really for the silk just to kill em.  i think the spiders in kaesora drop silk.  thats a full dungeon of spideys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sadine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Someone posted that the spiders in FV where also a good source of silk.<br />
<br />
Lots of people hunting spiders in EK. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Furyrpied</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The FV spiders may be good for silks, never tried it.. but when you are choosing between craig spiders and those evil spell casting damage sheilded FV spiders, what would you choose?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>dbtort</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">FV is good especially if your a pet class or can AE, on avergage 1-2 silks per spider but there are alot of them and rarely camped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arghargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">EK is still the best spot I know of, but they won't drop 8 anymore.  There was a bunch of other items added to their drop table, so you get junk instead of silks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you can track I'd say EK. If you can't or there's too many people hunting there, FV is decent enough and the spiders are easy to get to and plentiful. Or the spiders in upper guk, no real advantage to a tracker there. Kaesora spiders I found to drop too many other junk items. I've killed there quite a bit and the drop rates were disappointing - pulling practically every spider in the place and half the undeads with them I'd still get less silks than for the same amount of time in FV or EK. Killing spiders in EF can also be an alternative for lower levels with tracking. It all depends a lot on your level and class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes they do just got 8 off of one yesterday. 8 on  a spider was always rare. More common is 2 to 4 per spider.<br />
<br />
Ok FV is not really that great a place for silk farming the spiders are much higher in level than either upper Guk or East Karana.<br />
<br />
There are basically two choices when it comes to what is best for silk farming.<br />
<br />
If you have a tracker and/or don't mind running around over a fairly large zone to kill spiders then East Krana is your best bet. Lots of spiders that drops silk quite often. Just be sure to kill the snake place holders as well as the spiders.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you prefer to sit at a static spawn camp Upper guk heart spiders is the way to go.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shamiks_Anar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When I needed silk for Wu's tailoring, I took a trip to East Karana...<br />
<br />
Now, I know that doesn't seem very exciteing, but here's a way to keep things interesting and expedite your collecting at the same time...<br />
<br />
If you are of a class that can PB AoE for over 600, bring along a friend (preferably bard or ranger) to pull massive trains for you...and I mean everything that spawns in the zone aside from NPCs, giants, and cyclopses (anything with more than 600hp or might ruin either of your factions).<br />
<br />
The funny thing about the EK zone...is that all of those mobs you just wiped out are on an instant spawn timer (or very near...maybe 30 seconds) and what spawns in place of them is pretty much random (killing a lion, wolf, spider, snake, griffawn will spawn any of those).<br />
<br />
My friend and I collected a little less than 6 stacks each in about 2 hour's time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">hehe i have to get to 49 for that.  my pbae atm drops them to like 49% and they all scatter.  :(  that is unbeleivably annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My vote is EK.<br />
<br />
Took my then 26 druid to EK to forage tea leaves for my brewer. While he was there he basically killed everything that would give him XP including spiders! By the time I got 100 tea leaves, my druid was level 31, and I had over 300 silk swatches. This was over a weeks time, but I got that many without even trying. A concerted effort with AE spells will bear much fruit! Heh<br />
<br />
I still go there to forage, and swim, and fish, and kill for xp... :p and some crags are still light blue! Imagine that. hehehe Oh, did you know a 31 druid can solo a hill giant? Root and Rot baby! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">soloed my first hg at 30 as a wizard.  i was completely out of mana and had an mp item doing it though.  not recommended.  way too dangerous hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>RangerTimy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well, I went to East Karana to find silks, and all I can say is... wow!  Even though I was never there alone (at least 2-3 other levels 60+ hunting silks) I was able to walk away with 7 stacks of silk after only an hour.  Also got a few tea leaves, vegetables, and fruit, to boot!<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestion!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I like Upper Guk, 12 static spiders, 8 minute respawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The FV spiders take more yes, but when there's 6 people in EK all after silks and all over 50th it can be faster to run my pally out in FV, get 15+ spiders and go to town with AEPB. Obviously not a low level solution, but if you have the firepower it works quite well. At least until EK is less farmed - there really is no place that's better than it IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Meirril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Even as a non tracker just stand on the hill the hill giants path on to and mow every snake and spider you see. I'd recommend throwing in wolves and lions as well, hides sell well enough and it keeps you from getting frustrated by not being able to find anything. <br />
I can't stress this enough, kill the snakes. (unless alot of other people are picking out the siders and leaving the snakes alone. Then just do what their doing until they get frustrated at no spiders spawning and leave. Then go back to killing snakes.)<br />
<br />
All the good zones have already been mentioned. You can also try due tarantula's in SRo. Their drop rate stinks, and they arn't a major spawn in the desert. On the up side, you can collect lots of water and maybe an extremely rare ancient cyclopse there. G'luck!</div></div><hr />
