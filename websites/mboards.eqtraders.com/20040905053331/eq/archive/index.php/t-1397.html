<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jorg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well i was dumb and made my troll warrior cazic thule cuz i was a newb at the time and didn't know better to make him rallos zek.  So now i'm screwed over when it comes to the new uber smithed stuff cuz i can't wear human made armor like the zek people can /cry.<br />
<br />
So I talked to many people and they all said to post here and ask because they, unlike myself, believe there is at least 1 ogre smith on this server.  I've never seen any sort of darkscale armor for sale let alone the Fulvous Darkscale (CT deity) that i need.  This really sucks cuz how am i supposed to twink my war if i can't get him the good stuff =P.<br />
<br />
So in summary if you know of any ogre smiths please let me know because i'd really like some of this made, and that ogre smith would basically have a monopoly of smithed armor on the rathe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well i found out that Necwor is a 193 smith or so, i think it will be a while before i can get my fulvous armor made but he is working up there.  So if you guys get any windstones sell em to him hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Still in search of a 250+ Ogre smith.  Troll Shad (Inny).  /t Kagan in game please!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jorg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hehe, i found another one who was selling fulvous darkscale armor in bazaar... but turns out his ogre switched servers.  However i managed to get a pair of fulvous darkscale gaunts from him =D</div></div><hr />
