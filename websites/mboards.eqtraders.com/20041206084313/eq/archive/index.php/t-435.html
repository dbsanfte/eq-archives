<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fandrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thanks for all the silk thread, good luck to you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ok first things first, i know alot of folks dont like to pay alot for Spiderling or spider Silks, and i respect and understand this, however I also know that to gather a large quantity it takes time, to do 100 skill ups involving silk cords  would require 600 spiderling silks ( one cord = 3 silk threads, silk thread = 2 spiderling silks, or 3x2=6 x100=600) and will take at the least 6 -8 hours of game time to gather or more and time is a precious thing in Game. <br />
 My rates are reasonable and flexible i do prefer to take items in trade for my time, i normally farm for two hours each morning after work, gathering anywhere from 50 to 100 threads at a time ( not spiderling silks as i almost automatically combine them to threads for more room in a few bags,) I dont make cords out of the threads unless hired to do so normally just leave it in thread form.. i am happy to gather for anyone in any amount. <br />
 My standard rate is 5plat per silk thread. (or trades of equal value to that. ) <br />
  I can gather shadeling silk threads as well <br />
  leave a post here or seek me out as Meegot  the ogre warrior ingame  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">:cry:  ok folks sorry to do this but Meegot will no longer be taking orders for silk threads, was a great money maker for a low level character ( over 30k in pp in 6months , just 2-3 hours a day, ) but time to develope Meegot into a real warrior ( he still only 11th level)  and to move on in the game. I hope others will help our fellow Trades folks with resonable prices and continue to do this service for you.. <br />
    i will say that it seems 5pp a piece for silk threads is a good standard price.. as for other items across the servers, well it gets weird.. Stormhammer leather padding 75pp, blue diamonds are at 280 to 400,  just an example of what i have seen. <br />
  Any way I have sold the silk farm and wish all of you that bought from me , and those that didnt , good luck on your skills.   :D</div></div><hr />
