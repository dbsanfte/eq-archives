If so, please post your results. I have been playing around with both Tier 1 and 2 Poisons and have not had many sells. It may be more expensive to make, then Rogues are willing to pay. I do pharm all my components that I can but still have to purchase the vial componets/ambers/mercury/gnomish spirits etc. etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Osprey</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On a whim, I put a bottle on my bazaar mule. It was a 10 does bite of the shissar and I think I priced it at 500pp. <br />
<br />
It sold after a few days. <br />
<br />
For me to want to sell it, I'd need a steady stream of ingredients really. If you did this by vendor mining....<br />
<br />
6pp for tainted planar essence<br />
3pp for phosphorus powder<br />
1pp for mercuric ore (no idea what it costs really)<br />
2.6pp for ethereal suspension<br />
3pp for scent of marr (not sure what that costs either)<br />
<br />
So that's 16pp per dose. (When I did the 500pp, vials were not being returned.)  <br />
<br />
So materials is 160pp.  Add in time, and a bit of failure rate, and I'd probably try for 400pp. I can't imagine anyone willing to spend 40pp per dose.</div></div><hr />

I haven't seen anything that says how to do it, though. I'm presuming that it is possible based upon what you said above?<br />
<br />
Makes it much easier to carry around a 10-dose bottle of poison than 10 bottles of one-shot, that's for sure ;)</div></div><hr />

I have a few customers and they do sell.</div></div><hr />

I don't really see a market for it.  Plus the successrate on tier 2 poisons is kind of retarded.  I takes me around 20-25 combines per 10 dose.  I guess if someone requested the stuff I would make and sell but I have put some stuff up before and it never moved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same here, the only exepction would be a lower level rogue who can apply poison (20, right?) buying high level poisons (&gt;105 trivial)...<br />
<br />
But then those poisons would probably be too expensive, and since there is no easy way to search for the poisons (with the exception of searching for &quot;all effects&quot;, but that will give you also every spell for sale at the bazaar..)..<br />
<br />
No market for them on Kane Bayle, not even special orders...</div></div><hr />
