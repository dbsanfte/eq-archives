<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kiatek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It seems everyone likes to yell at others or make sarcastic comments or just in general try to make others feel stupid around here lately.  Or maybe that's just my impression from various threads I have read. <br />
<br />
For instance, in the baking forum there is a thread on MTP's.  I read a post yesterday of someone saying others should stop making new tradeskillers feel bad that you had to do it the hard way (paraphrased).  That person sounded very bitter that others had to have an opinion about doing things the hard way.  IF it was in the primal scream forum (as I am doing) I wouldn't have thought about it, but it wasn't.  That isn't the only questionable post in that thread mind you, in my opinion.  And it isn't the only thread.<br />
<br />
Just wondering if the new UI isn't making folks harbour ill will towards each others now.  Some for having done it the old way, and now new tradeskillers for feeling as if old ts'ers are calling them &quot;newbies&quot; in a negative way b/c they didn't do it the old way.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if the new attitudes continue, it will probably end my on and off perusing and chuckling at the site.<br />
<br />
/shrug  Probably going to get a chorus of &quot;don't let the door hit you on the way out&quot; but oh well.</div></div><hr />

Hey,<br />
I resemble that remark!:wave:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kronepsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wouldn't say it's a prevalent attitude.  It's only a few bad eggs really, from what I see, mostly of names that I really don't recognize.<br />
<br />
If anyone's posting in a thread that develops into what they'd consider a bad attitude thread however, double/triple check that the post isn't bringing the attitude into the thread too.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind that very handy &quot;Report this post to a moderator&quot; button.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, that's it!  It's not a button, it's a link.  LINK, darn you all!  Why back in the day before anything stacked and you had to walk across Everfrost, uphill, both ways, just to buy a brick of ore, calling a link a button would have gotten you banned from the game, and furthermore...<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I couldn't resist.  Being one of the relative newcomers, I understand where you're coming from.  I never tradeskilled, or for that matter even played, before the Planes of Power expansion came out.  To me pelts and sheet metal always stacked, you could buy just about everything you need without going more than two zones away, and the concept of faction work to buy materials is still alien to me.<br />
<br />
The problem I see is two sided.  On one side, there are people who have played since the olden days, who did a lot of stuff the hard way because there wasn't an easy way.  They've been bombed by newbies asking questions for ages, and having been on the &quot;master&quot; side of the &quot;OK, how I make metal bits&quot; discussion, I can see where it begins to wear after a while, especially since there are SO MANY people who just want it all handed to them that the good people with simple questions to get started get the ill will.<br />
<br />
On the other side, there are lots of people who, for whatever reason, didn't get into tradeskills until recently.  They ask a starter question, and wonder why so many oldsters bark at them.  They can't see why they should feel badly about having a tool or feature just because there are those who skilled up without them.  There are a lot of oldsters who will make a new tradskiller feel inferior without even meaning to, because they &quot;only got into it for the Aid Grimel earring&quot; or &quot;just do it for the money&quot; or any of a million other reasons that are just as valid as doing it for the love of crafting.<br />
<br />
The solution to this clash in the middle is obvious, but like real life, there will always be people willing to do it politely, and people willing to do it rudely, and the attitude that crops up when someone does it rudely unfortunately takes time to fade back down.  On the whole, this place is one of the friendliest, most helpful and most informative sites I've ever experienced.  So if you see attitude flying around a discussion, be patient.  Those who really do need the help will get it eventually, and the rudesters will eventually tire and leave.<br />

Button, link, whichever.  As long as people realize that it's there BEGGING to be pressed/clicked on.  :P</div></div><hr />

It seems everyone likes to yell at others or make sarcastic comments or just in general try to make others feel stupid around here lately.  Or maybe that's just my impression from various threads I have read.  Curious you say that.  To me its seemed like its actually been getting better, with fewer sarcastic, rude,  and/or mildly-attacking remarks.  I'd actually all but stopped reading the EQTC forums a few months ago, just too much hate &amp; anger and too little rational discussion in every thread I could find.<br />
<br />
To me, it's seemed to have gotten a lot better 'lately', with fewer purely sarcastic and derogatory postings, and more of the informative/rational/humorous discussions that I love this community for.<br />
<br />
Its in part from changes in my reading habits (just plain avoiding some of the worst, etc), but I feel its largely a shift in the postings, considering I read about twice as many forums as I used to ;)<br />
<br />
I'm not saying you're wrong or I'm right - we're both right, you for you and me for me.  I always find it interesting when two people can look at the same scenario from different backgrounds, and come away with polar opposites for their observations&amp;conclusions.</div></div><hr />

I got called rude by someone badgering me with questions on how to make things *after* i politely told them i was very busy, was sitting there with 'afk/very busy please send me a tell after noon eastern us time' as my message and had already answered their original question about how to use the forge [yes, *right* click on it...] all i did was heinously tell them that they really should come to eqtraders and read the smithing section and it would answer all their question. I got the response that they were in game and wanted to smith NOW and that they didnt want to log out and *read*...<br />
<br />
finally after 20 minutes of this crap, flipped screen, found their guild website and wrote down the names of their officers went back into game and sent one a tell and complained about them after taking screen shots. found out it wasnt being played by the player but his 10 year old kid...GAAAAK! give him a nintendo and keep him out of MY hair!!! officer told the kid to back off and i finally got some peace...i was about to log into my ranger and go forage somewhere to get some quiet...</div></div><hr />
