<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I'm looking at fletching and smithing next (and last, as the case may be). Smithing I already know is a pain in the butt, but fletching still remains to be proven as a pain in the butt.<br />
<br />
I'm a woodie druid, so I have the option of Blessed Bankbreaking bows and arrows (that probably no one buys anymore because they all want PoP stuff) and I do not have the option for Blessed Raindude stuff.<br />
<br />
However, the recipe for steel guardian arrows (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9627&amp;menustr=080060010000) does not show up in the database as culturally confined to Karana worshippers? Is this an oversight or can anyone really combine these?<br />
<br />
If so, I'm thinking then I can make a little halfling rangerette and PL her up in fletching to the level of making the subcombines (which looks like 188 and that's easy and inexpensive) and then do the real arrows combines on my main.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Or<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Level up (both in level and in tinkering skill) a gnomie to make my own standard bow cams and go that route.<br />
<br />
<br />
***********<br />
What do you guys think? (I hate farming acrylia, so I really don't want to go there) If the steel guardian arrow is culturally confined, then I have no choice...<br />
<br />
But, looking for your opinion. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aerinha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The problem with the steel guardian arrows, is that you need the Surefall fletching kit to make them....that fletching kit is the reason I had to raise my ranger's smithing, rather than have my husband's Karana druid make it for her, because the silly thing is no drop!!<br />
So although the combine for the arrows is not deity restricted, HAVING the kit to make them is. <br />
I haven't checked my server yet to see if the merchant that sells the steel has come home yet, either. Mostly I have been skilling on the acrylia arrows, lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh. Lame.<br />
<br />
Then they should make those arrows be deity restricted as well so as to not get my little wood elf heart up...=P<br />
<br />
(I should add that I'm super excited for all the Karana worshippers - I think you guys deserved these recipes a long while ago...just wanted to sneak in my combines as well =D)<br />
<br />
I guess I'll make a gnome.../shivers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Furyrpied</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">aye.. good luck with the tinkering... I have a gnome who has gotten up to standard bow cams.. broke my bank i dunno how many times..... *sigh*<br />
<br />
But like i said... good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The more closely I looked at the recipe list, the less I think I'll do the gnome thing...<br />
<br />
whatever arrow's to 202<br />
<br />
no-cam recipes to 215<br />
<br />
then probably mix acrylia with no cam bow recipes to 250...and probably throw a few woodie bows in for fun...<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
I dunno....2 cam bow recipes would get to 235. Closer trivial means better success chance, which means more cash back from selling to vendor - and less farming of acrylia (which I hate - did it once as a tailor, really don't want to do it again).<br />
<br />
But maybe if the acrylia/shadow etc. components are decently priced (i.e., a lower combine cost than X recipe I was gonna do), might do that...I dunno...I was all excited about having figured out a good way to go =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aerinha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For the acrylia arrows I make, I purchase the acrylia anytime it falls below my threshold price...but the condensed shadows I farm. I can't see paying 15 to 50pp per condensed anything when I can farm it or find on npc merchants(bring back the vendor mining...=/ ) for so much less. I hunt in shadeweavers when it is deserted, or, pay in buffs and heals to the newbies in the zone. I have made friends that way. <br />
I have also hunted the aliens in twilight sea for the condensed substance. The Vas Rens I think were the ones that had it. I took my alt warrior there when she was of a level to get exp with her group and had fun. <br />
Maiden's eye, and Akheva ruins are decent places to get it from the toilers. <br />
The aliens in Scarlet Desert drop the condensed flame. <br />
I would be more specific, but it is way too late for me to be posting coherently. <br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

You obviously have tons more experience than I at this, but recently when I hit 202 in fletching I did some playing around with Wood Elf arrows and bows and looked at the acrylia route, and decided I needed a Cam-bot, so Gnomedeguerre was born.<br />
<br />
<br />
It led to a little thread on ideal tinkerbots that you might find interesting.<br />
<br />
http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=11015<br />
<br />
<br />
I ended up using 200 bonechips to jump from 2nd level (got to first level just killing newbie quest defective clockworks on the way out of Ak Anon) to 9th level, which let met get spells for a long Kurn's Tower and the Paludal run.<br />
<br />
Once I hit 16th, I got tinkering from 50 to 75 on cams themselves, then did stalking probes up to 102 (I have this thing about getting to at least 101 in skills) on Stalking probes, and then Powered Gloves were enough for a couple more skill ups just for fun (though you can take those all the way to 122 with about 4.5pp loss per success).<br />
<br />
Anyway,good luck!<br />
