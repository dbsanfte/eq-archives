<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Clerigo Dwarfroar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For those of you that do not know, when you make a grandmaster trophy, you can summon a no rent bag.  You can take that bag and hand it into the gn0me in the bazaar (middle building, second floor) to get a 100% weight reduction bag that only weighs 1.2 lbs.  If you have 2 or more grandmaster trophies, you still only get one bag.<br />
<br />
Now, I personally think that each grandmaster trophy should get its owner a seperate bag.  If you have grandmaster 1 trade, you get 1 x 100% weight reduction, 1.2 lb bag.  If you grandmaster 4 trades, you get 4 x 100% weight reduction, 1.2 lb bags.  etc etc.  We put the effort in it to get the skills, and the trophies, why not let us have the reward of a few extra bags.<br />
<br />
Help this happen.  While in game, type /feedback and let them know how you feel!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The problem lies in this...<br />
Lets say (HYPOTHETICALLY!!!!!!) SoE makes each trophy summon a different bag.<br />
IE Smithing = GM Smith's Bag, Fletching = GM Fletchers Bag, etc<br />
<br />
I already have the current bag on me so if they make the change I get 2 bags from my smithing trophy (the old generic bag AND the smithing bag). This since I have all 7 trophies I now get 8 free bags. While I would love to see this they would have to somehow get rid of the older generic bags.</div></div><hr />

They could make it No Rent :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mezzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No Rent Bags are just beyond Evil.. I dont go LD often.. but it seems I do when I actually use the No Rent from the trophy.  My last loss was:<br />
<br />
15 Bars of Wind Metal<br />
2 Crimson Robes of the Aldene<br />
1 Hiero Cloak<br />
<br />
Even with a great connection, you risk losing stuff in the no rent bags.  After that loss, I dont use them anymore.<br />

Oh yea.. My 15 Petitions, and 2 Emails went unanswered to get that stuff back.. So I forked out 400 k to replace the materials that belonged to the guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BAAAAAD Idea. I log in and dont read the patch (like 80%+ of the player base). I log after 48 hours of play, I lose all my items in the bag. BAAAAAAAD Idea ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Agosia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">somehow get rid of the older generic bags <br />
<br />
All they would have to do is have you destroy the old bag and turn in a new no rent bag that is tagged for the specific trophy you have. If you still have an old bag in your inventory you won't get a new one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sulkano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree that there should be some reward if you GM all the tradeskills...but not a bunch of extra bags. I think something along the lines of being able to combine all 7 GM trophies into some kind of master trophy (or whatever it would be called), with stats worth putting the effort into it, more approrpiate. I know that there would still be alchemy, poision, and tinkering left over...I have no good answer there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Okay, new solution for the old bag - CHANGE THE STATS. If they made the old grandmaster bag lose the 100% weight reduction, and in place made the trophies summon a trade specific one, people would get rid of the old one on their own free will.  They have never had a problem nerfing weapons that people already had, they should not have a problem with this.<br />
<br />
Or, they can just cut their losses, and let the people who in the past had an older bag keep it. They didn't take away the Mask of the Deciever from the non-rogues after they nerfed that, they realized their mistake and capped it without hurting those that had one already.  It really would not be tragic if we all got an 8th bag. (I also like the idea of creating a TRUE GM trophy, combine all 7 items in a summoned GM bag to create a new trophy, this one could in turn summon the bag that we all have, creating an 8th bag!.) <br />
<br />
(Or if you are me, a 9th useless one, as I have an alchemy trophy too!!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I personally would only support this if they ALSO make a required skill level on the combine...  something like 225.  Not that my &quot;support&quot; decides what SOE would do :)<br />
<br />
as it is right now with no required skill level... someone could just get lucky and make a bunch of trophies and get bags...  (unless I missed somewhere required levels being added)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Twistagain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/agree NGreth<br />
<br />
I want a separate bag for each trophy, but I also think the trophy should require a high skill to make. I don't think requiring 250 is necessary, but 225 does sound reasonable (I was thinking 230 myself when I was pondering it, but I'm not one to quarrel about 5 pts.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Haha, well I am glad I have the House Ogre's support for my multi bag proposition.  I am not opposed to a skill requirement, however, I think it would be unnessesary.  As it stands you can get a 100% wr bag for around 5k that is not lore. (Bag of the Tinkers) The likelihood of someone attempting multiple tradeskill trophies for a wr bag would be irrational at low swill as the cost would be significantly more than buying dragon bags or the before mentioned tinker bag.  <br />
<br />
The one thing about a required skill level would be that they could lower the trivial on the trophy.  As it sits, GM TS'ers have an extremely high failure rate on trophies because the trivial is set so that those without near GM status stand to fail often. If they required a 250 skill to attempt (this would be able to be lowered with a geerlok or such to 241 (?) the math escapes me, but the point is here) they could encourage us to make the trophies for the sake of a memento despite the crappy stats the put on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well... too many people and especially monks... that little bit of weight matters...<br />
<br />
Yes the money situation of probably having to combine 20 times or so each... *MAY* make up for it, but I am not sure about that...<br />
<br />
For monks 1.5 vs. 3.0 is a big difference... especially over up to 8 slots.<br />
<br />
I just bon't think we should give anyone an incentive, no matter how small... to just &quot;throw money&quot; at making trophies.  I think making these unique bags available gives that incentive to just throw money at it.  Make them actually work through tradeskills to get them.</div></div><hr />
