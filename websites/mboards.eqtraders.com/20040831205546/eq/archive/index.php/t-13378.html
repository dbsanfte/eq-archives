<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>scarbrowed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends on what you mean by best. Wu's is probably easier to make a large numbers of combines. You can start ribbons, silver then gold I think, but you will need a lot of dye components. A lot fewer subcombines, though.<br />
<br />
When I was at your level, I even threw in a few of the LoY summonable containers, just because they were easy. They are LORE, though, so you have to sell or destroy them.<br />

(I'm at work, so I can't spend time looking recipes up. But I think they were easy to find.)</div></div><hr />
