Cleric epic is a walk in the park minus the sol b hand in..compared to shawl.   Always a crowd..  SK &amp; Enc &amp; Necro we more painful.<br />
<br />
The SF shards can be annoying but RF can be 1  grouped by a decently equipped (Luclin- non VT) probaby group.  Been duoed by a Elem geared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sumamael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have soloed my cleric's epic except for the chardok king/ixibat and the final ragefire fight. You can even get into Solb hand-in spot solo if you are lucky and someone killed the fire giants or you are level 60+ with a nice big shaman damageshield potion.<br />
<br />
It can be done in a few days maximum a week depending on your luck and how many of your guildmates willing to help.</div></div><hr />
