<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My main will -eventually- get to 1750, so this question is about my baby alts.  They were created before NTCM and were intially intended to individually cover the gamut of tradeskills.  Now that they aren't needed for that purpose, some feel neglected and unloved :(<br />
<br />
It was easy to decide to stick with initial gameplan for some of them (i.e. my Erudite will go for tailoring in a few years, my Enchanter will go for Jewelcraft on the off chance I actually play her high enough to get JCM, my Barbarian will go for Smithing for the cultural, etc.)  But I am stuck on 3 of them:<br />
<br />
Froglock Shaman (Alchemy won't preculed a regular tradeskill)<br />
Human Monk (this human druid has already GMed smithing for cultural) and<br />
Half Elf Ranger <br />
<br />
I have given some thought to this, and it seems the Bristlebane Party Platter is about the only 'uber' tradeskilled item that is No Drop.  Is there any reason not to focus on having these alts GM baking so they can make their own Platter?  Remember - Auricula will get to 1750 and can (try to) supply them with any droppable tradeskilled items (armor/weapons/whatever) they may need.<br />
<br />
Edited to add:  I am not asking for advice on cheapest or fastest.  Those are not factors in my decision.  I am mostly asking if there is something cultural and/or no drop for those three characters that I am overlooking.</div></div><hr />

Well there is some discussion that there was supposed to be Froglok cultural smithing but it either didn't go live or is or is one of the great mysteries of Gukta.<br />
<br />
/em runs away and hides</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The best tradeskill?  Hmm, that's tough to say.  Honestly, other than the party platter, I can't think of anything that having a maxed tradeskill would cover, since you're already maxed in the things you'll need for anything tradeable.  I'd go with what's fun at this point.  There are ranger bows that are nodrop, so fletching is a natural choice for the ranger.  I'd also consider that it's possible that Froglok cultural will come to pass, since it's been written, so you may wish to wait on maxing anything with your shaman.  For the monk?  Party platters are HEAVY.  This might matter, unless you want to lay out for a WR bag.  It's also possible to (horrors!) play an alt with no tradeskills at all.  I know, it's heresy, but I tried it and it's quite fun just to have a character to grind with, and not have to worry about tradeskills.<br />
<br />
Good luck, and happy skilling!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dont mind me asking please........what is a Party Platter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thank you, Silverfish ... I did not realize there were no-drop bows.  Boy, am I gonna hate GMing Fletching for a second time (haven't even finished it the first time yet).  :giggle:<br />
<br />
Tejaye ... I went back and re-read what I had typed.  I am not sure where I lost you.  Bristlebanes Party Platter is a No-Drop item created with a high Baking tradeskill level.  Pretty sure the trivial is one of those 250+ things.  If you are looking for the recipe, it is in the database.</div></div><hr />
