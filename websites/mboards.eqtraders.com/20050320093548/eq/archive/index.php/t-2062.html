I am nearly done with the 8th shawl. I have the Qeynos 5th badge, I did the Sheild of Bane Warding quest. I camped my way through the Aegis of Life. I have done all the solo parts of the Epic. I crafted bits of my Earring of Solstice. All quests which actually gave me some useful gear. I am  also with my guild working a smith up to Grandmaster at the moment, about 40% through collecting the parts for the massive skill run.<br />
<br />
Where are the other quests that actually require some running around, which is single cleric can do a good part of and yeild something useful? Doesn't have to be tradeskill related. Only one come to mind at the moment: Spirit of Garzicor (the earring).<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions would be most welcome?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iannyen</div><div class="date">01-09-2003, 07:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Might want to look at the Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced magic manual.<br />
<br />
Don't know what your Range Item is, but the book has deacent stats, and some AC to boot.  The first part can be done almose exclusively n PoK, and the second part can be MQ'd.<br />
<br />
Check the Quest section of the main site for it.</div></div><hr />
