I've researched it here but just want to be absolutely sure so I don't waste either their time or my time.  I've broken it down to an Infused High Quality Ring section, an enchanted chain jointing section and royal temper section.  Thanks.<br />
<br />
1.  Infused High Quality Ring - velium ring, celestial temper, large brick of enchanted ore, smithy hammer<br />
<br />
Velium Ring - large brick velium, file, coldain velium temper<br />
Celestial Temper - purified water, blue diamond powder<br />
Blue Diamond Powder - blue diamond, jar of acid (place directly in kiln)<br />
Purified Water - 2 water flasks, celestial essence<br />
Celestial Essence - celestial solvent (vendor-sold), spell research component<br />
<br />
<br />
2.  Enchanted Chain Jointing - enchanted metal ring, file, smithy hammer, flask water<br />
<br />
Enchanted Metal Ring - large brick of enchanted ore, file, flask water<br />
Large brick of enchanted ore - large brick high quality ore - enchanted by an enchanter using the level 49 enchant steel spell<br />
<br />
3.  Royal temper - rain water, griffene's blood, 2 essence of sunlight<br />
<br />
Leather padding<br />
<br />
Appropriate plate mold<br />
<br />
Imbued gem (in this case the gem is jade for a troll warrior worshipping rallos zek)</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) ring recipes (velium rings, enchanted rings) produce 2 rings per set of ingredients.<br />
<br />
2) Jade is imbued solely by Ogre Shamen of Rallos Zek, as far as I know.<br />
<br />
3) 1-3 imbued rings per item.<br />
<br />
4) 40% success rate on most Fierce armor pieces.  You'll want to have 3x materials available to have a good chance at what you're looking for.  Personally, I've had as many as 7 failures in a row, and have heard of 10 or more.  Usually, though, 3 attempts will come up with something.<br />

If someone were to bring me those, I have tons of the rest already stockpiled, or can be bought in vast quantities in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
The only other thing that is not tivial to obtain is the enchant/imbues needed for the ore and jade.</div></div><hr />
