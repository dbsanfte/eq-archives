<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jackmoove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have searched all over..  the highest I can train is 170 (lvl 49 chanter).  What is the name of a trainer that can give me 200?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are level capped.<br />
<br />
You can't train to 200 until level 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqNichola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The cap for research is (level-15) * 5, btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">when you gain levels to be able to raise your skill more, you need to: a) go back to the Guildmaster you handed your note to originally, when you started your too (the guildmaster assistants.. ie, the ones you didn't hand your note too in your starting city, won't help you); b) go to the guildmaster of another city (again, it must be the one that a toons starting note is handed too); or c) any of the chanter guildmasters in PoK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the head of your guild in your starting city.  the pok gm are supposed to as well.  good luck.  many other trainers can only get you to 185 i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>llaffer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've never have seen one trainer stop training at one point and another trainer allowing continual training (other than level based caps).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">there was a thread a while ago about only being able to train to 185 even though they were a higher level.  they got the you know more than i do message.  THE guildmaster or pok gms can train to 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chantmon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I trained Research to 200. Cost a lot but was worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i am in the process of doing this.  not being able to farm specific components or even just wizard runes makes it hard to get enough of the right kinds for skilling use.</div></div><hr />
