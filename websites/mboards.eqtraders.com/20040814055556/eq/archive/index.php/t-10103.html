<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know how to set up a fishing macro so I could walk away from my computer while my character fishes? I know it can be done, I've seen others using them, but could never figure out how to do it myself. The main problem is the fact that you cannot fish after you have caught something and have it on your cursor. I'm sure this was put into the game for the express purpose of keeping you from making a macro for fishing. I knew a person who used something called a &quot;Nostromo&quot; in place of a mouse, she used it to teach languages with. It would constantly set off her &quot;teach language&quot; macro eliminating the need to mash you keyboard, making the whole process much less painful to go through. I'm guessing you would have to use some similar method, but if anyone knows of a way of doing it using in game commands only, please post it. Also, if anyone has experience using the Nostromo or anything similar please post that too.<br />
Thanks in advance for any help you can give.</div></div><hr />

right click drops it into my bags<br />

I check text every so often and pause during a commercial to dump the junk on the ground.</div></div><hr />

Right cick on what?  Your auto-equip inventory slot?  Or have you found a way to right click on something else and have it just drop in as though right clicked while looting?<br />
<br />
My fishing hot key isn't even a macro, it's just gotten from the ability buttons so that it pops up when available and down when I press the hot key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>drael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I goofed, left click drops into inventory - i leave mouse hovering over the auto drop area. Using the /doability command in a hotkey is the only eula legal macro I am aware of....that was what I was trying to communicate.</div></div><hr />
