<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aloura</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">its been a while since i've posted here, forgot my PW so had to make a new account.:( <br />
<br />
I did 80  gem studded chain combines today, I have JCM 3,  and normally these are similar to trivial items<br />
<br />
<br />
Before I got jcm I probably did around 700 of thse. (250 + gearlock).  My failure rate was around 45-50%<br />
<br />
<br />
I got JCM, and my failure rate went to on a BAD day 10%<br />
<br />
<br />
Today I did 80 chains, and failed 47 of them.  Perhaps it was just a very very very very bad day, but this is exceptionally unusual. I'm  250 in  5 skills,  and close to 250 in the others. I'm familiar with the RNG, and how a bad luck streek can go.  I've been shafted by it badly in the past (failed 6th shawl 13 times, back in velious days when it was hard). <br />
<br />
<br />
JCM is supposed to reduce failures by 50%.  It did seem to be &quot;to&quot; effective for what it was called in the past.(meaning it helped more than I think it should have, but then it was 18 aa's)  But now it seems to be having no effect at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Has anyone else had decent sized (40+) runs lately that have JCM 3, and can 2nd the thought that JCM may be broken?  There was someone else in serverwide today saying the same thing, this is why I'm curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aloura</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I spoke with GM Uhyre (rallos server gm) about the issue.  He made an enchanter, gave it the AA's,  250 jc, and grandmasters eyeglass.<br />
<br />
He did a large test run and said he saw what I was saying regarding the lack of difference ATM between JCM, and no JCM.  He said he would report his finding to the dev's and suggested that I /bug the issue.<br />
<br />
He also suggested I avoid working on this skill until the issue is resolved and perhaps work on another skill. <br />
<br />
I do the chains for free for people because its so expencive to fail them,  I guess that means my work load will be ligthenend for a while =P<br />
<br />
<br />
I suggest the rest of you either avoid important high end JC combines for a bit, or  do your own tests and /bug it if /when you find similar results.  <br />
<br />
Please note that less than 60 combines is a very poor sized test bed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lerana Raynefeather</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">its really messed up i just failed 6 of 11 gem chains and since getting JCM 3 the WORST i have ever had is 3 fails of 20 and usually  1 or 0. something is definately wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Iumiena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">JCM2 and I made about 30-40 chains with 0 failures. Either I'm very lucky or they fixed the bug and made it bugged the other way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Asmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd suggest you buy a lottery ticket ;) <br />
<br />
Had a friend do 20 gemstudded chain combines, 250jc jcm3, 7 successes 13 failures. When he did chains for himself(prior to the patch) he said he had never failed any. So i'd say it definitely looks broken still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gappy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">averaging 5 out of 20 on gem studded chains :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Okay.  The warning has been passed.   If you have further problems with Jewelcraft Mastery, you should report the problem via /bug (for issues relating to how it works/doesn't work) or feedback (for issues not related to software-implementation) in EQ or the EQLive web site. <br />
<br />
Thank you,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>tawnos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Any new word on this? My tailoring is on hold until i can make chains for a reasonable cost.  I'm hoping someone has heard something from a gm about whether it is fixed or when it will be fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>PinyonTreedotter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My guess is no fix will be available until after LDoN.<br />
<br />
IF the fix was a simple, &quot;oops, forgot the JCM mod in the subroutine,&quot; we might see it with LDoN.  Otherwise, with all the patches that are likely with LDoN, it will be some time.  I hope it is the former.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ChanterCrafter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This problem is most noticeable in JC, but is also occuring with other tradeskills.<br />
<br />
The high failure rate seems inconsistent, as some people are not suffering it, while many others are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>mezmera</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Had my own run in the the Gem studded Chains.  Week previous had a fairly steading sucess rate with JCM3 and 250 skill.  Fast forward to this week, barely 50 percent.  I'll definalty be one of those saving my crafting supplies until this problem has been addressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I am 2 sucess and 5 failures on BloodMetal earings, prior to getting to 250 or around the Augest patch I was 90percent plus on such combines. <br />
<br />
I did resonable on Valor Rings and BD earings today (20ish percent failures). I did 1 of 3 on the ears today. (well last night). I was 1 of 4 prior.<br />
<br />
I have 250 JC Skill, eyeglass and the 18AA JCM. I cast overwhelming spledor, VoQ and intelectual superority on myself prior to combines.<br />
<br />
What is other peoples experience so far?<br />
<br />
Try and be spicific as possible, date you did it, spells that were on you, and items you used that effect success, and your JC skill level and your JCM level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Belanar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">250 skill, JCM2, buffs are irrelevant to combine successes, failed 3 of 4 fire emblem combines on Thursday Sept 12th.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Elipson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The failures boggle me. I have done in the area of 15 bloodmetal earring with zero fizzles. About 10 valor rings and only 1 fizzle. I have also done 5 earth rings with 1 success and 1 air ring also failed. Emblems I also don't fail much on, so I am starting to think maybe they didn't screw up JCM but rather the triv on recipies?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Lairelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Tonight, I was using my husband's enchanter to make two Electrified Earrings of Tempest for a twink, and failed both combines.. He'd never failed any of them before, and up until about a week and a half ago had great success rates with everything, even eplanar jewelery.  He has 250JC+trophy, and JCM3.  In the past week he's failed multiple PoAir rings (made close to 20 in a row, then failed about 50% recently), same sort of statistics with other PoP jewelry items too(emblems, earth rings, etc).  Our tradeskillers in the guild are all agreed that something was broken or nerfed and needs to be changed back to how it used to be.  These failure rates are ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ilona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">If you don't have JCM skill, it is semi-common to fail 9 of 10 gem studded chains.  you should also occasionally get 9 of 10 successes.<br />
<br />
If the success rate on PoP jewelry is about 50% without AA points, then at JCM3 (which adds 50% to success rate) then realistically you should be getting 50%+(50%*.5)=75% success rate in all.  Getting &gt;90% success shows the AA skill was implemented incorrectly to start with, though whatever &quot;fix&quot; has been put in recently may well be a little drastic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>tawnos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Its a matter of semantics as to how it should work based upon the description which says something like 'This ability reduces the chance of failing any jewel craft combinations by 10, 25, and 50 percent.'  In the case of a 50% failure rate combine, this could either be interpreted to mean it halves the 50% failure rate (ie 50% fail / 2 = 25% failure rate) or it decreases the failure rate by 50% (ie 50% fail - 50% = 0% failure rate).  Maybe there was a disconnect in what the designers intended and what the people who wrote the code understood.  For now, though, jcm seems to do absolutely nothing but eat up 18 aa which is hopefully not 'working as intended'.  SOE picked a rather inconvient time to make everquest stable as there haven't been many patches recently to give them a chance to fix jcm.  I just hope they know it is broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Elipson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I've posted on the developers corner, but as per Sony's normal laws, I have heard or seen nothing yet. This annoys me because I have tried over and over to check if they know it's broken via GMs, lead GMs, forums etc and I have yet to have it confirmed as an issue.</div></div><hr />

I agree, I think everyone knew the AA was working a little too well. (meaning it was working better than it's description said it would). However I doubt they were trying to fix it, sounds like they just broke it period. At this point all data points to the hypothesis that the skill is not doing anything at all, neither helping nor hurting just absorbing AAs.</div></div><hr />
