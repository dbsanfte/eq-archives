<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lyron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else hear haout this?  It's all over the main page at Caster's Realm (http://eq.crgaming.com) .  Apparently, they have a new class in the files on Test.  It is also in the new character creation screen on Test, but you cannot select it.<br />
<br />
The class is supposedly called Berserker, and seems to be limited to Human, Vah Shir, Ogre, Troll, and Barbarian. The races are merely informed speculation, based on the fact that sometimes a blank window pops up and demands that you click &quot;OK&quot; when you select these races.  To get this to occur, you must select another race first, and then choose a class that the race you want to test cannot be.  (For example, act like you were going to create a half-elf bard, then switch to ogre.)  The creation utility will then try to randomly assign you a profession, except with the aforementioned races, sometimes it will fail, and you will get the pop-up box, presumably because the utility tried to assign the Berserker profession. It is difficult, but possible, to get this effect when testing humans, since they can be so many different classes.  It's rather easy to get the effect with the other races.<br />
<br />
The name seems to imply a pure melee class that can inflict more melee damage, but possibly not take as much damage as, or perhaps has lower AC than, a warrior.  I don't think warriors, rogues or monks are gonna care for this much....<br />
<br />
Standard disclaimer: As with all things on test, it's possible that this will not go live, and since SOE hasn't even mentioned it or started putting Berserkers on gear, like they did in perparation for the Beastlord class, it is likely that it will be a while in coming.  Also, it's possible that this is merely for internal use, for EQII testing, or is a joke by SOE staffers, and is never supposed to be implemented.<br />

You know, I thought the same thing, since dwarfs are basically a  melee race.  *shrug* SOE's done some nutty things when assigning classes and races before though.  I mean, witness the non-existence, until recently, of gnome paladins and SK's, and halfling rangers (halfling paladins there was actually sort of a reason for, since the cleric halfling god is Bristlebane, who seems to be incompatible with paladins).  Then witness that frogloks can't be beastlords, like EVERY OTHER shaman race, but CAN be wizards, but again can't be enchanters or magicians.  (I know the wizzie stuff is based on Guk, yes, but it still seems nutty.)  I'm just saying, not the way I would've done it.</div></div><hr />

dwarf berserkers please.  unless they have to stay at least medium size for something?</div></div><hr />

I was assuming it was more along the lines of shamanistic races, rather than &quot;melee&quot; races.  &quot;As clerics (civilized) are to shaman (tribal), warriors (civilized) are to berserkers (tribal)&quot; was my logic.  Humans get berserker, although they have no shamans, and iksars do not, although they do have shamans, so its not perfect, but it still seems 'reasonable' to me.<br />
<br />
Any why would you define dwarves as a &quot;melee race&quot;?  We can be warriors, paladins, rogues (3 melee) and clerics .  Other races, such as gnomes, can be warriors, paladins, shadowknights, rogues (4 melee), as well as clerics and all int casters.  Halflings can be what, warriors, paladins, rangers, rogues (4 melee) and clerics, druids.  So both gnomes and halflings have more potential melee classes than dwarves, but dwarves get designated as melee but the other two don't? Sure, they're more &quot;culturally&quot; melee, but 'simple' RP explanations for class distribution got thrown out the window by SoE long ago (for examples, see: halfling paladins, gnome paladins/sks...).<br />
<br />
Sure, if I were ever to roll a berserker I'd go dwarf if it were an option, but it just doesn't seem to follow the pattern of the other races.</div></div><hr />

Maybe I'll two-box a monk when my enchanter gets Project Illusion....</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is possibly the best idea to date.<br />
<br />
I must now go get a few levels, a bunch of AA, and a second PC.<br />

<br />
But Project Illusion will be lost when the person zones, correct?  The Perm. Illusion part is only for illusions cast on yourself?<br />

Oh, then there's the fun I can have once I get Dire Charm and use my Chokadai Vocal Chords (effect: Voice Graft) on my new pets.  I've already charmed Dorn B'dynn in N.Ro and made him sing the Teapot song.  I'll have to head to CB next and get the King.<br />
<br />
And then maybe they'll have that Doppleganger spell working correctly so I can impersonate guards.<br />
<br />
I love being a 'chanter!</div></div><hr />

As far as dwards being a melee race, at least compared to halflings and gnomes, 3/4 of dwarf classes are melee classes, compared to 4/6 of halfling classes and 4/9 of gnome classes.  But what i was really referring to is the fact that both dwarf stamina and strength are (significantly) above that of a human, and both halfings and gnomes are below ( halfings do have equal stamina). This makes dwarves ideal for melee applications, and halfings and gnomes somewhat less so (although halfling rogues and rangers seem to do fine.)  Just think about how many of each race playing each class you've seen; people playing gnomes tend to play casters, and people playing halflings tend to play druids (although rogues and clerics are also popular).  I'm not saying that other class combos are bad, just that a lot of EQ players choose races that have natural fortes that complement  the class they choose.</div></div><hr />
