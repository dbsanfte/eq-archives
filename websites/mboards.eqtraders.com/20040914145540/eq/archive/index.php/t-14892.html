<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Clarine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, <br />
<br />
    I am a Bard(ess) and I am used to exchange singing and hunting techniques on EQdiva. I found a technique for farming that can be used by other classes as well, nothing exceptional but  as I didn't see it elsewhere and people in game didn't know it, I thought I would start a thread here on Farming Techniques (Of course you should still consider buying your spiderling silks and other basic ingredients from newbies, but sometime, you it takes more time to find the newbies than to farm the items...)<br />
<br />
   My Old Technique:  AOE (Array Of Effect) <br />
I just run fast, attacking some (preferrably social) greeny mobs in groups, when I have enough I go to a corner and launch my AOE songs, then loot. And try to catch the eventual running ones.<br />
<br />
  New Technique: Pet Hunter<br />
I tried to give my (charmed) pet a generic command<br />
&quot;\pet attack a moss snake&quot;, and it worked: the pet try to find a moss snake and attack it!<br />
Now it wasn't difficult to define a macro with (up to) 5 such specific commands corresponding to the various animals you want to hunt, and to bind a movement key to this macro. Now in areas dense in desired mobs, I spend my time just looting. In zone not so dense at least we are two hunting, and often the pet attack before I even see the mob, when it is behind a tree or a mound, or to far or too well hidden for me to find.<br />
<br />
&quot;Voila&quot;. It is not much but Mobs (and Pets) are much better hunters than me (at least as long as I don't have tracking) and this new technique has been my joy those two last days. If there are even better techniques, I would be glad to learn about them!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KanadWinterstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Will work until you lose sight of your pet, if you never see the corpse then you never get the loot :/<br />
<br />
I do all my farming on a ranger, lucky to have a 65 ep geared ranger for a roommate I guess. It still sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Clarine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well: us Bardies have a song to find corpses. <br />
such that if you don't have a target, it points to any corpse.<br />
<br />
But I seldom need to use it: the pet is coming back after his fight, <br />
if I missed the direction he went I recover it by observing where he comes from when he comes back.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if the density is high I don't mind losing a few corpses,<br />
and if the density is low, while I am looking for the corpse my pet is looking for another target. If I am paying enough attention, both tasks equilibrate themselves. (OK, tracking is probably better, I can't wait my level 35!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Clarine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh!, and I forgot:<br />
<br />
the advantage we have, ench and bards, is that instead of &quot;losing&quot; our pet, the charm break and the former pet comes back to us angry. Hence you can always deduce the direction he was when breaking the charm.<br />

Speaking as a chanter.......... having a seriously p'ed off ex-pet come raging out of the woods at you is not always such a great advantage. I really looking forward to the time when I get my permanent charm AA to stop all that nonsense. =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naeadiene Needsamap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hehe Bards can afford to get hit a great deal more than Enchanters can.</div></div><hr />

Well, remember that we're discussing farming, and moss snakes are green to most of us, so one would hope you're not charming a hill giant to do your dirty work.  Although, that would have the advantage of assisting with corpse tracking, since you'd be able to see his ugly self from halfway across the zone...<br />

<br />
LOL<br />
I was in WC for bears yesterday, was hoping to find a Giant to help...<br />
<br />
I found a small gnome  blue to me (at 31) who obligedly fetched me some bears/puma/tigers for my tailoring.<br />
<br />
I think I will try with a mammoth in EverFrost though: more spiderlings and bears there, and the mammoth will certainly show from far away :idea:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't be such a wuss - show some flair.<br />
<br />
You use Hill Giants for spiders but it's dragons for moss snakes<br />
<br />
(I wish) ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gaell Stormracer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just to be picky, AoE = Area of Effect.<br />
<br />
My favourite technique for farming Substances in Hollowshade Moor is to use PBAoE (point blank area of effect) nukes after aggroing 8-10 of the mobs onto me - wearing a fungi tunic, boots of stability, and having a lot of regen buffs/spells helps avoid an embarrasing corpse retrieval. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hilbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Inbetween clearing out all the evil vile undead shadows in Twilight Sea I like to take side trips over to Elemental Island and round up every elemental on the island. This usually takes me at least 10 minutes or so but it is so worth it to turn around and see about 40 mobs coming ripping towards you all with mayhem in their eyes. I run them upto the castle and wedge myself into and outside corner waiting for my friends to appear. When I can see them cleary I start catastrophy and hope to get it off as the bulk of them reaches me. Had a few close calls but it can be a very rewarding way of getting some tradeskill items I value (drops of mercury and lavastones in particular).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Clarine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yesterday I was in Everfrost to hunt bears and spiderlings with a pet hunting for me.<br />
<br />
I stopped in Hallas to work some tradeskills and finally managed to blacksmyth a pot, then to use it to cook rabbit stew and vegetable soup, gaining  some 5 points in a few mns!<br />
<br />
I went back to Everfrost to farm, and celebrated a bit with some hot drinks.<br />
It was the first alcohol I was drinking, while my pet (one of the three nasty skels with the sad story in three pages) was going on and on killing bears and spiderling. It got a bit difficult to follow him, but was great fun to try to catch even a dead spiderling when my head was sooooo rolling :cheers: <br />
<br />
A Question for you though: I wanted to see my character from over, changing the camera views, but couldn't. Was it because I was drunk, or beause of the recent patch?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I hope I won't have a headache when I will log back, and I will go fetch a mammoth to do the same  again. <br />
<br />
Cheera !:wave:</div></div><hr />

Huh, you learn something new everyday. Neat. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Clarine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You can't change camera views while drunk. <br />
<br />
Huh. Is it a bug, or is it wanted? (An undocumented feature) :confused: <br />
<br />
It sounds a pity for those wedding nights when everybody is partying and one wants to take a screeshot.... :( <br />
<br />
Well it just means that the photograph shouldn't drink ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Being unable to use an external camera view whilst drunk is working as intended. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ixiola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I do the PBAOE trick too with my cleric and a tank friend.  Tank grabs about 20 - 30 mobs in hollowshade, and brings them back when he's getting low on HPs.  I cast a heal over time on him to keep him from dropping, then cast 1 or 2 AE nukes to kill the lot.  I counted like 31 hits from one of my casts.)  I then med to full while he goes and gets the next set of victims.<br />
<br />
It's actually pretty enteraining watching a hord of sonic wolves flowing around the area as they follow the tank.  Looks like a colony of ants who just got invited to a picnic.</div></div><hr />
