<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArrakeenNaedShoj</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My skill is currently 193,(modified 203 with gearlock) and I have had a 95% success rate so far on my own combines and those for freinds on the old Imbued/Enchanted cultural Chain/Plate. <br />
<br />
This is great armor for anyone unable to get velious or better armor, and much of it rivals old hate/fear/kunark gear for some classes. I know for Hielf/Halfelf/Woodelf Clerics/Bards/Paladins/Druids there is no better &quot;twink&quot; armor in the game save Uber drops. <br />
<br />
I am more than happy to do combines on this armor for free provided that you bring me ALL the components neccessarry for the final combine. <br />
<br />
If you have any questions about the necessarry components and how/where to farm them Feel free to send me a tell or check Here (http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_smithing_high_elf.htm) and For stats on the various peices check Here (http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/smithing_stats_highelf.htm)<br />
<br />
I am still wearing some of this stuff at 54 as a cleric, and many of the pieces just can't be beaten for the ease of aquiring, so check it out today.<br />
<br />
PS I am also willing to do any other smithing combine for you if I have time, but understand that many of the more difficult peices will have extremely low success rates. (5% or so on all &gt;250 trivial items.)</div></div><hr />
