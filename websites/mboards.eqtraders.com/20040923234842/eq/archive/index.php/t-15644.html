<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Because I currently only have about half a dozen unfinished EQ projects in the works, I figured I ought to start another. :upsidwn: <br />
 <br />
I want to create a list of all the keys in EQ. I mean only keys that are some kind of tangible item that allow you to click somewhere on something to get to somewhere else that is not accessible without the key. I don't want flags that do not involve an actual item that serves as the key. I want to include keys that can be added to the keyring and then deleted, so long as there was originally an actual key. Keys that do not actually look like keys (that look like bracelets or rings or idols) are still keys. <br />
 <br />
The info I want is the zone that contains the &quot;lock&quot; (the portal, door, or whatever you will click with the key), where it takes you to, if the key is no rent and if not if it's tradeable, the keys' names, and whether they fit on the keyring.<br />
<br />

Plane of Tactics - alt access key from PoTranquility, &quot;Completed Diaku Emblem&quot; (keyring)  <br />
<br />
I'm not sure if this is relevant or not...<br />
<br />
The completed emblem isn't a key. Sort of.<br />
<br />
When you hand in the 4 no drop, lore, otherwise identical quarters of a diaku emblem (no, it's not annoying looting them, why do you ask), you get the completed emblem back, *but* the entire group that does the handin is flagged, so you don't actally need the key to enter tactics, since only 1 person has it and up to 6 are flagged.<br />
<br />
Your keyring shows that you can enter tactics as a Diaku.</div></div><hr />

<br />
None go on the keyring (more's the pity)<br />
<br />
Blackburrow - at least one locked door, does it have a key?<br />
Nope - it's just there to make you take a longer route to run to zone. ;)<br />
<br />
Najena<br />

Plane of Air (Eryslai the Kingdom of Wind) has a &quot;key&quot; opening the rainbow leading to Xegony's island. Takes 4 essences from the avatars in the zone, combined in a quest container. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wow, this is great! :)  Updated to here.  I do want keys that don't fit on the keyring, as well as those that do.  Sorry, my wording in my original post wasn't entirely clear on that.<br />
<br />
I'm confused about the keys with &quot;Veeshan&quot; in the name.  They are:<br />
Key of Veeshan (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=20884)<br />
Key to Veeshan's Peak (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=20602)<br />
Veeshan's Key (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=20919)<br />
Veeshan's Key (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=20918)<br />
<br />
Both named &quot;Veeshan's Key&quot; are tied in Lucy to the Key Master in PoSky.  But it's possible that Lucy made that connection based on item names alone and not from each of those different items coming from the Key Master.  Could one of them be the version quested with Sirran and the other the one bought off the Key Master?  Or maybe for some reason the original item was removed from the game (but someone still has one on them) and the second is the replacement?<br />
<br />
Then, most sources list the key that gets you into Veeshan's Peak as the &quot;Key of Veeshan&quot;.  But an item called &quot;Key to Veeshan's Peak&quot; does exist in Lucy.  But it's not no drop, which is...strange.  If the &quot;Key of Veeshan&quot; really is the key to VP, then what is the key to get into the quest hall in PoSky?  Several sources list that as &quot;Key of Veeshan&quot;.  If it is the key to both PoSky and VP...that'd be even stranger.<br />
<br />
Oh, and for the record, the PoSky keys weren't no rent, at least not within the last few years.  They just poofed whenever you left the zone.  If you camped there and came back much later, they'd still be on you.  This has changed though, and you can keep the keys permanently now.  Not sure if they fit on the keyring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont even think theres a key to this. Ive asked about it before on the Rangers Glade, cause reavers drop Ranger epic items, and everyone concurred theres no key to this.. you HAVE to have a rogue to pick it. Lord Grimrose, when you say the reaver elevator key doesn't go on the keyring, where do you have that information from?  I'm assuming you or someone you know has the key?  Can you get the name of it, so we can track it down?  I'm not sure how to reconcile these two statements.  <br />
<br />
In looking through Illia's I see a statement here (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=98) that &quot;I know Neh Ashiir drops a key that works for the elevator. Its called &quot;Key of Torsis&quot;. Its No Rent btw.&quot;  The same thing is repeated by a couple other people.  Then there's this contradiction: &quot;the key that Neh `Ashiir drops Does not opperate the lift it is no rent but does not opeate the lift we ahd killed her 2 times for part of chanter epic to get some other mob to spawn&quot;<br />
<br />
Then this, which confuses me even further: &quot;The Captain of the Guards drops the key to the Reaver Castle but not to the Elevator.  I have the key. I know the mob on the last platform atop the walkways drops the no rent key to the Reavers but you still need a Rogue to pick the lock of that second door to get to him. &quot;  Maybe I don't know the layout of CoM well enough to understand that one.<br />
<br />
Lucy shows Neh dropping the key.  Neh's entry in Illia's has more mentions of this key being for the elevator.  <br />
<br />
Is there anyone who has personally looted a Key of Torsis off of Neh and tried it on the elevator?  Did it work?  Might need to cast the net for this question on a few other boards. :)<br />
<br />
Huge thanks to everyone who's offered info so far!  This is marvelous!<br />

High Keep - to ?, &quot;H.K. 401&quot;<br />

<br />
The Freeport bank door doesn't open; apparently only GM's can get in there.  It's apparently the room where you got summoned if you were a bad boy, in the old days.<br />
<br />
H.K. 401 and its companion, H.K. 102, are both quest items.  You hand them in to the banker's assistant to &quot;open the associated safety deposit box&quot; and get the contents for your quest.  They don't open any actual doors.</div></div><hr />

Allakhazam lists H.K. 401 as a quest item for the High Guard Battlestaff, though the quest is marked incomplete.  It doesn't list any other use for the key.  H.K. 401 identifies as Highkeep Strongbox Key#401, which makes it seem unlikely that it's a key to a door.<br />
<br />
The Silent Watch Shield quest (which Alla's lists as Princess Lenya (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=96)) only mentions &quot;the key to the Royal Suite on the 3rd floor, a nodrop lore item.&quot;  It doesn't list the name.  It would be worth investigating whether this is in fact the right key.<br />
<br />
There is an item in Lucy called &quot;H.K. 106&quot; which identifies as &quot;Highkeep Strongbox 106&quot;.  Lucy lists the item type as &quot;Keyv2&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Misc&quot; for the other H.K. keys.  Maybe this item is different?<br />
<br />
At any rate, H. K. 102 is most definitely a quest item in the paladin SoulFire quest.</div></div><hr />

Kyros...  Take a look at my Paladin's Magelo.  In my bank... in the third box down of the second row (a deluxe toolkit), you'll find a Silent Watch Shield (the reward of the quest).  In the second box down of the second row (a trader's satchel), you'll find a H.K. 401 with a key icon.<br />
<br />
Trust me, I did the quest... I know what I'm talking about.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Odd.  Then either the same item is used for two quests (unlikely) or else Alla's has their info mixed up somewhere.<br />
<br />
It's also unusual that the item lore is wrong.<br />
<br />
I've been looking around for a new time waster since I'm almost done with tradeskills.  I'll try running the Battlestaff quest and see how far I can get with it.</div></div><hr />

Updated to here.  Also put a note in the EQ Beastlords forum letting them know we've got an effort going here too.  I thieved what information of theirs fit what I'm looking for.  They're tracking some flags and other intangible keys, so they're not doing exactly the same thing, but nearly so.</div></div><hr />
