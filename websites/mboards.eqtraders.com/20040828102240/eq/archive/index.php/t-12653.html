<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>iasmin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i Know that Magelo has had some troubles lately with server issues, but it's never failed to load for me. Now I've been getting days of &quot;connection refused&quot; messages regardless of where I try from. Anyone else having trouble connecting? Anyone confirm that they can still access the site?</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I can only hope.  I signed up over the Thanksgiving weekend - nice timing...  I dont think I've even had 25% uptime since shelling out for the premium membership.  Ug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>iasmin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As of 1pm (eastern daylight savings time) I could access Magelo again. I too joined recently, just as a patch came out. Jelan seems incredibly sincere in his frustration over all the problems. I bet he's been beating his head against the wall. I'm willing to tough it out and wait a little longer. Magelo is a good enough service for what I want to do with it that 12$ doesn't seem like enough. Your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kentarre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, I'm not too upset, really, just a little annoyed...  But he really is working hard, I can see that, and as long as I can get my fix again, we're all good :D</div></div><hr />

Gotta love 64 bits system... It looks like that the filesystem i choosed for the database server (XFS) is not reliable under amd64, i will have to re install the server, the website should be online within 24 hours.<br />
Sorry for the inconvenience, be sure i am working hard on this to bring magelo back online as soon as possible.<br />

Been that way all day long, some of yesterday.  I guess downtime is a bit longer than expected.</div></div><hr />
