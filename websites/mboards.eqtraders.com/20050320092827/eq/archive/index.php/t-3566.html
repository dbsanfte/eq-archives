<br />
Heck, at first they didn't even want it to be here, called us a CHEAT site...<br />
<br />
Now SOE at least tolerates us :)<br />
<br />
You can also try mailing Alan Vancuvering... but I am not sure...of his email, it is semi public someonewhere on EQ's sites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quinner Sparrowhawk</div><div class="date">02-14-2003, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">:shock: They dared to call this a cheat site?  :evil: This is the most informative and user friendly fansite out of all the sites out there! SOE is just mad because you don't put up pop-up advertisements. And that the people who post here know more about tradeskills (and some other aspects of the game) then most of the SOE EQ employees. <br />
<br />
A note to those knowledgeable SOE employees who read through the posts on these boards - You should consider giving this site official sanction. Fansites are not a threat to the game but rather a resource to be cultivated and used. Regular posts by official SOE employees (Like Absor) help to alleviate angst and confusion on certain topics and can generate responses for solutions to problems faster and cheaper than paying QA to do it.<br />
<br />
And an official apology to DenMom is in order!</div></div><hr />

<br />
EQ Traders has been something of a godsend to the various tradeskill developers (and occasionally, I'm sure, a nightmare). <br />
<br />
And many times people from SoE actually do come here and post.  Really. <br />
