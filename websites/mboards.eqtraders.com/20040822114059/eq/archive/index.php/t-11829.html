<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Elipson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I am still seeing close to no effect with this AA even after the patch. Gem studded chains especially have close to zero improvement. Normal at 250 is about 50% sucess. With all 18AAs into JCM I get about 60-70% success and I've even been so low as 50% ( I make 40 at a time and have since last patch made at least 200+ chains )<br />
<br />
Anybody else see little diffrence?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I only have JCM 1, and my numbers on Gem Studded Chains are right about dead on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ayaxi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have JCM3 as well, and I have noticed a decrease in successful combines  since I spent the AAs. I petitioned it as a bug, but havent heard anything else about it as of yet, probably wont.  I have made 10 attempts on that darn Gallant ring of Valor and only succeeded 4 times. and according to this website that combine is trivial at 250, not 250+ like some of the other things. I have simply refused to do anymore of those rings. Anyway, I guess thats what Im gonna have to start doing with all JC stuff becuz I really just feel too bad when I blow someones components.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">JCM 3 is supposed to give you a 50% reduction in failure rate, so, for items that normally have a 50% failure rate, that should become a 25% failure rate.<br />
<br />
Before they messed with it, they had JCM 3 subtract 50% from the failure rate, basically making anything with a 50% or lower failure rate a no fail combine.  When they tried to fix it, they messed it up pretty bad.  Since then, in theory, they have fixed it.<br />
<br />
The OP statse that he has seen his success rate go up from 50% to 60% to 70% after getting JCM 3.  JCM 3 is supposed to reduce failures by 50%.  So, that should reduce failure rate from 50% to 25%, or increase success rate to 75%, which is higher than the OP has seen, but, how large a sample size are we talking about?<br />
<br />
Not having any enchanter high enough to have any AAs I have no actual experience with it, and I only recently got Alchemy Mastery 1, and have not done enough combines to have any idea as to it's effect.</div></div><hr />
