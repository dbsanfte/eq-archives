<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darkchild</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is a right page the one that curves to the right or the one that's sorta straight?  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ilona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Take a piece of paper and tear it in half.  The one you have in your left hand is straight on the left and jagged on the right... that is the left half.  The one you have in your right hand is jagged on the left and straight on the right... that is the right half.<br />
<br />
Similarly in EQ :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Take a rock.. put it in your left pants pocket... <br />
<br />
If the rock lines up with the smooth edge of the page.. then the page is a &quot;left&quot; side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>vmissouril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you got to be kidding me.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">but there are -three- smooth sides on a sheet torn in &quot;half&quot;... <br />
<br />
Top, Bottom and either left or right (if torn from top to bottom)<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
Left, Right and either top or bottom (if torn from left to right)<br />
<br />
I keep meaning to get a screenshot of the different paper icons, and plugging them into a simple page writeup.<br />
<br />
We have different paper items:<br />
<br />
Whole Page w/ Writing (sometimes Quest Items)<br />
Whole Page w/o Writing (Faded)<br />
Half Page with Jagged Left edge (Right Page)<br />
Half Page with Jagged Right edge (Left Page)<br />
Scroll that is rolled up (Some Newer Research paper)<br />
<br />
Note the Scroll is same icon as used for actual Spells, Sketches, Patterns, and maybe even some in-game notes &quot;storyline content&quot; items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The scroll icon items, as far as research components, are the words.. and writ of quellious (i assume just to confuse people).. for post 50 spells.  Words for sub 50 spells are the whole page with writing.<br />
<br />
The pages without writing (same as the parchment icon), called &quot;faded,&quot; are either velishouls or salis pages... once these are combined the first time, then you can tell which page, or piece of page you have.<br />
<br />
The half pages are the &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; pages, and are called that on which side of the page it is if you were looking at a piece of paper torn in two...as Ilona mentioned.  It really is as simple as remembering which of our hands is left, and which is right (go through basic training, and forget once which hand is which.. and you will actually be carrying a rock in one of your pockets).<br />
<br />
There are a few words and pages that are whole pages, and have a torn look to the bottom... there is no real reason for this other than it's an alternate icon for a page.  These all are full size.. so easily seen as a full page.<br />
<br />
Sometimes misunderstandings come about because while we have a huge graphic game, icons seems to be the last concern, and they are used over and over on innumerable things, with little diversity, and sometimes with little consistancy.</div></div><hr />
