<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings All,<br />
<br />
As a lark, I applied to be a GoD beta tester last night and to my surprise, I got accepted.  :shocked:<br />
<br />
I would like to focus on testing new tradeskill recipes during the beta trial period.  Has anyone here been a beta tester for past EQ expansions and have any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Should I just /betabuff a character to 65 and run around hailing NPCs?  Or have one or more of my characters copied over to the beta server?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Serenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would suggest  copying characters over.  Beta buff actually copies someone's character that was chosen as the 'default' for the level (inc of 5).  If you /beta buff your brand new female barbarian warrior to 65, you will find that you have a male ogre for instance.  And there's no guarantee that your new beta buff will, or will not, have raised the various tradeskills.  Copying your own characters gives more control.<br />
<br />
Note, I was in LDoN beta.  I've been accepted into GoD, but haven't logged in yet, so I'm going off of how the beta buff worked for LDoN.</div></div><hr />

look for player made weapons for me.  and something for tailoring or brewing.  can't tell us until nda is lifted by would be nice to have advanced scouting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
1)  Betabuffs may or may not have decent tradeskills.<br />
2)  If you're going to be grouping, people tend to avoid betabuffed folks like the plague.<br />

I'm so grumpy that I missed open enrollment.   So grumpy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Progress Report for 8-Jan-2004<br />
<br />
I downloaded the beta patcher zip file yesterday evening after I got home from work.  I unzipped the file into my EQ directory and started the patcher.  It did a quick file scan and started downloading new zone data files.  I assume traffic was very heavy since it estimated that the files would take approximately eight hours to download.<br />
<br />
The download finished around 4:30 am this morning.  I ran the Test patcher when I got up and it took about ten minutes to download some additional files.  I logged onto Test and selected the Beta server.  The Berserker class was not available for selection so I created a wood elf druid since I have the most experience with druids.  My new character popped into the Kelethin druid's guild.<br />
<br />
At that point, I camped and went to work... where I'm... errrr... working!  Yes, that's my story and I'm sticking to it!<br />
<br />
So far, everything has gone very smoothly.  Tonight I will play with /betabuff and actually attempt to do some exploring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>sumamael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Do the copy command (was it /beta?) as soon as you can on your main char/home server. It might take a while till it gets copied over.<br />
<br />
Lilosh is right, /betabuffed chars are usually being avoided in pick up groups tho I only encountered this phenomenon in level 65 groups.<br />
<br />
Good idea to look out for developer made groups (they usually make serverwide requests for players in the appropriate level range). These were my most fun experiences of my LDoN beta time. (remember how to behave tho!)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mahlig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">errr...I am in the Beta for this as well.  The Berserker class is available but there is a trick to it (or so say my level 2 and 5 berserkers).  I am not sure what I can say on the matter, so I will just say that there is a trick and you will probably need to ask on the Beta server.  You can look for me as one of the following and I will tell you:<br />
<br />
Burlaap (5 Berserker)<br />
Mahlig (2 Warrior)<br />
Yudaman (2 Berserker)<br />
<br />
I also betabuffed 2 characters, but will probably copy Uban over there.  Reportedly, the tradeskill stuff has not been put in yet.  But I am looking for it as well.  I think they are more interested in the class and the zones to begin with (though I bugged 2 things already with regard to Berserkers).  So, as soon as I find something, I will try to get in touch with you to discuss.</div></div><hr />

PSSST...  You are not even suposed to admit you are in the beta... :) I checked the NDA and as far as I can tell, it doesn't prohibit people from admitting that they are beta testers.<br />
<br />
BUT... according to the NDA, I can get kicked out for mentioning that a NDA exists!  (If I get removed from the beta program for confirming that an NDA actually exists, I won't be too disappointed.  Trying to deny the existence of the NDA is just too silly.)<br />
<br />
Not much to report today.  After I downloaded more files, I didn't have much time to explore since the server was being brought down fairly often.  Between arranging windows and creating new hot keys, my betabuffed druid (8th shawl!) foraged some new non-tradeskill tagged items, which I have noted down.<br />
<br />
I have requested that three of my characters be copied over to the beta server.  I should have more time to explore the new zones this weekend.  So far, I'm impressed with how smoothly the process has been going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Brody is correct.<br />
<br />
I even mentioned this at the time of the LDoN beta when you brought that up, Mr Ogre.<br />
<br />
There is nothing in the agreement preventing someone from saying that they are in the beta.<br />

<br />
It should mention not talking about &quot;what you find&quot; though :)  (I havn;t seen my NDA in a while since the last one I submitted was for Velious, and I have not submitted a new one since then... and have just been living with that one (which I think did mention not talking about being in the beta...)  so I jsut don't even talk about it when I am in it until I see the official &quot;NDA lifted&quot; posting :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Why is beta registration STILL CLOSED?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a link to the &quot;Register for Beta&quot; site on my desktop, and i click it whenever I pass by my desktop, and the page still redirects to &quot;Registration is closed, sorry you missed the 10 minute window.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
So sad.   So sad.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Sony Beta is such a joke it's sick...  It's not a beta test.  It's their method of creating hype for the expansion.  If the LDoN beta is any indicator, almost everything that is said and done in this &quot;Beta&quot; will be ignored and most likely routed straight to the bit bucket.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the cynacism, but that has been my experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I guess the language in the confidentiality section of the NDA does imply that people should not reveal their beta tester status since &quot;any and all&quot; information concerning the beta program is considered to be confidential information.<br />
<br />
I did more exploring this weekend.  Unfortunately, my characters have not been copied over to the beta server yet, so I only left the Queen of Thorns city ship zone a few times.  I have a lot to learn about running a 65th level character and was forced to gate out very quickly after briefly peeking around.<br />
<br />
The Find command currently works in the city ship zone, so I did visit all the vendors that are active.  I don't think I can say more about the tradeskilling features of the city (and who knows what will change before GoD is released).  If they keep some of the present features, some of us are going to be very happy.  (Is that cryptic enough?)<br />
<br />
Again, I'm very impressed about how smooth and stable the beta has been for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">One of the betabuff characters does have some pretty good tradeskills (and a coldain shawl to go with them).  I think it's the 65 druid but don't quote me on that.<br />
<br />
I've fooled around some in beta, and I've seen changes and bugs get fixed pretty quick, so for now, I still have faith :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Brenlo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Please remember that disclosing information from the beta can result in your being removed from the beta and possibly face account action.  We are excited to hear that you are mostly pleased but please ask that you respect the NDA you agreed to.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Brenlo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">As I said :)  When in the beta... you should not talk about it.  With the hint from SOE.  I am just going to close this thread and ask that you instead use notepad, or the notes feature of the game... write yourself some notes about your experience *if you wish* and then when the NDA is lifted (and it almost always is before release) then you can post your thoughts on the beta :)<br />
<br />
So enjoy the beta... but keep silent about it.</div></div><hr />
