<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jarak_akn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">By looking at all of the recipies and the existing trivials I have extracted what I think are all the trivials for the core GoD baking. NOTE THAT THESE ARE NOT CHECKED, but I doubt that any are more than 2 out. I have marked the rows that are guesses. <br />
<br />
I would not recommend putting them in the dB unil they are confirmed.<br />
<br />
I have also looked at the data on lucy and worked out the sell back price for all of it. <br />
<br />
Finally I have taken the cost of the store bought ingredients off to give a margin on the food. I have made a note of non-store bought ingredients that you need. I have taken the &quot;cost&quot; of 1lb of any of the meats at 500cp (5gp) which is the vendor price.<br />
<br />
Please find attached for your enjoyment. It is a zipped csv file that should be readable by most spreadsheets.</div></div><hr />
