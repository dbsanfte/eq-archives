With geerlok my skill is 172.2, and I'm averaging better than 50% success rate on acrylia studded items. I am willing to hit combine on anything that is not trivial to me, so if interested please send me a tell in game.<br />
<br />
I have plenty of the needed tannin, so all you need is the right number of acrylia studs and superb rockhopper hides... we can meet in the bazaar and bob's your uncle. <br />
<br />
Side note: my smithing is at 116 (121.8 with geerlok) so if you have acrylia that you need made into studs I can do that as well (if I'm doing the tailoring combine for you). If this is the case, please note that 18 small pieces of acrylia are needed for one attempt at a studded acrylia tunic ( 18 sm pieces = 9 acrylia bits = 6 acrylia studs ; 5 studs needed for combine ).<br />
<br />
Of course, I'm willing to hit combine on other things, it's just that your best chances come from using me to do Acrylia Studded combines for you.<br />
<br />
See you in game!</div></div><hr />
