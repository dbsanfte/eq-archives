<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Olgruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been having some success farming velium in SS, but have not been able to find the forge.  I've been past the fountain and past the 6 or 7 golems guarding the upper level of the zone and all the way up to some mob called &quot;Count&quot; something or other who saw through my invis so that's where i stopped.  Can anyone tell me where in the zone I can find the forge?  Please make your answer as in depth as possible since I don't know my way around the zone that well and know no landmarks other than the fountain.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zmek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ITs on the same level as the Fountian (zone in from CS) just head towards the zone in from WL. first  intersection left, the there should be a long hall way to the right. its the last room on the right. there are two Gargyal Guardians which are really merchents. so you dont have to worry about them they are non KoS.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. it sounds like you went the wrong way looking for it.<br />
