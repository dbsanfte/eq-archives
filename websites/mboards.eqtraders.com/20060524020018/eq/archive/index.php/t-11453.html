If you need a specific piece of Heraldic armor made, feel free to send Sebmulea a /tell with what piece you are interested in and what deity you are looking for. I have supplies to make any deity piece except Bertoxx armor, and Veeshan (i do have fused crystals but in very limited supply).<br />
<br />
Some info to read before you send my bazaar mule a /tell however:<br />
<br />
~Include that you wish to have X piece with X deity made in your /tell. &quot;Hi&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;are you there&quot; etc will be ignored. If you leave a /tell with the above info i will get back to you with the items price asap.<br />
<br />
~Do not /tell me at midnight pst and expect me to get back to you right away :) I am generally near my bazaar mules computer after 3-4pm pst, though not necessarily checking it.<br />
<br />
~I do not do combines. I will make Heraldic to order but using my own components and thus price will not be reduced (especially considering i only have a few items i keep in stock). I will not do combines for non-heraldic items either.<br />
<br />
~Prices are not up for negotiation, regardless of undercutters, sorry. I am willing to negotiate on bulk orders however (&gt; 4 Pieces).<br />
<br />
~I do not need supplies (except 1 mentioned below), so do not offer them in order to lower the price of an item.<br />
<br />
~Do not ask me the stats on a piece you are interested in. If you are coming to EQTraders i am sure you know how easy it is to look up what you want :)<br />
<br />
I am currently looking for someone to imbue Black Sapphires. If anyone is interested in imbuing BSes for me (1k per stack) please send Sebmulea a /tell stating you would like to imbue BSes for me and i will work out a time to meet up with you. The required deity to imbue a Black Sapphire is Bertoxx in case anyone was wondering.<br />
<br />
I try to keep Heraldic Breastplates, Greaves and Bracers in stock at all times for each deity so please feel free to check them out if that is all you need. (Sebmulea is located on the corner with the oven, next to the stables)<br />
<br />
Thank you for your interest! :)<br />
<br />
PS ~ don't have time to keep up with this thread so please respond through /tells :)</div></div><hr />
