Why is there no similar achievement for brewing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Maybe there is and we just haven't discovered it yet.  Probably not though, since baking is harder to skill up, there are many more choices of good stat foods.  Maybe one day there will be more.</div></div><hr />

I think SoE has nearly forgotten about brewing beginning with PoP.  Not only is there no &quot;uber&quot; self-only item as you mentioned, but there aren't even any good tradeable planar combines, while there are tons for Baking.  Except for dyes, I've been making the same old things since Luclin.  There are a bunch of LDoN recipes, but like most LDoN recipes, they suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Iannyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've GM'd both Brewing and Baking, so I feel the need to interject here.  Yes, there are far fewer stat foods in brewing than in baking.  But most of the stat foods in baking are crap to begin with, compared to the few good ones. <br />
Brewing:<br />
<br />
~Qeynos Afternoon Tea<br />
~Kaladim Constitutionals<br />
~Grobb Liquidised Meat<br />
<br />
Baking:<br />
~Misty THicket Picnic<br />
~Halas 10 pounder<br />
~Holy Cakes<br />
~Oohba (sp?) Truffles<br />
<br />
*Most* of the rest of the baked stat foods have stats far subpar to these, and aren't really made for proffit often.  Heck, I'll often buy MTP's and HMP's in the Bazaar because people are selling them for 3-5pp each!  I use some of my proffits from selling QAT for 15pp each (around 600-1200 units per week) to buy my food, I rarelt bake it anymore.<br />
<br />
Yes, the BBPP is *uber*, but its also no drop, and drink goes away more quickly than food.  Not sure I want something so painful to make as stat food.  And when you get up high enough to get ingredients for that, most people aren't worried about those stats anyway.<br />
<br />
I myself am about to start eating holy cakes, just because my other class stats are maxxed, and I'm no where near elemental planar flagged.</div></div><hr />

There are many great PoP stat foods that do not require elemental access, like Hero Sandwiches, Tormentor Stir Fry, Mephit Pies, Slarghilug Poppers, and so on.  Virtually every PoP zone has a useful stat food associated with it, and the stats on these foods blow brewed items out of the water.  PoP drinks seem to have just been left out.</div></div><hr />

Justice Fruit Pies...<br />
<br />
Yea, I agree that PoP left brewing out to dry.  I just got my corking device and was planning on brewing up myself some GLM to go with my HMPs that I bake, but that seems to be about the extent of what brewing is good for stat-wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Elyssanda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">here's an idea... <br />
Come up with some PoP stat drink recipes.. and /feedback them in.. explain that we/you feel like brewing was rather ignored... and then, add your suggested recipe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">one thing I'll say in Bakings defense.<br />
<br />
Brewing is used for tempers, needed for smithing, Baking is used purely as food. So I guess Baking is given better stats than Brewing to make up for it.<br />
<br />
Still would like something better than Kaladim's And Qeynos to brew.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Carmaris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah, but trivs are so low on tempers (outside ethereal), that any smith is better off just taking an hour or two to skill up their brewing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Certainly should be something out there to make that 9-part combine of MHB worthwhile!<br />
<br />
Hot cocoa could be a recipe.  Increase cold resists, stamina, maybe dex.<br />
<br />
But then again, it's early, it's cold, and I want some.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ChaseFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A fairly old thread on the matter you may revive if you wish. (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4029) <br />
<br />
Some of the conceptual drinks were overly-complicated I think, but might give some ideas...</div></div><hr />
