<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Left home an hour early, so I could cash my paycheck, and withdraw money and maybe make rent this month.   Left home, went to the bank, and found the paycheck wasn't with me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Went home, and decided to go to the bank on the way to my workplace, and got there, and the walk-in entrance was closed, as of 10 minutes prior.<br />
<br />
Went through the drive through with a driver's side window that doesn't go down, so You had to open the door, and stand a bit outside of my car.   They audibly confirmed that I cashed the check, and that I made a 70.00 withdrawl.  I took my recipt for the withdrawl, and made it to work 10 minutes early.<br />
<br />
At work, I realized that I wasn't wearing the bright semi-obnoxious shirt with my store's logo emblazed across the front.   Had my boss give me the verbal equivelant of a dirty look, and I had to buy another shirt, for $5, due payday.<br />
<br />
On lunch (around 10p)I opened the envelope from the bank, and inside was the cash from my paycheck.   Yup, JUST the paycheck amount.   I triple counted, and uttered more then one curseword.<br />
<br />
After work, I left, and among the things I stupidly left at work include my tupperware from lunch, my tshirt that I mistakenly wore, some vitamins I meant to take, the burger I saved for my last break (and then was going to bring it home, and eat after work) and the book I'm midway through.<br />
<br />
Drove home alone, for once, and came home to an empty apartment.<br />
<br />
<br />
So If anyone needs me, I'll be the man in his room, quietly screaming himself into whatever passes for sleep these days, and hoping that when I wake up, something goes right tomorrow.   <br />
<br />
Maybe the trip to the bank to the bank tomorrow to convince them that I REALLY would like that $70 to pay rent will go well.   yeah, and monkeys Might fly out of ...errr...   the ground.<br />

P.S. Anyone caught using this thread to discuss, or make some kind of joke about, my workplace will be glowered at with evil thoughts.</div></div><hr />

I've had days like that... I usually go to bed early... :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You have my sympathies - I have been in El Mondo Mal with ya since some time last week and really need to shake out of it.  I won't dwell on everything but it included getting a speeding ticket on the way to work (even though I was one of the slowest cars, I was still speeding) - hasn't really gotten any better.<br />
<br />
Good luck!!!  I would take a mental health day myself, except I have no vacation days to spare.  I am also so cranky I think I am getting many folks ticked at me which is driving my mood lower and fouler.  I think I am becoming Gollum's little sister in game too.  :(</div></div><hr />

I won't go into details, but the last couple weeks have been a little over the top and today has been &quot;one of those days&quot;.  Just one thing was my hubby discovering that the info that Oregon needed to process the amended 2001 tax return that they received last JUNE did not go through when I faxed it, even though I SWEAR that it did!!!!  I'm sure the confirmation the fax machine spit out said it went.....<br />
<br />
:boggled: :steamed: :rolleyes: :cry: :eek: (we need a banging-head emoticon...not the heavy metal kind either)<br />
<br />
<br />
At least I can play EQ, unlike Sunday &amp; Monday when my server was down, so perhaps I should look at the bright side of things.  Remember, it can always get worse.  Anytime you say it can't it will (so don't ever say it  ). <br />
Perhaps not on the magnitude of the bad one you had...but suffice it to say that I'm with ya' man!!<br />
<br />
I truly hope that the rest of your week is SO MUCH BETTER that the bad day will be a distant memory.<br />
<br />
:goodvibe: :goodvibe: <br />
<br />
Personally I need to :meditate: and go to bed early.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, reading your response reminded me, that the Vile day was also the first day my computer had internet access again in over a week, so I'm still readjusting from my deprivation.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's been a bad week, though.  Work stinks, money is so tight as to be non-existant, and I'm slipping back into depresion. <br />
<br />
God help me.  :-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Speckocat Catnippurr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Money being tight I understand.  Another issue this week is battling to get some other money we're owed as well.  /growl<br />
<br />
Keep your chin up.  Like I said....things can always be worse.  Try not to let it depress you.  I know what that's like....<br />
<br />
Just know that some of the rest of us out here understand all too well.  It doesn't fix it, but hopefully it eases the pain at least a little.</div></div><hr />
