I logged on my cleric and began to imbue 107 (exactly) rose quartzes for someone. <br />

Whlie I was doing that, a DE necro wandered in. He proceeded to sit in the corner and watch me. He fed me mana and told me how beautiful I was, heheh. <br />

There's GOT to be more exciting things to do in EQ than watch someone imbue 107 rose quartzes!<br />
