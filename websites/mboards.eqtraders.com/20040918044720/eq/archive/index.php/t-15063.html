<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was curious what zones and fish you target, if you are lookin to have fish that are worth selling in Bazaar?<br />
I heard Cobalt Scar has Cod that sell for 50pp each in Bazaar on some servers.<br />
Since this is the only way now to make money from fishing........what zones and fish seem to be worth targetting?<br />
How much plat do you sell these certain fish for on your server?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, if you can get into the planes, Nightmare Cichlid and Valorian Discus might sell, since those are needed to get the Fisherman's Companion. (Might be worth converting them to the needed bones, instead of trying to sell the actual fish, though)<br />
<br />
For Nightmare fishing, I hear you really need to be able to FD fish, as mobs can see through invisibility. Don't know about Valor, though.<br />
<br />
As an alternative, you could try fishing for Saltwater Seaweed in OOT, but that's only a good idea if you're not evil, since evils are KOS at the two best fishing spots. Might not be worth it, though, as I bet most Human smiths don't bother doing Seafarer armor and weapons for skill-ups, as there are better alternatives now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gnormy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aside from those listed above you can also fish<br />
Cobalt Scar for Cobalt Cod<br />
Iceclad Ocean for Iceclad Cutlassfish<br />
Ocean of Tears/Timourous Deep for Saltwater Seaweed (low demand)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I sell Cobalt Cod for 100pp each on Veeshan, and I'm the cheapest in the Bazaar. For me, at 200, Fisherman's Companion Pole and regular bait, I get about 20 Cod for 180-200 bait.<br />
<br />
The Snapper is a give-away at best, and usually just dropped. The rest is the usual junk, but for a couple of hours work, I can usually score 4k on the Cod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why do players pay so much for the Cod?<br />
What is the Cod is for? What makes it so valueable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's used with Arctic Wyvern Hides to skillup in Tailoring (the Hides are another good money maker, btw, but the drop rate is abysmal).<br />
<br />
It's not a bad Tailoring path, but very expensive if you have to buy the components.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What mobs drops the hides and what Tailored item do they make along with the Cod? What is the Trivial on that?<br />
I am new to tailoring and so I was curious what the cod plus hides make, what skill level.....and what mob drops the hides?<br />
What is the Hide drop rate anyway......is it like 1 in 10 kills?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The Hides drop from the Wyverns in Cobalt Scar. You'll need to have your CoV faction above KOS or you'll be dodging Drakes the whole time. CoV is &quot;easy&quot; to raise in Great Divide killing the Giants and wolves, but it takes a bunch of them. It takes a LOT of them.<br />
<br />
You can make an entire set of Arctic Wyvern armour, but I believe it's Shammy only. Iirc, the trivial is 250 or better on all the pieces, with the usual skillup path; make the one you can get skillups on with the least ingredients.<br />
<br />
The Velium may cause you some trouble, it's going to take a lot. Personally, I'm stockpiling this stuff and waiting for post 200 to start using them up.<br />
<br />
The drop rate was about 1 in 10 (and may still be), but last night and this morning it was like 1 in 25. Maybe the RNG was out to get me, I dunno. I'll find out more tonight.<br />
<br />
If your CoV faction is ok, this is a pushover zone for a level 50+.<br />
<br />
As always, I welcome corrections :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I recall doing the Wyverns even though I am KOS to CoV Faction. I just quad them on the beach since I am not KOS to the Otters. <br />
You mentioned you are stock piling Velium.......where do I get Vellium from?</div></div><hr />

Yes, that's correct. You still need a key to go from Skyshrine to Cobalt Scar. I don't think you need a key to go the other way.<br />
<br />
Yes, you can go from Great Divide to Plane of Mischief to Cobalt Scar without a key. You zone in to CS in the middle of the ocean under water, so be prepared. This is the route I use and have never had any problems. I understand that the CS zonein point is in the path of a wandering underwater dragon, but I've never seen him.<br />

I don't know if, like the other planes, you have to be level 46+ to get into PoM.<br />

The occupants of the woods in PoM don't see through invis, so I always enter that way. To get there, go to Great Divide and follow the glowing river all the way to the South end of the zone. You will see a miniature castle in the water; click on it and you will zone in to PoM. You will find yourself in a small raised gazebo-looking thing. Face due North and click on the ground in the middle of the woods. You should see a message like &quot;You can't reach that from here&quot;. That's the Cobalt Scar zonein. Walk toward that area clicking on the ground until you zone in to CS. You will be underwater at loc 0,0 in CS. Swim East to get to the Othmir area of the beach.<br />

If you park yourself on the very SW corner of Valor, you can fish for Valorian Discus (and Crawdads) in complete safety.  99% of the time, there are xp groups hunting both the Inner and Outer camps, so monsters are kept clear and when they do get overrun (and run to the zone-out), the mobs' pathing has them returning far enough away where they won't aggro you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The zone-in is a tree, so if you walk a bit at a time due north from where you zone in, clicking on trees, you will find the one that gives the &quot;You can't reach that from here&quot; message. I use this method to get out of PoM when I'm there killing things. <br />
<br />
Remember, you have to find a way out of CS, you can't go back through PoM, that's one-way only. So, you'll still have to run through a bunch of zones, or get a druid to come port you out. (I don't know about running, since I always have a druid on another account port me out.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The catch rate for storm slamon isn't that good.  However, all is needed to fish there is level 55+.  The catch rate for giant halibut and giant snapper in the PoW is very good.  Really important to have a really good invis or FD to fish there though.  The mobs in the water will aggro on you when you are vis.  I have caught 80 skill up fish here in an hour - and I'm pretty happy with that.  Also the halibut and snapper can be used (with bread crumbs) up to 222 skill baking.  Avoiding using vegetables is good for a non-forager.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Grimlach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">lvl 55+ storm salmon in plane of storms is always good, but kinda rare.<br />
lvl 40+ cobalt cod in cobalt scar is good, but about as rare as salmon.<br />
If you can feign death or dont mind the hassle of zoning every time your invis wears off, then I'd suggest trying to fish in reef of coirnav (plane of water) provided you are elemental flagged.<br />
no other fish are really worth the time and effort.  People frequently farm cichlid and discus so those really dont do anything for you.  just stick to the fish above and you can make yourself a nice living as a fisherperson.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">You could also consider fishing in Old Sebilis for Kunzar Koi. (Used to make kunzar glue for crucible of escape)<br />

<br />
If you follow the wall from the zone-in until you get to the river/hobgoblin area, then follow the river a little until you can see the the bank (looking over the cliff), you can levitate down there and fish in relative safety. You don't even need invis. Just dont get too close to the Slarghilug's. You can gate out afterwards. Of course, it helps if you are a caster  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Troodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Yes, that's correct. You still need a key to go from Skyshrine to Cobalt Scar. I don't think you need a key to go the other way.<br />
<br />
This is correct; you don't need a key to go from Conalt Scar to Skyshrine, only the other way around.  If you want this key, talk to Zigrak Whisperwing and do this quest: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=940<br />
<br />
Or you can also just kill Zigrak and he'll drop the key, hehe, if CoV faction doesn't mean anything to you.<br />

<br />
<br />
Yes, you do in fact need to be 46+ to enter Plane of Mischief.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you port into Cobalt Scar you don't need a key.<br />

Correct... you used to need a dragon tooth to port to CS, but that requirement was taken out of the game when Luclin launched.</div></div><hr />
