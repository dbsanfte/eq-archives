The Hopper caves in DSP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dmuerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep but as i said, they nerfed the spawn rate in there to like 20 minutes so you almost fall asleep waiting for them to spawn now :/.<br />

Any other zones?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Flawless drops are nearly non-existant in Mons Letalis and Scarlet Desert.  <br />
<br />
What class are you?  Check into Cultural robes for other paths to and past 200.  You should definatly do LoY ribbons until 187 - you probably won't find a better path to 187 than LoY ribbons.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>borblefoot furtoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually there are to alternatives to DSP. The scarlet Desert and Mons letalis.<br />
<br />
Mons letalis hoppers have the highest pelt rate drop which includes FLawless and superb, But its has the worst hunting conditions and can be very dangerous. Not to mention the pathing had been messed up for some time. I have not been there since the recent collision changes so I don't know if things are still messed up there pathing wise or not. But it certainly was a viable alternative for me when the hoppers were not up in DSP.<br />
<br />
The Scarlet desert drop rate is about the same as DSP. There are fewer hoppers available and they are spread out more. Pulling them is the hardest part, but once you get back to the ramp to the mesa killing them was easy.<br />
<br />
DSP is the safest and easiest place to get hides, at least when the hoppers are up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Obina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Do check the bazaar on your server for the dye forages/drops.  You may be surprised.  It is a bit of an effort to look for all 12 as the names are so different.  With patience, I bought all I needed in the bazaar to get to 187 on ribbon.  Some days there were few or the price was silly.  Took a week of looking before and after my grouping.  Yes in the end I spent a boat load of plat.  But I spent way less time.  I'll earn the plat back in less time than farming would have been.<br />
<br />
And then I got lucky and got to 188 on my 6th shawl combine.  How cool is that!<br />
<br />
*Sigh* but now I'm looking at getting on my tractor and farming.</div></div><hr />

Just hang out at the foot of the ramp to the big plateau and you can pull all kinds of rockhoppers from around the base.</div></div><hr />

I have recently timed the respawn rate for the hopper cave in DSP and it is about 13 minutes.  Depending on where you set up in the cave and how crowded it is, this should usually be adequate to ensure a steady stream of hoppers.  If it's crowded, I would usually go do something else.<br />
<br />
The Mons hoppers have a decent drop rate for the upper end hides, but the zone is bugged.  A full three quarters to four fifths of the hoppers on my track are stuck in walls, boulders, etc., in that zone and are not accessible.  I never figured out a way to get them out.  At least on Tribunal.<br />
<br />
The Scarlet hoppers also have a decent drop rate for upper end hides, but there are only about 8 or 9 hoppers in the zone.  If you don't have track to find them, it is probably not worth your time.<br />

Hey, my first post on these forums, I joined just so I could respond on this thread, although I've been reading them for a long time.  And tailoring is now 240, I'm into the final lap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>mewkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">From my time spent killing hoppers for my VT shard...<br />
If the samabata are up, go to one of the back caves (I think it's the one on the right as you enter the room that forks but not certain). Kill the Sambata Keeper untill the named guy spawns. Killing that named guy will get the hoppers to respawn. Once the hoppers are up, make sure not to kill the Old Aged one, that will trigger the sambata to take over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sharrien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I buy most of my pelts now, but when i farm them I always go to ML or SD.  DSP has more spawns and is easier to get to but you trip over lvl 30 people constantly.  It's way over crowded and I feel silly competing with toons half my lvl for a camp.  ML can be a pain in the butt with all the aggro, but at least it's not crowded.</div></div><hr />

i good way i've found out is that make a hot key with /target A<br />
<br />
keep clicking around and then once you have them targeted just simply nuke, snare etc.<br />
<br />
if you are brave you can try aoe see if ya get more than one.  <br />

this is a lesson i learned from doing guk &quot;can't target anything&quot; LDONs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Anubsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I tried ML but only got one hopper (chanter no track) and i found it by useing F8 to find them) it dropped a flawless though so i was happy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Rissenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I tried out the Hopper cave in DSP with the intent to see what the drop rate was. In the cave there is a total of 30 hoppers (26 if the age old hopper is up since you dont want to kill him)<br />
I killed off the entire cave a few times and noticed that I got about 2 or 3 Flawless pelts per cave run. This means that if you have the entire cave for yourself, which is HIGHLY unusual, you will get between 10-15 pelts per RL hour. Then we also have to count in the time it takes to farm the acrylia.<br />
<br />
Now, if we calculate that the average amount of combines before every skill-up is 30 (seems to be the likely number at STAT 280), that would mean 2-3 hours of farming per point. (Acrylia excluded.) We are talking mindless farming with no cash of any shape to get these points.<br />
<br />
Anyone else than me see something wrong with this picture? We need either more options of combines, or an increased drop rate.</div></div><hr />

I actually like that picture :)  It says with 1 evening of heavy farming, you could potentially get 1 skill up.  Seems like a decent rate not to get determined people discouraged but not so easy as to allow a person to GM tailoring on a whim.    <br />
<br />
Another thought is to increase the amount of acrylia farming (or invest a couple hundred pp in the bazaar) and make an item that would actually sell for a small profit vs is just for skill ups.  You would have slightly more time involved but you would then have both a skill up and some pp to show for your efforts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So in your opinion, it would be worth to heavily farm the entire cave for 4 rl hours a day for 50 rl days to go from 200 to 250? To each our own I guess.<br />

I just sold what pelts I have so far gathered. I found another route.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- I am not saying that I do nopt prefer a challenge, but do you really, REALLY find the drop rate of one of the few acceptable &quot;low-cost&quot; routes good as it is? There is ONE cave, and often it is camped, or one can get to share about half of it. There is a reason the flawless pelts sell fast at 300pp each on my server.<br />
<br />

<br />
- If a person comes up to me and seems real happy and says that they have GM'ed Brewing, then yes, I think they have made an accomplishment. For myself, I GM'ed it in a few hours and dont think it is a big deal, no.<br />
<br />

- Attention of the tailoring in itself, or the toughness to find materials if you are not loaded down with platinum?<br />
<br />

<br />
I have done quite a few tradeskills. Do you see me complain about any of the others? What i am saying is that the drop rate is ridiculous on the &quot;low cost&quot; routes.<br />
Othmir furs, rockhopper hides, whatevertheyarecalled wyrms, they have one thing in common, they dont drop very much. <br />
<br />
And as for &quot;dumbing it down for my own pleasure&quot;....how much have you soloed for farming stuff? I have farmed so much alone that I have gotten so tired that I just dont want to go out and solo anywhere anymore...and I am a necro! So please, spare me such comments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Aryse Andenter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I'm following this off-topic.<br />
<br />
<br />
I like that tailoring is hard, but I do think it crossed from being hard into being ridiculous. It's okay that some tradeskills are harder than others, but there is a limit to how much of a difference there should be. <br />
<br />
Also, I don't mind some farming, but first of all, if I have to farm for hours and hours like this, I want a few more options (in case a camp is taken, or just to tame the monotony of camping for hours and hours over months in the same zones). There are what, like 3 zones to do your farming in right now for the pelts above 200 skill? And I do think the farming crossed from being enough to make the tradeskill hard into  a realm of ridiculous difficulty, particularly since it produces a product I can't even give away, much less sell. <br />
<br />
While we're at it, please someone explain to me the logic behind the arctic wyvern gear having the low stats it does when they have the same trivial as earthweave?!!!! <br />
<br />
With a drop rate like that, my time is better spent farming pp and buying the pelts - only I can't get them on my server, not even at 300pp+, they simply aren't available. Tailoring was the first tradeskill I started, and it will be the last I finish, if I do at all.</div></div><hr />

I looked up the ribons but all of them require foraged items and human mages get zero foraging :(<br />
<br />
All of the foraged items to make ribbon dyes also drop off of certain mobs in the same zone, so you can still do these if you can't forage.</div></div><hr />
