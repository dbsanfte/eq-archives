You get better at it the more you do it.<br />
<br />
You, eventually, will be able to refine 3 from each sample.<br />

Do we have any idea what the better/more metric is based on? Is it JC skill, or some hidden number?<br />
<br />
Frankly, these drops aren't that common, and I really don't feel like &quot;practicing&quot; if I have do do hundreds in order to get &quot;better.&quot;</div></div><hr />

She isn't progressing me past the simple  clasp part.   Here's the interesting twist.  I wasn't able to kill the critters on teh Natimbi broken shores beach so a friend and i multi quested the reinforced kit.   So *NOW* i'm trying to do the newbie jewelry quest... and it's not going well.<br />
<br />
I'd recommend that people do the newbie quest before doing the reinforced part.... i just might have to go bakc and get the no drop shell myself and turn it all in again just so i can get the other quest to acknowledge me.  Don't know. :(</div></div><hr />

You must turn in each item one at a time (up to 4 per turn in). Stacks count as one item...<br />

<br />
it doesnt take long at all spent like 500 on raw pale nihilite at 30-50 each and by the end was doing 3 90% each time and it is based off of a hidden number but the number is the same for all skills it appears. when i completed the second quest for aligned steel i immediately made three each combine. on a side note jewlel craft quest was a breez compared to the forge version took forever.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Aryse Andenter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I heard they changed it so that you are more likely to get more Pale Nihilite for each refinement, and I guess it must be true, since I have done about 10 combines recently, and never got less than 2 back on any one of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">According to Absor, there *was* a bug that gave back one extra when refining nihilite, ore, darkmatter, etc. <br />
<br />
As it is now, things are nearly as messed up as before.  Ore simply won't convert, and nihilite (not tested anything else) returns one or two nihilites and a flask of water.<br />
<br />
So, is anyone getting 3 nihilite/ore/whatever after the patch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Aryse Andenter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Ugh! I just went and tested as soon as I read that I don't like that at all. I went from getting back two and often three before to getting one back and a flask of water each try today. I hope this is another bug and not their final 'fixed' version!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Aryse, in trying to fix the problem, they bugged it some more.  I'd have preferred they left it alone, lol.<br />
<br />
Basically, what happened was you were always getting one item too many with the refining combines.  Before the patch, that was represented by one extra pale nihilite, aligned ore, whatever you were refining.  Now, you get the proper amount of the refined material, but you also get a water flask instead of the extra refined material.<br />
<br />
Thats why I asked if anyone has gotten a third refined material since the patch.  I'd like to know how many nihilite, darkmatter, ore, etc. has been refined to get to the point of getting 3 back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Anubsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">This better not be the final finished version, I have gone through about 40 stacks since the changes and have yet to get 3 out of a combine. Anyone know how many you get back now with the handin method, im still getting only 1 nihi and a water flask every 5 or 6 times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Theophastus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Must not be doing too bad 'cause I saw all that pale nihilite on your trader Anub  ;) Not that I'm gonna buy it off ya though; I have a personal belief against taking a 50pp loss per combine...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Mavick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">A few weeks ago I began posting some information on my attempts to refine dark matter in the tinkering section (and I sure hope that this doesn't count as a cross post).  The information I listed was when the combines were returning an extra refined item per combine.  It LOOKS like at around 60 combines you move into a pretty reasonable return of 2 per combine (I was getting 3 per at the time due to the stated bug).<br />
<br />
Because I've moved I hadn't had a chance to combine anything after the listed information, I could only speculate that the trend remained similar (meaning without the new waterflask bug).  IF this is right (and they didn't include some nasty exponential modifier) then at about 120-140 attempts the refinement process would (normally) be producing 3 per combine with reliability.  <br />
<br />
I suggest then that the water flask bug basically caps the refinement at 2 now, and the code/formula is going to have to be fixed again... or else people will just hand in the stuff for their guaranteed 2 refined item return.  BUT THAT IS JUST SPECULATION!<br />

Theo!! heheh never thought id see someone i know here. <br />
<br />
Anyways please dont buy it from me its just there because i do all my or at least most my crafting in the bazaar and if i have it in my satchels i dont have to look for it :) that if some poor schmuk pays such an inflated price for it w00t im rich quicker :D  . it has happened kept my skinning knife there fo awhile for 1k and somone bought it i was sooo mad had go up my smithing just to make a new one.</div></div><hr />

Trying to do the freebie quest so i can make the nihilite, however I have given her over 300 simple clasps and she will not let me proceed onto the second combine!  :mad: <br />
<br />
Are the GoD freebie quests broken at the moment? I have also tried the brewing quest, and again I can not proceed past the first series of combines. <br />
