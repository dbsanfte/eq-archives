<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Malodium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Maybe this is old news, maybe its covered in another thread I didnt notice, but sellback for star ruby steins is now 4sp.<br />
A few weeks ago it was 30pp.<br />
<br />
Very sucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, I mentioned it elsewhere already.  Currently still have 70 or so on my bazaar mule to sell off.  Guess I shouldn't complain too much, they are selling at 100pp each in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Iannyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No kidding, I think I'm the one buying them :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thicket Tundrabog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Making star ruby steins and vendor sellling them is for the rich and impatient. I've worked my way up to 241 pottery skill on first opal and then star ruby steins. I Bazaar sold all the opal steins for 40pp, and am currently selling star ruby steins for 140pp each. I put 4 - 6 steins on my trader each night, and most of the the time they sell out.<br />
<br />
Occasionally I'll vendor mine unfired opal steins. Buy for a few cp, fire them and sell them for 40pp. Not huge amounts of plat, but it sure is a great markup :) <br />
<br />
I think lowering the vendor selling price of steins is a good thing. It's a plat sink in an economy that has too much plat floating around.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The thing is, star ruby steins were already a plat sink without the nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">SOE has somebody systematically going through all the tradeskill materials and nerfing sellback on any items that could be sold to vendor for more than the price of the materials.<br />
<br />
They are doing this to stop the plat-manufacturing houses that have sprung up (mostly in Asia, if you believe reports) that have been buying up toons on *************s, and using them with macro programs to make tons and tons of skills items and selling them back to vendor for plat, then selling the plat for cash back on auctions again.<br />
<br />
They are also nerfing any easy-loot farming spots at the same time, for the same reason. The most obvious, and the most talked about, is the cleric/enchanter bot duo on almost every server that have been farming Pyra in Sebilis for up to a year or more--those mobs no longer drop cash gems at the rate they were, and lo-and-behold, the bot farmers seem to be disappearing.<br />
<br />
What's amusing is, if you surf around a bit on the various class message boards, you will see posts from &quot;new&quot; players who claim they are looking for places to farm cash with their &quot;nearly naked&quot; lvl 65 toon, cause &quot;they need to finally buy some good armor&quot;. These are almost certainly the same bot runners, trying to use the goodwill of the gamers on these sites to suggest new spots for them to set up their farming bots.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">BTW, since last week, I've made something like 23 star ruby steins, and sold them all for 275 each.  Other vendors on the server are at 300.  Sometimes, there will be one real lowball at like 160 or something, I just let him sell out and get my price.<br />
<br />
It's been nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hey Rorgg, if I was in your shoes, I'd buy out the guy at 160 and mark em up.  Treat him like a middle-man retailer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which has what to do with star ruby stein change?  The steins were selling back for 30pp.... the gem alone costs 60p+.  This recipe was already producing something below cost of components.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Noni DeeCups</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Why skill up on star ruby steins? I found the idols to be much cheaper / easier. I got really angry every time I ( 250 JC ) would fail a laquer so I started looking at other items. Lo and behold: unfired idols. <br />
<br />
I made the Idol of Tunare (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=2303&amp;menustr=) ( Triv 250 ) and dropped them on the ground without firing them. Your out of pocket price is fixed because there are no failures on sub combines - about 50 plat combine.<br />
<br />
I got over being angry about resale pricese to vendors a long time ago while skilling up on tailoring...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>OberonMiM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i havent seen any macroers farming any plat dropping mobs ever<br />
<br />
but then again unless that macro program knows how to pvp it really wont work too well now will it :P<br />
<br />
Im just glad i already hit 250 in everything</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Circlemage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think the thing is that unfired potterry object X (value 0) and high quality firing sheet (value 4sp) are giving a sell back price of 3sp i.e. 75% of the &quot;costs&quot;<br />
<br />
I wonder whether any pottery item that doesn't get glazed etc while firing is selling back for more than 3sp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mumboh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's been a while, but I seem to recall that a few things sold back to the vendor for more before they were fired (ceramic bands maybe?). However, the price wasn't very much more.<br />
<br />
I just don't understand the low sell-back price of pottery items, especially the ones with gems in them. You can sell JC items back for a decent price (albeit a loss). But a handful of sp for something that takes 68pp gem is silly.<br />
<br />
Bah! Next thing will be coin-operated pottery wheels at the kiln-o-mat. :boggled:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aandaie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">They always overdue trying to limit making any money from skills, to vendor NPC sales. <br />
<br />
I don't know why that is. In other games, like FFXI, you can make  a small profit or at least nearly break even. It just makes sense. <br />
<br />
If an item costs 65 plat, in vendor npc materials, you should at least get back 60-64 plat. Four silver pieces? Ahahaa.</div></div><hr />
