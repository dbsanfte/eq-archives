<br />
As a 65 necro I can farm most whatever i need but it is so time consuming its ridiculous, for example i spent 4 hours killing othmurs and got like 12 furs akkk .<br />
<br />
Anyone got a route to 242 that i can farm myself that wont take ages and ages??</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rissenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Check throuhg the different robes that we can sew and create. Then sweep the bazaar for the stuff you need. I usually do these sweeps when I log on and just before I quit.<br />
<br />
I save up all these things and do all the combines about once a week.<br />
<br />
So go farm other stuff that drop gems and such and use that cash to buy these things instead. Oh, and if you still want to farm; go to the Rockhopper cave in DSP. As a 65 Necro, you can walk through the entire cave and kill all of the hoppers. Rince, repeat.<br />
The flawless rockhopper pelts can take you to 250.<br />

Unfortunately Rissenn, Flawless hopper hides will only get you to 242 - that's when acrylia reinforced trivials out. Timper will have to do some other type of tailoring after that to hit 250. :(</div></div><hr />

He asks about 242 originally anyway :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, I forgot to add that that would only get him  8 points.<br />
<br />
<br />
Which, I thought, would still be helpful.<br />
<br />
Sorry for not clarifying.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Timper Tantrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the tips.<br />
<br />
Yeah I been doing Cultral Robes baut seems runes and words are rare in bazar. I guess i need to just learn patience and do like suggested above collect through the week and have my combiones on sunday or something hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Silound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Solstice robes, although expensive pas 210-215, are very simple, requiring only one dropped item, of which there is lots of  available, and some money on chains. <br />
<br />
If you can farm items that sell and/or cash quickly, then it sounds like you would be well off to do solstice robes.</div></div><hr />

or<br />
Arctic Wyvern Hide Mask (triv &gt;250)<br />
<br />
are the way to go.<br />
<br />
Tho I'll admit that it's alot easier to run thru Crystal Caverns to farm out velium and just convert it into small pieces in the dorf town. Cause farming out Grimling caves takes forever to yield little, and competing for rockhoppers that may drop flawless is very slow. And farming Arctic wyverns and Arctic drakes tends to be alot easier and you get at least more drops.</div></div><hr />

Heh made me laugh when I saw that. While the rockhoppers are no problem, at 65 on the FV server  Arctic wyvern hides  TLC  in cobalt scar and the only other source is western wastes wyverns which are no where near as easy to farm. As they summon.<br />

Luckily I am a halfing and I have been skilling up on Haversacks.<br />
