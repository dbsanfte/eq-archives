<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moomasta5000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have read a lot on these Message boards and i have seen lots of people talking about making some money from their tailoring skills. I was just wondering if i could get some people to post some of the things they make to make money off of. If anyone is willing to share their info that would be great, thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">what i have seen<br />
haversacks<br />
lemming back packs<br />
some velious stuff<br />
some acrylia stuff<br />
(stay away from skill up items as their market will be flooded)<br />
some of the loy robes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PetrosDaroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most of what I've seen that goes for high end is the haversacks (fetch about 6k a piece on E'ci) and haze panther.  Not to mention stuff that's made from the elemental planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are a number of items that make money for a tailor, scattered all over the range.  Some are:<br />
<br />
Leather padding (trivial 41): Anyone doing fine steel plate needs these, and since fine steel plate is a major skillup path for smiths, there are lots of FSP smiths out there.  They sell in the Bazaar for anywhere from 15 to 50 or more plat each, depending on your server.<br />
<br />
Handmade backpacks (trivial 88): If you farm your own stuff, you can make some good money with them.  They sell for 50 to 90 pp, again depending on your server.<br />
<br />
Folded bearskin potion bag (trivial 162): You'd think there's only a very limited market for these, but I've had some luck selling them to non-shamans, by reminding people with my /auction message that it creates a ten slot container on command, so it's got some usefulness as a loot bag or insta-storage for non-stacking tradeskill components.  Since the bag it creates is not NORENT, it's OK if you use it then forget to empty it before you log out.  When it sells (not fast, but well enough) it'll sell for around 100 pp (YMMV).<br />
<br />
Acrylia studded gear (trivial 188): There's good money in this stuff, but only for certain pieces.  Masks won't get you a dime, because the market is saturated, but cloaks sell for 400-800 pp because they're not the usual suspect for skillups and the cloak has BIG wisdom on it.  Sleeves also sell well.<br />
<br />
Fleeting Quivers (trivial 222): More often than not, you'll be making these on order, not building and selling them, but if you lay hands on an HQ lion pelt, you can build one and sell it for a lot of money.  On my server, it goes for about 3000 pp.<br />
<br />
Acrylia reinforced gear (trivial 242): The same situation as studded gear, you'll have to research which pieces sell and which are everywhere.  Again, avoid masks, and go for belts, bracers, sleeves and such.<br />
<br />
Velious tailoring (trivial 250+): There are many, many options at this level, from othmir fur caps to cobalt drake gear to haze pantherskin.  You can charge for combines, or find components and sell the results.  A few pieces, like arctic wyvern masks, are overstocked because they're on the easiest skillup path, but others will sell for a small fortune.  Check you Bazaar and build accordingly, or to order.<br />
<br />
Ceremonial solstice robes (trivial 250+): There's a steady market for these robes for the POTC quest, and they also make for fairly cheap skillups.  Check your market, and don't sell them when lots of others do.  Dry spells do come up where people are looking for the robes all the time, so hold out for them and you'll get your investment back with interest.<br />
<br />
Cultural tailoring:  Halflings can make Leatherfoot bags.  Erudites can make armor.  Several races can make robes.  Don't forget to investigate these possibilities, since most of them pay back well for the effort.<br />
<br />
I hope that'll get you started.  Happy stitching, and don't stick your thumb too many times!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moomasta5000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey thanks everyone for their replies. Im not a halfling so sadly i cant get in on the haversack market &lt;whine&gt;, but i am a druid so lemming backpacks can be made from foraged goods. <br />
I do a lot of farming lately and sadly my skill is only 156, but i have definetly been getting into it. My step appoaching quickly would be the acrylia masks. I looked in bazaar for the small peices of acyrlia and they go for 50-70 a peice &lt;ouch&gt; Even if i am a druid i have never made it big on the cash and with 6 peices at least per mask thats pricey. I know i can get the DSP hopper camp pretty constantly since im on Maelin Starpyre and we are still a grossly underpopulated server. Just want to know if there is a nice place for a druid to farm Small peices of acrylia. Best kind of place would be where i could quad kite or low low lvl mobs like in EK where you can pull 15 spiders and lions and then cast catastroph or upheaval and kill them all at once = P<br />
I highly doubt acrylia would be as easy as silks and hq pelts but hey mabye one of you guys has a secret place to sahre. Neways, any of you lucky spots where you think the acrylia is droppin please feel free to share if u want = )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Deedolith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Acrylia spots:<br />
DSP: sambatas ==&gt; high end rare<br />
Grimling forest: Grimlings ==&gt; rare<br />
Tenebrous mountains: Laborer camp ==&gt; uncommon<br />
Tenebrous mountains: gol baku (aliens) ==&gt; uncommon (easyer with track)<br />
ME: Gorangas ==&gt; rare<br />
The deep: ==&gt; rare<br />
Acrylia caverns: ==&gt; common (tough place)<br />
<br />
The best place is definetly AC, but you probably need a grp to go there, soloing is tough unless you are the right class.</div></div><hr />
