<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Serenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know this is a dead horse, but I'm just boggled.<br />
<br />
I've been raising my jewelcraft for the shawl, and I noticed that Champagne Magnums trivial at 196, so I got a friend to enchant gold for me and made a dozen stacks of magnums.  Then I took my brewing up making Demi-Sec Champagne and dropped thaton my merchant.  <br />
<br />
As usual, I checked current prices before putting mine out there.  An Opal costs just under 18pp, so I figure cost without failures is about 19pp, failures obviously upping that.   There were considerably more then 200 out there at 20pp, and one seller is someone I know is already 250, so wasn't even making these for skill ups.... /boggle    What am I missing?  I can't believe someone got enough 'dropped' Opals to make putting that many up at just over cost worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ancarett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree -- it's frustrating to see a flood of goods priced under cost!<br />
<br />
I imagine that you've run across a popular skill-up option (popular because people KNOW everyone buys the EoS quest items) where the player was willing to take a bit of a loss knowing that they would eventually sell all the champagne.<br />
<br />
Try to see if their bazaar mules aren't on all the time and cover the market when they're not around or, if you have a lot of cash, buy them up at the low cost and resell them at the fair market price!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aryse Andenter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heh, that's really below cost, the gold bars cost 10pp each aprox. on top of the opal, don't forget.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a very logical reason for their pricing them under what they cost to make:<br />
<br />
They didnt make them. They found them on a vendor.<br />
<br />
Check their other wares. If its a complete mix of random amounts of unrelated stuff.. they are a vendor diver..<br />
<br />
Champagne magnums sell to and from a vendor for very little. I have some myself on a mule i found on a vendor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you should see how much they go for tribute :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">you should see how much they go for tribute :)<br />
<br />
Hmm, gotta check that out, I found 4-5 stacks on a vendor, myself  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Or...take the plat and half or less that it takes and turn them into Demi-Sec Champage.  At least on my server these sell fairly quickly for 50pp. (hehe, I used to get 500pp back in the day =/ This was a long time ago though, pre-PoP)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Serenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You're right, I didn't even take into account the cost of the gold bars.  I had bought them a week prior, so forgot their price, it's the opal's cost that was in the forefront of my brain :p.   I did buy up all they had and put them up with mine at 60pp.    Which might still be too low, I'm not sure what is a 'reasonable' sell price considering the cost is approaching 30pp to make.  (I used to sell for 100, but the highest out there now is 80).   I'm going to assume that Splunge is correct and it was due to a vendor dive -- one of the sellers has been a 250 brewer for quite some time, so I doubt he made them himself, and I know for a fact both that he vendor dives and that he makes a point of being low seller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nanndas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I attempted to make a stack about 6 weeks ago. I took a bath on them. I only successed on 11. I needed 1 for Lenann, my druid for his EoS and put the rest on my trader at 60pp trying to break even. At that time I was 15pp higher than the lowest reseller. 2 weeks later I found a stack on a vendor for 115pp. Now I have 30 and still no sales. I inched my prices down to be close to the lowest. Sold a few. They are now down to 25pp with large quantites on some traders. <br />
<br />
There are a few items that the current Bazaar pricing is wacked out. Take Prismatic dyes. I was making them in 3 stack lots. Raw components are 590 a stack from the vendor. It takes 3 combines to make them and I always seemed to end up with 17-18. This works out to around 33pp each for my cost. I'd sell at 45-47 each. A few times lately some trader has had them for 37.5 pp each. So I just stopped going through the trouble (and huge cash outlay) of making them. <br />
<br />
Then HMP at 2pp each, GLM at 1.8. Players won't buy handmade backpacks when the price is 75pp, but those same players sell the pelts at 45-50 each and we eat the odd failures. So I may start to use the same time it takes me to make the product and go and kill greenies for pelts and silks...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Haha   :dedhorse:   This just has to be in this thread.<br />
<br />
But yeah, Champagne Magnums are great vendor dives, I usually find them associated with excess lacquered gems and the like. (or at least I used to, I heard from a friend that lacquered gems cant be sold to a vendor anymore, if so, I wonder what inspired this nerf?)</div></div><hr />
