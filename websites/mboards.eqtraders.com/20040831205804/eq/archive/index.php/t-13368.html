<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My friend has a 250 Jewelry skill. I just bought her 2 Artisan's Seals as a gift. I looked up the recipe for the Trophy and saw you need one seal and one glass shard. Do you think in one or 2 attempts she could get the trophy?<br />
What is the average amount of attempts with a 250 Skill?<br />
I saw it is for a +50 Cha item.....are there more than one Trophy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dalur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would assume that with 250 and a gear lock it shouldn't be a problem on first try - but you have to factor in the RNG.<br />
<br />
I was at 247 pottery when I made my gearlock.<br />
<br />
There is a GM trophy for each trade skill.  But you obviously can only use 1 at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>scrubfire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It took me 4 attempts to make my GM trophy.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taushar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I got mine on the first try on JC one. However, I have managed to get all 7 trophies and at 250 skills, I averaged about 50% range. So, theoretically and the RNG being &quot;normal&quot; you should be able to get the trophy in 2 tries. Good luck to your friend.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My first trophy was on my enchanter in JC.  I got it on the first try.  I then attempted the pottery trophy on my druid.  I failed 6.  Got tired of failing those, so I spent 3 AAs and GMd brewing and failed a brewing trophy.  I then attempted another pottery trophy and was successful.  There are horror stories of 10+ failures on trophies, but most do get it in a few tries (2-3).  Note some of my pottery failures were in the 230s + geerlok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>data9724</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Took me 8 tries on the brewing one (of course the one where you need a corking device, 750p-1K extra cost pr try), made in 2nd try on all the others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Collwyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">*lol* Took me 11 tries for my JC trophy at 250 skill.  Was just a poor luck.  Sounds like averages are 1 in 2 or 1 in 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">it took me 4 tries on my baking one at skill 212</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zakaton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did it just tonight with a 240 skill and a Geerlok. As far as I know there's no extra benefit for going over 240 when you have a Geerlok as you'll hit the 252 cap anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zeari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">New GM jeweller on AB tonight with Eyeglass on first try with no skill mods and 216 int !! Had to do it before it became too easy tomorrow!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">on my cleric it took 4 tries for the JC trophy<br />
<br />
on my ranger it took 6 tries :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tshesebe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It took me 11 tries to get my JC trophy with 250 skill.  One of the failures was &quot;cooking the aritsan's seal&quot; in the kiln :steamed:   yea, I had 129 in Pottery &amp; I failed on a FIFTEEN trivial! <br />
<br />
   I petitioned, and a kind hearted guide convinced me not to smash my computer with my bass guitar. :steamed:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Andevian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I got my trophy in 3 attempts, started trying at 250+geerlok (252) skill. The only thing different worth mentioning on the third attempt was that I used a planar kit instead of the regular kit, don't know if that matters. I've also heard that the RNG has excessive low streaks in PoK and Bazaar, so I always do important combines in one of my two &quot;superstition&quot; locations. The two failed attempts were in Erudin Palace in front of the vendor I did half of my skilling up on, the successful attempt was in front of the Felwithe vendor I did the rest of my skilling up on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Saellis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">252 (with geerlok), first attempt success at JC GM trophy.<br />
<br />
good thing I didn't read these boards before trying. I would have been too scared to spend my plat on the attempt :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tingteng</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">1st try at 220 skill.<br />
<br />
ya I was pushing it hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>MoggeTreestump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">When I attempted all of my trophies(i have one for each) I was already 252 modified with geerlok(except maybe pottery). Brewing, Baking, JC I failed once each(first 3 I made). Smithing, Pottery and Fletching I didnt fail any(next 3 I made). Tailoring(the last) was a real bitch....I failed 3(maybe 4) times.  So overall I had about a 50% success rate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Doze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It took me 2 attempts to get my trophy at 244 + gearlock at lvl 34.  I am now lvl 41 and pushing hard for velium at 44.</div></div><hr />

Good luck</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jarak_akn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I got it first time at 247 + Geerlock</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">At 250, it took me 2 tries to get my Baking trophy (first time I forgot to equip the geerlok). About average, it looks like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Nilwean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">3 Attempts for Fletching.<br />
1 Attempt for Baking/Brewing/Jewlery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Arista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It took me 2 tries to get my jewelcraft trophy. On another character of mine, it took 2 tries to get the baking trophy. Both had 250 skill and geerlok at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>vovinit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">To sum up what everyone is basically saying, it's a roll of the dice. I got mine at 242 on first try. But I have known several who failed 4 times at 250 skill. One guildy got his gm eyeglass at 212 first try. You just have to take a shot at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Yelram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Finally got my JC trophy on the 5th attempt ( 252 w/geerlok every attempt).  I think the game knew that I had stopped caring by that point and so let me have it.  I am not insane enough to attempt one for another skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>maartena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I got one in ONE try, with 250 skill plus the Geerlok.</div></div><hr />
