<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Straay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering if someone could give me some good areas to hunt for spiderling silks.  I've been hunting Rockhoppers for the LQ Hides, as I can also use the Greyhopper Hides for skill ups in tailoring.  Drops have been fair there, but when I went after spiderling silks, I couldn't seem to find any.  I killed 10 spiderlings in Feerrott, and got 1 silk, EC and NRo didn't even get me that.  The buggers go down in one hit, but it's a pita to track them down kill them, and get nothing, especially with a 100 skeletal conscripts juming on you as you go looking for them.  So any suggestions on good place to farm the silks, and better places than Marus Seru for hides?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nalien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you are just using LQ Rockhopper hides then you can go to shadeweavers and kill lesser shades and silkworms. Those silks combine to threads that can be used on LQ Rockhopper hides only. The benefit also being that the lesser shades sometimes drop swirling shadows useful for shadowscream armor or just to sell in the bazar for some profit.<br />

I haven't done any serious analysis, but it's fairly obvious that something is different.</div></div><hr />

Naw, it's just bad luck. My usual spiderling silk farm nets *groan* me several stacks of silks per hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>pr1me</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I find that Everfrost seems to be the best area. Just pick a spot near Halas that's not swarming with lowbies and you'll have plenty of wooly spiderlings, wolves, and bear cubs to kill. Seems like the spawn rate was greatly increased in the low level areas of Everfrost when the 'zerker class was first introduced as well, so there should be plenty of mobs to go around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dmuerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I tried every area i could think of to get spiderling silks but they are so packed now with newbie trash that you will go crazy trying to get the silk now.  The best bet is to go the luclin route and use hopper hides and the appropriate silk from shadeweavers thicket.</div></div><hr />

Go to the Field of Bone.  If you're not an Iksar, be sure to give Cabilis a wide bearth, as Trooper Taer from the city has a fairly large patrol radius.  Don't go into the pit, but instead, find a small hill slightly into the woods west of the pit.  On the side of a hill facing away from the pit, you will find a tunnel sloping down into the bonebinder warrens.  As a general rule, the FoB is a big newbie area, but I generally find there is nobody in the warrens.  Entrance to the warrens is -300, 2600.  Spiderlings also congregate between the woods and the pit, but slightly north of the ruins nearby.  Not as many as typically in the warrens, though, and outside, there are a lot of annoying large/giant scropions which tend to aggro on someone minding his own business.  Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>tomojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you go to Shadeweavers, and it is crowded, you could go into Shar Val and kill the Xacra (sp) worms in the pit.  They also drop the silks to make the threads. They also drop the Xacra tooth that can be used in the fletching quest and making lots of xacra tooth darts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My two favorite spiderlings in all of Norrath: inside the brownie village in LFay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bregalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">When I was farming padding, most of my silks came from Feerrott - in particular, druid ring vicinity - they were all over.  However, since Ogre newbie armor quests went live, the drop table got heavily diluted by those quest items - before you often got a couple silks from almost every spiderling, now you might get silk from one out of ten.<br />
<br />
There are a couple underground complexes in Field of Bone, not far from Cabilis - lots of spiderlings there, but the respawn is fairly slow.<br />
<br />
Then there are crab spiderlings in Innothule near Gukta - but they seem to be day spawns, at night replaced by skellies/zombies. Zombies are also good to kill, though - their skins are useful to those working on pottery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>astianax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">my two favorite spots have already been mentioned, the bonebinder warrens in field of bone (occasionally, a named lvl 5 or so spider pops in there, tend to give the drops to local lizards), and the everfrost assembly line<br />
<br />
the former's spawn is a bit slow, as stated elsewhere, but it is a nice place with only spiderlings and very few youngsters to compete with. <br />
as for the latter, not sure if everything still wanders a big circle since i haven't visted in about 6 months. but it was nice of all the newbie critters to wander up to you instead of being chased down</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Qedin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Make sure if you go to Shadeweavers you hunt near the PC entrance cave.  Above and just around it there are plenty of skellies to kill.  I know I can get about 20 swirling shadows and more silk than i know what to do with in a hours time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Faerel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">By far the best place I've found for spiderling silks is the newbie area just outide Gukta. They only seem to spawn during the day but there are plenty of them. I usually use my lv12 ranger to hunt them for good measure. If you need zombie skins too, zombies replace the spiderlings at night  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Since the 2 Spiderlings in Brownie camp in Lfay are guaranteed to be productive, why don't more folks take advantage of them?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because brownies are both KoS to everyone, and relatively high level versus the rest of the zone (and many farmers).   Most would rather kill green spiderlings in places where everything else is green, and thus unlikely to attack, then to kill 2 spiderlings in a spot where you must also kill a bunch of tough non green mobs.   On the plus side, bakers love the brownie parts  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have a rather unconventional method of farming Leather Padding, but I find it yields a lot more.  <br />
<br />
If you kill rockhoppes, you will get LQ,MQ, HQ hides in much higher quantities, and you will get the $$ hides often as well.  The hides for tailoring drop just dandy in Shadeweavers if that is all you are looking for.<br />
<br />
However, the real money is in the luclin thread.  If you use rockhopper hides, it allows you to use Shade Silk thread as well as regular thread for padding.  This is especially useful because you can massacre the little silk worms in Shadeweavers for silk, which have dropped as many as 5 at a time for me...but /drumroll. A little known fact is that the black Aliens in shadeweavers, and other parts of Luclin drop silk as well, and they have TONS of it.  If you go and clear the caves in Shadeweavers, I have regularly gotten 2-3 stacks per clearing, and only rarely under 1 stack. <br />
<br />
The lower quality rockhoppper hides tend to sell for less than their old world counterparts in the bazaar on my server as well, when I am feeling especially lazy.</div></div><hr />

When I got to the caves in shadowweaver all I found is gorta ko(for got the name...) the yellow alien, and no more than 6 shark xxx.<br />
<br />
where did you hunt to get so much silks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Valeanx Madpath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">On the north zone wall in shadeweavers near the center of zone from east to west there are mobs that pop very rapidly. Just use your cycle through NPCs key and find them with the 3d target ring. As far as I can tell, everything is a PH for everything else, and lesser shades spawn very often. They drop shadeling silks and have about 100 hps.<br />

<br />
The shak dratha and gor taku are a day/night cycle - which can be annoying as you can't tell the time on Luclin. Best bet is to stay in PoK until 5pm or so in-game, then run to the caves and kill gor taku; when they respawn, it should be as shak dratha.<br />
<br />
Then when they start respawning as gor taku again (i.e. it's morning) do /time, make a note of it and then go kill in shade corner for half an hour or so.</div></div><hr />

I dont think it is a good farm spot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Shade silks are used to make shade silk armor (trivial mid to high 20s, depending on the piece), and cured shade skil armor (trivial at 82ish.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Piikaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">If you are a class that has &quot;Sense Undead&quot; and an extended range item, it makes farming the silks quite easy in Shadoweavers. I would stand on a rock, cycle through Sense Undead / Nuke undead (one of my lower nukes as they only have a few HP's). I could do this for 4-5 min, then go around and gather them up. Another trick is to find a lowbie, group with them and have them do the looting for me while I nuke.<br />
<br />
Additionally, since I'm a lvl 65 cleric, I can run around and kill the shades and all the other MOB's as fast as they can pop. YMMV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Alenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">a little secret for farming shadeling silks ive discovered...go to Shar Val and jump off the bridge into where the mobs are.  You are looking for the silk worms.  Heres the trick....everytime something dies, another mob &quot;insta falls&quot; near you...so just kill everything you see, and loot the worms.  I get about a stack of silk every 20 minutes or so if im focus and not chit chatting &gt;&lt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Zeralenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I agree that spiderling silk drop rates have been seriously nerfed. I am trying to get my poor lil' necro some cash on Tarew Marr (thanks for the attempted twinking, Tink, but I'm doin' this the hard way!) and have decided that farming low level tradeskill items is the way to fly. I killed probably twenty of the crab spiderlings in Gukta and yielded only about five silks. I had slightly better luck in Halas, but the spawn rate there is SO high that as a real newbie I had a lot of problem just keeping alive, since running to the guards is really out for a DE necro. However, you can also get a lot of bone chips, which, if you are really ultrapoor like my lil' necro, actually sell reasonably well in the bazaar (which then funds making celestial essence ... hee hee).<br />
