<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tawnos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hit 242 with a variety of geerloks and collapsible toolboxes almost entirely from bazaar-purchased materials.  There is not a sufficient quantity of materials sold in the bazaar to skill up very much after 242, so i'm assuming i have to start farming POI for drops for the gauze press.  Is there any particular area in POI in which the drops are highly concentrated, or should i just kill in random places?  Does it seem viable attempting to 2-box enough POI mobs to get 4 stacks or so of gauze press combines to supplement the 3 or so i've managed to scrounge from the bazaar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gumble Tinkertumble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just kill random mobs in the main areas. I haven't seen as many drops from some of the side rooms for instance.</div></div><hr />

Wow that's wrong!  It drops in PoInnovation, like all the other Tinkering stuff.  I've hunted tons and tons in BoT and they don't drop there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been lucky to having bought about 10 stacks in the bazaar from a certain trader, but if it wasn't for him I would have had a serious 'pinion' problem ages ago.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Whizbang_Dustyboots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I found the Velious recipes -- specifically the GVDs and cultural armor (the upgrade to our Velious armor) -- to be a lot easier to do than endless woks and other PoI combines.<br />

I know it won't seem like it when you're spending yet another evening in Wakening Lands or begging other people to help you out, but you really can get more drops there. It's not cheap on diamonds or blue diamonds, though, so I hope you've been banking both them if you go this route ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lomerax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">if your server's elemental planes are excessively overcamped as my own, molten ore becomes a very viable option for skilling. ive seen molten ore for as low as 30p each.. that and a bunch of foraging in PoI and you have an easy skill up path with not nearly the difficulty of farming poi for drops</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>tawnos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks for the tip on the elemental bow cams.  I had thought they trived in the 220's for some reason.  Now my druid is going to find a new home in poi while foraging grease.</div></div><hr />
