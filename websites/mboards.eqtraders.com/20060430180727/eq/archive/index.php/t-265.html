<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arhallia</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the recipes page for smithed, non-cultural weapons, there is both a Black Acrylia &quot;war hammer&quot; AND a Black Acrylia &quot;battle hammer&quot; listed (with different trivials).<br />
<br />
While there is a recipe for a regular forged war hammer (Called a &quot;War Maul&quot; I think, when its the Black Acrylia version), there is no corresponding &quot;battle hammer&quot; (1HB?) recipe.  If this recipe exists, it is not listed on the site.<br />
<br />
I'd love to make a 1H Black Acrylia hammer, so I'm desperately hoping there's just a missing recipe -- but I've been a smith for a long while, and I feel pretty confident that there is no such thing as a smithed 1H hammer (not that I make many weapons!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazick</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I was entering this into the database, I noticed this discrepency. Looking at the Weapons Attributes page there is only a listing for a Black Acrylia War hammer (no battle hammer). <br />
<br />
I did enter a recipe for the war hammer, but did not try to create one for a battle hammer, since no other metal type has a battle hammer item.<br />
<br />
I probably should have reported this at that time. I expect it was a report of &quot;battle hammer&quot; that got recorded, when it should have been &quot;war hammer&quot;.<br />
<br />
Not being of high enough skil to attempt this, nor having enough materials I cannot confirm or deny the existance of any recipe for a &quot;battle hammer&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sometimes, when I'm doing dozens of trivial updates in one fell swoop, it's very easy for me to just do edits on autopilot and not stop and think about whether what was reported in makes total sense or not.  :O</div></div><hr />
