<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Minta Rose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Mines of Nurga, which I've always found on Kunark, seems to have burrowed up to make a new entrance on Velious.<br />
<br />
Also, the Swamp of No Hope has expanded past Kunark and fused with the original world.<br />
<br />
Are Nedaria's Landing and The Hole &quot;free zones&quot; a la Jaggedpine Forest?  They aren't original ones.<br />
<br />
I attribute all errors to gnomish burrowing expeditions for the dual purposes of laying track for now-outmoded rapid transit continental transfer by wheeled mine cart and placement and detonation of earthquake induction coils for the objective of recording geomantic tremors and seeking correllations for the forecast of future earthquakes set off by invading alien races with gnomish technology.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, they're both free &quot;Optional&quot; zones, and available without any expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well those two flubbed assignments (Mines of Nurga &amp; Swamp of No Hope) have been put back in Kunark. Thanks for the note.<br />
<br />
As for Nedaria's Landing, Jagged Pine Forest, The Hole, Stonebrunt Mountains, The Warrens... they are off of the original continents and don't need any of the expansions... unless the Mac based Server doesn't support them.. So they are classified as &quot;Original&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">bleh.. ok Fixed them up so that the &quot;Free&quot; Zones actually have &quot;Free&quot; rather than &quot;Original&quot;...</div></div><hr />
