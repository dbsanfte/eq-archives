<br />
EQ Traders Corner is NOT in the business of setting prices. Prices vary from server to server, based on all sorts of factors. You will have to watch your server's auction/trade zones and/or channels and see what people are buying/selling and what prices they are charging. You should also check your server's Marketplace forum to see if there are ongoing dicussions of prices on your server.<br />
<br />
It is important to realize that no one can tell you what your price &quot;needs to be&quot; or &quot;should be&quot; except you. Seek advice all you want, but the final choice remains yours. <br />
<br />
You may also wish to check the Primal Scream Room, since there is almost ALWAYS a &quot;discussion&quot; of pricing going on in there. <br />
<br />
Since it is the firm policy of EQ Traders Corner not to set prices, any information you gather from these forums should be considered as advice only.</div></div><hr />
