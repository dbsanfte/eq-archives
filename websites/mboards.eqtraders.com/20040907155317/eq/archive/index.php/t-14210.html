<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I thought I was going to use these for skill ups, b/c I am a leather padding merchant, and the market had slowed down for a bit.  Plus a buddy was skilling up in smithing and so I gave him some leather and asked him to make small fine plate boots as he skilled up even though they are not the most efficient choice.<br />
<br />
He gave me 41 boots, and I went to gather the other supplies from Tabben in PoK only to realize that Sharkskin tubing was 141pp per [I don't know why I thought these were 3pp or so, d'oh!], and that the sell back (after I succeeded once) was only 65 or so.<br />
<br />
So it's a pricy option.  I already had the 41 boots, so I tried them (actually only 39 as two got lost and I need to find them on an alt).  I did get three skill ups from 223 to 226.  I think I will gather some more quills and riggings and do another batch of geerloks, then perhaps I may do another batch of footwarming boots, say, 60 and just pretend I am doing tailoring, in terms of cost.  I'll hate life for a while, but getting to 235 will be all the closer to 240.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did anyone else use this path?  Was my 3 skill ups in 39 tries extra lucky, or do these offer a good rate of skill up in exchange for the high price?  In my experience, storebought bows were like that for fletching, expensive, but much more likely to yield a skill up than the cheaper arrows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i was skilling up smithing and offered boots to a friend.  we thought it was a good idea until she saw the tubing.  yeah it hurts man.  we vetoed the idea.  think there are lots of better options even with free boots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ixiola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I primarily did the Gunthak Geerloks and collapsable kits from the high teens to 240.  I didn't keep track of my skill up rate, but 3 out of 39 doesn't seem exceptionally good to me.  My reaction is that unless you have a market for this, this isn't the best skillup path.</div></div><hr />
