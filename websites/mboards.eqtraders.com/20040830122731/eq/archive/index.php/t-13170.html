<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cragzop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm curious how the titles work. I know they are related to the number of posts an author has, but what are the thresholds?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes, they are related to  postcount, but the staff does not say what the thresholds are; they don't want people artificially inflating their own postcount to get higher titles. <br />
<br />
yeah, a few people have custom ones, but I have no knowledge of how that comes about. manual editing, etc. /shrug. <br />

Krazick's catching up to you, Lilosh, what with all those Database Updates posts he makes. Better watch out. <br />
^_^<br />

<br />
Ok, for real. I can understand the placement of most everyone in that list. But... eniamn? The guy is a noob, he's barely been here for 5 months and he's already beat me?  Where all is he posting? What does he say? Is he using more enter breaks than he used to?<br />

(This post has been entirely in jest, no offense to any named individuals is intended, esp eniamn, it's just some odd manifestation of what passes for my 2:30 am 'humor'.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, I haven't been posting much at all lately.<br />
<br />
<br />
No wonder Krazick is catching up.  :-(<br />
<br />
<br />
I still have more than Ngreth and Niami combined, though.  <br />
