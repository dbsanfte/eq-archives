I was stuck at 194 baking. I made Ohabah Truffles until my entire guild refused to take any more. I made Candied Cockroaches until Orkin called and asked me to stop taking all their cockroaches. And still I sat at 194. :zombie:<br />
<br />
Then last night, I found a cache of cragbeast meat. And I decided to go for it. 15 stacks of GoD baking combines later (and all the subcombines) and I'm at 213 baking. <br />
<br />
Happy Happy Joy Joy. I have found my new home. I may never leave the Abysmal Sea again.<br />
<br />
:love:</div></div><hr />

Don't forget *MTP's* that you can use some other *MTP's* recipe's as well that are actually *MTP'S* not that bad, especially with the new UI *MTP'S*. Like Misty Thicket Picinics...<br />
