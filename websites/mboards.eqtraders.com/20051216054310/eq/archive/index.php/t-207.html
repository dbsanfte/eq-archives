<br />
&lt;center&gt; Please keep in mind I will NOT forge the items unless you are on-line at the time. So soon as I see ye and have confirmation, it shall be done.&lt;/center&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;center&gt;    I sometimes have a mule in Bazaar with some Heraldic Pieces PREMADE - Keep an eye out for Tradeskillz OR Purtynpurple <br />
<br />
Currently OUT OF Imbued Diamonds (Mith Marr)<br />
&lt;/center&gt;<br />
<br />
SOME Imbues allow races other then just Hum/Hef to wear. For example to Rallos Zek imbue lets a BUNCH of races wear, Veeshan imbue lets Wood Elves wear as well, and non imbued allows ALL Barbarians to wear.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind you MUST worship the deity of the imbue to be able to wear that imbue type. For example, for any Rallos Zek imbued armor, you must follow Rallos Zek to wear it.<br />
<br />

Method to obtain Armor:<br />
<br />
1.) Put in an order for a piece(s) and wait until I am able to attempt it, then I will notify you once I gain the item. I will hold the item for up to a week, and if you do not email me or otherwise say you're still interested, it will be sold. For larger/set orders I will work with you to make a package deal. <br />
<br />
I DO accept Blue Diamonds in trade, generally valued at a 500pp each credit. I also accept Essences of Sunlight in trade, which I will value at 150p each.<br />
<br />
Gorgets or Visors - 6k each<br />
Bracers/Boots - 7k each<br />
Arms, Pauldrons, Gauntlets, Helms, Belts - 14k each<br />

I am saving up (mainly BDs) and wanted to know if / how much you would credit for Raw Diamonds.  I would need the agnostic version.</div></div><hr />
