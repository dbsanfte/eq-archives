I have lots of stacks of various meats.  Most other races say eww. <br />
<br />
I've noticed several of us indulging in this habit.  Or is it becasue us dorfs are unmannered are noisy eaters?<br />
<br />
What do you think?</div></div><hr />

Failing his first artisans seal attempt in the pottery wheel drove my halfling baker mad.<br />
<br />
He now collects any cannibal meat he sees , and bakes it into yummy food, then gives it to members of the appropriate race,<br />

Inkies hate it when you give them blackened Tier'Dal.<br />

Cannibalistic foods are very fun.  I wish they'd add more.  Always fun to offer a Gnome some Gnome Kabobs.   :mrgreen:</div></div><hr />

Invisibly... there's no faction message, it just decreases.<br />
<br />
Seems to me I had a friend that was barred from his own home city because some baker gave him a couple stacks of his own racial food, which he thought was funny so he ate em and ignored it... only to find he was KOS to his own race.<br />

Had to get a GM to fix it for him. ;)</div></div><hr />
