   Another trick I do with Garshok a lot is to simply do a /who all ogre shaman 29 50. Then I pick the lowest one who seems to be in a zone where he/she/it probably isn't getting exp (i.e., Nexus, SH, Feerot, etc.) and send a tell asking if they are willing to imbue jade for 200 or250pp a stack. Then I'll  have them come to Nexus, buy them a KEI, and sit with them while they do a few stacks.<br />
<br />
  Takes awhile, but that's good money for someone in the 30s or 40s if they aren't a twink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zugwugger</div><div class="date">03-24-2003, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I spent a week thinking the Shaman had to Follow Rallos to imbude jade.  Not true just has to be an Ogre Shaman lvl 29.  I've bought about 3 stacks.  One time it paid nothing just gave the jade.  the other two I paid 30 pp Plus the jade to imbude the stack.  Then running threw the bazaar totally Broke i head a auction asking for a Ogre shaman Asked if they need Imbuded Jade they said yes.  I gave them 8 and they insisted on giving me 400pp for them (umber twink).  So unless your like Some lvl 65 who thinks 200pp is chump change look around do a favor be nice you can get them for 20pp -40pp a stack.  (when i have money I'd offer 50 pp 3pp per cast seams fair eh? depends on how umber they are.)  I'm twinking a Ogre Shaman right now just to Imbud jade.  (lvl 12 now but will be there send them a tell) Wuggerzug Ogre Shaman.  Buy the way i try and keep a supply of Blood Templer and Imbude jade in the bank so any Ogre Smiths or Jewlers on Quellious I wount have a problem LOANING some from time to time if the favor can be returned.  <br />
<br />
One more thing it is kinda of nice having a main at 33 that can make his own armor fairly Decent for his level. <br />
