<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>octagon999</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, this is my dumb question.<br />
<br />
I cannot figure out how to make certain small fine plate pieces.  When I try and make, for example, small fine plate greaves, I cannot get the recipe to show up, and I cannot figure out how to make the forge open in such a way as to allow manual smithing.  Obviously I am overlooking or missing something obvious.<br />
<br />
If someone could point me in the right direction, I would be grateful.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seksi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">To find the piece you are looking for change the range of trivial to min trivial 150 max trivial 200 and type in the search fine plate.  It should then pull up all fine plate pieces that have trivial between 150 and 200.  I know it works because just this morning i was working on fine plate and got to 177 on fine plate pieces.  Both small and large also showed up.<br />

The new UI is wonderful.  I love it!!!  Unfortunatly I had already made over 200 leather padding the old fashioned way :( .. my wrist is still hurting.  <br />
<br />
Good luck!!!<br />

click the experiment button on the UI  <br />

That worked.  Unfortunately, all the small fine plate pieces don't show up, even limiting the trivial range.  But, whatever works.<br />
<br />
Thank you for quickly helping my frustration.</div></div><hr />
