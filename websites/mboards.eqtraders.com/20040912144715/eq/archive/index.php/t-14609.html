<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Windru Peacekeaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has everyone reached a consensus on how many variations of each meat type (cragbeast, hynid)?<br />
<br />
I seem to come up with 72 variations on each (not counting the dried variation).<br />
<br />
Barbequed, Beer-Battered, Beer-Braised, Buttered, Garlic-Buttered, Grilled, Lemon-Buttered, Smoked, and Spiced = 9.<br />
<br />
Jerky, Kabobs, Pie, Sandwich, Souffle, Soup, Steaks,  and Stew = 8.<br />
<br />
9 * 8 = 72, did I miss anything?<br />
<br />
Windru Peacekeaper, 199 baker, 3 skill ups testing the cragbeast variations</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Teaamillie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Multiply that by four types of meat: Hynid, Cragbeast, Crab, Tuna.<br />
<br />
Too many  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drubear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, it looks to my spreadsheet that:<br />
<br />
*) Tuna and Crab share recipes, while Cragmeat and Hynid do as well. <br />
<br />
*) Tuna/Crab do not have Jerky or Kabobs, while Crag and Hynid do not have Cakes. Crab alone has Appetizers while you can only make Tuna into a salad. <br />
<br />
*) The trivial level, &quot;benefit&quot; and complexity of the recipes rather steadily increase thru the sauces: Grilled, Spiced, Smoked, Buttered, Garlic-Buttered, Lemon-Buttered, Barbequed, Beer-braised and Beer-battered whereas the resultant items similarly go Sandwiches, Stew, Soup, Steaks, Appetizers/Salad/Jerky, Rolls/Kabobs, Cakes, Pies and finally Souffles. <br />
<br />
*) Crab and Tuna trivials are generally below Crag/Hynid recipes, altho it seems that pies and souffles share the same trivial tables across the sauces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Windru Peacekeaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks!<br />
<br />
I've postponed newbie farming for snake eggs, it just seems that fishing for crab and tuna seems more fun &lt;wink&gt;<br />
<br />
No, I swear, I didn't say a thing!<br />
<br />
But yea, I have made almost all of the cragbeast recipes except for some of the souffle's, because I ran out of eggs...and they all used 2 eggs.  I know someone else posted that in the updates section<br />
<br />
/gu Nite All! hehe</div></div><hr />
