<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">looking for some suggestions from guru smiths out there, <br />
<br />
I have a 41 DE Enchanter who so far has a smithing skill of 160, I Have a huge about 20 stacks of LQ and MQ pelts waiting for me to turn them into padding so I can make Fine Plate to 188.<br />
<br />
I am planning to make a bard, race not decided yet, twink him up a bit with bazaar gear untill he approaches the sort of level to wear cultural.<br />
<br />
My question is... what can my chanter smith, that is wearable by a bard, FYI bards cannot worship innoruuk so I'm wondering what if any my options are in respect to making non deity armor with good ac and hps for a bard to wear from his 30's up until he can start raiding or buying ornate.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can't wear any of the imbued armors without worshipping Inny.  Halfelves can wear many of the non imbued armors, including bards.  You can also make LDoN plate armors for your new bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah I thought as much, Ldon stuff doesnt appeal much at all and the tier'dal sovereign stuff is WAR SHD CLR only :(<br />
<br />
wish they would put bards on that then id be set, guess I'll have to buy stuff for him, oh well, I plan to continue on with smithing, still got 40k in the bank to blow might get me a bit past 200 hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you could make the bard smith.  /evil i am but still.  my main has all skill and my alts are getting the rp trade of choice.  bard seem like a good smith.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>lilsneezy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have to ask what problem you have witht he LDoN armors?  They all offer a nice AC and some good stat bonuses.  On top of that, they are the only armor I know of (and I could most certainly be wrong) that offers 2 augment slots.  For a toon approaching their 30's I think an armor item with stats and 2 aug slots is pretty nice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Minta Rose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Errr. . .Have you considered taking up jewelcrafting?  The sapphire velium necklace has better stats than your cultural armor.  On the other hand, acrylia plate might not be bad for awhile--high AC at least--although some recommended level armors might be better stats by the 30s.  (What are you using prior to 30, anyway--fungi and luck?)  Don't buy ornate, smith Tae Ew or tier one PoP armor, once your bard hits 51.<br />
<br />
LDoN smithed armor is a rare tradeable two-slot armor, but far far far below the level that someone with that kind of bankroll would buy for twinking.</div></div><hr />
