<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Corinari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When I look at the list of recipes you list all the other trade skills besideds Make Poison in the expansion breakdown.  Can you add the LoY and PoP poisons back to this listing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually, if you look at each of the tradeskills we mix-and-match the categorization quite a bit:<br />

 Jewelcraft is (Enchanted, Imbued, Non-Enchanted, PoP, and Other)<br />

 Tinkering is (Normal, Armor, Geerlok, Robes, Recharge)<br />
[/list=a] <br />
<br />
There are plans to add other types of categorization... but I wanted to summarize what the site is like now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I will leave that decision up to our lovely super duper great people and Database gnomes.<br />
<br />
We mostly have the sub categories where something had so many hits the page was too slow loading.<br />
<br />
We also have people complaining that we have too MANY sub categories... so we cannot please all people.  Some people wnat MORE some people want LESS.<br />
<br />
Because we have requests both ways, I am inclined to leavbe it as is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Panamah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/agree Corinari<br />
<br />
I know I don't mess with the other poisons so wading through the entire list is pretty time consuming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arcturos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have to agree with the original poster.  When I am looking for a poison I do care about trivials but I also care about the effects.  It is a real nuisance to have to scroll through dozens and dozens of entries looking for a specific poison effect, whether or not it is multi-charged, etc.  <br />
<br />
You have said you use multiple categories already &quot;Make Poison is (Sing Dose, Multi-Dose, Dye and Other)&quot;  but for me (and I am sure other rogues) that is not enough.  <br />
<br />
We do care if its a PoP tier 1, 2 or 3 poison.  It can make a difference as to what level MOB's the poison will work on.  We care about the effect.  Is it DD, DOT, debuff, snare, slow, etc?<br />
<br />
Please, try and add some search functionality in those areas.<br />
<br />
One other suggestion, instead of listing the same poison 3 times (single, 5 shot and 10 shot) would it be possible to just list it once and indicate that its multichargable or not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Folks? We're STILL not ready to take extra feature requests, so while it's all well and good for you to have your 'druthers, I'm closing this down before more folks add their 'me too's to here.<br />
<br />
We know there's a lot folks want ... and part of the problem is many of you want different things, some of you want conflicting things, and most of you want stuff that'll take more time than we're willing or able to put in right now.<br />
<br />
Sorry, gang, just can't go there right now.</div></div><hr />
