You know, I've decided it's cruel punishment to know on Friday that you're going to be laid off on Monday. Gives you the entire weekend to fret about it. Going through the want ads is about an hour's worth of time and then the rest of the day just stretches out before you in an endless wasteland of worry.<br />
<br />
Well, I'm off to the block. See you all when I return.</div></div><hr />

Things are rough all over.  I've been noticing a lot of this going around.  Things can't stay bad forever, hang in there, you'll find new employment. <br />

But I have to join with Lilosh in boo'ing and hiss'ing outsourcing things out of the country. My work got oursourced to Pakistan. GRRR</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our original story we heard was they were outsourcing us to New York and Canada.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then the boxes with &quot;INDIA&quot; printed on them started appearing.  And the computers in half the building started going into them.   Then we started seeing call notes from the indian call center.  Alot of call notes from India.   <br />
<br />
Welcome to the future. A global economy means everyone is proud to be an american until it comes time to pay their employees, and save a buck.<br />

It's sad to here about many of you out of work knowing that 6 idiots in Hollywood get 1 million dollars per episode and we keep watching the show.<br />
<br />
If corporate America keeps up with it's outsourcing policies, it will outsource itself right out of business because with out jobs, we won't be able to buy the goods they are producing.<br />
<br />
/em comforts Lilosh, Idara, and everyone else experiencing job loss due to the current economy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 I beginning to worry about what will happen to me. I'm suppose to retire from the military in September, if they'll let me with what's going on, and have to go out and get a job. I work some with computers, but don't know enough to really feel confident to get a job in the field.<br />
<br />
I like computers, but don't know if I'd really like a job in them anyway. Having to deal with &quot;Computer Illiterate&quot; people gets on my nerves at times.  Think I'll see what a Nursery (plants) or book store will give me in the way of pay. I like plants and reading so I'd fit in both of those jobs.<br />
<br />
Hope y'all find work soon. Keep your heads up, it's the only way to see the future/next job.</div></div><hr />
