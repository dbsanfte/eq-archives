<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bigtoxic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive never had reason to really come here except to offer support but now its my turn. Im Irish so its very hard atm to not throw out every curse word I know.  Ive been doing sol robes for for a bit( from 180 - 216 )  and i sat down to do a few more tonight. I had 300 combines ready in waiting. Started out good got skill up 215 after  3 combines....then $%#^%#%$&amp;$#$%$%#&amp;^%$*&amp;$^%$^%$*%^*^ 256 tries later i get  my second skill up...yes that 256....id have a better chance at getting hit by a falling star.  Im a troll warrior but with int gear..VoQ and tributes  i can get int to 280....there is no way in hell i should have to  fail 256 times in a row...id have better shot winning the lottery.  This has almost pushed me to the point of not only saying to hell with Aid Grimil quest but EQ alltogether.</div></div><hr />

The RNG is a harsh mistress!</div></div><hr />

Did you not MAKE any robes or not get any SKILL-UP for 256 tries. <br />
<br />
Not making ANY would be significantly out of average. You'd figure at least 15 successes even at the 5% minimum rate.<br />
<br />
No skill ups for 256 tries with an average of 1 in 40 (for the 215 skill range on a 335 trivial) is pretty low. You'd expect 6.3 skill ups.<br />
<br />
I'm too fuzzy right now to do the math right... but roughly..<br />
<br />
(39/40) ^ 256 = 0.00153 which is about 1/6th of a percent. Or in about 600 people doing 256 trials of 1 in 40 expectation one poor bugger gets none, while one REALLY LUCKY son-of-two-brothers gets 13.<br />
<br />
You are very unlucky. But presuming there are 240,000 people playing EQ... there are 399 people who are even more unlucky than you. (1 in 600)<br />
<br />
And think of it this way. If you figure life is like the &quot;bag of luck&quot; in which there are 10 good luck pearls and 10 bad luck pearls with no way to tell the difference.... maybe you have just taken the last of the bad luck and have only good luck coming for a while. (Which would be really sweet the next time you /rand for a nice item.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigtoxic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah i  was successful in making  making 20ish robes...cant remember the exact because wasnt keeping track. Its a day later and Im still upset because 256 combines without a skill up is just harsh. I could have taken off oll my int gear removed VoQ...not used the tribute int and with a base of 40int i bet i could have gotten better rate that that.</div></div><hr />
