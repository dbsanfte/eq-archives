<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Uh,  Fine Plate.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Be sure to check your cultural though.  As a wood elf, it would be better making the Fier'Dal Fletching kits til 163 (for example) and then move to fine plate to 188.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bregalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fine plate has lots of subcombines, but those are simplified with the new UI.  Especially if you farm your own padding (Marus Seru greyhoppers and Feerott spiderlings are it), it is fairly cheap as well.  If you don't want to farm, you can buy padding - but that will immediately double (if not more) your costs.<br />
<br />
One option of getting to 168 is humming orbs.  Run the Vah Shir quests, get their hammer and anvil, and go farm wolves/bears in Hollowshade.  Both wailing and shrieking substance are nodrop, so only people farming there are actual smiths - you don't have to compete with resellers.  Make humming orbs to 168, and stash them onto a storage alt - you'll need them at later stages of smithing.  Again, if you are not farmer type, this can be real tedious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaaba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also if you are a Karana worshipper, you can get to 188 by making steel arrowheads, which are all store bought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nanndas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As a wood elf Druid I went from 121 - 163 doing cultural fletching kits. Took 165 combines at around 7pp each. Stocked the bank in Felwithe with ore and then back and forth from mold vendor-bank-forge. Just dropped kits on ground as vendors only gave 7s for them.<br />
<br />
Is my next step fineplate or is there another avenue to get higher ?<br />

Do the humming orbs stack?  I thought they didn't.  That's what makes that recipe very unappealing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Twistagain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Correct...they do NOT stack. I personally have a mule who has a bank completely full of these things, waiting on swirling shadows to proceed further with the Shadowscream.<br />
<br />
And, to answer the question before it's asked, I was using them to skillup earlier...that's why I didn't just hold onto the substances until I had enough shadows to do combines.</div></div><hr />
