<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>larpaul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've decided to start pottery with my Lvl 26 Dwarven Cleric. I started last night and was able to skill up to 120. I'm about to start on the poison vials, and had a question about Wisdom and the Geerlok. My Wisdom stands at 200. However, if I equip the Geerlok, I lose 9 Wisdom gained from my weapon. Should I keep the weapon equiped or the Geerlok? I was thinking that the Geerlok only gives you a better chance at a successful combine rather than increasing the odds of a skill up occuring. Can someone clarify this for me. So far, I really like pottery and plan to take it all the way up to 250! Thanks for all the great info on this board.<br />
