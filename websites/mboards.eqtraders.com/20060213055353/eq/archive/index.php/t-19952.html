This place used to be so active.  No more tradeskillers on this server?</div></div><hr />

Not around nearly so much any more, but do still play.</div></div><hr />

I thought about the old 1750 guys on RN, and how many of them are left...I can't seem to list a single one that still plays regularly.  Galem still plays, but tradeskillers like Dissonant, Krysk, Mother, and others aren't around any more.<br />
<br />
As I try for 2100, I think of all the tradeskillers I've met during my time on EQ and of all those tradeskillers no longer playing EQ.  It helps keep me going.<br />

300s!?  When did they raise the cap?  Or is this another of those things they made to bleed me of my hard earned AAs?</div></div><hr />

<br />
 The cap was raised to 300 with the Feb 15th patch, when DoN was launched.  (But you don't have to own DoN to skill up to 300.)<br />
<br />
You can skill up to 300 in all the basic skills, and also Alchemy, Make Poison, Tinkering, and Spell Reasearch (if you are of a class or race that can access these 4 skills of course.)  <br />
<br />
Also, the last 4 are no longer level capped - once you reach the level necessary to learn the skill (ex: level 16 for Spell Research), you can skill up all the way to max.  You can't train them at the guildmaster past 20 anymore, however.<br />
<br />
You do not need further AA to skill up to 300.</div></div><hr />

Hehehe....guess not.  Just printed the latest (LONG) patch message and will read it during lunch.  Sony just renewed my annuals subscriptions, so I guess it's time to get logged back in and get something for my money!<br />
<br />
See ya soon....</div></div><hr />
