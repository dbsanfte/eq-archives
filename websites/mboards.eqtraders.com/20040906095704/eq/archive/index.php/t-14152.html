<br />
As with every new expansion the ranting and fuming and probably a bit of crying has started up in full force.  People are upset about various things, and you know what? I have yet to hear a new one. Since people can spend hours writing out a rant just to say what has been said countless times before, only to be flamed back by people saying &quot;yeah, heard it before&quot;, Ive come up with a &quot;Game&quot; we can play. The game is called *Trumpets flare*<br />
<br />
The Standard Rant List!!!<br />
<br />
The game is simple, just post what you consider are some very common rants(need not be tradeskill related), and I will compile the list to save us all time. Instead of the 3 page rant on how the market prices on X has crash a person can now just say &quot;SRL #78!!!!!&quot; and everyone will go &quot;Ug! I know how you feel&quot; or &quot;Man, SRL #45...deal!&quot;.<br />
<br />
At the moment I have:<br />
I hate n00bs<br />
<br />
I hate quad kiters<br />
<br />
I hate SoE<br />
<br />
I hate Verant<br />
<br />
I hate the customer service since Verant became SoE<br />
<br />
I hate how the Aid Grimel Quest has turned everyone and their uncle into a GM<br />
<br />
I hate how all the new GMs have bottomed out the price on item Z, X, Y, and LMNOP!<br />
<br />
You all have it so easy, when I started playing we had hell levels<br />
<br />
You all have it so easy, when I started playing we didnt even have items LMNOP, Q, X, and of course the infamous A!<br />
<br />
Kill stealers!<br />
<br />
Tailoring sucks to GM!<br />
<br />
Smithing sucks to GM!<br />
<br />
Oh yeah? Try Pottery to GM!(I gave each of them their own one because well... we get so many rants on them they deserve it)<br />
<br />
Oh yes, one rule. Please dont write a full page rant in order to add your idea to the list. A simple summary like Ive posted will do. If you feel the absoluete need for a full page rant, send it to me in private message, that way we wont force people to read it, but I can still add it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Farnyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Perfect Eniamn! :D  Just a note, when I get enough submissions Im going to create an official list with the more common rants near the top (Most popular = #1), but for now, we can just use the numbers all of you come up with.  :cheers:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wow.  List of rants.  This is fun, but dangerous.  I'll try to keep it nice.<br />
<br />
Those who annoy or anger:<br />
<br />
1.) People who want buffs that use reagents but don't want to pay for the reagent.<br />
<br />
2.) People who ask for a rez or buffs and then demand you come to them (assuming you're already in the same zone).<br />
<br />
3.) People who think that all Halflings are druids.  I'm wearing plate, darn it!  I can't cast SoW.<br />
<br />
4.) Pullers who don't stop when asked to hold pulls.<br />
<br />
5.) On the other side, casters and healers (glances around with contrition) who forget to call OOM when the puller asks.<br />
<br />
6.) Camp hogs.  When you're just camping for loot or experience (not for quests or specific drops), share a bit.  When I leave you to the camp, and return eight hours later and you're still there, it's time to let it go.<br />
<br />
7.) Pet masters who let their pet roam all over the dungeon.  No, I won't rez you the fourth time you lose your dumb dog around a corner.<br />
<br />
8.) People dumb enough to cast fear in an LDoN.  'Nuff said.<br />
<br />
9.) &quot;Train to zone!&quot;  Be a little more specific, eh?<br />
<br />
10.) Doorstops.  Yes, you need to talk to the banker like everyone else.  No, you don't need to sit and med/heal in the bank, in front of the door.  And no, this doesn't apply only to ogres, you half-elven door-plugger.  I hope the big Halfling footprint I put on your cloak getting over you doesn't wash out.<br />
<br />
11.) Bazaar Blockers.  Did you REALLY need to set up trader mode right in front of me, so close I can see the inside of your armor?<br />
<br />
That'll give you some entries to add, I hope.<br />

PS.  I'm going to keep the words &quot;Half-elven door plugger&quot; in reserve, for when I *REALLY* need to call someone something nasty. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Speckocat Catnippurr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">41.   Bazaar Door Stops When you zone into the bazaar to shop, med, camp, whatever....move out of the zone hallway!!!!!  Two of my most-played toons are vah shir.  If an ogre is standing in the center of the hallway--particularly if wearing something like deep cavern armor (I think that's what that bulky stuff is)--wee folk &amp; elves might be able to squeeze by, but my kitty ain't movin'.  :idea:?  Walk eight more paces and make a right or left turn.  I'm not trying to pick or ogres (or trolls) so don't flame me.  A good pile up of smaller toons happens at least as often and causes the same traffic jam.<br />
<br />
42. &quot;Plight of the Homeless&quot; -- This has been pretty recent.  Heck, since I play pretty much only on one server, it might be one enterprising idiot.  Do NOT &quot;spare some plat&quot; me unless you know me!  This is without even bothering with a sob story (or even the magic word, you know, uh uh uh &quot;please&quot;??).  :wizard: , just a &quot;Can I have some plat?&quot;  Maybe not a widespread issue...could just be my rant of the week. :rant: <br />
<br />
43.  Farming spiderling silk.  I'm sure you all have farming horror stories up the wazoo, but the most annoying &amp; tedious in my short (one yearish) EQ life has been trying to make enough thread and/or cord for everything I want to make and praying for a low fail rate so I don't have to get MORE!  Sure spiderlings are super easy baby MOBs, but the drop rates just bite.<br />
[/list] <br />
<br />
I'll add more if I think of 'em.  A few of you already got several of my personal pet peeves.  Nice to know I'm not alone in being annoyed by 'em. :D<br />
<br />
Arakni--you don't really have half-elves stuck in your network, do you?  That could be messy.  :rolleyes:  ok...bad joke.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm..... I'm pretty sure that my froglok can cast SoW. Let me check. Yep 52 froglok shaman can cast SoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Farnyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Tut tut! Like I said, please dont take any offense to the things people list here. This is just a fun little game to help people vent. So to keep the flow going.<br />
<br />
Class balance.<br />
<br />
&quot;My class needs to heal better&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My class needs higher DPS&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Class H is too powerful&quot;<br />
<br />
Politics - Ok, this isnt really an EQ rant, but I sure hear alot of rants about it anyway, so Im adding it :p</div></div><hr />

No really she does!!! Beastlord is my main!  I don't care if my pet is tough!  Let me root MOBs!<br />

LOL  :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">my erudite wizard can port you but cannot sow.  beleive me i would love it too.  :)  not a problem if i'm responding to ooc.  if you are standing in front of me getting a tl it gets amusing.  <br />
<br />
no erudties can sow.  <br />
<br />
that rouge just got a 32k hit.  (time geared using assinate on a gopher snake hehe.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I hate when large characters envelop my trader in the bazaar (one ogre can complete cover my inky trader from all directions).  <br />
<br />
I hate getting trapped inside people at the PoK port in and having to use succor to get out.<br />
<br />
I hate that pottery gets overlooked for new recipes.<br />
<br />
I hate when people don't have any manners.<br />
<br />
I hate when players use ooc and shout for their raid channels.<br />
<br />
I hate broken quests.<br />
<br />
I hate when people mark locations with corpses.<br />
<br />
I hate lag in bazaar and near the bank in PoK.<br />
<br />
I hate when magicians MGB mod rods in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I hate bad vision underwater.<br />
<br />
I hate the bouncing effect of levitation.<br />
<br />
I am beginning to hate having 45+ forages in Natimbi.<br />
<br />
I regret that all the caster classes get some sort of minion advanced ability except druids.  (wouldn't care if it was just a swarm of little bears (or puppies, see below) that acted like a snare or something)<br />
<br />
I regret that shamans get wolf pets and bear form, while druids get bear pet and wolf form.  (OK so I don't really hate it, but I want to have puppy pets in puppy form.)<br />
<br />
I regret that armor no longer colors you in wolf form - I liked having muddy feet with coldain skin boots.<br />
<br />
I regret that it looks like I sneeze my spells out when in wolf form.<br />
<br />
I regret that there aren't more animal illusions to go with the various spells.<br />
<br />
----------------------<br />
and for balance <br />
<br />
I love that halflings have cultural hide and sneak, and that I am able to sneak up on dubious mobs.</div></div><hr />
