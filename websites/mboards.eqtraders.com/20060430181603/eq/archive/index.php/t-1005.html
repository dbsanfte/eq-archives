<br />
Is there a Skill Level vs. Character Level cap on Smithing tradeskill?<br />
<br />
Example, lvl 1 Troll Smith with a skill of 250 in Smithing.<br />
<br />
I tried asking this question in the Bazaar one day and pretty much started a zone Bar-Room Brawl.  Lots of shouting and name calling by the players that gave me conflicting answers.<br />
<br />
I apologize for my previous post about needing a smith for an item.  I have read the post requirements, I just had a short term memory lapse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is perfectly possible to be a level 1 grandmaster smith.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cantatus</div><div class="date">12-14-2002, 05:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone can get to 250 in a tradeskill no matter what level you are.  However, all other tradeskills will be capped at 200.  You must be 51 or above and have 3 AA points to spend on New Tanaan Crafting Mastery to get an additional tradeskill over 200.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!</div></div><hr />

A gnome cannot get any skill increases in tinkering(above the 50 they are born with) until lvl 17.  At level 17 they an get to 250.  A rogue can't start poison making until 18 or 19, i forget which, and it is level capped.  Alchemy is also level capped and can not be started until a certain level, i don't remember the level but its around 30 iirc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garulf</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The non-tradeskill tradeskills (Foraging, Fishing, Begging, Alcohol Tolerance) are also level capped.<br />
<br />
The big 7 (Pottery, Smithing, Fletching, Tailoring, Brewing, Baking, Jewelcraft) are not capped.  A level 1 can theoretically be 250 in one of these and 200 in the other 6.</div></div><hr />

If the standard level capping as applied to weapon/defense caps applied (5*(level+1)) then at level 7, my smith would be capped at 40, yet I believe he's in his 60's at fishing.. (I'll have to check)</div></div><hr />

I started almost 3 years ago at level 1 with my first char for cash, so it is possible it has changed since, but I remember no mention of it in any patch.</div></div><hr />
