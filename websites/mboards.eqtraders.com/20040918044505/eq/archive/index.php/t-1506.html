<br />
Here's something that MIGHT help.  Feel free to check it out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For the record, EQ Traders has pages for alchemy just like it does for all the other tradeskills, with listings of recipes, pricing, trivials, and trade supplies, as well as some additional pages of miscellaneous helpful stuffs.  The links at the top of this forum or starting from www.eqtraders.com will get you there.<br />
<br />
That said, your guide is more than welcome here, UgZug! :)  Anything that people find helpful in dealing with tradeskills is very, very welcome.  I just want people to realize that there is much more to this site than just the message boards ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ohhh!  I reread my post and realized how badly that sounded.  :(<br />
<br />
If you notice in my guide - I quote EQTraders as the site to go to - even in the very first paragraph.  :)<br />
<br />
Please don't misinterpret my post - this is a great site.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh. Causing trouble again Ugzug? :) Both guides are good. Ug's is more in depth but EQTraders is more easy to get to etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">*hugs UgZug*  No worries!!  I just wasn't sure from your first post whether or not you were aware of the rest of the site.  Okay I confess I hadn't read your guide...but that's not due to a lack of good things being said about it! :)<br />
<br />
We have what we do only because Belgar went out of business and Niami graciously agreed to let me put his stuff here...and then I discovered that I rather enjoyed keeping it up to date hehe.  But I'm well aware that it's more of a data set than a comprehensive guide for someone who is completely new to Norrath and tradeskills.  As I said, anything that folks find helpful is quite welcome here!<br />
<br />
Hmm, now that you mention it, is it alright if I link to you from our pages here?  I'm thinking it'd go in the Learn Alchemy section.  If it's alright, would you rather I link to the Crucible thread or directly to the guide itself?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lupoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the guide at the link above is worth the /bump</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Anos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just FYI..this one done in excel is really really good<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The guide has been updated to v4.00 <br />
<br />
Please take a look - and if you can fill in any blanks (marked by ???) or if you have any questions, comments, concerns, corrections, etc. - please email me at caalger@hotmail.com or post on this thread: <br />

I'm trying to keep all of the requests for changes and updates in one place so as to prevent my poor adled brain from exploding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Verdandi - sent you an email - but posting here too (just in case).  The link to the guide has changed so the link to it on the Learning Alchemy page is invalid.  New link is posted on the Crucible thread and in your email!<br />
<br />
Thanks, hun!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Got it Ugz, just had problems with site flakiness when I had a chance to try to fix it this weekend.  Fixed now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Removing the sticky now that this is linked directly from the site :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Klacea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Since the new data base, I noticed the details are missing. I love eq traders but miss some of the things such as listing what Potion of Power does exactly in stats etc... is there a place I can find this?  The links posted above did not work for me.:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The details are there, just not all displayed at once.  If you are looking at the list of Alchemy Recipes (http://www.eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=29&amp;rsa=Alchemy&amp;sb=item&amp;sub=&amp;menustr=080010000000) or just run a search for &quot;power&quot;, you can then click on the names of the items to bring up the item detail (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1868&amp;menustr=035000000000).  There in the notes are the effect details.  <br />
<br />
We realize there are disadvantages to this system.  But there are significant advantages, such as searchability.  And it is so, so, SO much easier to maintain.  If the database hadn't been an option, the end of the site may have been the other big possibility...and no one wants that.</div></div><hr />
