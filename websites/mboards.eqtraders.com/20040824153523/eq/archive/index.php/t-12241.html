<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kungloa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As i sit here browsing the web boards and site again... I just wanted to say thanks to the people who bring this site to we the community of EQ... I havent been able to get on eq for the better part of 2 months now due to an errant thunderstorm taking out the only pc I own that can run eq... but with word that ill have a replacement arriving  ( or at least a fatty check from the insurance company) in the next week or so I figured id actually post (gasp!) and say thanks to the Denmother and da big Ogre <br />
and the miriad of others who bust their humps to bring the best reference site for eq to us...<br />
 thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Footsore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I logged in this morning specifically to say &quot;Thank You&quot; for all of your hard work and found this post already here.  So let me just add my appreciation for all that you are going through now, and all that you have gone through in the past. <br />
<br />
This is an amazing site with quality that rivals, and exceeds in many cases, comercial for-profit sites.  The &quot;love&quot; that goes into this site is apparent. I know a simple thank you falls short of expressing my gratituted, but for lack of a better way to express it....<br />
<br />
Thank You</div></div><hr />
