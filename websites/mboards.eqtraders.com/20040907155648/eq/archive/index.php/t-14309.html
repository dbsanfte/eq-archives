<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>casala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think it would be a nice added functionality to the different classes if we given the ability to research hybrid spells.  Granted, there are a lot of cross over spells as it stands now (druid spell which are researchable that rangers can also use, cleric - paladin, necro - shadownight, etc..) but I think it would be a nice added feature.  The rare spells could still have the rare drop components and only the 50+ spells could be researched.<br />
<br />
Just a thought...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqNichola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's my understanding that hybrids get to buy from NPC vendors all their Kunark-era 51-60 spells, which is most of them. For example, for Rangers, for spell level 50-60, 3 are Velious-era drop-only, 1 is Ykesha-era quest-only, 3 are Luclin-era drop-only, and the remaining *21* are NPC buyable. I think the situation is similar for other hybrids - they just don't have as much pain trying to get their 51-60 spells as priests and casters do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mileron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most of the NPC buyable spells for Rangers, SKs, and Paladins are 'lower' level versions of spells from their parent class.<br />
<br />
If you were to look through each list...<br />
<br />
Beastlord - 13 of 37 are vendor bought, and are class-specific.  2 of 37 are dropped and class-specific.  One is quested; one is LDoN.  The remaining 20 are shaman hand-me-downs.<br />
<br />
Paladins -  31 spells... Two are quested, two are LDoN, nine are class-specific.  Of those, nine, seven are dropped.  The remaining 18 are cleric.<br />
<br />
Rangers - 30 spells.  One quested, two LDoN.  Eight class specific, for which all are dropped, the remaining 20 are druid handmedowns.<br />
<br />
SKs - 39 spells!.  One quested, two LDoN.  Seventeen! are class specific, ten of which are dropped, leaving 19 necro handme downs.<br />
<br />
So that leaves 2 beastlord, seven pal, eight ranger, and ten SK spells which all could be researched.<br />
<br />
That doesn't even get into Bards.<br />
Bards - 31 songs.  One quested, two LDoN.  Nine are dropped.  The remaining 19 are vendored.  I didn't even count the two Ancient songs.<br />
<br />
I certainly wouldn't mind researching some of these, because no one really hunts PoG or FG or Velious with enough regularity anymore to make these more readily available.<br />
<br />
But where would we start?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As for Beastlords, all of their pre-61 spells are vendor buyable (yes regular or LDoN vendor) with the exception of 2 Luclin era drop only spells. (spirit of snow and spirit of flame).</div></div><hr />
