<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>trilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i heard that posions might actually be useful...new recipes with new effects.<br />
<br />
is this true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Turlo Lomon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have felt poisons were useful since day 1, four years ago.  It really depends on what is considered useful when balanced to the time and money involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>trilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">what is in your posion bag? what do you carry around and for what (group/solo/raid)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arcturos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The lower tier (old world) poisons are useful. The question really should be, &quot;Are they cost effective?&quot;  If a poison cost 6pp to make and highest amount of loot you can expect is 4pp off the mob then its not cost effective.<br />
<br />
The new PoP poisons and LoY poisons can be cost effective under the right conditions.  A large part of this reason is that they are 10-15 minute duration procs and not single shot poisons.  So, a PoP poison can cost 20pp per dose to make (or more) but you can use it on more than one target.<br />
<br />
Old world (single shot) poisons do have some nice effects.  Just don't use them on the first mob to come along. Save them for important targets.  There is nothing like a DEX debuff poison effect(Flesh Rot line) on a rampaging or life tap proc'ing mob to turn it into a snow bunny.  Also, only old world poisons can slow. There are no slow poisons in PoP.  The old world Paralyzing Root line does 50% slow + 95% snare. The strength of the poison determines the duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tokensmoke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually, there is a slow poison besides old world.  Its a LoY poison, Uses 2x blowfist barb.  Its a 30% procing slow, but the buff only last about 2min.</div></div><hr />
