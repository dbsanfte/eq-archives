<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Navox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, this is my first time posting here -- I wouldn't be posting if the main site was up. <br />
<br />
Does anybody have the recipe for the vial of prysmatic dyes? I was trying to make them last evening and the site was down. I have no idea what to get or do.<br />
<br />
any info would be appreciated. <br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kronepsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Generally if you have to use the boards to find information on a recipe, the best thing to do is to use the search button on the upper right.  General tips include making sure you spelled the item you're looking for right, and not necessarily using all the words of the item you're looking for, in case you misspelled one part.  <br />
<br />
This particular forum is for things that need the Denmother (or Verdandi's) attention, and is not appropriate for asking recipe questions if you couldn't find it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Furthermore, at the moment we're asking that people refrain from posting questions about recipes.  Once that starts there is going to be a flood.  If it looks like the site is going to stay down for a lot longer we'll need to reevaluate that.  <br />
<br />
In the meantime, you could try Allakhazam (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/).  Sorry for the the inconvenience. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smyrt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The dye vendor in Gunthak sells a book that tells you the recipe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Navox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Smyrt--Thanks.  I won't be posting here again :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok I will make that so for you Navox.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Craftah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not to be difficult Ngreth, but Navox could have been indicating that he won't be posting questions like the one he did based on the feedback that he got from Verdandi instead of a general 'I won't be posting here again because I didn't like the answers I got.' type of thing.<br />
<br />
The little smiley would seem to indicate the former...<br />
<br />
It's very easy to see why you took the second view especially with the issues that the site is having, but this might be a bit of overkill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Noni DeeCups</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wow. I am afraid to say anything else.</div></div><hr />
