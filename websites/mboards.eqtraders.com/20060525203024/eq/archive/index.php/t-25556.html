Need the services of a skilled Ogre Tailorer on Prexus for DoN culture armour(would prefer GM quality) but Master would do.  Looking for BP, Legs, and Wrists x 2.<br />
<br />
I didn't see any on the message boards who can do this and I know one trader, Gellis, who has tried to sell Boots/Arms but all attempts of contact have failed for other materisl(read above).  If you know this person or can do it I would be greatly appreciated, all in game resources that I have have failed me and now attempting to do the work myself :(  but skilling another toon in tailoring :faint:  isn't very attractive to me at this juncture in time.<br />
<br />
In game names to contact me:<br />
Aanoliliel (My druid)<br />
Grimwar (My Ogre who needs the work done)<br />
<br />
E-mail me so we can work something out(If the global chat service is available) or send me a tell.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
:D</div></div><hr />
