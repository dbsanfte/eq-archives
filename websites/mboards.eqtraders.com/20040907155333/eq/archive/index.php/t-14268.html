<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sheiba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have now failed the GM Trophy 10 times this week now and its driving me nuts.  My skill its 250 and I boost it to 252.  I have wis str and  dex at 305 int at 251.  <br />
<br />
What am I doing wrong?<br />
<br />
Im at the point with the tradeskill earing quest where I have failed 1 combine to make the bow and now have all the bits to try again but fear failing - any tips appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes the random number generator (RNG) is just cruel.<br />
<br />
By the by, the only thing that affects the chances of a successful combine is your level of skill in the tradeskill of the recipe (yours is maxed at 252, so you're doing as well as you can), not your vital statistics (e.g., intelligence, wisdom, etc.).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Greymantle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Probabaly just a very bad run of the RNG:boggled: , that said if i have a bad streak i reduce my stats to just below max, assuming that any are heh. I seem to have more luck that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sheiba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well I've failed 2 more times now and this is turing out to be very expensive.<br />
<br />
What gets me, what is the value in making it if the additional stats play no part in the success of making items.<br />
<br />
Has anyone managed to make it since GoD has come out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i waited for the new UI to finish maxing fletching 243 and smithing 228 because of the sub combines (steel arrows and shadowscream respectively)<br />
<br />
once maxed, i made trophies for both to complete my collection<br />
<br />
every trophy took me 2 tries to make</div></div><hr />

Well, if fletching is your first tradeskill to 250 there are two benefits. First being that you can use the trophy to summon no rent bags with 100% weight reduction, one of which can be turned in for a permanent bag with 100% WR as well (both summoned and permanent are no drop, so no sharing). The second benefit is the added stats. It's really not bad of a range slot item, gives good charisma which helps out a lot with buying and selling if you've got low CHA. The skill modifier works while equipped in primary, secondary or range, so you can swap it out with any whatever you might carry in those slots to help keep your other stats up while still doing combines.</div></div><hr />

...The skill modifier works while equipped in primary, secondary or range, so you can swap it out with any whatever you might carry in those slots to help keep your other stats up while still doing combines. <br />
<br />
True, yes...BUT, sadly enough, limited by the cap. :(<br />
<br />
Pulled directly from the F.A.Q on modifiers here at EQTraders:<br />
Q: If my skill is 250, would one of these geerlock tools (or trophey in this case) make my skill 262?<br />
<br />
A: No, modified skills are capped at 252. In fact, once your skill reaches 240, any skill ups that you get would be meaningless since your skill will be capped at 252.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litetta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I realize that, but you still get the whole 2 extra points (oh joy!) regardless of which of the 3 slots it's equipped in, where the geerloks only work in primary. Therefore allows you to keep any other stats up that you might want to keep up for whatever reason, such as doing a quick combine while doing a raid or exp. Sorry for any confusion :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vallorean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I guess the one other truly beneficial thing you get from the trophey is the +10 WIS (or +10 INT) which can help for skill-up in the current trade skill or others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Skyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Is there a minimum level for trophy?  I'm level 35, and have just hit 200 in fletching.  I started making shadow tipped acrylia arrow, and failed half of my stack, so I was wondering if I have to hit a certain level  to pass 200 in fletching.  If not, and I can reach 250 in fletching, then is there a minimum required to obtain the grandmaster trophy?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zakhrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I crafted my jewelers trophy when I was level 23, first try, no problem. I made all the stuff, got ready to make the trophy, then I bought 2 stacks of plat and 2 stacks of gems that were just over trivial at my skill of 242. I combined and sold back to the vendor, until I finally hit one of the notorious streaks of faliures that happen with the RNG.<br />
         I worked through the failures, (I failed 4 combines before succeeding) then I immediately put the artisans seal and the glass shard in my jewelry kit and presto! :wizard: First try. This method has worked for every one of my friends who tried it, (4 people) on the first shot. :cool:</div></div><hr />
