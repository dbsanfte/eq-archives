<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Towd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I finally (after 4 failures :{) got my Grandmaster Tailor's Needle.  I summoned the bag and went to trade it for the one that isn't no rent.  (Hand it to Jolum in the Bazaar)  He mentioned that I can upgrade the needle by combining it with an Embroidery Needle in a sewing kit.  So I have 2 questions:<br />
<br />
1.  What does it upgrade to?<br />
2.  Is it a no fail combine?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
When trophies were first put in game, they sucked worse then they do now. They didnt have the summon bag effect.<br />
<br />
What Jolum told you to do is how to upgrade the super-suck trophy to the not-quite-as-suck trophy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taushar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, they didn't suck as much as you think. When the trophy first came out, it was labeled as not lore. That meant people who was GM in one skill could have made more than one. There is no reason for this now since you can have more than one trophy from different skills. However, in those days, the trophy's stats were second to none. People have made 3 of them to put them in primary, secondary and range slot to boost their stats. <br />
<br />
Sony finally made them lore so you can't have more than one. They also gave people chance to upgrade to the new trophy by turning in their old ones. Some people have done this by turning in one of their trophy to get the bag and kept the other two for stats. They got the best of both world and the gnome still has the text left from those days.<br />
<br />
Now days, it's not really needed since PoP has introduced many items that supercedes the trophy as far as the stats. In those days, 3 trophies were the most uber.<br />
<br />
I wonder if anyone still has the old trophy around?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hasufax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was one of those that made an extra trophy just for the stats; I made 2 of the smithing trophies, one for secondary slot, one for range.  The stats were indeed ooooober.  Once they changed the trophies, I turned one of mine in for the new version, but I still have my other older version in the bank, just for sentimental value :)<br />
