<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kinare</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You heard me. Free combines. Here is the catch:<br />
<br />
* You provide ALL materiels.<br />
* Bring enough for more attempts. I want some of these neat items for myself.<br />
* If you are bringing stuff to me to sell we need to work out something. I really dislike having people use my skill and profit more than I do =p<br />
* This is for Planes of Power tradeskills ONLY.<br />
* If you are interested in this, please let me know. We can set up a time to get this stuff done. If you do not have all of the components, still message me and I can get back to you. There is nothing I hate more than waiting around on someone only to find out that they do not have all of the stuff.<br />
* I do not memorize recipies. All of the information you need is in this post, or in the links from this post.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can provide the following services:<br />
<br />
Jewelcraft, 250 skill +5%, have JC tanaan kit (not pop enabled account). JC recipies for POP are located Here: http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_PoP_jewelry.htm<br />
<br />
Pottery, 250 skill +5%, PoP enabled account. Pottery recipies for POP are located Here: http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_PoP_pottery.htm<br />
<br />
Tailoring, 250 skill +5%, PoP enabled account. Tailoring recipies for PoP are located Here: http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_PoP_tailoring.htm<br />
<br />
Smithing, 250 skill +5% NOT POP ENABLED, so I cannot get to the planar forge. If someone is willing to buy me a copy of POP for my smith account we can work something out =p<br />
<br />
If you want to know where all this esoteric stuff comes from and how to get it, look Here: http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/info/PoP_drops.htm<br />
<br />
If you want to know where to get the imbued stuff, look Here: http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_PoP.htm#imbue<br />
<br />
Please post here, or message me, or send a tell to my trader Nenwedar (usually in bazaar, filters tells to another window). I cannot play as much as I used to, but when I do I try to be busy =)<br />
<br />
EDIT: I reserve the right to refuse service to anyone, reguardless of annoyance factor.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curufinwe</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can offer 250 +5% smithing on a POP enabled account.<br />
<br />
As Kinare I am much more interested in ingredients than in pp.<br />
I ask for ingredients in exchange for my services, so I can't honestly say it is for free. But I am reasonable and we surely can work out a deal.<br />
<br />
To contact me just send a tell to any Divine Froggie, they'll know if I'm online with one of my alts.<br />
<br />

<br />
As far as my JC mule, she can make anything in PoP, because she has the kit, she just can't go up there =p</div></div><hr />
