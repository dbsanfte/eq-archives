<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dantius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there a certain zone or camp where large and small bricks and small pieces of acrylia drop at a better rate than others ??<br />
<br />
I camped one of the grimling caves in Tenebrous Mts and the time I put in really wasn't worth the return.  I also did some camping in ME and DSP.  The prices in the bazaar seem pretty outrageous.<br />
<br />
Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated.<br />

<br />
If you got a group, Acrylia Caverns.</div></div><hr />

Some of these mobs have a one minute repop timer. I did this one evening and focused on one mob, no need to move. you have just enough time to heal / med / rebuff before she pops again.<br />
Before the evening was done my packs were full of acrylia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mahlig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">errr...a grimling that is on the South Island or in the Owlbear caves?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>oerin trubble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In the Owlbear caves! Last cave on the left is where i camped.<br />
The one minute timer starts as she pops, so the longer you take to kill the less time to heal and med.<br />
I did this when the war was broken and could take days or weeks to reset.<br />
So the wars cycle more now and the mobs won't be up for as long but you can manipulate the war and get the mobs you want in the location you want.</div></div><hr />
