<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Binkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I failed on the 7th shawl today.  Not once.  Not twice.  Not even three times.  FOUR times I failed on the 7th shawl today.<br />
<br />
As I sit here with a lump in my throat and a burning between my shoulder blades, I gotta wonder if it's worth it.<br />
<br />
But then, you're talking to someone who camped for Boots of Flowing Slime every single freaking morning for a month and never saw them drop.  And here I thought the shawl would be *easier*.  |insert hysterical laughter here|<br />
<br />
I think I'll have FT 1 for the rest of my toon's life.  (And I swear, I wouldn't have that if the solstice earring combine could fail.)<br />

*cry*</div></div><hr />

Hang in there.  You'll get that success.  What's your skill at?</div></div><hr />
