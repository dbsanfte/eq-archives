I converted them to ore, then to HQ rings, ended up with 24 rings. <br />
<br />
went to PoK and got gold bars and coif patterns (12 combines). My wis was 207, skill 135 with geerlock.<br />
<br />
after 12 combines of coifs (8 successes)(triv 146) i moved up to a skill of 138. Thats an average of 1 skillup per 4 combines.<br />
<br />
 :D<br />
<br />
i sold back about 4 of them, got back my cost of the gold bar and pattern (had a cha of 180). Then i wnt to halas and gave the others to newbies that were naked. (i also made a bunch of them the patchwork armor, all they needed to do was bring me ruined pelts)<br />
 :D</div></div><hr />

To date I haven't made many things for newbies (mainly because so many are twinked nowadays).  I usually just give out buffs on the sly or occasionally give away old armor, but I haven't done the &quot;you bring me ruined pelts and I'll give you armor&quot; deal yet.  I have made a few tunare-only weapons and given those away, but that's been about it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sir0die</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">since i'm probably there farming spiderling silk or wolf/mammath meat, if the zone is not too crowded, i might be farming bear meat, which means i have the ruined pelts on me. Then i just tell them  to buy the pattern for the pieces they need, and i'll make them the armor. If they are a real newbie (non twink, lower than lvl 5) i might give the 3-4 plat to buy the patterns with, and show them where to buy backpacks at.<br />
<br />
it's easier that way, you have them hand you  patterns, make them armor, hand it back. That way you don't have to inspect them and figure out what to make them.<br />
<br />
sometimes i charge them spiderling silks or wolf meats, or lq/mq/hq pelts. It all depends on how crowded the zone is and how much stuff i make them. If it's too crowded with newbies for me to farm spiderling silks, i'll usually /ooc that i'll buy it for a few plat each.<br />
<br />
heck, the other day i gave a lvl 9 barb shammy a howling harpoon, what did i get in return, 3 stacks of spiderling silks, 5 hq bear pelts and 4 stacks of ruined bear pelts(which i made armor for newbies with).</div></div><hr />
