Same here  :D <br />
Dinged 200, then ran up to the bazaar to buy up what components I didn't have (I had been saving up branches and dragon eggs in expectation).<br />
<br />
I had read on the site that the trivial on the rod was over 200 and was somewhat daunted the first time.  After making them and from reading people's failure rates, I'd probably guess that the trivial is 201, just to make them &quot;never trivial.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b></b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">am i unlucky or is it this way. i am doing over 200 casts per skill up. that was the case from 180 to 181. so far  have done over 220 casts and not a single skill up.  am i unlucky. but i can deal with it i guess, make me sit lnger in PoG foraging planar oaks hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seamus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just went from 180 to 197 in 800 casts, w/255 Wis. Wasn't that bad at first, a skill up about every stack of bait until 185 or so. On this last skill up it took a little less than 200 casts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Talladar Goldenwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You may want to just go see your trainer if you want 200 fast.  it will cost a little plat but save you time if 200 is your goal.  If you are fishing for supplies then don't worry about it since the difference is meaningless between 180 and 200 really.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jensen Greatwar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i'm trying to get my fishing high enough to make the blessed fishing pole. i hate spending so much time making ingredients to fail at making them at 181 skill.  trying to make them to finance my baking habbit. just dinged 201 on it yesterday</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nimphe Wildwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">just dinged 201 on it yesterday<br />
<br />
I'm confused, you dinged 201 on Fishing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ausversucht</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you read more closely you will notice he was talking about baking.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Iannyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">no, I think he/she meant they are fishing to support Baking, in which baking was the subject of the 201 ding...<br />
<br />
I think..<br />
(took me 3 reads to get that)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nimphe Wildwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ausversucht - Yes I did read it closely, is why I am asking for clarification.  I'm sure it was for Baking but /shrugs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Serenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Skillups are pretty random.  I never counted my bait, but I went from 198 to 199 in the 30 minutes of a fishing tournament a week and a half ago.   Last night I fished for the first time since, and made 200 on my first cast (which caught a rusty dagger).  And yes, I got to 200 entirely on fishing.   To celebrate I made my first attempt at a Blessed Fishing Pole, and succeeded.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Alkee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">managed to get my fishing from 2 to 150 in 2 days in Cobalt Scar.<br />
When my last pole finally breaks I will spend my training points to take it to 200 :) So 3 days to GM fishing sounds nice.<br />
Although I don't know how much it will cost to gain the points through training them.<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zebroxks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i went from 123 to 187 today then said oh well. So i spent over 1k training it to 1k. I took my skill from 1-187 in PoG so i got about 30 something bark (i didnt forage them all) so atleast ill earn that 1k back and then some</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jensen Greatwar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">sorry about that i meant dinged 201 baking hehe. long day at work.     ;)</div></div><hr />
