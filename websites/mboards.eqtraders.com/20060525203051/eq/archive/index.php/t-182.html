I have 222 skill atm.  If you bring me the supplies I will attempt any combine for 100pp.  If you don't have the supplies and want a finished product then send me a tell in game so we can work out a time frame and price.  The harder to get the materials the higher the price while the easier they are to get the lower the price.<br />
  I have found that basing cost of items upon the availability of materials for said item is the only fair way to asess a fair cost.<br />
<br />
  I am looking for many tailoring materials to make items.  Namely wyvern hides, Othmir pelts, and Cobalt Cod.  I am open to cash, trades or anything that is that we can agree on for your tailoring materials.<br />
