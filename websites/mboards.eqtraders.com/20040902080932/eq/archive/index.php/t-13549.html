<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taushar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">RNG was kind to me tonight. I was at 244 in smithing. I had collected 25 each of the substances for Shadowscream combines. I figured 1 point and I would be happy. I ended up with 4 points to 248. At that point, I figure my luck would hold out so I did a stack of BD cultural armor. That brought me up to 249.  I went back to HSM to collect more substances but the camp was all taken. Came back to the bazaar and saw that Mistletoe Tempers and Blessed Dust of Tunare were on sale. I have not seen Dust for sale in weeks. It must have been fate. Bought 90 of each and went to make a stack of sickles. On the 7th combine, lucky number hehe, I made 250. Six total points in one night over 52 combines. Not too bad at all. Now, on to my last conquest, tailoring.<br />

Very nice skill ups, nice to have days like this.<br />
<br />
Personally I hate the RNG right now. Well it was only 6 attempts for the 6th shawl, but does that mean I need 7 attempts at the 7th?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>PetrosDaroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The 6th shawl was probably the most difficult one to do the final combine.  I had no problems with the 7th, but had to do the 6th one three times....6 times for your 6th shawl?  Ouch.</div></div><hr />
