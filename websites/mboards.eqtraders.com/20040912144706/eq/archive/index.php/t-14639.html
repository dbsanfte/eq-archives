<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solarax_Manastorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i have 250 un modded pottery with trophy and was wondering if it was possible to do the grimmel part out of order like say something to him to get the urn pattern so i could complete that part other than the ring for cap and have that part out of the way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nope, only if it's your 2nd time going through.<br />
<br />
Example: I'm on the pottery step. If I wanted to start over for a 2nd earring and do the smithing, brewing, and JC steps I can repeat the trigger text for those any time, and get whatever item he gives you.  However, I can't give the trigger phrase for the tailoring combine because I didn't get to it yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solarax_Manastorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ok thanks for the reply . was hoping i could get that one out of the way. but since i plan on taking tailoring up first then blacksmithing it might be a while then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqNichola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have done only the first 4 steps but when I give him the trigger text for step 7 (baking) - &quot;I am a master chef&quot; - he gives me the satchel... my advice would be to try it! Say &quot;I am ready to work with some clay&quot; to him and see what he does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wow...maybe they changed it. I'll have to try this too ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqdoctress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can do things out of order a little<br />
<br />
Just need the required flags and skills<br />
<br />
That is how the smithing MQ works btw.<br />
<br />
You can get all the materials from him from smithing to baking<br />
<br />
However, the final combine will always need the previous earring<br />
<br />
ie, the pottery part, final combine is the earring with 3 sacred waters in the pot thingy, then to hand it in to Grimel<br />
<br />
Or the tailoring part, combining the tunic with your previous earring. Or fletching etc.<br />
<br />
Only step 1, 2 and 3 does not need the previous earring for it to work i guess<br />
<br />
So actually, you can make the pot ready if you have the skill and flags but the final combines will need the previous earring<br />
<br />
BTW, he doesnt give you anything for the tailoring part, nor anything for the fletching part. Just need to gather the components for the final combine WITH the previous quest earring.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>scaevola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can do them all out of order as long as they don't require the earing from the previous quest.  <br />
<br />
I had the Jc earing banked x2 before I had fletching, smithing, tailoring maxed,<br />
<br />
I had the unfired urn and fired urn before I had smithing,fletching,tailoring done.  <br />
<br />
I had 12 twice brewed constitutions before I had smithing &amp; brewing done.  <br />
<br />
I did fletching last (was at 211) .<br />
<br />
Finally got done ..freed up so much bank space.<br />
<br />
You can do all but the final combines in most cases- the precombine are dooable just by hailing him for that specific task and getting the stuff<br />
<br />
You can do all sub combines for jc, the emblems, the pottery combines, and the brewing combines before you have all skills done they just take up a bit of bank space.. And the pottery combine if you fire it ..requires an inventory spot( @$#$4 ---suggest not firing it if you can afford it ..but the firing combine is faillable)</div></div><hr />
