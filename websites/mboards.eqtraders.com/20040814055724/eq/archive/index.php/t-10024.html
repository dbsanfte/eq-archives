<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sixes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">http://www.eqtraders.com/ is  giving Forbidden: You do not have permission to access / on this server. when it resolves to 69.57.130.57.  It reports itself as h10011.racknine.com but 69.57.130.57 does not have any reverse DNS.<br />
<br />
The other IP address for eqtraders.com is 207.44.180.46.  Accessing the URL as http://207.44.180.46/ redirects to https://207.44.180.44:19638/webhost/rollout/site which doesn't help much.  Not sure what happens if you access that IP address as www.eqtraders.com as I can't modify my DNS server at the moment.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps RackNine to debug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow, this helps more then what I was going to report.<br />
<br />
<br />
But yeah, I get the &quot;You do not have permission to access  /  &quot;<br />
 message, as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It is a DNS issue.  The site is still up, but for some reason alot of people are getting the old site.  (which has been cleared of data at my request... it was the old flat pages anyway...)<br />
<br />
The Host is working on it.</div></div><hr />
