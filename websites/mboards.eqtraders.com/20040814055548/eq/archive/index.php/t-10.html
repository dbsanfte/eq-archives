<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since the beginning of this site in April of 1999, we've had a policy about NOT posting recipes/drops that are found only on Test.<br />
<br />
<br />
The reasoning behind this is because it *is* the Test server.  There is no way to ensure that things there will go live, or if they will change greatly before going live, etc.  We don't want folks petitioning to GMs the day of a new patch because a recipe doesn't work the way &quot;someone&quot; on EQTraders Corner said it worked on Test. We also don't need hordes of folks on live servers coming back here and blasting us because they &quot;spent days farming x, y, z because they heard it was part of a recipe on Test&quot;, only to find that the drop required in the live version of the recipe was something different.  Been there, done that, won't repeat it.<br />
<br />
When a VI staffer posts here requesting that folks test some new things over on Test, so that we can ensure that most of the glaring issues are dealt with before it goes live, we ask that you try very hard to remember to NOT post actual Test-only recipes here.  If there are issues with a recipe on Test, several folks on the tradeskills:tradeskills channel know how to get in feedback so that the issue is addressed while still on Test.</div></div><hr />
