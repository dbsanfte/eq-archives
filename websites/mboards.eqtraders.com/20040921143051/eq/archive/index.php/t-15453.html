<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vwdiesel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, just posting to vent about my own stupidity.<br />
<br />
I've been vendor mining for the last 3-4 months gathering research components for both my enchanter and necro. I only work on research every month or so and yesterday was my day to do it. <br />
<br />
On my chanter I skilled up past spells that require Salil's writ pages and moved on to Nilitim's grimoire pages. I don't remember exactly what skill level this was. <br />
<br />
I had amassed a HUGE supply of combines for spells that require Nilitim's grimoire pages and was looking forward to breezing thru them and hopefully hitting 200 skill. I am currently level 46. Feel free to laugh now if you already know the punch line.<br />
<br />
So I fill my packs with pages, head to Greater Fay, park in front of Felwithe (hoping for a bit of home court advantage /wink), and announce that I am handing out free lvl 46 chanter buffs to anyone who wants them while I skill up.<br />
<br />
Open the research tome and start clicking away. I'm getting tons of successes, but no skill ups. Click click click click. Man, the RNG is being tough on me today. Click click click click. Ok this is getting ridiculous. I had previously been skilling up at a rate of one skill up per 2 or 3 combines (roughly, not calculated or parsed or anything) and at this point I had burned thru at least 60 pages with no skill ups. Something had to be wrong, so I decided to stop, and started to head back to PoK when that little voice whispered to me &quot;skill cap&quot;. Yep, that's right, I was at my skill cap for my level already.<br />
<br />
AAAAAARRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!<br />
<br />
If my neighbor were Ned Flanders, he would have stuck his head out and said &quot;That was the loudest profanity I have ever heard&quot;.<br />
<br />
So that was about 60-80 combines just flushed right down that nasty sewer thing at the Plane of Disease. <br />
<br />
There is, however, a silver lining. When I decide to gain a few more levels I still have 25 or so combines of the pages I was working on, and should have more once I vendor mine a few more. I have 7 skill ups to go before the pages I was combining are trivial, and luckily above that my stash of pages is untouched, so I should be able to skill up as normal without too much effort. I just won't have any extras available to hand out to my friends or guildies working on research.<br />
<br />
So remember kiddies, don't be a moron like me. Remember that Research is capped depending on your level, and the formula is:<br />
<br />
(Level-15)*5=Research skill cap<br />
<br />
Which for me was (46-15)*5=31*5=155!! And no matter how many combines you attempt in order to convince the computer otherwise, it just won't let you past that until you DING Level 47.<br />
<br />
And now there is a huge yellow post-it note on my monitor to serve as a constant reminder of my stupidity.<br />
<br />
Ahhh, much better. Thanks primal scream room!!</div></div><hr />

/hugs to vwdiesel. Of course, you'll never ever forget now...<br />
<br />
Unless you're like me; just yesterday I said something, about &quot;I'll never forget this again...&quot; except I did. o_0 Well, I'm sure if I were asked about that subject I would remember, rather than blankly trying to come up with it, but still. <br />
<br />
lvl-15, *5. Check. <br />
<br />
and more /comfort. <br />
