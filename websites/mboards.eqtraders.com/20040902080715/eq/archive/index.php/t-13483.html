<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cragzop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm curious about the skillup rates that folks have seen using differnt combines, especially at the higher end. Essentially what gets you the most bang for the buck.<br />
<br />
I've seen about a 1 in 15 to about a 1 in 17 skillup rate on ribbons.<br />
<br />
I've averaged about 1 in 20 on solstice robes.<br />
<br />
I don't know about cultural robes. Same thing for velious furs.<br />
<br />
I think the Aide Gimmel combines have an insane rate - as good as 1 in 6.<br />
<br />
What experiences have folks had?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Centuri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have found that on all my post-200 tradeskills,  I expect approximately 1 skillup every 30 combines or so.  I rarely go more than 40 without a skillup.<br />
<br />
And it seems that at least once every tradeskill you get that &quot;hump&quot; point that you just can't get past and you'll be screaming when you hit 300 combines without a skillup. <br />
<br />
I have not found any one item that works better than the others for skillups.  Only the ease/difficulty of finding components really affects my decisons on which things to skill up on.</div></div><hr />
