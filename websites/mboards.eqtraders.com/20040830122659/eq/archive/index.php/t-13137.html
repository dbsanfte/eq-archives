<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oualawouzou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello there!<br />
<br />
I did a quick search on this forum and didn't find the answer, sorry if it has been asked before... :(<br />
<br />
I see that the trivial on that bow is over 243, and likely to be over 250.<br />
<br />
But I was wondering how much over 250 is the trivial estimated to be?  Is it one of those items you have 50% chances of completing with 250 skill, or is the trivial a little lower than that?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">think its the same as the other ele combines at 50%.  fletching might be a bit worse though.  <br />
<br />
oh thats at 250.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Armaged</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Man, I must really be having a good streak then :)<br />
<br />
I'm 11 of 13 on Elemental Bows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm confused now, I thought the Eternal was the Karana equivalent of the BFT, and had about the same trivial?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And that would be around what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>lonewylfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can't find it atm, but I was thinking that at one point somebody said the elemental bows were probably around 260, and the bft around 275? :confused: <br />
I don't think those are the exact numbers, but I do remember reading that the bft was a higher trivial than the elementals. Would assume the eternal was the same, but never know. I've asked around, but haven't found anybody yet who's made the eternals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am getting about 50% on BFTs at 241+trophy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>intertex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Guess I should pray more...My success rate on the BFT is lower than 40% with 241+trophy :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">243 + geerlok, I'm something like 4 of 6 on the BFT.  However, at least one if not both of those fails I'd forgotten to equip the geerlok . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The exact trivials on everything are coming soon with the new Tradeskill UI.<br />
<br />
At the moment the databases arent complete. I wasnt able to find the trivs on cultural or planar bows.<br />
<br />
<br />
.... but the elemental planar cams trivial at 282 exactly. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xanthe Ravenwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I officially hate Fletching. At 250 skill plus a geerlok, I've failed my last 10 or so Elemental bow combines, and wasted over 300k's worth of components. That just really does take the pi$$. Even worse, the last one I failed was one for a friend.<br />
<br />
I have a little karana fletcher on Stromm with a skill of about 210 or so. He's tried Eternal Tempests about 5 or 6 times now and failed each one. Low skill on him for the combine yes, but was hoping to get lucky. No such luck.<br />
<br />
Yes I just want to whinge *snaps fletching geerlok in half*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>FentFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just succeeded on my third attempt at the Eternal Tempest Compound Bow with 207 skill + geerlok.  At my level (52), it has a better damage/delay ratio than the Nightmarewood Bow that I made earlier.  I also like the &quot;low tech&quot; look of the Karana bow over the Nighmarewood bow as well :)  A simple Karana farmer oughta have a bow like the Eternal Tempest bow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Pondlife</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm guessing in about 25 attempts on BFT's I've made 10 and failed 15 combines.  That's at 252 skill including geerlock.<br />
<br />
I also believe my success rate on Blessed Champion Arrows is roughly 1 in 3 attempts.  Luckily a successful attempt results in 10 arrows.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking that cultural fletching has some trivials that are just too high.  Considering all the sub-combines involved in making the bows, and the cost of materials (especially Blue Diamonds), its no wonder I have only ever seen one other person on Stromm sell BFT's and BCA's.</div></div><hr />
