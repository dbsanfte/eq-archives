<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is Apology Version 9, at least, because I'm never happy with the way the others came out. I'm almost paranoid of posting now... there is a fine line between enthusaism and obsession, between being 'righteously justified' and being 'right out of your mind.' <br />
<br />
I crossed that line badly. And I'm sorry. <br />
<br />
Part of the reason it's taken me so many days and so many drafts to post this is the perception that I hurt people so directly that I shouldn't even show myself in order TO apologize, and my inability to accept direct responsibility for what I did. Punishment is easy to accept, but so is finding a reason why 'I didn't do it.' <br />
<br />
I did it, and I'm sorry. I broke rules that I knew beforehand, and that I knew afterwords, and that I should have known at the time. I lost control of myself, and snapped so badly I barely recognized myself a day later. I could blame school stress, and wouldn't be too wrong. I could blame new medicine, and wouldn't be too wrong either. I could blame the 'last straw' concept, and probably wouldn't even be far from the mark with that. <br />
<br />
But even reasons, legitimate ones, accurate ones, after-the-fact ones, they're all beyond the point. <br />
<br />
<br />
I broke rules, I broke trust, and I'm sorry. <br />
<br />
<br />
It is true I don't know why I exploaded. It is true that I have exploaded before. It is most probably true that I will expload again at some point in the future. The only thing I know to say at this point is that I will do my best in the future to at least contain such losses of self-control to the point that they don't injure people again. <br />
<br />
I hate causing trouble, and I've been beating myself up for duration of this thing because when I am an idiot, I am really huge fricking idiot. I can never cause trouble even when it's semi-convenient to have trouble caused; no, I have to wait until the most breathtakingly inconveninent moment possible to make the huge ass of myself. <br />
<br />
Between the papers (why is that still plural?), final presentations, final projects, and other stuff that I would say I hate with a passion, except it's closer to 'hating with an apathy', the board will be spared of my opinions and derangements for at least a month. With any luck, I will have stabilized by then enough to try to begin to rebuild. <br />
<br />
Until then, I can only hope that I'm not too KOS to be able to do some Chocolate Truffle turn-ins to raise faction just a bit. <br />
