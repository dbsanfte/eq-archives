<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vwdiesel</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 08:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I need the services of a Dark Elf GM smith to make 2 subcombines and 2 final combines for me. I have all the components except the cultural smithy hammer. The items I am trying to make are Dark Prince Sovereign Bracelet (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=4657&amp;menustr=080040020020) (2 of them), which require the Infused Adamantite Rings (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=4893) subcombine to make. I have a smithing geerlok if you need a skill modifier.<br />
<br />
I would like to donate 400 pp for your time, and an additional 300 pp per successful combine, for a total of 1000pp if both combines succeed.<br />
<br />
The characters I play are Lorgaich, Eldritch, Aigilean, and my bazaar mule Beomir. Please feel free to contact me via this thread or in game to get in touch with me. I play normally from 6-11pm EST Mon-Thur, 1-11pm Fri, and off and on all day Sat and Sun.<br />
<br />
I have /ooc'd in game and will continue to do so. If I find someone in game to help me I will post the results in this thread. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help.<br />
<br />
Edited to add links to combines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vwdiesel</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wanted to extend my thanks to Nevenya for attempting to combine these for me. Neither final combine was successful, so I'm going to gather up the components to make 2 more tries. The offer still stands for anyone that would like to try it, although Nevenya graciously offered to try again once I get the components for the 2nd attempt. I should have the components gathered by the end of the week.<br />
<br />
Thanks again Nevenya, I appreciate your time and effort regardless of the outcome.</div></div><hr />
