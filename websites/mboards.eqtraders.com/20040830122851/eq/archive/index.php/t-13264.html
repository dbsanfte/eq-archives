<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lilsneezy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well after getting to 216 the hard way (LDoN), I finally took the time to read the boards and found the great thread about EVBs.  After 2 hours making the temper and a half hour making the EVBs I am now at 222.  Now I am wondering if there is a recommended way to cheaply yet semi-quickly to get to 250?  I had thought of doing acrylia, since it is not that expensive to farm the bazaar on my server (The Rathe) for those parts at the moment.  Other than jumping into underfoot/mischievious is there any other route that could be recommended?<br />
<br />
Thank you for any advice,<br />

You could probably get there semi-quickly or you could get there cheaply, but you probably won't do both at the same time.  <br />

Mistletoe Cutting Sickles are a good thing to make, since they sell well.  You'll lay out a bit of money up front, but should make it back reselling them.  ShadoScream armor can be done very cheaply, but it will take a loooooooooooooong time to farm the stuff you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When skilling up, remember this rule of thumb; <br />
 Skill up quickly.  Skill up cheaply.  Skill easily.  You may only choose 2 options.<br />
<br />
If a path is easy and quick, it will be expensive.  If it is cheap and easy, it will be slow and tedious. If a path is expensive and fast, it will be hard to do.   Knowing this little rule-of-tumb will make you a lot less insane, since it will keep you from seeking an option which is all three. :)</div></div><hr />
