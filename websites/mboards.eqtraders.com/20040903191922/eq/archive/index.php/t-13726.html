<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been a 250 skill Jeweler on my Enchanter Tynna for long over a year, however I had planned on moving her to a server with my RL friends so never attempted the trophy til now. (back in the say when char xfer was naked, no items)  But even after the move I didnt have enough plat to make the items needed for trophy til last night... Thanks to help with a friend (Boobear) I got my Ornate Silk Sleeve Pattern made and my JC GM trophy last night.  Was a great night.<br />
