<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>JMorgana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Let me start by saying i have petitioned in-game, as well as using the &quot;Contact your server GM&quot; link on the boards and using the live tech support chat. No response from the first two methods and the third one said I had to do one of the first two.<br />
<br />
My problem is this: The day GoD went live (2/10/04), I opened my skills window for something unrelated and noticed that where I had previously had a 197 tailoring skill, it dropped down to 192 somehow. (NOTE: I didn't buy and install GoD until about 3 days later so I'm not sure if it's related to that or not).  I tried to do a few Ceremonial Solstice Robe combines hoping maybe it was a glitch and would correct itself.  Succeeded on a robe about 3 tries in, but I'm still at 192.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else had this problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>sjsell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It hasn't happened to me that I know of.  But I will have to check all my skills to make sure.  Hope you get it resolved. Let us know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">did not happen to me recently, however, there were a number of folks who lost skill points for various skills a while back. all i really remember is that at the time, I was full on level 60 exp in Old Sebilis. I would fill up my bar to 100% exp and when i'd come back in the next day my bar would say only 98% exp. At that time, the missing skill points were all in 2% increments... or something like that. That was right before POP and level 65. <br />
<br />
very sorry to hear of your lost points, i hate EQ tailoring (love sewing in RL though). Good luck getting it resolved.</div></div><hr />
