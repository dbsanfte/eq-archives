I think its called Deathsteel. Havent actually begun smithing yet, so wont be trying it for awhile myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kallisti</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is indeed found in Droga. Three hours there got me about a stack and a half of Deathsteel, as well as Grinning Goblin Brew and Mt Death Mineral salts in about equal ratios. Each weapon combine uses a total of two of each ingredient, so after three hours we had 12 combines worth of material and leftovers on both ore and salt.<br />
Can't attest as to the actual combines, as I'm waiting to get a bit further through Ornate Chain to try it. (I want to max gold two ring stuff first.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naeen</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The weapons are pretty crappy, but it's a very cheap way to skillup to 158 from banded. I used it to suplement skillups when I was doing ornate chain. Normally I'd take a friend's twink down to droga and PL them at the shroud of nature or idol camp while collecting materials. I find quite a bit of ore and goblin brew on vendors, but I almost never see the salts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only a couple trivials have been fully nailed down for them at 121, the others, all we know is that the ranges are &quot;somewhere&quot; in the low to mid 100s, but much more narrowing needs to be done.<br />
<br />
You can find recipes, and what trivial information we have on them at http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/smithing_weapons.htm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">neipa</div><div class="date">12-07-2002, 10:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a lot of deathsteel ore on morel thule if anyone wants<br />
it. I got a lot of it merchant mining thinking i could get the temper <br />
ingredients myself, but no such luck i am way to low of a level and its taking up a lot of space in the bank<br />
<br />
just send neipa a tell and if I am on i'll give it to you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xorshaik</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe I'll give this stuff a little work, my main can use the faction and I have to get his smithing up to 168 since I'd rather use him to farm the shrieking/wailing substances for the Shadowscream skillups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolfypaw</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I think going this route is a waste, financially speaking.  You can sell the salts in the baz for probably 25pp each or more.  There are a lot of level 60s with a ton of money to spend who would prefer to buy salts instead of farming greenies for Chardok faction.<br />
<br />
What is the cost of an ornate chain combine?  I bet it's less than 25pp.<br />
<br />
All just my opinion, however.<br />
<br />
If you do decide you want to skillup this way, take your high level characters in and AE the place.  If you do it enough, you'll also get non-KOS in Chardok.  Remember to also save the green goblin skins for faction (or sell 'em for that 25+ pp each).</div></div><hr />
