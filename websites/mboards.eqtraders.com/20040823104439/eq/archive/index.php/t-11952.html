<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Damion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im wondering.<br />
<br />
Since the last week, a multitude of persons on the server are selling coldain velium tempers. As low as 6pp pr. <br />
<br />
I have my toon logged in right now and no less than 2000 tempers are for sale at an avg. of 7pp now. <br />
<br />
Thats lower than recorded net price.<br />
<br />
Given that the tempers are not something you make, just for fun, due to the high number of combines pr. temper. im wondering, did it change?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Apparently there was a bug recently where the merchant would sell them for 0 (free). I'm guessing that a lot of people stocked up on them before the merchant was taken offline. See the following thread for more details:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, most of the sellers bought &quot;free&quot; CVTs. Wish the GMs would check the logs of who purchased large amounts of those and suspend/ban 'em all (or whatever the current penalty is for exploitation).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Damion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, that sucks...<br />
<br />
ok, thanks for letting me know.<br />
<br />
I thought i had made the bargain of the year buying 800 CVTs for 6pp a pop. I guess i just made an exploiter rich.<br />
<br />
On the bright side tho, will be quite a while before i need to buy em again :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kitre Halfax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Since the database is down, what is the recipe, exactly? I'm sure lots of people who were too lazy to make them before (like me) will be wanting the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aradyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Verdandi in the General Tradeskill Discussion Forum:<br />
At the moment we're asking that people refrain from posting questions about recipes. Once that starts there is going to be a flood. If it looks like the site is going to stay down for a lot longer we'll need to reevaluate that.  :( <br />
Thank you for your patience.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">rest of quote includes looking at allakhazam's for info too.  they get most of the stuff this site has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aradyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Erm my fault! My copy-quote must have cut that off and I hadn't noticed.   I meant to include the link as well.  My apologies.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hehe not a prob ara.  no more cvt on vendors.  looks like it will all be player made now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Saleani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There was a bug in the pricing, so they were free from the vendor. I expect the price to get fixed in a few weeks. The interim repair job was to remove them from his inventory. I sure hope its not a permanent removal, I can easily go through 100 stacks of the temper in a month, and if I have to depend on other players to make them, there will never be enough tempers for me to buy, and I sure as heck am not making any more once I run out of the algae.<br />
<br />
temper = 4 celestial essences + 1 coldain heater.<br />
coldain heater = allspice, brown algae, shotglass, flask of water.<br />
<br />
If it is permanent, I am just glad that 2 of my chars have finished shawl 8.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I hope they make him sell them again too the otters hate me something about killing them or something. BAH!<br />
<br />
Guess Ill have to sneak up and buy them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i made a stack for a guy last night for 500pp.  not bad.  i dont mind the change.  course i am a wizard with cs port.  it would really suck without that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Raddan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well it's been a while, and still no Temper on the guy next to the rogue trainer in Thurg.  Any other NPC vendors?  No?  Then where do I get all the words or ruins to make the hundreds of celestial essence I'll need?  Any other source besides mob drops? :confused:<br />
<br />
Ahh! Scent of Marr!  TY TY TY.  guess I shoulda looked at that list a little more closely.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">across the courtyard from the guy selling the solvent in pok.  :)  makes making 80 cvt much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>FeroceFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Looks like these tempers will remain player-made only for quite some time.  While this bugged 0 pricing was bad news for you for a while, it's good news in the long run, as this will provide steady income for the brewing community.<br />
