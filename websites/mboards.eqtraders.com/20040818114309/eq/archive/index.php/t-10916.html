<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mazaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Working on some magician spell research with my level 29 magician and have a couple low-level trivials and a recipie problem.<br />
<br />
Minor Summoning: Earth, made this spell with skill 49 and it reported as trivial (no big shock).<br />
<br />
Lesser Summoning: Earth, made this spell with skill 49 and it reported as trivial (again, no big shock).<br />
<br />
Tried to make a 'Summoning: Earth' spell using the posted recipie (Glove of Rallos Zek, Words of Dimension, and Lesser Summoning: Earth) in an Elemental Grimoire but it wouldn't combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mazaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just created 'Greater Summoning: Earth' at skill 61 and it did not report as trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the recipe i have for Summoning: Earth is:<br />
<br />
words of Coercion<br />
gloves of rallos zek<br />
lesser summoning: earth<br />
<br />
This was from May 2000, though, and is marked unconfirmed. Also, that spell can be purchased somewhere as i did not research it myself, and i made all spells that could not be purchased from a NPC (no bazaar back in those days!)<br />
<br />
good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ilona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Updated trivials in database<br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm the recipe for the spell that has wrong recipe in the database please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mendatenrognabs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In my recipe list for magician spell research (compiled from other sources in 2001) lists no recipe for the level 24 spell summoning earth.  It was NPC buyable because I do have the spell.<br />
<br />
The recipe that Ndaara gives looks very much like the recipe for the level 29 Greater summoning earth.  Words of Coercion seem to be for the 29 pets, while words of Dimension seem to be for the 24 pets.  The only difference between Ndaara's recipe for the 24 earth, and my recipe for the 29 earth is Spell: Lesser Summoning Earth vs. Spell: Summoning Earth.  Perhaps Ndaara got confused.  <br />
<br />
I Believe I have all of the components to test Ndaara's recipe in my bank.  I will get back to here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mendatenrognabs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just tried the following and they were all DNC.<br />
<br />
Words of Coercion, Lesser Summoning Earth, Gloves of Rallos Zek<br />
Words of Dimension, Lesser Summoning Earth, Gloves of Rallos Zek<br />
Words of Dimension, Lesser Summoning Earth, Topaz<br />
Words of Coercion, Lesser Summoning Earth, Topaz<br />
<br />
I since there is a NPC buyable version if this spell, I would have to say that this recipe does not exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">no, actually, i didn't get confused. My list is from 3/8/2000, as posted at http://www.watson.org/~wander/eq/recipies.html (the only recipe source i could find back then). 24 earth can be vendor bought, so i didn't try to make it.<br />
<br />
sorry it didn't work!<br />
<br />
for future reference:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tunist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Originally posted by Ndaara <br />
level 44: buy fire <br />
<br />
All four level 44 pet spells are sold in Katta Castellium, third floor of the int casters guild.<br />
<br />
Vendors here sell some otherwise research-only spells for other classes too, like Gravity Flux and Thunderbold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Updated trivials, except for the Mist Elemental Spells. <br />
<br />
Don't have the Recipes for these yet... can you provide them?<br />
<br />
Minor Summoning Mist Elemental - Trivial at or below 47 (&lt;=47)<br />
Summon Elemental Mist - Trivial greater than 48 (&gt;48)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mavick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Mist Elemental spells are the Air Elemental spells.  It is the name that came up when I researched it.<br />
<br />
This information was pulled from castersrealm and I had it up when I was making my combines.<br />
<br />
Level 16<br />
Minor Summoning Mist Elemental<br />
<br />
Ingredients:<br />
Summon Air Elemental Scroll (level 12) <br />
Aviak Feather<br />
Words of Tyranny  <br />
<br />
Level 24<br />
Summon Elemental Mist<br />
<br />
Ingredients:<br />
Lesser Summoning: Air Scroll (level 20)<br />
Words of Dimension <br />
Pearl Shard  <br />
<br />
<br />
In fact, looking at the names of the air pets, the name changes each time a new spell level pet is acquired until like level 34.  After that, I'm not sure as the 39 doesn't seem to have a researchable air/mist pet.<br />
<br />
Level 12 is called Air<br />
Level 16 is called Mist<br />
Level 20 is called Air<br />
Level 24 is called Mist<br />
Level 29 is called Air<br />
<br />
... don't ask me why- if I knew I'd probably still be the only one laughing at my inside joke.<br />
<br />
Mavick- for Props who can't reach the keyboard to order that booster seat online.</div></div><hr />
