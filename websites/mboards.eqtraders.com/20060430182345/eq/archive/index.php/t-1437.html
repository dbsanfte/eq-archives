<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tilnoom</div><div class="date">12-24-2002, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings.<br />
<br />
Couple of questions from a Tailor who needs Smithing for Cultural combines.<br />
<br />
For cultural, I need to combine the following to create an enchanted steel thread:<br />
1 x gold thread<br />
1 x large brick enchanted ore<br />
1 x smithy hammer  <br />
<br />
Now, this wouldn't be a probem apart from the fact my erudite has no strength and there isn't a HQ ore vendor close to the Erudite Forge. The best one would probably be PoK/Bazaar (providing they aren't out of stock again).<br />
<br />
How do other low strength smiths go about carting around tons and tons of ore? I don't want to do what I did before, and get myself stuck w/o certain tools at bind point unable to move :)<br />
<br />
Other than binding myself at the Erudite Forge and doing as many combines as I can in one go, porting back up, get loads of ore, gate, rinse and repeat.. I can see no other way of doing it. Anyone else have easier ways which they use?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Tils.</div></div><hr />

Depends on your access to pp as well. You can camp for or buy weight reducing bags. Perhaps one of the easier is the Rallic Pack (85% weight reduction, which sell for around 1K on our server, but are lore), Archeologist's pack (from Goblin Archeologist in Permafrost, 6 slot, 25% WR), or any of a number of other 100% WR items, which run 2-5K in Bazaar. You do have to spend time auctioning for them in Bazaar or in the Auction channel.<br />
<br />
Another method is to GM a tradeskill, get your trophy, and then you can summon as many 100% WR bags as you have slots for. This, of course, assumes you are at least 51 and can plop AA points into New Tanaan Tradeskill Mastry to GM the smithing skill  as well.<br />
<br />
Another tried and true method we smiths of old used to use when one could only purchase MQ Ore from 3 places in all of Norrath, none of which were near the mold vendors: Purchase in Bazaar, put them in the bank, and get a SoW potion and STR buffs (or STR potions)  to help you lug them from the bank to the forge. Your gate back method also works well if you are a class that can gate. There are things that can make your job easier, but none that will make it simple :)<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />

Since this zone has no AGI issues you can use the forge in this same zone. Anyone interested in tradeskills remember weight reduction bags are a must.<br />
<br />
You can also buy all the goodies you need and put into the bank, run to Bazaar and use the forge there.<br />
<br />
Weight reduction bags:<br />
Archeologist Pack<br />
Bag of Sewn Evil Eye<br />
Bag of the Tinkerers<br />
Blood Encrusted Glove<br />
Bootstrutters Framed Pack<br />
Box of Nil Space<br />
Darkwood Trunk<br />
Driftwood Treasure Chest <br />
Dusty Ransackers Pack<br />
Featherweight Pouch<br />
Foragers Bag<br />
Herbalist Pack<br />
Kayruuls Mystic Pouch<br />
Kobold Shaman's Pouch<br />
Large Soiled Bag<br />
Light Burlap Sack<br />
Lionhide Backpack<br />
Momento Box<br />
Pierce's Pouch of Storing<br />
Rallic Pack<br />
Shralok Pack<br />
Traveler's Pack<br />
Travelers Pouch<br />
Treasure Hunter's Satchel<br />
<br />
Hopefully this list will help, many are sold in Bazaar, some are no-drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tuga</div><div class="date">12-24-2002, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Magicians and Shaman can also summon 100% weight reduction packs for ya . These are No Rent, so make shure you don't log with anything in them you don't want to loose. SoW potions will also allow ya to move with any amount of weight, when I had to buy ore from Grobb and forge it in Oggok I'd routinely have over 1K in weight on me. Good smithin. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cigarskunk</div><div class="date">12-24-2002, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can also get a guildy or a friend to kill you then simply drag the corpse loaded down with bags of ore to the forge and take them out as you need them - just make sure that they don't hit you with DoTs and that the guards don't descide to &quot;help&quot; you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vagabond</div><div class="date">12-24-2002, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another option for those with 2 accounts.<br />
<br />
Create a gimp lvl 1 max cha ench, give whatever cha gear you need to max out prices.<br />
<br />
Bind her at your forge, or wherever you want to do the handoffs.<br />
<br />
Go buy the ore, get fully wt'd down, nuke or melee the merch and die.<br />
<br />
Pop at bind with ore.<br />
<br />
Trade to the main character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kuronekosama</div><div class="date">12-24-2002, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, If the distance between buying the ore and the forge isn't too great, then just simply get a sow pot or jboots.  If you have a speed increasing effect, you can encumber yourself to your hearts content and still be able to move, albeit at a snails pace.  Careful though, because at that point even the slightest fall can kill you.  I dropped about the height of my toon, and took 20000 points of damage.  That's not an exageration, that's the real # heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sinuuyanea Nocturne</div><div class="date">12-24-2002, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or, if you're indoors and have a snare spell, do this:<br />
<br />
1:  Snare yourself (dead serious)<br />
2:  Press the Num Lock key<br />
3:  Strafe.  While snared, you will be able to strafe at normal speed, as long as you are on auto run (Num Lock)<br />
<br />
This is what I did in Neriak: thankfully, I had enough HP to withstand the damage from Engulfing Darkness to make it to the forge...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garulf</div><div class="date">12-25-2002, 12:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All good suggestions, but the easiest method by far is one of these:<br />
<br />
If you have two accounts (or a friend willing to help), either make a newbie to buy the ore for you (bind them in front of the forge you'll be using), then have them attack the merchant, they'll die, and pop up at their bind point with the ore on them.  (I know someone posted that, just trying to consolidate).  Or for the freind helping out, have them bind at the forge, go buy the ore and gate back.<br />
<br />
If your friend happens to be a GM tradeskiller, with his/her trophy, have them do the same thing as above, only they won't have to  worry about encumberance.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you are a gating class, it's even easier, bind yourself in front of forge, then go buy your ore and gate back.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">12-26-2002, 08:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually if you are going to use a second account or friend and you need the ore enchanted, here's the way to go:<br />
<br />
get a 24 wizard (20 in your case for Tox gate, I have to use nek gate).<br />
<br />
Bind at baz, gate/run to ore vendor, buy ore, gate to baz, hand off ore, enchant ore, bank ore.<br />
<br />
Run to forge, bind.<br />
<br />
Go to bank, unload ore, gate to bind.<br />
<br />
Retreive ore from wizard.  Wizard can bind nexus and gate there and run to baz to meet trader with finished components if necessary.<br />
<br />
Weight reducing bags don't help enough if you have to make a lot of trips with a lot of ore.  With run 3, a rallic pack, large soiled bag (&amp;lt;- must have for smiths!), dusty ransackers bag, herbologist and archaelogist packs, bear skin potion (yeah, not WR I know), and bag of sewn evil eye I still get very encumbered, very often.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even the cheap ones let you move fine while super encumbered.<br />
<br />
Though this isn't the 'best' way to go about it, horses have quite a few other benefits for most low-strength folks. :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cavel</div><div class="date">12-26-2002, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I do is, having 2 accounts, bind my chanter near the cultural forge. Buff her up with SOW and Str and char. Send her to the Merchant for the ore, gate back enchant the metal then hand it off. This is what I see as the best way to work with this.<br />

As long as he has a drum equipped, he can move.<br />

Sow potions help. The cheapest horse helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Question - would horses work in cities? I can quite easily buy a cheap and nasty donkey to ride around on.<br />
<br />
I'll have a think and see what happens :)<br />

I do have one note for you about horses if you decide to buy one.... be aware that if you are heavily encumbered you can die very easily to falling damage while on a horse and even its innate safefall will not protect you.<br />
<br />
So low hp characters beware, I once travelled from West Commons to East Commons tunnel overladen with platinum (carrying about 400 pounds of the stuff) and took about 2000 points of falling damage cumulative.....  horse would crest a small bump along the desert portion of the commonlands and I'd fall for 1 to 400 damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Herculez</div><div class="date">12-30-2002, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get a 10 charge sow potion and sow yourself before you purchase ingredients.  Bind near where you need to forge, and go pick up items.  Even if your agi drops to 1 and you couldnt move otherwise, the increase in speed that sow adds with still work.  Meaning that even fully encumbered, you can always move with a sow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cubwynn</div><div class="date">12-30-2002, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't depend on SoW potions... on my level one armor mule, a SoW potion only lasts for a very few minutes. Enough to walk from the Halas Pit of Doom and Curio Shop to the Bank and possibly back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pietre Christopher-Ryskin</div><div class="date">12-30-2002, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I buy what I need on an enchanter level 8 mule with cha gear and a bear skins of rage that I got for 3p off a vendor (15str, all/all) and hit the vendor who promptly returns it to its bindpoint next to my smith. He doesn't loose xp, his corpse goes poof fast, and he brings back the haul.<br />
<br />
For no rent stuff, I have a &quot;grand plan&quot; that I haven't tried out yet because I have not had the need, but here it goes: Have a level 10 that gets killed every so often. With the new &quot;newbie rules&quot; from Sony, he wouldn't loose xp, and he's the level that characters start having to do &quot;CR&quot; so his inventory would be on the corpse as well as having the long timer. <br />
<br />
When I have to shop while loaded, I tend to use the Strengthen spell and strafe. (hold right mouse, push forward/side). It would not surprise me if your movement speed would match ~1.41 times as fast as otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andaerice</div><div class="date">12-31-2002, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm curious about this...<br />
a SoW potion only lasts for a very few minutes<br />
I always have a 10 dose SoW potion on me.  I haven't timed it, but it seems to last at least 30 minutes per cast, but I think it actually lasts 45.<br />
<br />
With the SoW on I can easily get back and forth to the forge full of ore at 200+ stones overweight and my AGI down to 1.</div></div><hr />
