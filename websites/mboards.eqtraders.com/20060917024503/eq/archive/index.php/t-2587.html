In any case, I know cobalt cod is fished in CS (doing that right now actually).  But if you have the tracking skill, you can see a lot of green-con &quot;a cobalt trigger&quot; swimming in the water.  I tried to hunt one down, but they are too fast and small for me to even click on.<br />
<br />
Has anyone tried to &quot;catch&quot; one of these guys?  And if so, do they just drop fish scales, or... I'm hoping, cobalt cod?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wish cod was a little hiigher on the fish list too-i fish 4 times as much fresh fish =(  at least you can kill wyverns and fish while you med =)</div></div><hr />

I never saw them drop cobolt cods either.  I'd estimate that I'd killed 40-50 of them.</div></div><hr />
