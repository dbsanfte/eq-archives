First post. I'm looking at buying some Tunarean Soldier Leggings for my level 45 druid main. I've only done a little in regards to tradeskills. No where even remotely close to being able to do the final combines and probably not able to do the lesser combines. <br />
<br />
First question is, If I were to bring all the pieces needed for the combines and final combines, what would guess that it would cost for the combine?<br />
<br />
Second question is, What do you think it would cost to buy all the pieces on average?<br />
<br />
Third question is, How much would it cost to be delivered some leggings without any of the pieces?<br />
<br />
Fourth question is, If I brought the pieces, and the player is doing it for free, what is a good tip (pp)?<br />
<br />
Thanks much for the response. This is a very good resource.<br />
BTW, i've created a document that has all the pieces and what is needed for each combine. This might be of use to others. Feel free to distribute to where it would be most readily found to others and make updates if anything is incorrect. This info was created from eqtraders and allakhazam's. <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

(edit...Bah, formatting of indents won't hold...don't know if this is useful now....<br />
