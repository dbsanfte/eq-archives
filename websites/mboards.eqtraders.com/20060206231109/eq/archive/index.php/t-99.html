<br />
Again, since I'm first, I'll go first:<br />
<br />
I'm looking for stacks of Zombie Skins or Black Wolf Skins.  <br />
<br />
In exchange I can craft Poison Vials, Wu's Fighting Armor, Banded Armor, Enchanted Gold Jewelry, or various Tradeskiling tools, exchange rates TBD.  Alternatively, I will pay cash, double whatever NPC merchants will pay for the Skins.<br />
<br />
Please contact me before collecting, so we can agree on an exchange rate before you go hunting.<br />
