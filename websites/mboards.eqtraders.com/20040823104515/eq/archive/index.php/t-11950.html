<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>HoverCraaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">SO I'm a part time player, but I have two accts to support. Not in any uber guild, and no massive amount of income flowing in.<br />
<br />
So you can imagine my frustration when it takes 60+ combines one day for a single skill up, and 230 combines another day for 3 skill up in Pottery with 203 INT. I'm a Rogue. I spent alot of cash just to get INT gear to do this very skill (over 5k). <br />
<br />
All on these #^$%@ casserole dishes. =)<br />
<br />
63 combines = 1 skill up = 188 skill.<br />
230 combines = 3 skill ups = 191 skill. <br />
<br />
So i ask, is there no end to this boring and monotenous skill?<br />
<br />
I have purpose to get my Rogue up in skill (don't we all want that GM Poison Vial?). But what I do not have is 50+K to dump into a skill.<br />
<br />
Any help, flames, or other input from peanut gallery would be appricated. <br />

Rather expensive, but might be less painful than doing it the clickclickclick way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thats not very helpful since the skill he's frustrated about is pottery...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaasper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pottery is not a required part of Posion making. All vials but the advanced can be got from merchants.<br />
<br />
Advanced posion vials are always returned on combine (when you make 10 stack posions).<br />
<br />
So I advise you to spend your money on learning posion making and save pottery until your rich n famous.</div></div><hr />

And all this time ive been gonig off information stating that the artisan seal is trivial at &gt;250!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
I want mah plat back! I have a dr00d for such trade skill things... LOL<br />
<br />
Should I hunt down and kick the website inthe jimmy that I got that info from? Or has the Artisan Seal been changed on combine difficulty as of late?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Galain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The seal has a relatively low trivial.  I don't remember it exactly, but I think it witll be trivial at your skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">To the best of my knowledge, we have specified that the trivial of the unfired Artisan Seal has been &lt; 150 for a long time (over a year)... and &lt; 102 for the past several months.<br />
<br />
As for &quot;getting your plat back&quot;... sorry, can't help you there. <br />
<br />
As for getting angry and ranting at the site that told you it was trivial &gt; 250... that is your choice... but will it really do any good other than to get your fustration out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>HoverCraaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for the help all!<br />
<br />
Confirmed trivial lvl for Artisan Seal is &lt;102 (one post suggested it at 99) from what I've gathered in reading up on it. To fire it is only 15 (although still high failure rate according to some). <br />
<br />
Krazick, I was only kidding about the &quot;getting mah plat back&quot; and &quot;kicking in the jimmy&quot; comment. I don't spam with riddiculous rants like so many I've seen. <br />
<br />
And to think that my humor is usually so obvious and clear...<br />
