<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ariaya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay ... I have to admit that picking my ranger for my tradeskilling character might not have been the smartest thing .. but she's my main and well .... <br />
<br />
Are there any suggestions in the not-too-expensive range that I could use for additional wis?<br />
<br />
Here's my magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=355393)  and I also have a charred guardian shield (+9 wis) and a platinum jasper ring (+6 wis) in the bank that I put on when tradeskilling .. gives me a whopping 138 wis without KEI (sigh)<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?  At this point I'm tempted to get a bunch of +10 Wis augs :) but I need to upgrade my armor first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>vizzie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The best advice is to go to the bazaar, do a search putting in your race, class, and select by stat wisdom, and 1 slot at a time. Click on the wisdom column to sort. Find things that are cheap and have more wisdom than what you have in that slot now. Buy them. Use them for tradeskilling.<br />
<br />
Also, don't forget stat food, like qeynos afternoon tea and misty thicket picnics. Stuff yourself full of normal food, put them in your food and water slots, trade skill, switch 'em back out.<br />
<br />
Couple things you might want to look for: ulthork hide tunics and most of the acryllia studded pieces are good deals, wisdom wise, off the top of my head. Just check the bazaar, you'll be surprised how quickly you can get over 200 wis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The 357 (something like that) point 10 stat augs are lore, but you could pick up 6 wis augs if you get a 63+ advent. I know my shaman has 5 of the 6 wis augs and I love the extra wis they bring.<br />
<br />
Lower levels will have lower stats on the augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/bazaar<br />
<br />
Search by wis, slot and your budget. *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Have you thought about your food and drink?<br />
<br />
Beer-Battered Cragbeast Sandwiches give WIS: +7 and don't require you to find huge amounts of vegetables. Only the cragbeast meat is not vendor supplied but you should be able to pick up quite a bit of it on the vendors in Natimbi.<br />
<br />
Misty Thicket Picnics are always a favourite and give WIS +5. You can pick up plenty of these in the bazaar from bakers or make them yourself.<br />
<br />
And on the drink front there is Qeynos Afternoon Tea also with WIS +5<br />
<br />
Back onto clothing and equipment. Well I can't get your Magelo profile to show on this PC due to the dicky network connection but here are a few popular choices:<br />
<br />
Earing of the Solstice - Must have for all casters due to the Flowing Thought stat (now called Mana Regen - how naff) But it also has great stats and gives WIS +8. It might seem a bit daft to mention this when you wanted to know about tradeskilling items but for the stats this is one of the best value items in the game. <br />
<br />
Sapphire Platinum Necklace gives WIS +8 and INT +8 meaning you can share it with any INT caster alts you might have and get double the benefit.<br />
<br />
Velium Jasper Ring gives WIS +7<br />
<br />
Velium Ruby Veil gives WIS +8<br />
<br />
And the list goes on......<br />
<br />
The trick is to forget about the other stats and build yourself a tradeskilling suit that you will only use in safe zones like the PoK. Any item that has high WIS and a selection of other good stats is going to be very pricy but an item that only has high WIS but poor other stats or none at all will be much cheaper. Remmeber that you don't need an item to have great AC if you are tradeskilling.<br />
<br />
Oh, and another thing.......... Grandmaster Brewers Corker. Brewing is one of the easiest and cheapest skills to GM. The final trophy is more expensive than the others but it's still worth it for the stats. If your ranger is your main character and you don't have a pressing need to GM another skill before you hit level 51 then you should seriously consider making brewing your first GM skill. Dropping that corker into your range slot will give you WIS +10 but also CHA +50 and provide you with unlimited 100% weigth reduction, no-rent, giant capacity bags so you will never have to worry about weight penalties again when you are out foraging (or buy too many blocks of ore when skilling up smithing *blush*).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Metra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's a long and difficult quest, but I did the &quot;Shield of Bane Warding&quot; quest specifically so I could get the +20 wisdom for tradeskilling. (The most difficult part is getting the 8 skulls, but you can do that while you are farming acrylia in TM, since you have tracking...)<br />
<br />
Also Axgoreth's Belt of Defense is a fairly common drop in ME and has +15 wisdom.<br />
<br />
Also - isn't there a +WIS tribute buff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My tradeskiller is my ranger as well (wood elf.)  I did what a lot of people here suggested.  I went into the bazaar, and searched for WIS items and slot.  I concentrated on slots that had items without WIS on them first, but I didn't buy anything until I searched every slot.  I found a nice tunic (forgot the name) that gave me a nice boost of WIS over my current one, and it was really cheap.  So I bought that instead of something more expensive.  My WIS is around 200 (including a MTP and QAT) when tradeskilling.  I'm into smithing as well, and bought a set of STR gear just for that.  I can get up to 245 with the self buff, and easily hit 255 with a little help from a shammy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nanndas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Get a KEI also when you are about to start doing a ts. My druid is at 230 wisdom when I put cragbeast steaks in the the first inventory slot. I had KEI last night and he hit 255 wisdom. I went the bazaar route for my BL and got him to 207 with stat food..<br />
<br />
<br />
Nan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dalur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not sure what your budget is or anything, but I have one of these that would be a great item.  If you have the funds, you might pick up 2 of them - http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17382 <br />
<br />
<br />
And here is a shield slot item you could use also - http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7830<br />
<br />
A range slot item - have to camp to get it, but that could be an option also - http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7338<br />
<br />
<br />
There are probably lots of other items out there, I would go to allakhazam's and look slot by slot to see what you can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I looked over your profile on Magelo, and (please don't take this as insulting, but I am good at spotting this sort of thing) it seems you're well geared for adventuring but short on loose cash.  That said, you should take the advice here about going to the Bazaar, but I wanted to give you a few things to watch for, or perhaps to commission if you can't find them, since they'll give you the wisdom boosts you need for trades without leaving you penniless.<br />
<br />
Rings: First, upgrade the fire emerald.  Please.  Level 58 characters with platinum jewelry makes Bristlebane cry.  Then, upgrade the platinum jasper to a velium jasper.  It's only one point more, but the extra cost can be offset by selling the ring you have, and every point can help.<br />
<br />
Food/drink: Definitely the cheap way to get a wisdom boost.  Cragbeast foods are high in wisdom, and if you don't want to try making it yourself or buying in the Bazaar, mine the baking vendors on the Queen of Thorns itself, where you can often find these things that players sold back to clear space, for much less than you'd pay in the Bazaar.  For drink, Qeynos Afternoon Tea is about as good as it gets reliably, so buy or brew it and use it.<br />
<br />
Acrylia Studded Cloak: One item, 10 wisdom, usually cheap.  'Nuff said.<br />
<br />
Acrylia Studded Mask: 5 wisdom on the face slot, and they're absolutely everywhere since they're the cheap acrylia studded item for skillups.  If you can't score one off a vendor near a loom, you can still get one for a pittance in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
Velium Polished Quartz Necklace: made from polished quartz foraged in LDoN, it adds 8 wisdom, and if you can commission it from a jeweler, it's a great cheap boost.<br />
<br />
Wrists:  There are a number of wrist items that add wisdom,so check the Bazaar, but you may want to go hunting at your level in the Umbral Plains as well.  There, a bracelet of sense drops that's just like your bracelet of fortitude, but has 15 wisdom instead of 15 stamina.  It's not easy, but a group of equal level folks will get good experience there, and you can get some awesome drops, so selling your groupmates by linking your bracelet of fortitude will usually get you enough support to do it.<br />
<br />
Velium Ruby Veil: 8 wisdom, in your face.<br />
<br />
Now, if I was wrong, and you have a lot of dough to blow, there are other choices that will still be cheaper than top end but will get you very wise.<br />
<br />
Cobalt Drake Belt: 8 wisdom belt that you can wear while you're at your skills.  Your sash haste doesn't help the combine button speed, after all.<br />
<br />
Shield of Bane Warding: Don't even consider buying it.  Go get it for yourself.  It's a good quest, it's good experience, and it's a lot cheaper than paying Bazaar rates.  But if you have money, you can buy it for a large bankroll.<br />
<br />
Emerald Dragonscale Tunic: It's 20 wisdom and usually much cheaper than anything comparable.  It's still not cheap, but cheaper.<br />
<br />
Lodizal Shell Shield: What fits in your back slot, gives 10 wisdom, enduring breath and enough other stuff that you might very well want to replace your Tigeraptor Cloak?  The Lodizal Shell Shield.  Many people forget that it can be worn on your back because it's a shield, but you can get this and still use both those blades.  Not a big improvement in wisdom over your current item, but the extra stats (and enduring breath forever) can seal the deal.<br />
<br />
Earring of the Solstice: You may want to get this anyway, to replace your earring of woven bark.  Mana regen, 8 wisdom, and a host of other stats make this a must have.  I know warriors wearing this thing.  I strongly suggest it.<br />
<br />
I hope this gives you a few ideas.  Happy skilling!<br />

LOL .. not insulting at all!  Accurate!  I've been busy leveling and not so busy farming cash.  There's a few pieces of gear that need upgrades even for normal adventuring .. that ring is one of them.<br />
<br />
Thank you to everyone for all the suggestions!  I don't mind a camp or two especially when I'll get some xp out of it.<br />
<br />
Many thanks again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kentarre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just one other easy piece you might look for is an Emerald Dragonscale Tunic.  I found a good deal on just the scale and did the turnin myself (iirc, you need a fine breastplate and an ulthork tusk?? in addition).  Ive even made a little money on doing that quest again - buy the scale low and sell the tunic high...<br />
<br />
Anyway, here's my magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=593476&amp;alt=146629) as well, if you can get any ideas from that (I'm a woodelf ranger).<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Saleani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Take a look at my magelo, and click on the tradeskilling profile. Its a little out of date, but reasonably accurate. This character was originally made to model fine plate armor for sale, and had a naked wis of 85, but now, with AA and gear, can get to over 300 wis without c3, food or drink.<br />
<br />
I also have an emerald dragonscale tunic that floats around my chars (along with my shoulders). You may find a tae ew tunic for a reasonable price, and that is like 11 wis, and decent combat armor for your level as well.<br />
<br />
I got a shield from the takish theme that has something like +9 or +10 wis, and added 2 augments to make it +29 wis (one of the augments was the lore +10 wis all-slot aug, it has a type 1 and type 2 slot). If thats too many adventure points, then maybe spending part of a day to camp Dylan in High pass for the Testament of Vanear, although its only +10 wis and not that much of an improvement to your CGS. <br />
<br />
Stop over in Maidens Eye, and shop at the 4-arms for an axgoreth belt. They are level 58, and the best drops for the belt are at the zone to UP (but some mad trains), the zone to AR is a second best: you may be able to find a group camping the shards in ME down by the AR zone. Add a +5/6 wis augment and you have a +20/21 wis belt.<br />
<br />
Stop in Qeynos and beat up fabulous fippy for a +5 wis range item. <br />
<br />
Stop in solB and head over to the king tranix camp. Because the fabulous king tranix drops nice stuff, he is perma-camped. Most folks consider the +13 int/wis necklace to be the booby prize. With a +6 wis augment, you are looking at a +19 wis necklace. But as tradeskillers, we know better, don't we? It is extremely likely that the necklace will rot, since it always used to rot when clearing for naggy raids. Golden Efreeti boots are pretty cheap these days, especially since the fabulous GEBs are being perma-camped too. <br />
<br />
If shawl 8 is in your near term future, that would help with wis. As mentioned by others, I would also like to recommend a solstice earring.<br />
<br />
I would check out allakhazam to look at quest armor as some can can be among the better +wis gear around (like my helm and arms of ro), although the ivy etched is lower wis than what you have. The shield on my back is a quest out of katta. If your guild hunts Yelinak for gear, try to get the head, +9 wis and 41% haste. The AC and HP make it one of the best guantlets you are likely to get outside of VT or the elemental planes. What you need to do for faction will be very hard though. If you do get the Yeli head, search for posts by me in the quests forum for more detail than you want to know.</div></div><hr />
