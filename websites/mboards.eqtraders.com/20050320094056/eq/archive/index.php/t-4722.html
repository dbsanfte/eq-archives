<br />
Wanted to share this upcoming special event with everyone! <br />
<br />
Dining Out for Life is a wonderful international event. As with all special events, success depends mostly on getting the word out, because the amount of money raised depends on how many people participate. Dining Out for Life is all about raising money for our fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, friends and relatives who are living with HIV/AIDS. That is the sole purpose. I wish to God that we didn&#8217;t have to do this. I wish that this horrendous disease no longer existed, but it does, and we have to continue helping those affected take care of themselves. We have to be extra generous with our time and money so that they will continue to live with dignity and care for as long as they live. <br />
<br />
For people living with HIV/AIDS and other life-challenging illnesses, the battle is far from over. We just make sure no one has to do it on an empty stomach. <br />
<br />
There is an organization here in D.C. that is called Food &amp; Friends. Food &amp; Friends prepares, packages and delivers meals and groceries to more than 1,100 people living with HIV/AIDS and other life-challenging illnesses such as breast, lung and colon cancer throughout Washington, DC and 14 counties of Maryland and Virginia. For more than 14 years, Food &amp; Friends has provided food and companionship to our clients, their loved ones and caregivers. <br />
<br />
Once a year, they do a fund raiser that helps them raise funds to operate. Well, Thursday March 13 is the next night here in DC. By going to a listed restaurant, part, if not all, of your bill will be donated to Food &amp; Family. <br />
<br />
For a list of participating restaurants, please go to http://www.diningoutforlife.com/ <br />

Now, you may be saying to yourself, I don't live in DC, what good would it do... Well, if you go to the above link, there are organizations in most major cities who use the Dining Out For Life to support local organizations who strive to help feed people living with HIV/AIDS. <br />
