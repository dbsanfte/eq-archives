<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, this has been ranted about before, but it is far from dead.  I do not ask that everyone have perfect grammar, perfect spelling, or an advanced college degree to play EQ.  However, is it too much to ask that people take a reasonable stab at making coherent statements?  All of us suffer from keyboard lag, and so mistakes happen in EQ, but for God's sake, spell check your macros! If I see the word &quot;Incomming!&quot; ever again I will scream!<br />
<br />
This goes for your posts on EQTraders as well.  If you are posting something you want us to read, attempt to spell every 9th or 10th word correctly.  Your posts lose all credibility if we have to hire someone to translate them into something close to English!<br />
<br />
/sigh. Use your abbreviations, type slowly if you must, go back and edit your posts, just make it worth our time to listen/read. I am sure there are others that express my irritation in this, make me feel better and let me know that you do!</div></div><hr />

I kid you not a Ph.D grad student in religious studies put these &quot;words&quot; up on the board during her &quot;practice lecture&quot; time in our class.<br />

Lay - the non-ordained, non-professional ministers of a church.<br />
<br />
Protestant - non-catholic christians.<br />
<br />
Nightstand - a table by the bed.<br />
<br />
One cannot &quot;Lay&quot; or &quot;Protestant&quot; as they are not VERBS. Making 'ization' forms of either of these words impossible.<br />
<br />
There is a HUGE difference between a Night Stand and a Nightstand in the bedroom I think most would agree. (If you don't see the difference seek professional help, you sicko. Making love to furniture is just wrong.)<br />
<br />
I told my wife (who has a Masters of Arts degree in English/Creative Writing) about &quot;Protestantization&quot; and she clapped her hands to her head and went &quot;la la la&quot; for a minute and then said &quot;You can't just MAKE UP words!!&quot;</div></div><hr />

(Or don't speak very good american :p ).  But I can't stand people (especially when they're asking me for buffs) that can't even take the time to type out the word please.  It's even more pathetic when I ask them to ask me in proper english and 95% of the buff beggers don't understand when I say &quot;Please ask me in proper english.&quot; /sigh.  I deal with it to a certain extent, but if I have to work to understand you and it's because you aren't even trying to make yourself understood, I don't care what you have to say, it's not worth my time.</div></div><hr />

I know on the boards I CAN do something about it (I just don't very often) but in EQ there is just not the time to spell check.  Nor would I have word up to do the spellcheck for me?<br />
 <br />
so you think I should just drop playing EQ because my very logical mind cannot wrap itself around the total illogic that is spelling in the english language?</div></div><hr />

You use the words that are already there but have been bastardized or forgotten. We really don't need that many new words.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sometimes I do rely on older words.  There are a few words like blatherskite that I'll dust off and use on occasion.  At the same time I'm also one of those who makes up words regularly.  Some days I have to go to 97 and sit around doing a whole lot of nagdt before going home and commenting how seven-four it all was.  The people I know offline would easily interpret all of those words plus all the other strange invented terms I'm likely to use.  One of my friends has even gone so far as to compile a lexicon of the invented terms we apply to things.  &quot;I'm going out for stk-chz-bev, want any?&quot;  &quot;It's about time for me to epso now.&quot;  We tend to avoid these words on message boards or on EverQuest.  They pretty much amount to an inside joke that would annoy more than amuse when used with most people outside the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I understand there are reasons, and that there are non-native speakers.  But many of you hit it right on the head, the native speakers are the ones that seem to butcher the language the most.  I have personally never spoken with you in game, Ngreth, so I have no idea if I can understand what you say in game or not.  No, I don't ask that you quit EQ, but this game is a text based medium, and it is becoming more and more a button-crunching speed game as well.  As such, if you say something that no one can understand, people die.  I am guilty of pressing a spac ebar too quickly, but that is easily corretable with a simple space* bar.  I played a bard, and still actively play a bard.  I know all about having to speak/type quickly if I want to do my job, I just got good at communicating in 3 seconds intervals.<br />
<br />
In my above rant, my biggest complaint is a macro that hasn't been spell checked!  If you have the words &quot;Incomming!&quot; in your macro, it is just incorrect, fix it.  I have told many people it is spelled incorrectly and they just don't care!  I do not honestly wish anyone to leave the game, and I applaud anyone who is attempting to learn a new language, because God knows I would have a terrible time playing EQ in Arabic, I just do not speak it that well. <br />
<br />
 However, that said, there are games I simply cannot play because my mind can't handle them, I am colorblind and that prohibits me from playing some games because I cannot distinguish between certain parts of the game, so I do not play them.  For the players that cannot piece together a proper thought because of some reason or another, it becomes a burden on the others there, this is most evident recently when someone new was leading one of my guild's raids, his communication skills were so poor that we could not function behind him.  Having known him personally, I can say that it is just pure laziness on his part, and by his assertion &quot;You know what I meant, figure it out.&quot; (Spelling and grammar fixed for him.)  I am sure some form of disability applies to maybe 0.001% of the community, the rest are just too lazy to care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Did you know that as long as the first and last letter of a word is correct, and all fo the proper letters are in the word... most adults can read the word without serious difficulty, AND at good speed (where the minor slowdown of reading it will not &quot;get them killed&quot;)<br />
<br />
 <br />
I tend to spell phonetically since the english language is so horribly illogical.  You can at least tell what I meant to say.<br />
 <br />
Never has a misspelling got anyone killed.  AND I trully may not know I have spelled soemthing wrong in a macro until someone tells me.  At wich point I am happy to fix it :)<br />
 <br />
I have never had a problem with having my spelling corrected.  My problem is with people telling me to go away, or that I am stupid because I have a problem with spelling.  Just because I have spelling problems does not mean I am uninteligent.  I DO have a problem memorising things.  It has never worked well for me my whole life.  At 34 I can no longer spend 8 hours a day for a year to memorize all the silly exceptions to the rules, that it would take... that my still memory deficient mind would forget in about 9 months... so I would have to do it all over again.<br />
 <br />
My common TYPOS on top of my spelling are transposed letters (when 2 letters are on diferent hands on the keyboard is the most common time for this) and the space in the wrong place :)<br />
 <br />
And yes.  I am not putting this through a spell checker as I sometimes do, so everyone can see what a horrible person I am and how teriblly imposible it is to read what I say, because I have a spelling issue.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ngreth, your type of spelling mistakes don't bother me.  I can understand the people who mispell occational words, and transpose letters etc etc.  I do a decent amount of that myself, and oftentimes I hit enter without it going past a checking thing in my brain.  I have no problem with people who are bad spellers, I'm one myself.  But, the people who type so badly that I can't understand them, or the &quot;plz buf&quot; etc people I just don't want to deal with. :)  I use some short forms of words myself, but nothing annoys me more than someone who doesn't really mean please or thank you to the point that they won't even take the time to type the word out.  If what you want isn't worth the time to say please then you can live just fine without it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Saleani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You can't just MAKE UP words!! Actually, Shakespeare did it all the time. He would verbify nouns, and nounify verbs. A long time ago, in an english class, we went through many of the words and phrases that he created. Did many of them stand the test of time? no. But if you lead someone down a primrose path, you can thank him for that phrase. I vaguely remember that the number of unique words he created was around 2000, but only about 100 are still in use.<br />
<br />
So where are new words supposed to come from? The english language is very much like a magpie. If any of them there foreigners leave a pretty word laying about, we're gonna snap it right up. Any language that prevents the addition of new words is a dead language. Humans make words to describe concepts that are important. To the ancient greeks, the word for drunk and the word for insane were the same: the distinction was not important to them at all. But those same ancient greeks had 8 words that get translated into the english word &quot;love.&quot; Loving chocolate is not the same as sexual love, nor the love between a parent and child; and none of those is the word that is used in the new testament in the phrase &quot;love thy neighbor...&quot; My Oxford English Dictionary has something like 215,000 words in it. To get into the OED, a word has to be in common use for over 10 years. Lots of the words in the OED are obsolete and have not been used in a couple hundred years. <br />
<br />
Why are word spellings inconsistant and irritating? Part of it has to do with swiping words from other languages (subpoena anyone?). Also part of it has to do with the way the written language was pretty much formalized in the 18th century. German spelling is consistant because 1 guy went around Germany and wrote down all the words being used and made the first dictionary. In England, there were 3 guys who went around doing the same, and they got together and, well, it came out more like 1 word from you, and one from you and around like that, so spelling is not consistant. And anyway, if you got in your wayback machine and went to the 16th or 17th century and tried to tell someone that there was one and only 1 way to spell a word, you would get laughed at. Other silly rules of grammar also came from that era. Why should we not split infinitives? Because one guy, in 1728, felt that latin was the perfect language, and you since could not split an infinitive (because an infinitive would be a single word) in latin, therefore it should be banned in english. Example: to go is an infinitive, to boldly go is a split infinitive; to go boldly would be the preferred construction if you get in an argument with an antisplitinfinitarian. <br />
<br />
Do I get irritated when reading mispelled posts? yes, but I live with it. Do I get irritated by reading mispelled stuff in game? no. I type around 90-100 wpm (I am a programmer and I live and die by the keyboard) and I know when I am banging away in the game that transposed letters happen all the time. Since my pinkie is used for the caps key, and its a lot slower than the other fingers, when something is capitalized, so usually are the next 1-4 letters. Since I touchtype, frequently, I put my hands down off by one key (oops, off by one is a common programming error too), so that &quot;stay back&quot; becomes &quot;dysu nsvl.&quot; whiskey tango foxtrot? Do you hunt and peck for the keys? Does your correspondant h&amp;p? Please cut them some slack. I encountered one guy in the game who is in a wheelchair and is limited to 1 finger at a time, and that &quot;finger&quot; is a pointer strapped to his hand. Completing a trade with him takes about 2-4 minutes as he has to move the trackball with something like a pencil. Tie a pencil to the back of your hand and try typing some time. <br />
<br />
One can sometimes tell who in the game is not a native speaker of english. It takes practice, but if you have studied other languages, you will start to pick out the sort of spelling and grammar errors that, say, a french person would make, or a japanese person. For example, someone who is a native speaker of slavic languages (say, russian) has a hard time with &quot;the&quot; and &quot;a&quot; because those do not exist in their native tongue. In japanese, &quot;no&quot; is placed at the end of the sentence to negate the sentence, a common error would be to place the &quot;no&quot; or &quot;not&quot; in a place that an english native speaker would not place it. <br />
<br />
The last gal I dated was russian. We met in a japanese class (go figure). Usually, she asked me to proofread her essays. Her grasp of english is far better than the average american college student. <br />
<br />
As for what kids learn and how they learn? I am not sure, but when I was in college the first time, students that were as little as 1 year younger than me had been brought up with some different theory of spelling/learning words and their spelling was a lot worse than mine. I don't remember learning to read and write, so I cannot tell you what method worked for me. I gave up whining about bad spelling about 20 years ago. If I hadn't, and the ulcers didn't kill me, the blood pressure would have killed me long ago. There are many different forms of learning disability that we are finally recognizing. 20-30 years ago we would not have cared, and just called them stupid (like my ex). You are not stupid. You are different. Some people can learn many languages very easily (like me), some cannot (like my sister). Some can listen to music and repeat it flawlessly (like my sister), some cannot (to which my ex would say to me &quot;you white people really don't have any rhythm&quot;). Some people can watch a dance performance one time (like my ex) and repeat it flawlessly, others fall over if they try to dance (stop looking at me like that). Some people are good with math, some people are not. Intelligence comes in many shapes. Perhaps knowing when to shut up is one, which I am not good at, so I better stop now.</div></div><hr />

Shakespeare was a hack. A great hack, but a hack. Shakespeare was to the Elizabethan era as Jerry Bruckheimer is to today; as sensational blockbuster entertainer out to make money.<br />
<br />
Just a thought. I don't think he meant 12 meanings for every phrase he wrote. He was just a good writer.</div></div><hr />

Much to our detriment... I wish we had more words for love. Too many uptight, close-minded people, and brainless infatuated children have ruined our word.<br />

Doesn't bother me that much when people have misspellings in conversations.  Spelling comes naturally to me but not so much to everyone else.  I don't expect those who find it harder to sit there stewing over each word to make sure they get it right.  I'm a rotten public speaker but I doubt audiences (when I have them) really want to wait while I carefully speak each word and choose the next.  <br />
<br />
When people who aren't native speakers can still get their point across to me in writing, well, they're doing better than I could in any language other than my native one, so I'm not going to complain.  But rouge just...just...gets under my SKIN.  Rouge definitely doesn't carry a dagger.<br />

If I'm feeling grumpy, when someone asks for something with &quot;plz&quot; I tell them to spit out the bixie and speak clearly.  That usually confuses them long enough for me to make my getaway.  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
In this typing world in which we live, we try to create shorthand for many common words.  LOL and ROFL are very widely accepted.  No one ever complains that people are using abbreviations for those.  There is no difference with Plz.  It's an abbreviation.  It's not worth sweating over.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lilosh will be along directly, I'm sure. (He highly objects.)<br />
<br />
I've had instances where I've asked people to rephrase or re-say something because I simply could NOT understand their terrible spelling, abbreviation, or combination thereof, and I've been treated like an idiot for having to say I don't have the innate ability to &quot;read anything as long as the first and last letters are correct.&quot;  I have visual impairments so that if you tell me &quot;send it to my email address il01steve@something.com&quot; I'll repeat back to you &quot;that is i as in ice, L as in Lima, zero, one, S T E V E?&quot; Otherwise I'm likely to read it as ii0lsteve or... who knows what. Thanks be to Innoruuk for letting us set our fonts to something with serifs, so I can SEE my ones and l's and capital I's.  Combine MY visual impairment with YOUR inability to spell and we have a problem. Combine YOUR inability to spell with someone who isn't a native English speaker, or who is Deaf, and once again we have a problem.<br />
<br />
Never has a misspelling got anyone killed. <br />
<br />
Beg to differ. Sure, &quot;most people&quot; can pick out words even if they're misspelled; but then, &quot;most people&quot; can spell, too. If it's not fair for me to expect you the minority bad speller to accede to the majority, then it's not fair for you to expect EVERYONE out there to be able to read your writing with &quot;just a little effort.&quot; There will be times when people can't read what you're saying, and it won't be because you're stupid, or they're lazy. <br />
<br />
If you want people to make allowances for your differences, then you have to understand that not everyone has the ability to make every allowance.  Don't treat me like I'm hateful because I say your writing is hard to read, and inquire as to whether it's an innate disability on your part or what the issue is, so that the two of us can determine who needs to do what, and we can talk.<br />
<br />
However sympathetic I may be to someone's plight, in the end it doesn't matter WHY they're a bad speller, if it hits a certain point I simply can't figure out what they're saying.  Mix that with the attitude that &quot;if you won't try to understand me you're mean, and rude, and evil&quot; and you know what?<br />
<br />
I'll just do what I should have done at the beginning of this post. Walk away.<br />

Do I complaint to someone's face about those in particular?  No.  But it can and does change my attitude toward people.<br />
<br />
If someone starts talking to you (I mean face to face) with &quot;Hello&quot;,&quot;Hey&quot;,&quot;Wazup?&quot;, or &quot;How are you doing?&quot;, each sets a different tone for the conversation, and your views on the other person.  I'm not saying any is better than any other, I'm just saying they're all different.  Some people are infurated by some forms of spoken communication, and some people cannot understand some forms of the spoken English language.  Its no different with typing.<br />
<br />
Your word choice, and how you present those words, is one of the windows that person has into your presented personality.  It seems natural (to me at least) that the forms of communication you chose to use would be something you will be judged by, by everyone you interact with.<br />
<br />
Very few people speak perfect English; very few people type perfect English.  We each choose, somewhat consciously somewhat unconsciously, how we personally are going to butcher the language, and that choice influences how others see us.<br />
<br />
I can usually understand what people are trying to say when typing, although there are times when I run into someone's language that I just cannot parse.  To me, &quot;plz&quot; is very, very different from &quot;please&quot;. {&quot;you&quot;,&quot;u&quot;}, {&quot;2&quot;,&quot;two&quot;,&quot;too&quot;,&quot;to&quot;}, and many others are each different to me.  I do react to them differently - the specifics depend on context and the situation - and I personally see nothing wrong with that.  You choose your form of expression, I choose my interpretation of that expression.</div></div><hr />

I do not honestly wish anyone to leave the game, and I applaud anyone who is attempting to learn a new language, because God knows I would have a terrible time playing EQ in Arabic, I just do not speak it that well. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds like those kids in elementary school who think it's cool to be out of the spelling bee..<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, Johnny, spell CAT&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, K-A-T, ALRIGHT! I'm OUT! he he he (I know there are two T's, shhh!). Heh heh heh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Come spend a day with me as a cel phone tech, you'll be cringing by the end of the second hour.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I axe you a question?&quot;<br />
&quot;My phone cuts in and out (ok, how does it cut in?)&quot;<br />
&quot;Cut my service back on&quot;<br />
&quot;I brung-ed in my phone...&quot;<br />
&quot;My phone is broke, it's been dropped calls&quot;<br />
<br />
Need I continue?  :(<br />
<br />
(And no, these aren't the Spanish speaking people either, they at least try).<br />
<br />
I know, I got 360 verbal on my SAT's, my reading / writing skills aren't the best (but they have gotten better since I found out I like to read), but come on!  This is just plain ignorance!<br />
<br />
&quot;Can (or better yet, may) I ASK you a question?&quot;<br />
&quot;My phone cuts out&quot;<br />
&quot;Turn my service back on&quot;<br />
&quot;I brought my phone in...&quot;<br />
&quot;My phone is broken, it's been dropping calls&quot; or &quot;It drops calls&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Aye, when people respond with nothing other than LOL, it burns me.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean, people LOL after really innane stuff, so it's no compliment.<br />
<br />
When you sit there and read &quot;I have to go to my grandmothers funeral LOL, be back later&quot;, you'll see what I mean.<br />
<br />
<br />
LOL has become way overused, and people use it as filler in conversation.  It's the equivelant of Umm or Uhh in public speak.  It's dead air, and empty language.<br />

Try IM'ing with my 17 year old sister in law.  I think she uses LOL more than all the other words combined. <br />
<br />
&quot;LOL Hey Yo! LOL! Whazzap LOL!&quot;<br />
<br />
:D<br />
<br />
Thank god I find myself in mostly mature groups where LOL isn't the main word.<br />

Also, being in character, this is giving me good fuel to bug Lickity in game.  :D   :p <br />

Isn't that what they do now anyway? We use Latin words to make new words most of the time, or we name them after someone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">So where are new words supposed to come from?<br />
<br />
Mommy-word and Daddy-word loved each other very much... *giggle*<br />
<br />
Actually one can make a verb out of another word.  It just often sounds silly, and should be avoided. <br />
<br />
More commonly one makes nouns, adjectives or adverbs from a verb.  (The technical term for this is a gerrund. While I'm sure there is a term for turning a noun into a verb, my sleep-deprived brain refuses to dredge it up.) <br />
<br />
And while playing, I'm the single worst typist I know.  I'm not a very good typist under the best of circumstances, and under time pressure my spelling becomes attrocious.</div></div><hr />

It's kind of scary when you think that these people have had 8 years of college!<br />

<br />
You'll find a lot of stupid uses for words have been dragged into existence by modern business people. <br />
<br />
&quot;We're looking to grow our business.&quot;<br />
I actually laughed out loud at the end-of-year company party when the CEO said that. *pictures CEO in overalls with a watering can*<br />

<br />
&quot;Let's action item that.&quot;<br />
try again: &quot;Let's make that a priority.&quot; or &quot;Let's act upon that.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I am sorry if this has offended folks, I do not mean to insult anyone's intelligence, but this was inspired by a sort of &quot;straw that broke the camel's back.&quot;  I play on a European server, and it is ridiculous that I have to see the native EUROPEANS correcting my often times ignorant guildmates because of their disregard for language.  The fact that a majority of adults can recognize words from the the first and last letters is a SYMPTOM of this, not justification for it.  We have become so fast paced and sloppy that we as readers compensate for the lack of accuracy in language by assuming meaning.  This becomes extremely evident when you are reading English as your second language, and thus how &quot;language got my group killed.&quot;  I was in a group near midnight my time with one of my guildies and four members of a European guild on our server.  They speak/type wonderful English (I know they speak it well because of a wonderful program called Teamspeak, its fun, not real practical though..), however, being non-native speakers they have a harder time &quot;assuming&quot; spelling.  Thus, when my groups puller (the eariler mentioned guildmate) uses strings of letters that even I have a hard time pieceing together, I can only imagine the hell that they are going through!  <br />
<br />
As far as weighing in on the abbreviations, I am guilty of these at times.  LOL, ROFL (one I resisted, but I have to use for emphasis now, because LOL has become so watered down,) etc, are nice quick words, but we have sure turned them into filler.  <br />
<br />
I have been trying to avoid using this recently becaus of an incident I saw.  I was in a class here on campus the other day and the LOL thing really burned me! Someone actually VERBALLY SAID LOL!!! As if we can't even &quot;LAUGH OUT LOUD&quot; when something is funny in &quot;Real Life.&quot; Anyone else ever had someone do this? I have also been victimized by the phrase &quot;WTF&quot; verbally! How awful is this going to get!</div></div><hr />

But that's not necessarily what growing a business is Cubwynn.  It's actually a fairly accurate use of the verb.  It also makes a good extended analogy when you talk about organic growth versus growth by acqisition.</div></div><hr />
