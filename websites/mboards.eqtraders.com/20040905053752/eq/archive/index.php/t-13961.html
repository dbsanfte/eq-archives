<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Laeelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a level 65 necro, so i'm well equiped for farming either cash or furs...<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm of two minds on what is the best path to get from 187 to 240 (252 after 5% bonus)<br />
<br />
<br />
Solstice to 220ish then Othmir Fur/Wyvern Skin...<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
Othmir/Wyvern all the way to 250..<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
Cultral Robes?..<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that I'm a great class for farming both cash and drops. =)<br />
<br />
<br />
I have done a lot of searching on the messageboards, and have not been able to find anything useful that compairs Cultral Robes (how hard is it to get words of abrogation  and wing of xegony for example .. only a total of 3 for sell in the bazaar currently)<br />
<br />
Also, I have not found much to compair furs to the other when your able to do the farming yourself..<br />
<br />
Any advice would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Anaxo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wings of Xegony are easy to get, since they are a sub-50s research component and often found on merchants. Words of Abrogation are a lot rarer, due to being used in high end spell research.<br />
<br />
I do not know how often othmir fur drops, haven't never hunted the walking furballs myself. I vaguely recall others posting that they were getting about 1/8-1/10 kills or so. No idea of how often wyvern hides drop, so can't compare those.</div></div><hr />

I'll do some merchant farming then =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tudamorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Solstice robes are the fastest option to 250 if you have a Tunare priest handy to imbue the emeralds, a 250 jewelcrafter (preferably a JCM3 enchanter too), and some seed money.  The only non-purchased item is Spider Silk, which you can easily buy in the Bazaar, so you can do this without farming.  Once you get going, you can do a stack per 15-20 minutes, probably faster now with the new UI, not to mention less wrist fatigue.  Your successes will also sell back to mitigate your losses.  I did the robes to 250 and I have never regretted it.<br />
<br />
Othmir fur, in my experience, is very rare in the Bazaar and when I do see it it's very expensive (more expensive than solstice robe components).  It's more of a cheaper farming route, but at level 65 you won't get much XP from it and you will be spending hours getting the furs for just one stack of combines.  You will also need vials of clear mana.  And, you end up with a useless product.<br />
<br />
Cultural robes are the worst in my opinion.  Not only do you have to contend with a rare forage/loot, but you have to spend ages farming vendors for the research components.  Definitely the slowest option of the three, and expensive if you're buying the components.  Do this only if you need a break from whatever other method you're using.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqdoctress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did Solstice and Othmir for skill ups.<br />
<br />
I always found I had at least 1 to 2 skill up on Othmir caps per stack while for solstice I was getting 1 skill up every 30 combines.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately Othmirs are rarely seen in Bazaar and usually farmed by tailors themselves, there are a lot of available silk swatches etc in bazaar, therefore making solstice readily available for skill ups.<br />
<br />
Just have to balance I guess, time spent on farming othmirs vs plats spent on Solstice :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
=)<br />
<br />
I maxed smithing (250) long ago, and while i was farming shadowed men I thought several time...<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank goodness i'm a Necro... makes killing these much easier (i strted at level 41)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Both otter and solstice robes are going to require additional classes to help you; otter caps need mana vials (chanter), robes need imbued emeralds (tunare druid or cleric) and high jewelry combine (which I would suggest you go to a chanter with JCM3 because they'll fail less).<br />
<br />
But other than that, do whichever doesn't drive you nuts. Going the otter route, you're definitely going to have to farm and it will be slower. However, it will be a HECK of a lot cheaper. Going fast and depending on your cash vs. supply of silks in the bazaar vs. ability to get a Tunare priest, solstice robes may be a better route.<br />
<br />
Personally, I did both, but probably more solstice robes because 1) I had the money, 2) I am a tunare priest, 3) spider silk supply was good (see also 1), and 4) I had a chanter friend who had JCM3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My reccommendation:<br />
Superb Hoppers to 188<br />
Robes to 210<br />
Ethereal to 212<br />
Flawless Hopper, Velious+everything else to 250</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Seedling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Flawless hopper is 242 trivial, but by far the best way to skill up, I think, provided you're a wizard with nerves of steel (and a Force Shield to match ;).)  DSP is the best way to get flawless and superb, Mons Letalis can be good for drops too, with the rare occurrence of a double hide drop, but the adds will drive you bonkers... (had to root 8 greencon shiknar before I decided to  Abscond...) RNG can be a bitch in Mons though... 8 hides in 1 hour, or 1 in 2 hours... and ofcourse adds.. adds.. adds.. adds.. adds.. and adds..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>casala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What about the rockhopper v. panther / haze panther?  Which is easier to farm?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>baody</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A lot of my improves from 218 to 238 were acrylia reinforced combines. Lately I've been doing cobalt drake belts and arctic wyvern bracers whever I can. Because I'm not super rich, I don't make things that I can't sell for at least the cost of components, and hopefully a small profit. I've been told, at least once, that this isn't the right attitude to take toward &quot;trade skills,&quot; but I'm probably going to stay at it until I get to 250.<br />
<br />
My advise: watch for good prices in the bazaar, sell lots of different stuff to get a feel for the market, don't sell at below cost, be patient, be patient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rhyianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i am doing otters for the most part.  skill ups seem to be decent.  rockhoppers are very overcamped on my server, may try the robes again, now that recipes are in the book (least i think they are lol).  all the subcombines drive me batty tho :).<br />
<br />
at 65, i can keep 2 otter camps clear.  i do box an enchanter but she really only casts tranq sometimes, and occaisonally slows a boss otter.   if my sweets comes, we can keep everything down, in a mad rush of slaughter.  he has a cleric that is on otter faction so we make good cash off the other drops too lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tarabella</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I did a combination of cultural LoY robes ( was actually very easy to vendor mine and find the runes I needed) and wyvern hide. After 210 I strictly did wyvern and actually made a small profit considering if you fish/ quad/ and farm velium you only lose money on buying the patterns. Only problem is the time it takes to accumulate supplies.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>KletianTellah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I recommend you do everything you get your hands on.<br />
1) Farm Othmir Furs / Wyvern Skins while lfg (look for LDoN groups)<br />
2) Ask to ML / save Abrogation for you (Abrogation/Virtue/Tempest seem to be common enough, especially in guk ldons)<br />
3) Do all your subcombines / combines during group / raid downtime<br />
4) After you have 250 tailoring send me your account information :D<br />
<br />
Main thing is to work efficiently.  As long as you have friends / alts to make gem studded chains and imbue emeralds, you can keep pushing through solstice robes while you try to get other components.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>MissV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've been using EQTraders for years but I only recently started reading the boards. In my short time I have seen several references to the &quot;first, level up a necro to 65&quot; or some such but no where have I see the reason for such a statement.<br />
<br />
What's so special about necros that makes trade skills easier for them? At the risk of being called a board newb I ask this because it totally baffles me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rachelou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Likely as not, the pet and fear make farming Real easy.  My necro is only level 14, so I  would not know. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">So far I have done 187-199 doing only cultural robes. Since you are a research class, this should be simple.<br />
<br />
I find a pretty good supply of the research components in the bazaar. The only thing is that some of the ingredients are cheap, since the materials have no other use, and some are very pricy. I still cannot believe that Yaeth's 73 right is a component for a cultural robe.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, my cultural is human, but I've had very little problem getting up enough materials for 2-4 stacks of combines at a time.<br />
<br />
Last night, did 40 robes (Scent, lodestone, capacity) and got 4 skillups 196-199. Seem to skill up more on cultural than solstice, although that may just be luck.<br />
<br />
Another nice bonus I just discovered is: Robe of capacity is still worth some decent tribute points. They nerfed the heck out of robe of scent, but capacity is nice for tribute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Immzen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I stopped doing the robes at around 215 because I was making them more then I was failing on them. At 215 I switched to doing Black Panther / Haze Panther Armor.  I farmed up 160 Black Panther and  5 Haze Panther Skins. Out of all those I made 40 pieces of armor and about 10 skillups</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I just hit 240 yesterday and think you should do some of everything.  I tend to bazaar farm instead of farm my own pelts, and buy up anything not incredibly overpriced.  Would not recommend solstice robes over 220 as you will be wearing out your gem chains quickly.  Everyone and their aunt is now tailoring and about 20 people are currently selling solstice robes in my bazaar.  On top of that, the new UI isn't working for non-rogue mortar combines, so you will be making your CEs the old fashioned way.  I would personally recommend solstice robes to 210, ethereal to 212 and then acrylia reinforced to 242 as primary (they are easiest and a lot cheaper then velium combines now) and then velious combines when you have them to 250, interspersed with the acrylia.  Velium is a lot harder to come by these days due to the EVB smithing skill up route, so recommend acrylia over velious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kanstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hellos,<br />
<br />
I'm dwarf at skill 187 and found this thread informative as options for the way forward.<br />
<br />
Just now, I've figured the options on the plate are:<br />
    Acrylia Reinforced Mask<br />
    Othmir Fur Cap<br />
    Ceremonial Solstice Robe<br />
<br />
I notice GoD has given other options, but don't know how viable they are:<br />
    Cragbeast Backpack ( triv 196 )<br />
    Bolstered Hynid-hide Backpack ( triv 202 )<br />
    Steel-Laced Etched Bull Whip ( triv 202 )<br />
<br />
My fears for these, some parts are forage only, others are drops from lvl 60+ mobs in GoD zones.  Guessing this means as they are tradeable, they will appear on a baz mule but cost a fair pile of plat.</div></div><hr />
