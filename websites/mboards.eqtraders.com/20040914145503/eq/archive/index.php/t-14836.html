<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Working on getting my pottery up and got to 122 yesterday. So i switch to large bowls. Came here and got the recipe and head to my favorite trade skill place, the boat. So i stop and talk to my 2 favorite dark elves and started to do my pottery. They are quite fond of my bowls. went to the pottey wheel. So i goto in expirment mode. Add water, large clay, glass, and my sketch... And all i get is a message saying these items will not combine in this container.  i have looked and double check the recipe and it does not see like i am doing something wrong. Anyone have any ideas?<br />

Sorry.  It's the Halfling in me.  I'll try the large bowl tonight, in New Tanaan and Rivervale, and let you know.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think there's two different large bowl sketches, one of which is used for mixing bowls, iirc.  It's been ages since I made either though.  Double check that and make sure you're using the correct sketch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Still not working. i have tried it at bunch of different spots. Double checked everything still nothing up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Did you check if there was indeed 2 different large bowl sketches on the merchant and make sure that neither of them was working?</div></div><hr />

Thats the problem its a flask of water not a flask of &lt;yellow liquid&gt; sample...<br />
<br />
seriously... check the clay too I had a nice habit of trying to use ore or the wrong size clay....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">OK this i what i am using. 1 flask of water, 1 large bowl sketch, 1 large block of clay, and glass shards. I use the pottery wheel and it sends me a message that these items cannot combine in this container.<br />
<br />
I will double check again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rhyianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">am reasonably certain there are 2 large bowl sketchs, one for mixing bowl, one for large bowl.  somewhere it tells you which order they are in.  (i forget have to look up my notes at home).<br />
<br />
i suspect you have the wrong sketch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>syndellbristle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The Large Bowls are not bugged... what happened was they probably snuck in a recipe change.<br />
<br />
I made numerous of these bowls for skill ups the recipe was as follows<br />
<br />
1 Water Flask<br />
1 Large Bowl Sketch<br />
1 Glass Shard<br />
2 Large Blocks of Clay<br />
<br />
hope it helps =D</div></div><hr />
