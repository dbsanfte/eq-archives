<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arghargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How long has this been the case with fletching?  Its odd that fletching doesn't always return a tool when smithing, baking, and brewing always return tools (hammers, pie pan, cake pans, non-stick frying pan, muffin tin, corking device, etc.).  This should be bugged.<br />

i've never heard of a tool being eaten when things were &quot;working as intended.&quot;  my non-stick frying pan would have been eaten several hundred tiems by now of patty melts alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You get the tool back on the Uber bows, like Stonewoods.  Sort of an afterhtought, given the cost of the other stuff, but my &quot;lucky planing tool&quot; has now made 3 Stonewoods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It makes perfect sense.  Afterall, when I rip a piece of wood down to size on my tablesaw, the saw gets consumed in the process.  Why do you think custom made furnature is so expensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rhoninn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Really you can't make a rl comparison, any hand shaping tools I've ever used such as block planes, scrapers ect.. are not consumed when you use them and if you're having to buy a new table saw every time you rip a board then I suggest you switch to a sturdier brand.</div></div><hr />

That has been my experience with fletcing also, since at least mid last year when I took up fletching for the purpose of the shawl quests.  I found it definately odd =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Teedyo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Been that way for me since Aug '02.  Guess if you use the plane properly; it's edge gets so dull in the process that it is no longer useable.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Its been that way since 1999.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Been fletching since I started playing in Dec 2000.  Even then, bow combines ate the knife/planing tool.  <br />
<br />
I was so used to this, I was suprised when I got the planing tool back when making a Nightmarewood Compound Bow for a guildie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mayera Silverwinds</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yup planing tools have been eaten by old world bow combines since I started fletching some time in 99. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Oh... Joy... you get the planning tool back now... Which means I have to go add it in as a returned item on a bunch of recipes... Joy...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Don't go making changes just yet, it was posted in the In Testing forum which is usually reserved for changes on the test server.  I don't know if it's live yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure I'd go quite that far, however... It is definately silly.  It seems to me, you'd have to be trying pretty hard to break a planing tool in the process of crafting a bow...  :boggled: <br />
<br />
So, I fixed it. :) It's not live yet, but should be going live during the next scheduled update.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Maddoc, did you include the whittling knife in with the fix to the planing tool?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Maddoc-the-Wayfarer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You guys break knives that often too?<br />
<br />
I actually hadn't even given it a thought. I'll look at that one (and others, if there are any more) tomorrow. That's probably just as easy a change to make.<br />

This is nice!  It's not game changing or anything, but it sure will be nice not to have to buy a bunch of non stacking planing tools or knives for skill up sessions.<br />
<br />
/happy dance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Awesome, thankee on the fix. =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Aerinha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">oh, wow. You mean I can keep one planing tool and one whittling knife in my tools backpack(s) and not have to figure in the cost of a new tool each time I make a bow?<br />
THANK YOU and wow. <br />
Ok, I am past needing to skill up on any fletching by several months(250, yay), but it is SO nice to have someone actually do something about this,even if I am no longer one of the primary beneficiaries.</div></div><hr />

Lol, nice... only took them 5 years... maybe people for so long have just accepted that as the way it is that nobody bothered to complain to someone who could fix it until now.<br />
<br />
But hey, great.</div></div><hr />
