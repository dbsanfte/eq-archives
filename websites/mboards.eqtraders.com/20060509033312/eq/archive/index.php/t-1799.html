<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pojodan</div><div class="date">01-02-2003, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a Vah Shir Beastlord and have worked my way through the Sonic Wolf Bane weapons quest including getting my tailoring to 158 to make the bits.  I've only, for certain, found someone to provide rogue bits, though  know someone who might be able to do the warrior and bard bits if they have the time.<br />
<br />
Thus, if anyone is a Vah Shir Bard, Warrior, or Shaman that has done the Sonic Wolf Bane weapons quest either up to the tradable bit part or past this I'm interested in getting together with you to trade bits.  <br />
<br />
I'm more than happy to help gather the components since it takes dozens of kills of each kind in Hallowshade Moor to get one component.<br />
<br />
Send me a tell on the server or reply here.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pojodan</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">She has and I've talked with her about it, though she's very often busy and hope to find others whom have done the quest as well.<br />
<br />
I've managed to gather a rogue and shaman bit so far, just need Warrior and Bard now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pojodan</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Twinked a warrior and got his smithing high enough to make the claw set, whoo!<br />
<br />
Now I just need a bard peice, so if there's any Vah Shir bards whom have done this quest I'll gladly trade a warrior or beastlord bit for it, or we can work out some other trade if yeh like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harvyst</div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I admit I get busy... I often promise more than I can deliver which is why I've been trying to practice 'no' recently. ;) <br />
<br />
However, I had to destroy my shaman bits to make room in my bank about two months ago. I didn't have room for all the non-stackable bits.<br />
<br />
Sorry.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to 8 more bank slots... maybe then I can finally start collecting pieces for tailoring, as right now the pottery and the banking bit (leftovers from halas 10 lb pies) plus the 8th cudgel quest has totally swamped my bank space.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm working on the 6th shawl, have a set of tradeskilling gear, have several quest peices from various quests, and have some tailoring/baking/smithing stuff all cramed into 80 slots and currently have 3 backpacks full of other gear and assorted other junk so I fully understand your reasoning behind destroying anything that was vital.<br />
<br />
I still managed to finish the quest and can make beastlord and warrior bits for anyone who needs them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just wanted to say Gratz on getting most of your quest parts together. I am also working on this quest for the elusive Sonic wolfbane weapons. <br />
<br />
If you happen to know a Rogue whom has the Ceramic Clas Sleeve set still for trade, or can make them. Please Let me know :) Same for the Shaman Reactive Sealant Soak. I am missing those two items.<br />
<br />
Good Luck with the quest =)</div></div><hr />
