<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nasumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First... please don't flame me. lol :D I'll go ahead and admit I don't know anything about anything...  I decided to post this in the brewing section because most tempers are brewed. If it deserves to go elsewhere, I'm sorry. =/<br />
<br />
I've recently been reading through all sorts of books in EQ and came upon a set in PoK library called  Fortifying Innoruuk's Realm Vol 1 - 9.  It tells the pointless story of a ritual sacrifice of trolls. Anyway, getting to the point, inside Volumes 5 &amp; 7, I read this:<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Vol 5 -<br />
<br />
For the ritual, the Grand Ritualist hired several forces to retrieve supplies to make the Sacrificial Ritual Temper. This temper would be used to prepare the<br />
trolls at the time of the sacrifice. Led by the dark Tharknight, they quickly agreed to assist the Grand Ritualist with the gathering of these ingredients.<br />
<br />
They set forth to retrieve black sapphires, a leg of an ancient froglok from the depths of Guk, the brain of<br />
a Tae Ritualist from the Accursed Temple of Cazic-Thule, dried dragon blood and high elf blood.<br />
<br />
Vol. 7 -<br />
<br />
Once The Thaumaturge received the box of ingredients, she placed the leg and brain in a pot. She then grabbed the head of the high elf and let the<br />
blood drip over the pot.<br />
<br />
Next, she poured the contents of the red vial, the yellow vial, and the green vial of acid in the pot as it began to hiss, spit, and smoke. Those in attendance slowly backed away from the pot. <br />
<br />
The pot immolated with burning flames. The Thaumaturge reached her hand into the burning pot while holding an empty bottle. She then pulled out the Sacrificial Ritual Temper and sealed it.<br />
<br />
------------------------<br />
<br />
I am wondering - Is this a real recipe or just Sony being too detailed? If it is a recipe, what is the final product used for? <br />
<br />
I did a search on the main site and in the forums but couldn't find any information. :) Thanks for replies in advance, this has me curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>astianax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">this one's got me rather curious as well. it does have the sound of mere flavor text, but i'm not used to soe getting that descriptive without a reason (brodder, yes. sony no)<br />
<br />
short breakdown of the purported ingredients. anyone seen or heard about any (other than the sapphires...my poor sk goes through tons of those for her armor)<br />
black sapphires are already around and well known<br />
ancient froglok leg- i know that frogs in upper guk randomly can drop froglok legs, but this sounds like it'd be from lower, or even potentially deepest<br />
brain of tae ew ritualist- pretty self explainatory. have yet to hit ct, but guildmates have been eyeing it for a while. i'll see about throwing 'em his way<br />
dried dragon blood- once again, self explainatory, but there's several different places this could be, if it exists. vox/naggy are prob'ly out, and, i'd think from the other 'drops' that veeshan's peak or tov'd be too much<br />
high elf blood- elf blood already exists in the game, and it drops from all types of elves (dark, high, wood...don't remember if half)...so, we'd have a minor quandry like the frog leg one...either the pre-existing general drop, or a new one that's yet to be discovered/reported (if they even exist at all *shrug*)<br />
<br />
<br />
and maybe the end result is a way to get those trolls out of our fair city *grin*<br />

edit: d'oh, qutie rather abstractly reminded me that i forgot to mention dragon necropolis for the dragon blood. and that zone'd seem to make the most sense</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>QuteCleric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are almost as many different places that have frogloks as have dragons.... also it's dried dragon blood so might not drop directly off a dragon..... if any of it exists :-p<br />
<br />
Qutie!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Suedyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As I recall, Tomeseeker Salkien (who holds the 9 volumes of &quot;Fortifying Innoruuk's Realm&quot; started work in the Great Library of Myrist after the discovery of Broken Skull Rock by modern mariners, and at about the same time as the dramatic changes to the Plane of Hate.<br />
Examining all 9 volumes, I understood that they referred to historical events, referring as they do to the continuation of the Lanys T'vyl saga. However no-one I have asked has been able to tell me whether such a GM-quest/ event actually occurred or not. <br />
<br />
Knowing whether these events are Salkien's own fabrication or have some basis in historical fact would, I think, give some insight into the nature of the recipe in question.<br />
<br />
So... has anyone heard of a GM event involving the Tier'Dal, Trolls, and the Tower of Frozen Shadow?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once the cold meds wear off, i'll think on the other bits =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taelnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bag of dried blood drops in ruj http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=25308</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dory</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There is in fact a froglok leg that drops in deepest guk that is tradeskill flagged. I vaguely recall it being &quot;a froglok femur&quot; or something like that. A vial of elf blood drops from takish hiz but is not tradeskill flagged.(Though that doesn't mean much lately) It would probably be satisfactory as &quot;dried high elf blood&quot;.<br />
<br />
*edit* The text mentions a high elf head. Sand elf heads also drop in takish-hiz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dory</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I could have sworn that the drop from deepest guk dungeons was an ancient froglok femur but I can't find any such thing. There is a &quot;froglok leg&quot; and that might be what I'm remembering.<br />
The text itself is horribly written and not clear at all.<br />
It mentions the ingredients but not how they all combine.<br />
<br />
Brain + Froglok Bone in a Pot is clear.<br />
<br />
Add High Elf Blood dripped from a head.<br />
<br />
Then add three vials of acid which were taken from priests in West Karana.<br />
<br />
Black sapphires were then used in the ceremony itself.<br />
<br />
No mention of where the dragon blood was added.<br />
<br />
Going way out on a limb and assuming this is an actual recipe for a combine I would suggest that the three vials all refer to blood:<br />
Elf Blood or Vial of Elf Blood being the red vial<br />
Tae Ew Blood being the green vial<br />
Dragon Blood being the yellow vial. Anyone know of any yellow vial items anywhere?<br />
<br />
None of the ritualists in CT are listed as dropping a brain according to Illia's. There's three or four different ones. That's why I guessed just the blood vial instead of the brain.<br />
<br />
If someone has some possible ideas of yellow vials that might relate to dragons I'll look into trying a few combines but I don't hold out much hope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Barnum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yellow blood??? <br />
<br />
Could this finally be a use for Diaku Blood? It is tradeskill marked.<br />
<br />
The blood was last updated on &quot;live&quot; on 11-20 and on &quot;test&quot; on 12-6.  This is according to Lucy: http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemhistory.html?id=26979</div></div><hr />

Test  12-06 16:28   Changed tradeskills from '0' to '1'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Originally posted by Dory <br />
Elf Blood or Vial of Elf Blood being the red vial<br />
Tae Ew Blood being the green vial<br />
Dragon Blood being the yellow vial. Anyone know of any yellow vial items anywhere? <br />
<br />
The colors don't match, though.  Tae Ew Blood Vials are yellow, not green.  On the other hand, Froglok Blood is green ...  not sure if that matters here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>QuteCleric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It specifically states the vials are of acid, not blood, where did the concept of red, green, and yellow blood come from?<br />
<br />
Qutie!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dory</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Vial colors are a matter of screen tinting it seems. I see tae ew vials clearly as green.<br />
<br />
Switching the acid to blood was only my best guess since blood is mentioned as used in the recipe and I am not aware of any acids using a vial model, and certainly not three different colors.<br />
<br />
As I stated all of this is way out on a limb to even be a recipe. The text is horribly written and unclear even beside that. I just brainstormed possibilities.</div></div><hr />
