<br />
I started Stromm when it first came out, and decided that i wanted to do tradeskills, since one I could acually sell some of it, and 2 I am playing a shaman, so Wisdom is just natural:)<br />
<br />
My number one priority is to get tailoring to 250, which is hard, being that I seem to be able to get one skillup for every 50 combines now:)  Tailoring (189)<br />
<br />
I have done the other tradeskills mainly so that  I dont have to buy anything from people that I can make myself.  My highest skill is Jewelry Crafting (199), cand I cant take that any higher till I get some AA points:)<br />
<br />
My characters name is Grroak, who is a 55 froggy Shaman, in the guild &quot;Ungrateful Lemmings&quot;  Hopefull i can meet a few of you guys later on, and maybe get some tips:)<br />
<br />
Good luck and may Stromm live on:)<br />
