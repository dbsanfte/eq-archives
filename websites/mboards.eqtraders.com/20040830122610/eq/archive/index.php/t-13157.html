Hello there!<br />
<br />
I'd just like a little advice...<br />
<br />
I'm currently at 199 skill (had a lucky streak last night but had to stop due to lack of funding!).  I have two objectives right now: the Eternal Tempest Compound Bow and the Trophy.<br />
<br />
Knowing the following things, which of these would you recommend me shooting for first:<br />
<br />
-Level 51 Ranger<br />
-I use the Bow of the Huntsman (20/30 with a 70 or 80ish damage proc)<br />
-Not guilded, so not raiding much if at all<br />
-Not willing to buy equipment in the Bazaar, though I'm fine with buying components to craft my own stuff<br />
-Willing to reach 250 in Fletching eventually<br />
<br />
The way I see it is that a new bow never hurts, especially one with nice stats.  But at the same time, the trophy would probably help alleviate the expense of skilling up to 250 thanks to more successes ( = more to sell back) and will also help with eventually crafting the bow...<br />
<br />
Which would you recommend I shoot for first?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Can't really offer advice on which to do first, don't know much about the trophy personally (too lazy to do it!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>theRiov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">your bow will do you very little good until level 55 minimum. The stats are nice but not fantastic.  get your fletching up before you do either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would wait on both until 240 + geerlok or 250 unmodified.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oualawouzou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh, I should have mentionned that I didn't intend to try either of those before I skill up some more...  But since both are expensive combines, I was interested to know which one you'd think would be best to try first when the time will come. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">trophy first.  then do the bow.  a geerlock can be equippped now to help you with the cost though.  good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">buy a geerlok and use the money to get fletching higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cragzop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd vote for the bow before the trophy.<br />
<br />
I'd get a geerlock as soon as you can, that 5% pays off huge, especially if you end up skilling up on bows at any point.<br />
<br />
Assuming you don't need the stats the trophy is really just for your own personal sense of accomplishment (and the bag) ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As a fellow ranger, allow me to offer my opinion.<br />
<br />
The trophy is a nice item.  10 to STR, INT, WIS, and 50 to CHA, as well as being able to summon 100 WR bags.  The 5 percent mod to fletching is moot, because you can buy a geerlok planing tool to ge thte same effect.  Useless to you in combat unless used in range slot, useful out of combat for buying, selling, and fletching.<br />
<br />
The bow is also a nice item.  MUCH better than your current bow.  Better stats, beter range, better damage and delay ratio.  Useful in combat due to the stats (better stats than the trophy IMO) and as a pulling tool.  With enough arrows, makes a fearsome bow for kiting with, even without the archery AA's.<br />
<br />
All in all, I'd have to say, buy a geerlok and go for the bow first.  The effects of the trophy (other than personal satisfaction) can be duplicated elsewhere, while the bow itself is a generally useful upgrade.  The geerlok's skill mod and the trophy's skill mod do not stack, so having the one makes having the other irrelevant.  Besides, I've said on the Ranger's Glade that the cultural bows are the best bows to use (though I've found one or two since that were better) from around 20 to EQ and some level of AM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>FentFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd agree...get a geerlok and get a few skill points first.  Then try for the Bow.  A Ranger with a good Bow is a lot more fearsome than a Ranger with a Trophy ;)<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm 0 for 2 on the Eternal Tempest Compound Bow :(, but I had (what I think to be lots of) luck with my first attempt at a Nightmarewood bow.  The Nightmarewood bow is a bit nicer, but I'm still determined to make the Eternal Tempest bow since Karana demands it.</div></div><hr />
