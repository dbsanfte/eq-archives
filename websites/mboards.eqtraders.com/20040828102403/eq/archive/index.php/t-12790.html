<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I need some advice; What should I skillup on 231-250 (im at 225 but Im making white bands until 231 with no problems) ... <br />
<br />
I tried farming Heavy Clay but its way to big of a time sink, its simply not worth it. Im a Barb Shaman (Tribunal)... Im looking for least depandance on other people's enchanting (other than enchanted clay) components for me. Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
(I did star ruby, those are a bit expansive (~80pp per combine))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think there is anything else beyond 231 except idols.  And they all need clay enchanted and gems imbued.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Check the idols that the imbued gem is done by a shaman. Shamans can imbue gems far easier due to cannibalization. Then all you need is to hire lowbie chanters to imbue the clay and higher level ones to do the mana vials.<br />
<br />
Personally i did Cazic Thule idols by imbuing Amber with my shaman and borrowing a guildies chanter-bot for the vials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can imbue ivory, actualy I always buy them when I see them on merchants so I have quite a large supply of them. Roughly how much was each combine on CT idols?<br />
<br />
Edit: Also, Vials of Distilled Mana that are needed for it seem very expansive; Star ruby combines are much cheaper... or am I looking at it wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Quikpick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Make vials of clear mana, uses a peridot instead of the distilled mana vials. Same recipe just use a different vial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Does it work on Imbued Ivory stuff or only Cazic Thule?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Vial of Clear Mana uses Emerald; you mentioned perdidot (which is used for Vials of Cloudy Mana. Can you confirm which one is it?<br />
<br />
Thanks :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Another option, I did red ceramic bands to 242, they worked fine and sellback on the unfireds isn't awful (~31 pp).<br />
<br />
Once you're that high, Star Ruby Steins succeed enough that you can possibly break even by selling them at the bazaar -- I make about 8 or so per 20 attempts, which costs around 1600 pp, and have no trouble selling the steins for 285 pp each on my trader, which is a small profit actually.  It's just not fast.<br />
<br />
But at that point, if you have a Geerlok, who cares?  You'll get to 250 eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Quikpick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sorry was in a rush, it is indeed emeralds.<br />
<br />
Unfired Idol = idol sketch, sculpting tools, imbued amber, large block of magic clay, vial of clear mana.<br />
<br />
You can replace the imbued amber with something else, it depends on the imbuer that you have access too. Star Rose Quartz are the cheapest but I couldn't find an Erollisi Marr imbuer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for the info all. I already contracted a chanter for vials and I will imbune Ivory (since its most convenient for me) ... wish me luck hehe :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I did the star ruby encrusted steins to 242 mostly, they eventually sell off in the bazaar at around 100 to 200pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks for the info all... Silent &quot;ding&quot; last night ... 250 Pottery :D<br />
<br />
I did CT idols all the way up to 248 and finished it off with Star Ruby steins :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I am doing CT Idols<br />
<br />
Have a iksar shammie in guild who does my Amber,<br />
Have a chanter bot for mana vials and magic clay.<br />
<br />
200 combines - 222 to 230 (nice 8 skillups, 1 per 25 combines)<br />
200 combines - 230 to 237 (nice 7 skillups, 1 per 28.5)<br />
200 Combines - 237 to 240 (aargh 3 skillups, 1 per 66.7)<br />
<br />
Guess i gotta get more stuff imbued.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">80 combines -- 222-225 on Star Ruby Steins (didnt know any better than)<br />
200 combines -- 225-231 on White bands<br />
440 combines -- 231-248 on CT Idols <br />
40 combines -- 248-250 on Star Ruby Steins<br />
<br />
Good luck :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>OberonMiM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">if you can find a cleric who can mass imbue most gems (like me)<br />
<br />
I found that star roze quartz then amber idols were the fastest.<br />
<br />
Clerics can enchant FAR faster than shaman if they have a manastone :P</div></div><hr />
