<br />
Only went from 190 - 204.<br />
<br />
Is this right?<br />
<br />
Don't think I'll make it to 250 at this rate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">take a look at the other bazillion threads talking about how slow skill ups are from 180-220 or so, and you will see that yes, this is normal. VERY VERY FRUSTRATING! But still very normal. <br />
<br />
you might try some other recipes. I made grobb meat drinks, qeynos tea, kaladim constitutionals, and demi-sec champagnes to get to 250. no, not even ONE MHB. took longer i suppose, but i didn't kill my hands and i paid for smithing skillups till smithing started supporting itself. i never did MHB because i can't stand to &quot;waste&quot; my work and part of the way i limit myself from killing my hands is by selling in the bazaar. when there's no room on the bazaar trader, i don't do any skilling. when some room opens up, i make some more stuff to fill her up.<br />
<br />
i further limit my clicking by keeping my prices on the high end. otherwise things like qeynos tea are not worth doing for skill, tea leaves are just too hard to come by. e.g. i sell my tea for 20pp each / 400pp a stack, even when others are at 10-15p. just not worth it to make them for less.<br />
<br />
good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I found that the skill levels 180-220 were also the &quot;HELL&quot; level of brewing with MHB's.  Once I got to 221 the skill-ups came at a MUCH faster pace.  I could not believe it.   Even a &quot;dumb&quot; warrior with only a 150 Wisdom was able to crunch through 220 to 250 in about 5 hours.    <br />
<br />
Take some Tylenol or other pain medicine for your wrist.   It will hurt after all the 1000s of combines!  9 item combines are the killer.   Mentally its challenging also to get through the long runs of 40-80 combines with no skill-ups.  But trust that the skill-ups will come!<br />
