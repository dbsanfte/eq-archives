<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>marykai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just and FYI.  Your DNS was broken.  I don't think you webhosting server had a problem... When I tried to access your site the error was unable to resolve host www.eqtraders.com.<br />
<br />
So, I went and check your name servers and they definately where not working for your domain.  The name servers themselves were working, but they didn't know anything about eqtraders.com.<br />
<br />
Looks like somebody accidently removed you from DNS to me.</div></div><hr />
