<br />
Well ... I had nothing better to do today ...<br />
<br />
Online Success Rate &amp; Skillup Chance calculator (http://www.catcreations.com/ariaya/tradeskill/skillup.php) <br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
Tradeskills are listed for those that we know or suspect the difficulty (from Sylphan's Thread (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=15638) ). <br />
I've added in &quot;unconfirmed&quot; options so you can do comparisions for other skills. <br />
You can compare recipies by entering up to 5 different trivials.<br />
You can compare with/without your geerlock when your skill changes when you equip your geerlock.<br />
<br />
Let me know what bugs you find!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just one question<br />
 Value of your int/wis stat with Geerlock (if different):<br />
<br />
What is this about?  The Geerlocks &amp; other tradeskill modifier devices do not modify your STAT (int/wis/str etc) they modify your TRADESKILL LEVEL.<br />
<br />
Therefore if my skill in baking is 100 and I equip a 5% geerlock, then my modified skill level is 105.<br />
<br />
My int (which is 280 : max without AA) is still 280, with or without the geerlock.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>papyscott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just did a quick example, and I can tell you don't have the skill-up chance per stack calculation correct :-)<br />
<br />
The calculator said my skillup chance per combine was 6.459% and my skillup chance per stack was 129.118%. :boggled: <br />
<br />
I think you are taking the skillup chance per combine and simply multiplying by 20 to get the skillup chance per stack.  That is ONLY approximately correct for small probabilities.<br />
<br />
The real chance of getting at least one skillup during a stack of combines equals<br />
<br />
1 - probability of getting zero skillups during the stack of combines.<br />
<br />
Since there is only one way to get zero skillups, you can multiply the probability of no skill-up and get the following:<br />
<br />
1 - (probability of no skill-up on a given combine)^(number of combines).<br />
<br />
In this case,<br />
<br />
The probability is:<br />
<br />
1 - 0.93541^20 = 68.7%<br />
<br />
Didn't check anything else, but I would update that :-)<br />

Tailoring<br />

<br />
It spit out <br />
Without Geerlock:<br />
Success Rate: 50%<br />
Skillup Chance per combine: 3.631%<br />
Skillup Chance per stack: 72.621% With Geerlock:<br />
Success Rate: 63%<br />
Skillup Chance per combine: 3.933%<br />
Skillup Chance per stack: 78.663%<br />
<br />
Now a skill WITHOUT a geerlok at 250 would only increase by 2 skill WITH a geerlok. Thus there really shouldnt be such a HUGE bump in success rate. I would assume your code doesn't &quot;cap&quot; skill at 252. <br />
<br />
Nice work though :)</div></div><hr />

How I would read the % is:<br />
If I did 20 combines I would expect an overall average of 1.29 success given enough combines. However this isnt exactly how the data is stated ;)</div></div><hr />

I guess you could read it like that.  However, since this calculation is only valid for your current skill level it seems odd to me to think of this as applying over large numbers of stacks and large numbers of skillups.<br />

Then it needs to be rephrased…it’s misleading.  Especially since the results are presented “With geerlock” and “Without Geerlock”<br />
<br />
Suggestions”<br />
<br />
Q1 – instead of “Value of your int/wis stat (Max of INT or WIS):” use  “What if my (MAX) INT/WIS is XXXX?”<br />
<br />
Q2 – instead of “Value of your int/wis stat with Geerlock (if different):” use “Instead, what if my INT/WIS  is YYYY?”<br />
<br />
<br />
Then the results could have the headings:  “With int/wis value of  XXX”  vs   WITH INT/WIS VALUE of YYY”, and people would know that the two different results are comparing chance of skillups based on different values for the stats, not on whether or not a geerlock is equipped.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ariaya, please take this as constructive criticism.  It’s a great tool, much preferable to doing the calculations  myself (cause my head was about to explode too! :) ) but it just needs a little clarity, so people that who are not familiar with geerlocks’ properties will not come away with wrong assumptions.</div></div><hr />

But the result presented really are with and without geerlok. This calculator is calculating whether you should use a geerlok or whether you should use your stat item instead. I'm not sure how Ariaya could make it more clear. <br />

Added in the following:<br />
- Skill level now has a hard upper limit of 252<br />
- Reformatted the form to make it clearer (I hope)<br />
- Reformatted the results form to show # combines per skillup<br />
- Success rates are capped at 5% on the lower end and 95% on the upper end<br />
- Changed the forumla so you cannot exceed 100% chance at the first roll<br />
- Added in error checking for trivial &lt;= skill, and skill &gt;= 250<br />

I think you still have a bug somewhere in your cool app b/c it is still giving &gt;5% chances of skill ups (on success) for &gt;190 situations.  My udnerstanding of the formula is that you can't get better than a 5% chance after 190.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>cuedyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ariaya,<br />
<br />
Either I am doing something wrong, or your calculator has a minor bug.<br />
<br />
I threw in some random numbers - just to see what the results would be.  I used:<br />
<br />
Tradeskill Level 150<br />
Prim stat 210<br />
Secondary Stat 180<br />
Recipe trivial values from 160-220<br />
No change with geerlock<br />
<br />
Now, why does it always come back and say &quot;ditch the geerlock&quot;?  It also shows the combines per skillup as more with the geerlock.  I guess I may have been misinterpreting the original formula, but, if the stats with/without geerlock are the same - why would it cause the number of combines to increase?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">if the second check uses modified skill, which we have all been assuming is true, then it can be harder as you approach 190 to skill up witha geerlok in place.  Compare 180 (189 with geerlok).  At 180, you have a 10% chance of passing the second test.  at 189, you have a 5.5% chance of passing it.  So the geerlok almost halves you chance, and rarely will a geerlok double your chance of success, so the net effect (assume it is modified skill in the second check) is to hurt your chances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Iumarex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">These calculators are going on the assumption that skill used in formula two has been modified by the geerlok.<br />
<br />
I was not at the discussion, but the posts I have read were kindof unclear on this point.  <br />
<br />
We already know that the modified skill is NOT used when calculating a trivial.  If the geerlok is ONLY applied to the checks for success/failure then the results could be significantly different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Rissenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I checked out MTP's (triv 355) vs my skill. (250)<br />
<br />
<br />
It said that I had a 37% chance with Geerlok. The chance should be 54-57%<br />
<br />
I have made about 7-8000 MTP's at GM+spoon level. Average is 54% success. At times a bit more, but never less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Ariaya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hmmm ....<br />
<br />
Well the math works out from the formula in the FAQ (the formula that I used)<br />
<br />
Success Percentage = (skill - (trivial*.75)) + 51.5 <br />
<br />
Glad to hear that the success rate is higher than 37% :) However .. hmm ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>scarbrowed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Actually, when I used the success formula, I get (252-(335*.75)) + 51.5 = (252-251.25) + 51.5 = 0.75 + 51.5 = 52.25.<br />
<br />
So 52% is right. You might check the order you are doing your operations using the parenthesis. I'm not sure how you got 37%</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kraggie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Without Geerlock: <br />
Success Rate: 72%<br />
Skillup Chance per combine: 6.847%<br />
Est. Combines per skillup: 15<br />
<br />
My math's gotta be wrong, or maybe I'm just missing some rounding.  Here's what I've got:<br />
<br />
Skill:  Tinkering (chose Medium-3)<br />
Skill level:  182<br />
Trivial of recipe:  215<br />
Int:  280.<br />
<br />
Success Rate:  182-(215*.75)+51.5 = 72.25%<br />
N = ((280-15)*10)/(1*3)  (Success case) = 883 1/3  So that's 88.3% chance of passing the first check.<br />
Using ran(200) &gt;= 182, I've got 19/200 chances to pass second check for 9.5% change of skill-up.<br />
<br />
That's 72.25%*88.3%*9.5% =6.06297% chance of getting a skill-up on success.  Rounding 72%*88%*9.5%= 6.0192%<br />
<br />
Skillups on Failure:?  27.75% change of failure, 2650/6=44.16% chance of passing first test, still 9.5% chance of skillup = 1.1643% of skillup on a failure.  1.1704% if I round the first two numbers.<br />
<br />
Needless to say with a 6~% chance of skillup on success and a 1+% chance on failure, I don't see how my &quot;Skillup Chance per combine&quot; can be under 6.<br />
<br />
Where am I messing up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Jarak_akn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">It can be under 6% because 1% (SU on fail) is less than 6% if I am reading your write up right. If I am then 72% of the time you have a 6% chance and 28% of the time you have a 1% chance. <br />
<br />
So your total chance = ((72 * 6) + (28 * 1))/100 = 4.6% (aprox)<br />
<br />
Rechecking ...<br />
<br />
Skill = 182, Int = 280, Triv = 215, diff = 3<br />
<br />
Sucess = 72.25%<br />
Skill up on Sucess = 88.33%<br />
Skill up on fail = 44.17 %<br />
Test 2 = 9%<br />
<br />
Skill up on Sucess (with test2) = 7.95%<br />
Skill up on Fail (with test2) = 3.975%<br />
<br />
Total SU Chance = (72.25 * 7.95) + (27.75 * 3.975) = 6.847%<br />
<br />
So you have about a 7% chance of skill up total, nearly 8% on sucess and nearly 4% on fails. (Sucesses are almost twice as good as promised by the dev team)<br />
<br />
Your chance of skill up on this item will slowly decreace till you hit 205 when you will have a 95 % chance of making it and a 4.31% chance of skill up<br />
<br />
Also note that making an almost trivial item will increase your chance of skill up now, but not much. An item trivial at 183 will give you a 7.75% chance of skill up saving you (on average) 2 combine attempts. I.e. hardly worth it especially if the 215 trivial item is easier and cheaper.<br />

I sent a message to the devs to confirm something that's been nagging at me and I just got a reply back.<br />
<br />
The skillup formula checks your raw skill; it doesn't take into account any geerloks or other skill modifying items.  This is actually a benefit to the player.<br />
<br />
Thanks to Absor and Tanker for confirming this.<br />
<br />
The formula that is being used here seems to be:<br />

<br />
but should be<br />
<br />
min(190, skill)&lt;ran(200)<br />

Compare 180 (189 with geerlok).  At 180, you have a 10% chance of passing the second test.  at 189, you have a 5.5% chance of passing it.  So the geerlok almost halves you chance, and rarely will a geerlok double your chance of success, so the net effect (assume it is modified skill in the second check) is to hurt your chances.<br />
<br />
Oh, if this is the case I will be soooo disappointed. :irked: <br />
I spent a boatload of time farming leather paddings this past weekend for getting my skill to 188.  I fell short for the moment at 184. I did all my skilling with a geerlock in place (which doesn't reduce my primary stat).  If I could have gotten there by not using it, I am going to kick myself for a week.<br />
No wait, I remember reading something on another forum that said the in-game formula for skill-ups doesn't look at your modified skill level from a geerlock or the like.<br />
<br />
I figure based on some other discussions that I need about 80 more combines to get to 188 with a 270 INT....../sigh....160 more silks and 80 more skins.  :faint: <br />
<br />
I believe this is incorrect in the calculator. EDIT: WAS incorrect....thanks Ariaya  :D</div></div><hr />

NP .. sorry I couldn't respond sooner :)  I hope I've gotten the calculations right now .. I'm *so* not an algebra person  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Kraggie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Thanks Jarak.  It helped seeing someone else do my math.  I did everything you did but I was using 9.5% as chance for skillup.  That fubar'ed the numbers a little. The confusing part was I was getting 6+% for chance of skillup on success and 1+% for chance of skillup on failure when I did the numbers myself, yet the online calc said my chance was ~6%.  6+1=6?  But when you use 9% instead of 9.5% the numbers come out right.  Thanks for going behind me and redoing them.<br />
<br />
Formula I'm seeing for 2nd check is rand(200) &gt;= min(190, skill).  In my case that's rand(200) &gt;= 182.  Which means if random returns 182-200 I get a skillup.  According to my fingers and toes that's 19/200 chances = 9.5%.  So did you use 9% because you rounded 9.5%.  I'm sure that .5% makes a huge deal to all of the rest of you.  Sorry I'm such a math nerd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Ariaya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">My math's gotta be wrong, or maybe I'm just missing some rounding.  Here's what I've got:<br />

Needless to say with a 6~% chance of skillup on success and a 1+% chance on failure, I don't see how my &quot;Skillup Chance per combine&quot; can be under 6.<br />
<br />
Where am I messing up?<br />

With the now fixed formulas .. your skillup chance is over 6%<br />

BTW .. my calculator doesn't round anything until it displays it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Kraggie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">So based on the information that Check 2 does not use Geerlock modified skill, there's no reason to NOT use a Geerlock now, right?  Which means you may want to edit the HTML and get rid of the messages about whether or not to keep it.  Seeing as the Check 2 skill is your base unmodified skill, having a geerlock equipped doesn't hurt anything (unless it lowers your base stats).  All it does is increase your original chance of success.  It should not lower your chance of skill-up.<br />

My mind's so frazzled trying to soak up all this info.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only time where it's really in question is when equipping the geerlok makes you un-equip some peice of equipment that has int or wis on it (whatever your primary stat is) and thereby, theoretically, you may not want to equip the geerlock.<br />
<br />
However ... the chances of that are pretty slim considering how much benifit the geerlock is when the skillup equation doesn't take it into account ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Isembold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Greetings, I have been trying to work out the math in this equation in order create a spreadsheet that would allow me to do these calculations multiple times at once. This way I’ll be able to solve for (approximately) how many combines it will take to go from a starting skill to reach a set trivial. I seem to be getting lost in the middle somewhere. I am using both online calculators, which are great for 1 computation at a time, for reference. <br />
<br />
Here is what I am doing: <br />
<br />
I enter my current skill in the first column A, the (adjusted) stat being used (Wisdom for example) in the second column B, and the trivial I am trying to reach in the 3rd column C. <br />
<br />
The forth column is the computation for the pass/fail percentage and the results I get match the online calculators. I am using  =MIN((A3-(C3*0.75)+51.5),95). Note that this is obviously on row 3 of my spreadsheet (Hence A3 and C3). This becomes D3. <br />
<br />
I place the skill difficulty in column E. <br />
<br />
Columns F and G are the computation for the 1st skill up check if I succeed or fail the combine. I am using =(B3*10/(E3*1)) for F (succeed) and =(B3*10)/(E3*2) for G (fail). <br />
<br />
Column H is the computation for the overall chance of passing the 1st skill check. I use =((F3*(D3/100))+(G3*((100-D3)/100))). Noting here that D3 is a number between 1 and 100 and need to be divided by 100 to make a percentage. <br />
<br />
At this point I have a number that is likely to be in the hundreds and I can’t figure out how to get to the final percentage. I know there is a second step but I haven’t been able get any tests I am running to come back with close to what the online calculators both tell me I should be at. <br />
<br />
Here is the data I am testing with: <br />
I am doing tailoring so the difficulty level E3 is 3<br />
My current skill A3 is 162.<br />
My current stat B3 is (235-15) = 220. <br />
My target trivial is 167. <br />
So my Success rate should be 88.25 % <br />
Chance to pass 1st check on success is 733 (out of 1000 for 73%??)<br />
Chance to pass 1st check on fail is 366 (out of 1000 for 36%??)<br />
Chance to pass 1st check overall is 620 (62%??)<br />
<br />
The online calculators tell me I should eventually have a 13% chance to skill up at this point. I cant figure out how to write the rest of equations for the spreadsheet to get to this point. <br />
<br />
I know the second check should be =((Min(A3,190))/200) but I am not sure how to apply this. <br />
<br />
Can someone help me out? Where do I go from here?<br />
<br />
EDIT: fixed formulae for second check, should have been the min not the max.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Isembold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Ugh, 2 days of banging my head and 5 minutes to figure it out after I post. My formula for the second check was incorrect. It should have been =((200-(Min(A3,190)))/200) which gives a higher chance to skill up with a lower skill. I had it backwards. <br />
<br />
Ok, so from above column I now becomes =((200-(Max(A3,190)))/200) <br />
Column J is =(H3/1000)*I3 which is the overall percentage to get a skill up. <br />
And  K is =1/J3 which is the number of combines I need to get 1 skill up. <br />
<br />
Copy all rows down setting A4 = A3+1 till column A =  column C and add sums to bottom of Column K.</div></div><hr />
