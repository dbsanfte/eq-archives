<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gnormy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Did some testing today using my Collapsed Tackle Box, Animated Bait (+3%), and Brells Fishing Rod (+3%).<br />
<br />
I have skill 200.<br />
Equiped Rod - tackle box showed skill 206 = Good :)<br />
Removed rod.<br />
<br />
put bait in top inventory slot - tackle box show skill 200 = bad :(<br />
Put bait in ammo slot - tackle box showed skill 200 = bad :(<br />
<br />
tried a variety of combos - makeing sure i had a regular fishing pole equiped and still no enhancement to skill.<br />
<br />
Sooo - assuming the Tradeskill UI is functioning correctly for skill mods (and it appears to be) - BAIT WITH MODS makes no difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Or.... it could just be that you only get the fishing mod benefit from the animated bait if you use it for fishing with. That makes sense to me.<br />
<br />
The tackle box shows the skill fro when you use the tackle box for things like prepping fish and tying flys - why would animated bait have any effect on those tasks? That would not make sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tingteng</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mods don't stack, we know this....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Liandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">put bait in top inventory slot - tackle box show skill 200 = bad <br />
Put bait in ammo slot - tackle box showed skill 200 = bad  <br />
<br />
<br />
His point was that the +3% mod on the bait had no effect on the fishing skill.  i.e. it wass still 200 with the bait equiped</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tingteng</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">nm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think it was an oversight personaslly, We all know the ammo slot does not provide any stat type benefits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Leewei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ammo slot does provide light and focus effects, though.  Depending on how the mod% is programmed in, it might be reasonable to expect the bonus to apply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm amazed it ever said 206. My understanding has always been that the higher of multiple modifiers was the one used.<br />
<br />
Granted, that doesn't address your question, but it was confusing that they apparently stacked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Nairn, why are you amazed?  200 skill + 3% from rod = 206.  No discrepancies there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Nairn, why are you amazed? 200 skill + 3% from rod = 206. No discrepancies there... <br />
<br />
My bad, I was thinking percentage (3%+3%=6%) instead of actualy numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gnormy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This was something that I've alway been curious about and the new UI provided a method to prove for sure whether the mod on Bait was being calculated.<br />
<br />
I really didnt expect it to work from from the Ammo slot, but I thought it might work similar to how food/drink work....by taking the mod% from the first bait item found in inventory.<br />
<br />
All testing proved negative - bait provides no mods at all.  Which kinda burns me :steamed: for all the 100's of silver I've wasted on Catch-a-Lot Bait.  I know, I know - its only silver, but its more the principle - that if the bait mods dont work - why even have them on the bait?  Rest assured - I've bugged this issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So you mean to tell me those Flies that offer +4% Mod actually do nothing???? Whether it is on ammo slot or inventory, it does not add to your Mod?<br />
We must all do something here to let Sony here us Fisherman that we cant be fooled. This is ridiculous. I assure you if it was Smithing or something, Sony would have it fixed in the next patch.<br />
***The only thing I dont understand is that how you got a 206 skill..........I know 3% + 3% from Rod and bait added up........but from my understanding you Cannot stack Mods for any Tradeskill.<br />
I did not get to try this yet......has anyone else tried to see if Blessed Rod + Fly Mods stack?<br />
Also....how can you get the 3% mod from the bait to stack.....if the Mod from the bait isnt showing up when you use a regular rod.<br />
Sony is playing games here!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Tejaye, there are no games here.  He said that when he equiped the 3% mod pole, his skill went from 200 to 206.  This is correct.  200 * 1.03 = 206.  If the 2 mods HAD stacked he would have had a 212 skill.  He didn't.  He had 206.<br />
<br />
This is explained if you read the post a little slower and don't skip around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My mistake...i read it too quickly......I just got aggravated thinking that the flies I made with 4% Mod were not gonna work. I was curious why Sony would allow this to go on for so long. I will try it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My mistake...i read it too quickly......I just got aggravated thinking that the flies I made with 4% Mod were not gonna work.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>gnormy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">you will note that i was not trying to stack the mods (as that would be pointless).  As indicated on my first post - I removed the Brells Fishing Pole and I tested bait with a REGULAR fishing rod equiped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Gnormy...have you received any response from Sony about the Mods on fishing bait having no effect?<br />
I think it is ridiculous that they treat Fishing with such disregard!!<br />
Why give us a Mod on bait....allow us to do combines that create Flies with Mods.....if it doesn't even work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">And the really screwball thing is that this major boo-boo would never have been uncovered without the new UI.  Ooops!  Yeah, I'm a little bummed about the small fortune I've blown on Catch-a-Lot back when I was a youngling...  Oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">How can we get Sony to correct this problem? Has anyone tried and/or gotten a response?<br />
Did anyone do a /petition ?<br />
If you do a /bug I hear that you never get a response, at least with /petition you may get one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If you /petition a bug, you will get a response.  But that response will be...<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Guide Soandso, can I get some more detail on this bug?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Then they will add the extra detail to your petition and hit a button that dumps the petition to the EXACT SAME PLACE it goes if you do a /bug yerself.<br />
<br />
I was a guide for a while, it's what they do. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Does anyone think that Sony will do something to fix the Bait Mods?  am sure its because the ammo slot was never meant for stat increases.....but think they will so something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>gnormy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If and when Sony fixes the bait problem.  It will be about the bait and not what slot it happens to be in.  More then likely, they would use code similiar to how Food/Drink stats are modified....using the first item in inventory.  Interestingly there was at one time a food item with stats that fit in the ammo slot and when the item was there, it would loose its stats.  I find it far more likely for SOE to &quot;fix&quot; this by taking mod from the first bait found in inventory then ever messing with the ammo slot at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">As of now Sony still is ignoring this issue. It is a big deal to me since before the UI we didnt know  we were getting Fooled.<br />
Why dont they just fix it...i dont understand?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>MerlmanTM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Are we sure this is a problem. Has anyone tried keeping your tacklebox open while they cast with this bait? Maybe it only works when it is on your line. Course I always use my summoned fishing pole. Guess Ill have to buy a regular one and test this myself. :bookworm:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Merl i will check the UI while my line is in the water....unless somebody else reads this first and tries it......let us know. <br />
Otherwise checkin UI while caych-a-lot bait is in water is worth a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Suani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I tested the effect of pole and bait on my fishing results in Natimbi. I bought 5 stacks for each combination. <br />
<br />
The table shows the result of each cast in terms of crab or tuna pounds. I gave casts that caught nothing or that caught junk a weight in pounds of zero.<br />
<br />
The fishing skill modifiers on Brell's Fishing pole and on the Catch-a-Lot bait are so small (3% and 2% respectively) that statistical analysis showed me no significant results.<br />
<br />
There is a hint that Brell would be shown to matter with a larger data set. <br />
<br />
I have no such hope for the Catch-a-Lot. It doesn't help. SOE needs to fix this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Suani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Bah :steamed:. I gather all this info then fishing in Gates of Discord gets nerfed a few hours later.<br />
<br />
I might redo the analysis to check if bait with mod has been fixed. That's if the value of crab and tuna has not been nerfed too hard.<br />
<br />
At least I was one of the last to get good prices for my fish. It's too bad that SOE thinks that hitting mobs is the only thing worth rewarding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The Catch-a-lot bait does not help because Sony refuses to let the stated Modifiers on all baits and lures work. Only the Mods on fishing Poles (ie-Blessed and brells) will work.</div></div><hr />
