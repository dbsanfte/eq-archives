<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>adamrussell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just got my trophy with a skill of 234.  Feel free to critique my reasoning.  I figured that the closer I got to skill cap the less it will cost on final combine, but the more it will cost for skillups.  At some point there could be a break even point.  From reading these boards I got the impression that at full skill (240+geerlok) there is a 50% chance of success.  I think that is my biggest assumption but it is reasonable.  If the success formula is valid then you lose 1% chance of success for every skillpoint lower than that.  My cost for components on trophy combine is 3704p.  Expected cost for total trophy combines is 3704/chance_of_success.  Doing this as a table I could see that on every skillup I would save money but the higher I got the less I would save on each skillup.  On the other hand the cost for skillups in the platinum range is a flat 106*36.7/20=195pp per skillup, since a combine costs 106, it takes average 36.7 combines per skillup (measured this), and failure rate is 5%.  I found that above skill 234 I would spend more money on skillups than I could expect to save.  It took 2 tries for trophy.  L62 bard with 255 wis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>vovinit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yah that would make sense if you were only going for the tropy but if you were going to actually make any of the items with a triv at 250 you still have to get your skill up to do them as the trophy only adds 5% and doesn't stack with the geerlok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>adamrussell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yea thats true.  Forgot to mention that I just did it for the trophy.  I guess if you include the savings on other products you will make it makes more sense to just go to 240.</div></div><hr />
