I'm sooo tired of whatever the heck it is that passes for chat abbreviations in the 13-18 year old group. I've had to flat out tell some people I don't understand what they're saying and I get laughed at.. Well.. Hello.. I speak English, Spanish, some French and even some Japanese, for goodness sake say something I can understand, especially when you're asking me a question. I got a 4-line message in my chat box yesterday from someone, and after about the 3rd word it went into some sort of code I swear. I'm not 13... I'm 33... I don't live in chatrooms learning all the lastest abbreviations and code. I have a RL with a hubby and 3 kids, then I have EQ. <br />
<br />
I do tend to use (...) alot... mainly because I've not finished a thought, just need a space and pause.<br />

<br />
Elyssanda - I must agree.  We're in roughly the same age group, well I've got a couple years on you since I'm 35, but I know EXACTLY what you mean.<br />
<br />
I grouped with some good players last weekend with my beastlord but had to several times send group chat saying &quot;huh?&quot; because they had mystified me.  I was an English major many moons ago and speak some Spanish, German, French, Hebrew, and Tagalog.  I am not language impaired...but I can sure feel like I am sometimes.<br />
<br />
I understand Lilosh point about irony as well, but the whole point of this particular scream is that  there are some standard abbreviations everyone  knows, and there is some measure of &quot;today's hippest internet speak&quot; which not all of us have the time or interest to be up on.  Plus there is at least the occasional generational shorthand that even my younger late-20-something and earlier-30-something EQ friends don't understand either.<br />
<br />
Don't know if it helps to know that you're not alone, Elyssanda, but it helped me to know that I wasn't.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Anyway, if you wanna show your intellectual superiority then use a l33t translator (http://www.jayssite.com/stuff/l33t/l33t_translator.html), most of the l33t speakers won't understand you but it will be their fault not yours ;)<br />
<br />
By the way I was trying to teach some manners for everyone who asked a rez from my cleric with any form of &quot;plzzz, pls, plx&quot; in their request by saying that &quot;I will rez you if you take the effort of spelling out PLEASE and THANK YOU correctly&quot;<br />
<br />
Then I give it up after 80% of the cases I got the standard reply back of &quot;thx rez&quot;</div></div><hr />

Supposedly the l33tsp34k is from those &quot;elite hackers&quot; who developed a shorthand to make typing easier AND to make it harder for people to understand them (a code)<br />
<br />
ROFL.<br />
<br />
Hackers are VERY precise and usually EXCELLENT typists. (speed-wise anyway) Thank god for spell check. There's not a need for a code that other people don't understand. It's the CODE that people don't understand already.<br />

I needed a &quot;secret code&quot; to make that unreadable to 99 percent of humanity? Innoruk's forehead!! My instructors tell me I need to make comments so _I_ can read it 6 months from now. :rolleyes: <br />

Text messaging on teeny-tiny phones will only make the problem worse. Much easier to excuse h1 and by3 when the &quot;keyboard&quot; is so much less functional. (I had expected phone manufacturers to put ALT and CTRL and SHIFT keys onto phones by now to make the 12 keypad a 15 keypad with 96 available keys.)<br />
<br />
8 states from 3 state keys times 12 keys = 96 effective keys<br />
<br />
48 upper case (+shift)<br />
48 lower case (no shift)<br />
<br />
12 number keys (no alt or ctrl)<br />
36 &quot;letter&quot; keys (alt, ctrl, or alt + ctrl)<br />

We would type emails to each other (though the same BBS over our 300-1200 baud modem) in L33t5P34K, SysOps could never understand us, so it was useful for a while.<br />
<br />
Then, we devoloped out own code that required a translator.<br />
<br />
It took the hex-ASCII codes for what we typed, made that regular text, then coded it again in binary, used that as a decinal, and coded it in HEX (again).  That made for a confusing year.  :D</div></div><hr />

It's called &quot;circle 13 encryption&quot; if you just want to get around &quot;word sniffers&quot;<br />
<br />
It's called &quot;PGP RSA Public Key Encryption with 1024 bit keys&quot; if you want to make a truly secrue communication.<br />
<br />
Oh, and to defeat &quot;traffic analysis&quot; you simply create email distribution lists. <br />
<br />
List one - everyone in the revolution.<br />
List two - everyone in my cell.<br />
<br />
Encrypt the message for the recipient.<br />
Encrypt the message for the cell.<br />
Encrypt the message for the revolution.<br />
<br />
Everyone in the revolution gets a valid message. But the &quot;clear text&quot; is junk to all not in the cell.<br />
<br />
Everyone in the cell, however, sees a second encrypted text. They decode. All but the recipient sees a junk message.<br />
<br />
The recipient sees a THIRD level of encryption and decodes it for her message.<br />
<br />
(NOTE: Use a COMMON private key for the revolution and cell levels respectively. This prevents &quot;the man&quot; from discovering who sent what.)<br />
<br />
To avoid having my insanely hard cipher broken because I sent the &quot;clear text&quot; message of &quot;dinner at 7&quot; the encryption software takes a LENGTHY quote from the encyclopedia and embeds the text of my message inside it. Then when my recipient gets the message they check the text they get against their encyclopedia copy and the &quot;differences&quot; pop right out.<br />

<br />
Itek: How deep should we allow the tree to go?<br />
<br />
Teach: Oh, limit it to something reasonable.... 50.<br />
<br />
:boggled: :boggled: :boggled: :boggled: :confused: :eek: <br />
<br />
See I had thought 7 or 8 would be more reasonable.<br />
<br />
Tree depth max 7 = 127 array elements need reserved space.<br />
<br />
Tree depth max 8 = 255 array elements....<br />
<br />
Tree depth max 50 (approx) 10 ^ 15th array elements.<br />
<br />
That's a thousand, million, million bytes minimum.<br />
<br />
1 Mb RAM = 1 million (roughly)<br />
<br />
1 Gb RAM = 1 thousand million<br />
<br />
So, in order to program the assignment I need 1 million computers with 1 Gb RAM each. Sure Teach, no problem.<br />
<br />
(I wonder what the actual RAM capacity of the world, total, is ... but I'm pretty sure 10 ^ 15th is a SIGNIFICANT percentage of that total.)</div></div><hr />

Tree depth max 50 (approx) 10 ^ 15th array elements. Okay, this is probably just going to wind up making me feel like an idiot, but:<br />
Since its not required to be a complete tree, wouldn't storing it by another underlying methodology (such as nodes with pointers) get around the issue of needing such a large space?  Sure, it would be less computationally efficient than the array and take up even more space if full, but assuming its a relatively sparce tree, the space savings would be huge.<br />
<br />
Since you had originally proposed that 7-8 would probably be reasonable, it seems possible (although without knowing the actual details, impossible for me to know) that the cases where you would need the other 41 deeper levels would be few.  If that's true (big if), then it would be rather sparce.<br />

20 years ago I was writing system code in Ada (we also wrote a core wars interpreter in it) - which allows parallel threading of operations. Ever wondered why you've stepped to the end of your code in the debugger and the main body has finished - but somewhere out there is a chunk of isolated code - still running in it's own thread :confused:  <br />
Or written a recursive routine to do a bubble sort that creates one thread for each swap operation - so if you had enough cpus, each swap would run on it's own processor - all at the same time !<br />
<br />
On the other hand - I came across a java &quot;expert&quot; a while ago who - on finding that the maximum value for a variable was supposed to be 32767 - couldn't understand why someone had picked such a weird random number :boggled:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Itek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Recursive expression tree evaluation...<br />
<br />
Meaning:<br />
<br />
Leaf nodes contain ONLY numbers.<br />
<br />
Non-leaf nodes contain ONLY the + (add) or * (multiply) values. and perform their function on their child nodes.<br />
<br />
Since you can EITHER use an array of objects or code your own nodes for a doubly linked list which allow connections to other types of nodes.... The array of objects is much simplier.<br />
<br />
But, to use an array you have to use array(index) to reference a node and (index*2 + 1 = left child) (index*2+2 = right child)<br />
<br />
So if the user inputs + + + + + 1 2 3 4 5 6 you get an evaluation of 21. But you had to go down to the 6th row, which means the highest index referenced is 32 and you need allocation for an array of 63 elements.<br />
<br />
I shudder to think of the time needed to enter 50 elements using only integers plus and multiply as a valid expression...<br />
<br />
It's really a pointless exercise... but what do you want from a 200 level java course.<br />
<br />
Malathos ... hehe...<br />
<br />
I generally avoid recursion... for just such reasons...<br />
<br />
And a wise man once said &quot;I'd rather gnaw my arm off and beat myself to death with it than learn Java.&quot;<br />
<br />
(It was me.)<br />
<br />
Honest example.<br />
<br />
Programming assignment. Print out an integer input as a binary. If user inputs 0 output 0 by itself, but otherwise do not output leading 0's. Use recursion. You MAY NOT use local or instance variables, and must have a return type of void.<br />
<br />
binPrint(int n)<br />
if (n is 0 or n is 1) print n, print newline, return<br />
call --&gt; binPrint(n/2)<br />
print (n mod 2)<br />
<br />
Gosh that was hard. But a REAL hacker will see why someone should be shot for writing it that way.<br />
<br />
:rolleyes: <br />
<br />
:mad: <br />
<br />
;) <br />
<br />
:eek: <br />
<br />
:confused: <br />
<br />
Ok... The reason is the program that calls that function (method for the Java-inclined.. whom must all die... it preforms a FUNCTION leave bloody naming conventions alone) must make sure that it passes an integer 0 or greater to the function....<br />
<br />
if (userInput &gt;= 0) call --&gt; binPrint(userInput)<br />
<br />
so if you just took the expedient of checking for 0 as well<br />
<br />
if (userInput &lt; 0) complain the user is doing it wrong<br />
else if (userInput is 0) print the 0 and be done<br />
else call --&gt; binPrint (userInput)<br />
<br />
Now we don't have to check for 0 every time we call the function recursively .... heck we only had to check for 0 once in the calling program and NEVER in the recursive program.<br />
<br />
Saves time, memory, code, sanity, coffee, hair, aggrievated assault charges....<br />
<br />
&quot;But that's not the assignment&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah, why would you want to learn how to code PROPERLY and the way the Peer Review will want ?? Due Dilligence? What's that?

<br />
That takes me back...<br />
<br />
Anyone ever try to play in one of those &quot;Dragonlance AD+D&quot; modules...<br />
<br />
Itek: Ok, I smack the big black lizard with my axe.<br />
Warrior: And I hit my lizard for 7 with my sword.<br />
Wizard: I'm out of spells so I poke my opponent for ... 4.. wow!<br />
<br />
DM: Ok, everyone make a (if I remember right) Dex check.<br />
<br />
Itek: Oh oh... my dwarf missed his dex of 9 with a 10.<br />
Warrior: clumsy dwarf ... *roll* yikes... rolled a 17 and missed my dex...<br />
Wizard: ... dex?? ... (horrified look) ... whew.... rolled a 3 and made it...<br />
<br />
DM: ok, the wizard recovers his weapon before his lizards corpse turns to rock .... everyone else your weapon is stuck in a stone statue of your former opponent.... and the next wave of guards will attack next round... Strength checks to free weapons or spend the round getting a new weapon?<br />
<br />
*utter panic follows*<br />
<br />
** 4 rounds pass **<br />
<br />
Itek: Ok, I still have one hit point...<br />
Warrior: I'm at 0 and fall to the ground... (bandage me wizard or we're all dead..)<br />
Wizard: um, ok I'm not hurt too bad i've got 7 HP left...<br />
<br />
DM: Ok, the 3 original lizard corpses all explode. You are all three in the blast radius of each....<br />
<br />
*roll roll roll roll roll*<br />
<br />
DM: Ok, you three each take 3 points from each blast. Ok, the dwarf is at minus 8, the warrior is at minus 9 and will die on his turn next round unless he's bandaged or healed, the wizard is at minus 2 and ... the cleric died 3 rounds ago.... hmm... oh and the  2 extra guards arrive to reinforce the 3 still standing... and the rest of the corpses will explode shortly....<br />
<br />
Jim (the -former- DM): Where are you all going??</div></div><hr />

And on the original topic (sorry, trying valiantly to re-rail), I reserve d00dsp33k only for those whom I have the utmost contempt for.  From best as I can tell, d00dsp33k was made in the way back when to keep wannabees out of certain circles. If a wannabee could decypher d00dsp33k then he is given another series of increasingly hard cyphers. One who can crack them all is admitted into the circle as a newbie. Wannabees who can crack d00dsp33k but not anything else were proud of themselves and used it as an eletist method of showing everyone how smart they were. the REAL movers and shakers all but fell out of their chairs laughing when someone actually thought that was cool. And have been continuing to laugh at them ever since.  <br />

How would I know?  You hear stories sometimes on the late night BBS, ya know? Pure hearsay and I'm sticking to it. Haven't touched programming since I gave up my old Trash 80.  Well... okay, my 386, but still, that's a long time.</div></div><hr />

I hope this isn't considered an advertisement, but this book is available as a free download on Baen Books' website (www.baen.com).  I grabbed it to read at work one night and had a blast, and ended up looking for more of his work to purchase... well, I suppose that's the point of their free library.<br />

Kind of like that first 20 points you can drop into a tradeskill, and make yourself some tattered or patchwork armor, or edible goo.. I made 5pp teaching someone to make edible goo once, did I mention that? And how's that for getting back on the EQ topic?<br />

EQ has some &quot;twitchy&quot; content to it, so sometimes typing shorter in order to get your point across is somewhat useful.<br />

How many of you use Hail to warn of impending danger...<br />
<br />
Hail, A Cragbeast Queen<br />
Hail, A Cragbeast Queen<br />
Hail, A Cragbeast Queen<br />

seems to work better than... Guys we need to move in an eastern direction in order to avoid the incoming Cragbea... CRUNCH!<br />

sometimes acronyms are appropriate... but too many times people tend to use them so much that nobody knows what the heck they're saying...</div></div><hr />
