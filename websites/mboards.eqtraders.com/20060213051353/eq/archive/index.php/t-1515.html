Please /tell me in game as JMorgana if anyone has any of either one to spare.  I'm sure we can work out a fair price, with having all of my skills over 150, I kinda understand the concept of being broke!<br />

Thanks in advance!<br />

I will be making my post-holiday return to EQ tonight and will be doing some foraging in GFay for Morning Dew.  While I'm waiting for the forage button to pop, I'll dust all the pixies I can find.  How are you set for Cinnamon Sticks?  I'm probably going to come up with more Sticks than Dew, and will be saving them for you or another baker, if you don't need them.<br />
<br />
If I find any Mushrooms in my travels, I'll save those for you, too.  This merchant mining is almost as much of a hobby/habit as trade skilling now.  I find all sorts of goodies.<br />
<br />
Oh, I've been kicking around the idea of outfitting another mule with 10-slot packs.  If you're still making, I'll look you up once I make up my mind. :)</div></div><hr />

I still have lots of materials for truffles, except the mushrooms.  I will also watch for morning dew for ya and if I see anywhere I will grab it.<br />

<br />
In fact, I think I have some plant shoots and cheese left over from when I was pushing Minervah to 250.  Cheesy Vegetable Casserole has a triv over 250, you'd only need some noodles (eggs) =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xiggi</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would highly recommend you to follow the casseroles route and use plantshoots and/or anaconda and griff meat.<br />
<br />
When I did my baking push, I wasted way too much time on mushrooms. I found the skill-up points dismal at best and most defonetely worth the time to forage or even purchase.<br />
<br />
For the casseroles, it is pretty easy to gather the components either in Jaggedpine or .... in the bazaar.  I always found the remaining ingredients in the small people area of ShadowHaven. I did my combines there.<br />
<br />
Getting GM Baking was a real breeze once I forgot about pixie, cinnamon, chocolates and all those other time sinks.</div></div><hr />
