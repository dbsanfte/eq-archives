<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kahizinn soulcaster</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am 181 in tailoring and have about 75 acrylia studs in the bank as well as about 15 superb rockhopper hides. I know ALL that acrylia studded items trival at 188 but i have seemed to notice that i get a few more skill ups making Tunics maybe 1 in every 8-12 attempts vs. 1 skill up every 25-35 attempts making masks.<br />
Is this normal or was it just a fluke (i only tested it once) and would i be better serverd as far as skill ups are concerned, taking my 75 studs and getting more rockhopper hides and making masks, or should i make Tunics??<br />
btw my int is at 240, 255 with kei</div></div><hr />

About the only things we're certain of are that the higher your skill is, the more difficult it is to raise your skill, and that certain stats (Int, Wis, and possibly a tertiary stat - none for tailoring) help you to raise your skill level faster.<br />
As far as we know, making different items with the same triv level won't affect your ability to raise skill, but that's merely an educated guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cylestria</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have noticed that sometimes making 'harder' or should I just say items that require more components, within the same trivial level, sometimes raises the skill faster.  But, they may just be a fluke.<br />
<br />
Anyway, say you're making tunics, and you get skill up every 8-12 that's every 32-48 studs for 1 skill up.  Say you're making masks where you get a skill up every 25-35 combines, which is 25-35 studs.<br />
<br />
Tunics = less hides and more studs<br />
Masks = less studs and more hides<br />
<br />
Skill ups - about the same, but numbers wise, more chances of a skill up (including the coveted 2 in a row) with the masks.<br />
<br />
So, I'd look at it like this, is it easier for you to get hides or studs? Therein lies your choice, but for me, I often select to use the least number of components possible for as many combines as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MasterKrym</div><div class="date">12-14-2002, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Current consensus is that best skill ups occur when your skill is around 20 points under the trivial level and diminishes as you get very close to the trivial level. The item shouldnt matter so much as the trivial - which as you point out is the same for oth items.<br />
<br />
The deciding factor for me is the sale price of the items. Tailoring is much less painful if you make some money as you go and I suspect the tunics (1000-1500pp on Tallon Zek) will sell much better than the masks (50-100pp). <br />
<br />
BTW The post above isnt quite correct as to the stat effects on skilling up - the information in the FAQ section is much clearer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More pure attempts, if one can consider having a starting point of an equal amount of hides.  With more attempts comes a greater chance of skillups (in my mind at least). Also, considering that all studded items trivial at the same point.<br />
<br />
The quicker you reach 188, then you can move onto the Reinforced, hence the acrylia pieces you will still pick up in farming can then be used to create tunics, which by then will be trivial, and hopefully a greater success rate than at 181...and will provide you with cash.<br />
<br />
So in short, go for skill now, and then create the tunics for profit later if possible.</div></div><hr />

While you can make more money selling the Tunics in the Bazaar, if you wish to do that, I'm looking for the most chances of skill ups for the number of items I have, which means using less Studs to make the Masks for more chances.<br />
<br />
As well, you do not have to wait to trivial Acrylia Studded before moving on to Acrylia Reinforced.  You can try for skillups at the same time.  This is what I plan on doing when I get enough Acrylia Bonings made.<br />

Masks = more attempts which should = more skill-ups.  However masks sell for crapola.  If you want to get some money out of it then make whatever pieces sell on your server knowing that you are going to need more components(studs) to get your skill checks.<br />

I generally make a few nicer items to get some cash back. I find wristbands sell better than masks because their are 2 slots for them.<br />
But I am always running out of flawless rockhopper hides before anything else.<br />
