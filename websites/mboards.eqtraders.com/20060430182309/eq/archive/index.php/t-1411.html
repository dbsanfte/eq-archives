<br />
New smith here, and I'd like to start by thanking everyone for all the great info I've gotten off this site thus far.  I am approaching the difficult stages of smithing, and this post by Araon:<br />
<br />
<br />
I am somewhat surprised that a high level human would go the shadowscream route. Freeport cultural is fairly straightforward, the only bottleneck being sea temper. Now that saltwater seaweed is droppable, even sea temper is easy, assuming you have a bit of plat to spare. <br />
<br />
If you can get the Gornit camp in OOT, you can hunt Gornit (a fast spawning Hill Giant who drops about 220pp an hour in plat alone), fish for seaweed while you med and even do the odd seafury cyclops if you have the mana. <br />
<br />
Better yet, persuade a group of high 40s/low 50s friends to come hunt seafuries while you heal and buff them in return for any sea foam drops. You can still fish at the same time.... <br />
<br />
Araon Trueheart <br />
<br />
got me thinking that freeport cultural smithing might be the way for me to go.  <br />
<br />
Could someone post some very basic info about the stages in this form of smithing.  I have the recipes, I was just wondering what everyone suggested as far as progression, what skill level to start at, any hits or tips, etc.<br />
<br />
Also, where is the freeport cultural forge located?  The Freeport Militia and I don't exactly see eye to eye anymore, due to a little favor i did for a few of my paladin friends.....<br />
<br />
Any information on this is appreciated, and I apologize if it has been covered in detail.  I couldn't find it via search.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fallwell</div><div class="date">12-23-2002, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm at work right now, so pardon any non-specifics ;) <br />
<br />
I started doing the field plate right after fine plate (188) until now (233).  Once I got a system down, and collected enough mugs, I can get 3-4 skillups a night.  I PLed a friend's smithing to 155 so he could help me make the sheets, rings, etc.  Only took a couple hours, he has good smithing skill, and it makes life way easier.<br />
<br />
Not saying this is &quot;the way&quot; to do field plate, but you may find something worthwhile in my routine.<br />
<br />
1. Bind in East Freeport near the mold vendor (near WFP zone), and take the boat to your new home, OOT.<br />
<br />
2.  Stand on the dock at Sister Island and fish away for seaweed while auctioning off to buy Mugs of Sea Foam.  I usually pay 7-10 plat each for them.  Hunting them yourself would prove to take way longer, and in the time you save you can easily go farm cash somewhere to make up the cost.  After a week or so there, people would start holding them for me to buy, and many people just gave them to me.  <br />
<br />
3.  Fill up your backpacks with seaweed.  I usually collect 60 seaweed (3 hours) and then gate back to FP to make tempers.  There is a tavern near the bank in NFP that has a brew barrel and sells fish wine. (fish wine + 2 mugs + seaweed)<br />
<br />
4.  I would suggest doing the temper collection heavy up front, especially the mugs.  Vendor dive often for the mugs in shadowhaven, pok and in OOT.<br />
<br />
5.  I then break up the fishing by farming pelts in marus seru and spiderling silks in Feerott.  I have also bought the occasional stack of padding in the bazaar if they are cheap enough (under 15 plat each).<br />
<br />
6.  The last thing I do is have a druid buddy (bound in HHK) gate back and buy a couple sets of 4/Unrefined Ore to restock Bazaar Vendor.  I make the folded sheets here due to the lack of encumberance.  <br />
<br />
7.  Gate back to EFP, then run to NFP and buy about 6 stacks of water in tavern near bank.  Head to forge make metal rings for jointing.  Make extra in case you fail on jointing.  Gate to EFP(bound right at mold vendor) and buy 20 molds*.  <br />
<br />
8.  Run to forge in WFP and make jointing.  There is a regular forge very close to the freeport forge.  I then do 20 final combines at a time, gate to vendor...sell....buy molds....rinse and repeat until done.<br />
<br />
*As for the progression of items?  I just worked from the trivials, stopping at 1 sheet items on non-imbued.<br />
<br />
Also, always have SOW when in Freeport :? <br />
