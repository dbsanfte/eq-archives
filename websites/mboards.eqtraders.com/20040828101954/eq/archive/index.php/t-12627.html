<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Woody</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, on a recent visit to the San Diego area, I managed to get together a very small group of people for some Mongolian BBQ. My shirt still shows the aftermath of the meal... durnit all.<br />
<br />
Well, among the folks that came out were Niami and Ngreth.<br />
<br />
It seemed as though we always managed to miss each other at FanFaires. They'd make it to the ones I couldn't attend, and vice versa. So, it was nice to finally get to meet and talk with two folks whose community directs a lot of fot traffic my way.<br />
<br />
I just wanted to stop in and say thanks for coming out you two. We'll have to do it again sometime. I remember to bring a bib or something.<br />
<br />
Stupid barbeque dot. **pokes his shirt absently**</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I love your comic. <br />
<br />
/hugs! /bow! /cheer! <br />
<br />
<br />
And that is a very nice thing to do, get people together for food. Food is good. Glad it was fun for all involved. ^_^ <br />

&quot;You are hungry.<br />
You are out of food.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I do miss that Mongolian BBQ, used to go quite regularly when I lived in So Cal.  The only one we have near where I live now is pretty crappy.<br />
<br />
Oh, yeah, Love your comic Woody, and, of course, EQTraders, I'd be lost without it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh, Ngreth just uses his beard to catch such stuff most of the time.  {teases then hides in a stray pack}<br />
<br />
It was great to finally meet you, Woody!  Hopefully that spot will come out, though I suspect you will still 'see' it even if it does.  {grins}<br />
<br />
If all else fails, hopefully we'll catch you in Vegas for the next Fan Faire.</div></div><hr />

Slight off-topic....<br />

Chanter Lesson Number One. If you cast Illusion:Troll in Rivervale, the guards WILL come after you, no matter how much they may love you otherwise. <br />
<br />
If you then click Illusion:Troll OFF... they still come after you. <br />

I rather more imagined this &quot;chewing&quot; to be in the nature of the way human babies but their own toes in theri mouths.</div></div><hr />

At the very least, chalk Ngreth's comment up to a Sanna-Style Unintended Double-Entendre. <br />
