<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was groupped in PoI when an interesting song came ove the player, &quot;Mr. Roboto&quot; by Styx.  I began to think that was a rather appropreate (sp?) song for the zone, then I began to think of others...<br />
<br />
&quot;Machines (Back to Humans)&quot; by Queen<br />
&quot;At the Heart of it All&quot; by Nine Inch Nails (the sound just seems to go along with the zone)<br />
<br />
Then I began to think of other zones and songs, like for Mistmoore Dungeons and Kithcor (at night) - Ghostbusters (Ray Parker Jr)<br />
<br />
PoJ - &quot;I fought the Law, and the Law Won&quot;  (? - Sex Pistols, maybe?) and &quot;I shot the Sheriff&quot; (Eric Clapton)<br />
<br />
PoK - &quot;She Blinded Me With Science&quot; (Thomas Colby)<br />
<br />
Blackburrow and SplitPaw - &quot;Dogs of War&quot; (Pink Floyd)<br />
<br />
So I'm wondering, what other songs seem to fit in well with some zones?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arrica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I do remember being in an exp group in Karnor's a good while back, and a med break had thrown off our control of spawns, so when our puller went out, he came back with 3 or 4 adds, and us without a chanter. :eek:  What made it creepy interesting, was just as they all arrived at our camp spot, my music player which was on random at the time, started up Duel of the Fates, from Star Wars Phantom Menace.  Made it even weirder when we were just finishing them off as the song ended. :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cubwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Bazaar needs &quot;The Price is Right&quot; theme, and The Nexus needs &quot;Theme from 'A Summer Place'&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Moonlilly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Plane of Time A...In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kyahra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There's gotta be something from Alice Cooper that would suit PoN.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Silound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Everytime I'm in the GY of any PoP zone I hear &quot;Electric Funeral&quot; (Black Sabbath) or &quot;Wanted, Dead or Alive&quot; (Bon Jovi)<br />
<br />
Ak'Anon - &quot;Iron Man&quot; (Ok so I like Ozzy)<br />
<br />
PoI - &quot;Replacement Killers&quot; (Crystal Method)<br />
<br />
Karanas - &quot;Country Roads&quot; (John Denver) or &quot;On the Road Again&quot; (Bob Seger) or &quot;Have You Ever Seen the Rain&quot; (CCR) or &quot;Ride Like the Wind&quot; (Christopher Cross)<br />
<br />
PoN - &quot;Monster Mash&quot; (Bobby Boris Pickett)<br />
<br />
Innothule/Gukta - &quot;Born on the Bayou&quot; (John Fogerty)<br />
<br />
Every time I click Selos on my bard I think of &quot;Born to Run&quot; (Bruce Springsteen) and &quot;Life in the Fast Lane&quot; (Eagles)<br />
<br />
HoH - &quot;Fight for Your Honor&quot; (Chicago)<br />
<br />
Dulak's Harbor -  &quot;Gangster's Paradise&quot; (Coolio)<br />
<br />
The race to time sparked me to always think of PoTime with &quot;Time After Time&quot; (Cindi Lauper)<br />
<br />
PoD - &quot;Down With the Sickness&quot; (Distrurbed I think)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok I could go down my playlist forever here and pick all my zone favorites but I'm too lazy to</div></div><hr />
