<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What's the best place to farm HQ Brute Hide?  I've tried Frontier Mountains and Warslik Woods.<br />
<br />
FM's terrain is horrible.  The monkeys roam absolutely everywhere.  Everything green aggro, including Sarnaks (I'm trying to keep my Chardok faction, /sigh).  In any case, drop rate is horrible, I got 2 HQ hides in 1 hour.<br />
<br />
WW was slightly better because there are no sarnaks and there is a static cave.  But the drop rate is still horrible.  I got 1 HQ hide in 1 hour.<br />
<br />
Anyone experienced in halfling cultural has any suggestion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dalur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My halfling druid friend is trying to collect the HQ brute hides also.<br />
<br />
Basically he has an monk that he used to play for a change of pace that he has perma parked in WW.  Usually before he gets on or logs off, he gets on the monk and clears out all of the caves.<br />
<br />
About once every couple of weeks, I have to run over there and empty out all of his stuff for him.  I think he usually gets 1 or 2 HQ per night.<br />
<br />
They are pretty rare. <br />
<br />
Another choice, you could try to hunt the brutes in Dreadlands around KC.  They are a bit higher level, but seem to have more of them around then WW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Elyssanda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ages and ages ago (6 months or so ago) I got 2 in one day in DL. Since I am a halfling, nor do I have a halfling alt, I gave them to a good friend of mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Minta Rose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get down to Chardok B for a short while and fix the sarnak faction if  you want to continue in Frontier Mountains.  Also, painful as the resale multiplier is, don't forget to check the Overthere vendors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>xonbink</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Easiest place to farm HQ Brute hides thusfar for me has been inside the cave in warsilik woods that leads to dalnir.<br />
<br />
There are  5 steady spawn brutes that respawn every 15 mins (approx) This can be very boring, however I found the drop rate of hq brute hides to be reasonable, as well as some coin and various words / runes. <br />
<br />
It's very boring, but the drop rate on hq brute hides was about 1 per every two clearings - somedays I was able to get more.<br />
<br />
It certainly beats dealing with aggro greenies in FM or even more difficult aggro in DL -<br />
<br />
Also, if you are using these for skillups, dont waste your time trying to make the high end cultural until you are near 250 skill as it's very expensive (blue diamonds) and failure rates for me even at 250 skill have been around 50 percent.  Personally I would just /auction wtb them everywhere you go - <br />
Good luck :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mileron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I leveled three toons in the Brute caves near Dalnir... it's great for 20-28ish.<br />
<br />
Single pulls.  May need a healer.<br />
<br />
So... if you're a healer class and won't get exp... just offer to powerlevel someone :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Meirril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've never hunted in the yeti caves in DL, but I always wonder what the drop rate is from them. Anyone have any experience there?<br />
<br />
Best way I've found to get HQ brute hide is hang out in the bazaar and check the vendors. Generaly some halfling gets fed up with tailoring and sells his entire stock of 6 or so he's managed to collect over the last month...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">had a bud farm the yetis for esscense fo winter for barb cultural.  he never saw the hides that i know of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've hunted a lot of yeti and never seen a brute hide. I'm pretty sure they only drop from things named Brutes. Dalnir caves are okay, or Dreadlands brutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nex Alacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ugh, I hate these things.  I wanted to use the Reinforced armor as a path of skilling up, but with the rarity of HQ hides, I don't think thats feasable.  I would buy them in the bazaar, but not for reinforced armor as on my server (stromm) the HQ hides sell for 200-400pp!!  I can't invest that much for an item that has 2 sta and 1 wis like the imbued reinforced!-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah, I can't even sell any Stormreapers these days, it's just not as good as a lot of dropped stuff that's out there. I'm sure the plain reinforced would only sell for very low prices, not enough to pay for the hides if you had to buy them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Noni DeeCups</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Skip them. Really. There are MUCH better alternatives out there now.</div></div><hr />
