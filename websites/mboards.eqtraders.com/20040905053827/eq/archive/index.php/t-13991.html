<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quiloue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I too am highly annoyed by the amount of ungrateful people i encounter on boards and in game. People who say things like &quot;SOE sux!&quot; or &quot;Why can't they get their sh** together?&quot; or &quot;God**** nerfing, that's all they're good for!!&quot;<br />
<br />
My response to them is:<br />
<br />
HUH???<br />
<br />
It amounts to a simple contradiction: these people are actually saying &quot;I love their game, I play it for hours on end, every day, but they, the people that actually work at maintaining and improving it... suck.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is as near to meaningless gibberish as I can find.<br />
<br />
I can almost understand people initially responding with a little dissapointment after something gets changed... like &quot;crap, we're not getting as many tribute points now.&quot; but then after TWO SECONDS of thought realizing that it would ruin the game if everyone were walking around with maximum buffs all the time, 24 hours a day... modifying their opinion accordingly and then saying &quot;yeah, but they needed to change that, or it would have been the end of EQ.&quot;<br />
<br />
But unfortunately, people tend to voice their complaints, and not their praise.<br />
<br />
Changes are made when the developers (who are not omniiscient and cannot see into the future to see the effects of their ideas over long periods of time) realize that keeping something in place would either break the functionality of the game, or make it drastically unfair, and thus alter the level of FUN for everybody.<br />
<br />
Yes people, the game is not in place to make you, your individual character rich, happy and unbalanced, but so that everyone, every one of the thousands of players, can have FUN. People who complain are simplly saying: &quot;But I want it to be left unfair because I, personally, was benefitting from that&quot;. <br />
<br />
Well, so sorry, but if that is your attitude then I am behind SoE whacking you with a nerf stick. In fact, I'll go find them a bigger stick.<br />
<br />
So let me be one of the few voices (and I know there are others) who says:<br />
<br />
Great game, SoE. I love the improvements. The game is far, far FAR better than when I started playing back in the Kunark days. FAR better. I love the new tradeskill UI. Keep on tweaking it, hell change the **** out of it, so long as you keep making things better, use my money however you want. <br />
<br />
I love changes, I love improvements to the game I love. Nerf the living crap out of it, I don't care, so long as it remains fun and challenging and fair for everybody. Whatever little tweaks need doing after big patches, no problem. Take the servers down if you need too. I won't complain. When they come back up they will be better. And that is the whole idea.<br />
<br />
(And all of this applies to the great job people do at sites like EQ Traders too. Don't listen to the majority people who complain. Listen to the silent minority who sing your praises!)<br />
