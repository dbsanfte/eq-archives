Can someone confirm, and does anyone have any clue what they are...?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The alternate tempers was just one idea suggested to make elemental tempers easier to obtain.  They are NOT an actual in-game thing.  They are just a player-made suggestion, one of many that the developers are considering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mezzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Man.. they need to do something.. even on The Rathe.. rather old server and a few guilds in Elementals.. these items are still way too rare.  Thanks... I could have swore I saw that on a patch.. hmm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I personally wear more elemental armor pieces than I have ATTEMPTED elemental plate combines. My guild has tons of drops that make farwater look like garbage, we have never SEEN enough single oil of frog to ATTEMPT a pair of greaves. Does this strike anyone else as balanced?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>thrashette</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What was darned stupid was making the rare temper component also be the pottery glaze component.  While I've enough bits to make 3 or 4 tries at Livestone plate, I'll be making totems. More profit to sell,  useful to more classes, and more tries per drop.<br />

You do know that up until a few months ago, the Rathe Travel Agency had a secret treaty not to bazaar Elemental tradeskill items?   Basically the Rathe economy for Elemental Items started in January 2004, with 7 guilds flagged.  It is taking a while to build.<br />
<br />
Things are getting better as more people group there.  Earth and Fire temper parts are starting to show up, and I was even able to get some E'cian Ice the other day.<br />
<br />
Expect Aid Grimel items to stay high for a while, though. Nobody does exp at the regrua, and Fire saps get consumed as fast as they drop.<br />

To see frog oil, someone would have to kill frogs.  There are only 9 frogs in game. They are neither attractive to kill on thier own, nor are they on the way to a raid.</div></div><hr />

Why do people keep discussing Oil of a Frog and Farwater gear?  Farwater plate and chain both do NOT use Oil of a Frog.  The Oil is exclusively used for Aqua Glaze, and that's used for only two pottery items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, I meant fish gills. I was griping to the guild about oil of frog for time key box and got the two confused. Both are too rare imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Galain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think I've made 12 pair of Farwater Plate and Chain pants.  Not rare at all.</div></div><hr />

You must be getting access to some guild's bank then cause its RARE I even see shimmering fish gills, soapstone, or E'cian Ice in bazaar OR people selling it. After 4 weeks of actively search out items I made a chain bp and legs for me. Luckily I went 2 for 2 since thats all the stuff I could get my hands on. This is even on Veeshan where elemental planes are becomming the new place to shout &quot;Cleric LFG&quot; and get groups!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grimlach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Earth temper:<br />
1) mephit blood - camp ledge left side of zone and you'll get more than enough while exping<br />
2) liquified earth - camp mud ring and kill tons of mudwalkers. I do this with a single group very often and you can too.  I dont suggest 2boxing here because of the roamer dillo tho.<br />
3) chips of granite - not sure exactly which stone mobs drop these but basically if you pull the blue con guys around the peregrin ring you'll get them very fast.<br />
<br />
If you stick to the appropriate camp spots and pull the correct mobs you'll have more than enough tempers in no time. <br />
<br />
Water temper:<br />
1) gills - zone in group killing many sharks and fishes.  Dont know exactly which mobs drop the gills but you'll get about 1 an hour with a decent group.<br />
2) mephit blood - same zonein group you camp gills for; you'll get more than enough bloods.<br />
3) soapstone - get lots of these when your guild attempts coirnav or ofassaa and kills the slarg guys. you'll also get the ice you need here too.<br />
<br />
Fire temper:<br />
1) mephit blood - obvious. kill either mephits that roam at zone or on their lil isle.<br />
2) magma crystals - drops off the soldier looking guys, fairly uncommon in my experience, but then fire armor aint that great.<br />
3) solidified magma - magma guardians by the birds.  Bring a strong group with a good puller as they hit like 5x 1.1kish<br />
<br />
Air temper:<br />
1) mephit blood - you will get tons of these when your guild does the avatar rings for xeg keys.<br />
2) fog fragments - smoke ring mist elemental looking mobs.  Your guild will be a main source of fragments for you here.<br />
3) condensated - forget exact name but drops off same mobs as fog fragments.<br />
<br />
Earth tailored and water plate/chain have more hitpoints than any ornate items you could possibly make and they're tradeable.  These items are the best tradeable gear in the game as far as I know; so why should their drop rate be nerfed? Personally I wouldnt bother with anything but earth items if you are trying to do this stuff with a single group instead using raid drops.  Earth chain/plate bp/legs are still very good and rival ornate.  Plus, they are tradeable.  I personally like the drop rate and difficulty of making these items; it makes them cool =)</div></div><hr />

Actually, it's metallic substance for the tempers; the magma is used for pottery, if memory serves.  Any tips for that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>thrashette</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Why do people keep discussing Oil of a Frog and Farwater gear? <br />
<br />
For me, it's because my guildmates are constantly after me about Farwater Legs and Ceramic Water Sprinker of Marr.  Both are made of unobtainium as far as the general population is concerned.<br />
<br />
Of course, the general population won't camp frogs and are scared of Ofassa.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, Metallic Substances are really rare on Xegony too.<br />
<br />
I recently saw a bunch of Liquefied Earths in the Bazaar... but I've already failed on 2 Livestone Vambraces &amp; 1 Livestone Chain Leggings (and succeeded on 1 Livestone Greaves).<br />
<br />
I really, really want to make some Inferno Plate Vambraces for my Cleric...  The high level of Mana on the Inferno Plate really looks like what I want. :D</div></div><hr />

These drop off the earth elemental mobs IIRC</div></div><hr />

Oh really? While it is true that BotS had a &quot;don't-sell-in-the-bazaar&quot; policy back when they first broke into Elementals, I've never heard of what you speak (and can confirm to have seen obsidianwood sap for sale in 2003).<br />
<br />
Nobody does exp at the regrua...<br />
...<br />

<br />
Though I do agree, the rare required components (liq. earth, shimmering fish gills, metallic sub.) are just STUPIDLY rare. Oh, but I can deck everyone out in silk. =P<br />
<br />
Lame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My apologies. Even though I'm coming up on my 2nd year anniversary on the Rathe, it is still a fairly new server to me. I learned that indeed there was some odd agreement not to sell elemental tradeskill components or stuff for a time...<br />
<br />
Too weird.</div></div><hr />
