I am also working on my trade skills but in the course of my travels, I do a good deal of foraging.<br />
<br />
Would people here like to place orders, in advance, for the sort of things rangers can forage?  If we can make a deal in advance, I'll hold stuff off the market and you and I can arrange for sales when we're both online.<br />
<br />
Post here with your desired good and I'll contact you so we can make a deal.</div></div><hr />

I have no idea how common they are, so if you want to check it out, and quote me a price per stack, the email is briano@wpi.edu<br />
<br />
If the price *IS* right ill be interested in at least 5 stacks, probably many more depending on how fast I skill up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velurian</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interested in bamboo shoots, foraged in Stonebrunt, and Seahorse Roe, foraged in Erud's Crossing.  May be interested in quite a few, depending on the price.  Send me a tell in-game (characters Velurian or Equidani) if you would be able to forage these and would like to discuss pricing.<br />
<br />
(To give you an idea of what I'd be willing to spend -- I'm looking for cheaper and/or less time-consuming alternatives to the solstice robes, and need these forages for LoY robes.  Depending on the price, I may really be willing to buy a LOT of these.  For now, bamboo shoots more than the seahorse roe.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andyhre</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will explore these zones.  As a Faydwerian, I'm less familiar with Antonica and I've never been to Odus, so it'll be a good exploration as well.  I will contact you once I have a decent supply</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galamann</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">didnt know either of those could be foraged, but im interested in both of the components Velurian is interested as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andyhre</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't forgotten about you folks!<br />
<br />
I have yet to make it out to the Odus spots.  I actually PoK'ed to Erudin and then took the boat to Qeynos but didn't realize it only stopped at Erud's crossing on the return trip.  I will make it out there.  Then it's father to try Stonebrunt, but I shall eventually.<br />
<br />
As for Plains roots, as Galamann knows, I did manage to find some in North Karanas, not as a foraged itme, but as drop from beetles.  I expect ot try the Commonlands soon and Galamann and I will chat off line once I have his needed stacks and stacks.<br />
<br />
You humble ranger just reached level 22 today, which means nifty new spells which may make my forays last longer.  And more importantly, my forage skill can go up another 5 ticks, making me a better root gatherer, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stonebrunt would make for good hunting for someone of your level.  Lots of high-teens to low 20's mobs.  However, I've never played a ranger, so I don't know anything particular to your situation.<br />
<br />
There's no particular hurry for my components; the tailoring combines on which these would depend, I won't be doing until I hit 200 or so in tailoring (at 189 now), and the tailoring gods have not been kind to me lately...whenever you gather a fair number, let me know.</div></div><hr />

As it is, I will forward your comment to the RL friend with whom I tend to play.  it may encourage him to think about this as our next destination.</div></div><hr />
