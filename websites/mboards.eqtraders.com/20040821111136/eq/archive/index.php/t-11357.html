<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>postalblowfish7</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a HUUUGE fishing fan and I picked up a Calapsable Fishing Pole in the bazaar the other day from a Trader.  It broke after a couple hours of good fishing.  I would really love to make one of my own, but I'm a Wood Elf, and i understand tinkering to be a Gnome only tradeskill.  Is there any way I could craft one of these myself?  Gnomes can be so tempremental some times ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Whizbang_Dustyboots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can try, but at a zero skill, you have a high chance of failure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not to take anything away from the tinkering skill, but if you really love to fish then you must do this quest:<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2236<br />
<br />
The quest is both simple and difficult.  All you have to do is hand the barbarian NPC, standing by the pool of water in PoK, two Nightmare Cichlid bones and two Valorian Discus bones.  The first trick is to be high enough level to fish in the Plane of Nightmare and the Plane of Valor.  The second trick is being able to live long enough in the Plane of Nightmare to be able to pull up the fish you need.  Fishing in the Plane of Valor is actually safe.  Or you can search the bazaar for the bones and just buy them.<br />
<br />
Doing this quest will get you a Fisherman’s Companion.  You can use the Companion to summon an endless supply of fishing poles.  The only drawback is that they are no drop so you can’t pass them out to fellow fishermen, even though they’re no rent.  And each fishing pole can summon an endless supply of ale.  The booze is no rent but it can be passed out to everybody around you.  So if you keep your Fisherman’s Companion in your inventory you’ll always have a fishing pole.  It’s just a shame it doesn’t also summon bait.<br />
<br />
I have four characters I play on a fairly regular basis.  They each have one of these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Fishing in PoN is safe as well, you just have to pick the right spot.  The docks work very well for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arghargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Both bones droppable, and are common in the Bazaar, so this quest is trivial.  I did this for an alt for about 300pp for everything needed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Whizbang_Dustyboots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Moving to the docks safely in PoN is a trick for many classes, though.<br />
<br />
But yeah, the Fisherman's Companion is great. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not too tough for any class, there are potions and items readily available to cast the spells on someone who can't cast them himself.  It's also not generally too hard to find someone to just cast them on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Whizbang_Dustyboots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Most everything in PoN sees inviz anyway, so that's not the problem. Avoiding aggro and making it to the dock alone is the challenge. If a wizard or druid with Exodus or an FD class tries, sure, it's not a big deal if they get aggro.<br />
<br />
What about warriors, though, you know?<br />
<br />
I would suggest that if you want to fish for these, get a group to drop you off.</div></div><hr />
