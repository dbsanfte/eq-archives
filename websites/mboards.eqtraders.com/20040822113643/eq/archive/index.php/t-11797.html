<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nihixul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night, after gating to Everfrost, I was attacked by one of the Vengeful trio of skeletons that annoy the heck out of the newbies there. I killed him and looted one of 3 pages needed for a quest. Alla says that the result of the quest is one of several books on brewing. However, it didn't list what the book was, nor did any of the comments thereafter talk about the recipes contained therein. <br />
<br />
I have a few questions:<br />
<br />
Has anyone done this quest?<br />
Does anyone know the books given?<br />
<br />
Vengeful Soloist, Composer, Lyricist. Vengeful, eh? Seeking revenge, eh? I know a certain brewer seeking revenge. Oh, but that's another story, right? Right? Hm. Something to ponder.<br />
<br />
By the way, the 3 pages are NO RENT. I will try to get the other two today when I get back from classes.<br />
<br />
ps - I wouldn't normally bother the community about such a thing, but I couldn't find any info about the quest. Given the NO RENT status of the pages, I can only assume very few people have bothered to do this quest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enter Halas.  Cross the moat.  Turn right at the sign.<br />
<br />
Facing the well, look 90 degrees right.  There should be a bar.  Enter the bar.  There will be two people behind the bar, and one person in front, and a guy way off in the left corner.<br />
<br />
You want the lady in front of the bar.  Hail her, talk to her, turn in the pages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This quest has been in EQ since day 1. All the recipes in the book are known (though I don't rememeber off hand which they are).<br />
<br />
Believe me anyone who started a Barbarian newb back in 1999 will be able to tell you all about those stupid skeletons kicking their butts repeatedly while they were trying to slay bears and goblins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nihixul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I knew where the lady was, I just wondered if the recipes were all accounted for. :P Ok, it seems they have. Good... or bad... or something. :)<br />
<br />
It must definitely have been quite traumatic, getting quashed by those skellies (who agroed me at lvl 62), because that is ALL the people on the relevant alla threads talked about. :)<br />
<br />
thanks for the help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes its quite silly... they are very common spawns in the Everfrost newbie era, are about level 15-20, and aggro on everything no exceptions.</div></div><hr />
