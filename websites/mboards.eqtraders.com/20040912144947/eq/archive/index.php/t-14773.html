<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaenine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a new poster here but a longtime user of the site. Recently resumed my tailoring career and a couple of high skill tailors advised me to do acrylia leather since my skill is still 174, great. <br />
<br />
As instructed I go The Grey zoneline in Mons Letalis where I'm told there will be 1 stack of Flawless every 2 hours and all the Superb I could want. After 5-6 hours of constant pulls I had 4 Flawless hides (not stacks) and maybe 8 Superb hides.<br />
<br />
Ok, I thought, no problem that would probably be a skill point, about what I expect to get out of Velious tailoring for that time investment.<br />
<br />
Moving on the the next obvious requirement of the recipes, Acrylia. 4 hours total of killing Grimlings in cave, at camps, wherever I could find them, in Grimling Forest yielded 0 (zero) peices.<br />
<br />
Seems like it takes at least twice as long to gather Luclin combines than it does Velious, was this always the case? If so will I need to take groups to the Deep to get the acrylia, or does anyone have some better advice?<br />
<br />
If anyone has a link to post already covering this topic please share, couldn't find one of this nature on my own.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just do a seach for &quot;acrylia&quot;.. and you should come up with at least 3-5 long posts giving lots of good details on where to farm.  Make sure you're searching all threads, not just the ones for the past week.</div></div><hr />
