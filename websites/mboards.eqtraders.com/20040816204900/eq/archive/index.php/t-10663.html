<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>warrenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently I opened a thread (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=10473) on the General board asking about purchasable foods and drinks which had extended durations.  It got shuttled over to OOC even though I feel that it is relevant to tradeskills.  Perhaps not directly relevant since it's not something made by players, but relevant none the less.  Good, purchasable food would be in direct competition with the items that we make.<br />
<br />
Yet on the General page, I see several threads which have nothing at all to do with tradeskills.  They're talking about the LDoN puzzle (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=10491), adventure points (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=10581), and a Ranger's adventures (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=10619).  It's odd that they stay on the general page, yet a thread which talks about food is moved to OOC.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to overrule a moderator's decision.  What's done is done.  And I'm not saything that the threads above should be moved.  But I wanted to let you know that I am frustrated over what I see as an inconsistent situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I moved a couple of those.  One of them was put there by Niami, who I am not going to second guess.  I'm sorry if you felt singled out, but that was not our intention.  We're human and move things as we see em, but we are apt to miss something here and there.  <br />
<br />
I am the one who moved your original post.  I read it first, and saw that you specifically did not want any mention of tradeskills, so I moved it.  <br />
<br />
Things have been extremely busy with the LDoN recipes.  I've only been able to do a very quick scan through the forums now and then.  My fellow moderators are similarly busy.  We do what we can, but please remember that maintenance and moderation of this site is entirely a volunteer effort.  We do what we can, the best we can.<br />
<br />
Cross-posting and reopening topics we have closed or moved only creates more work for us which means we have even less time to address other issues in the forums and to work on the site.  Don't do it.<br />
