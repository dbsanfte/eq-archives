<br />
Last October, my Kiwi partner's father was diagnosed with cancer. Although the prognosis is no longer as bad as the doctors originally thought, it's bad enough to get my partner to leave Scotland - which has been home for her for last 7 years and decide to fly back to her family in NZ.   I did some serious thinking, packed in the IT contract I was working on and started filling in paperwork. <br />
<br />
Last week, the New Zealand immigration authority granted me residency.<br />
<br />
In just over three weeks, we've got to finish re-decorating the flat, sort out all the rental details, pack everything we can't take with us into storage and board a plane to Auckland. Now I'm no stranger to New Zealand, having been there three times before and having toured around most of both Islands - and I always thought that one day I might move out there as I really love the place. However the one thing I hadn't bargained on - was the grip that my home country might have on me.<br />
This cold, wet, misty land that I was born and brought up in and have walked, driven, skiid, hiked, climbed, scuba dived and cycled my way around seems to be rooted in my very bones. Leaving Scotland - not knowing when or even if I'll be coming back - is without a doubt the hardest thing I have ever done in my life.<br />
<br />
In my youth, I had no concept of the sort of things I was going to get up to as I grew older - I imagined that life would be stable, settled and predictable.<br />
Now I find myself about to start over again - at the opposite end of the globe... find a job, get a bank account, build up a credit rating, find somewhere decent to stay, make new friends ...<br />
<br />
I turned 40 six months ago. <br />
<br />
I may be off-line for some months until I can get settled - build a new PC, sort out an internet connection and finally find my way back to Norrath ...<br />
<br />
<br />
... but I WILL be back  :upsidwn:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good luck.  :goodvibe:  :goodvibe:  :goodvibe: <br />
<br />
And I thought I had a hard time mnoving from New Hampshire, to New Jersey, to Florida.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Alkee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sorry to here that you had to uproot from your homeland, it can be unnerving. I, myself moved from England to New Zealand many years ago.<br />
But I am sure you will get used to it after a while. Good luck on getting work and settling into New Zealand life, I wish you all the best.<br />
I live in Hamilton, New Zealand which is not far away from Auckland. I am also a similar age to yourself (36). It can be tricky to start a life in a new country, me and my wife would be happy to say hello, meet you guys for a drink, make you feel welcome etc.<br />
Just send us a private message if interested.<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A girl in my poetry class is graduating in a week, and packing up to move /to/ Scotland and marry a Scotsman. So, as you leave a place you love, someone comes to learn to love it like you have. <br />
<br />
/hugs and /comfort and best wishes for it all. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wow, what an adventure!  I really hope everything goes smoothly for you. :hug:<br />
<br />
And...it's okay to keep your bind spot in Scotland until you're sure you're ready to change it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">New Zeland.  Wonderful country.  You'll find that they have excellent internet access and friendly people.  <br />
<br />
Best wishes to you on restarting your life.  It's an adventure of the most exciting and most terrifying sort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Malathos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the support folks !<br />
<br />
One week today and we should be somewhere over the Atlantic en-route to LAX - the first half of the journey. The whole trip takes around 24 hours of flying time not including the refuel stop at LA and crossing the international date line (which adds another day onto the whole affair).<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the packing goes on at feverish pace. We're renting out the flat while we're gone (so keeping our bind spot here :) ) and there's a thousand and one minor things that need done before we can do that.  Said goodbye to my parents today - who will be away when we leave - that was hard enough.<br />
<br />
My heart goes out to those people who boarded a ship over a hundred years ago to sail for a land they knew so little about - they were the real adventurers !<br />
<br />
On the plus side, I've already got companies in New Zealand trying to sort out  phone interviews with me while i'm still in Scotland - so I may have a job before I even get there - not that I'm too bothered about that side of things anyway, but anything that I don't have to worry about just now is a bonus.</div></div><hr />
