<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tudani</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure if this has always been the case as I haven't made white lead for a long time.  But today, on my shaman, I made some and was getting a trivial message.  The site still says 20 make poison as the trivial, and obviously my shaman has zero skill in make poison.  I never noticed a trivial message before, so I thought it was a bit strange.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tibis</div><div class="date">04-27-2003, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the only reason that 20 is listed as a trivial for White Lead is because rogues get the Make Poison skill at level 20, and thus when you train in it for the first time, you have 20 skill and, of course, it's trivial at that point.<br />
<br />
White Lead appears to be a no-fail combine in any case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tokensmoke</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 01:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agree....I think its one of those &quot;no-brainer&quot; combines..!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tudani</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most no fail combines that I have done that are not skill dependant (glazes, 5 and 10 shot potions) do not give a trivial message.  This seemed a lot more like silk swatches which are no fail but do yield a trivial message...however, I would not expect them to be trivial at zero skill in make poison. &lt;shrugs&gt; So either white lead is based on another skill or something is really weird with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dunnwindy</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe this is a Make Poison skill and Shamans cannot make poison.  Therefore you will get the &quot;trivial&quot; message simply because you cannot gain skill increases in a skill you can't learn.<br />
<br />
You would get the same thing if your shaman tried say Tinkering, or if I as a rogue were to try Alchemy.<br />
<br />
In this case, you cannot learn from making that item because making that item will not teach you a skill you can't aquire.</div></div><hr />
