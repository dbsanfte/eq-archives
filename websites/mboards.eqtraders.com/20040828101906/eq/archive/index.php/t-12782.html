<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>AbitooXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you may be on to something. Scanning the PoP Smithing recipies, all the tempers are of the format:<br />
<br />
Raw Item + Powdered Item + Blood (from zone mephits)<br />
<br />
Try combining 3 Living Coal in a mortar and pestle and doing the combines....  Are the grubs marked &quot;used in tradeskills&quot;?  if so that is the most likely pairing.<br />
<br />
Edited:<br />
3 Living Coal in Collapsible Mortar and Pestle did not combine<br />
2 Living Coal in Collapsible Mortar and Pestle did not combine<br />
1 Living Coal in Collapsible Mortar and Pestle did not combine<br />
<br />
Either the recipie does not follow the others, it is broken, it doesnt exist, or living coal is not the powdered item.  I did not have war grubs to try and powder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not saying that you are wrong, but it is believed that since they ended up removing the Plane of War where RZ was originally housed and stuck him in PoTactics, that the 2 zones' tradeskill stuff got combined and the tradeskill tag was just never removed from the diaku blood.  Each PoP zone has a blood temper, and Tactics' temper is made with war wraith blood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">isnt war wraith blood used in the orange diamond of war?  link (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=7104&amp;menustr=035000000000)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is precedent for a single armor's ingredients to come from multiple zones.  All the ingredients for Hurricane armor, including the Stormrider blood, drop in BoT.  The Stormrider blood also drops in PoStorms, though, if memory serves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, stormrider blood drops from the bugs in the trees in Storms.   And just as an FYI, Smashed War Grubs are used as a poison ingredient.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I take that back.  All the ingredients for Hurricane temper drop in BoT.  The armor requires Bricks of Electrified Copper, which I believe drop exclusively in Storms, not BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmmm.  I thought I saw Copper dropping in the towers the other night in Thunder...  I wasn't raid looter so didn't pay that much attention though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are split over zones, only when the &quot;theme&quot; of the zone is carried over more then one zone.  BoT is really like part 2 of PoStorms.  Those 2 zones are &quot;themed&quot; together.  Just like PoD and CoD are &quot;together&quot; and their tradeskill stuff is dropped over both zones.  PoTactics would have been grouped with PoWar, but War never made it live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Let's approach this from a different angle.  Is there any planar temper where the ingredients drop from two or more zones?  Off hand, I believe all the temper ingredients (for Night Terror, Hurricane, and Elemental tempers) all drop in one zone.  The associated bricks of metal drop either in the same or in a different zone.<br />
<br />
All the tempers follow a consistent pattern.<br />
 One appropriate blood<br />
 One rare component<br />
 One semi-rare component, of which you grind three in a mortar and pestle to yield four powders, used in the temper<br />
If we assume that the War Wraith blood is the one we seek (which makes sense; all the other bloods used in tempers are also used for the imbue spells, and for Tactics, that would be War Wraith blood), then that just leaves one semi-rare and one rare drop.  Most likely, though not certainly, they will be tradeskill flagged.<br />
<br />
What about those Keen Metal Spike things the tailors have been puzzling over?  Try grinding three in a mortar and pestle?  Or maybe it represents the rare component?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Turlo Lomon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Personally, I think that the drop tables for War were added to Tactics.  There is a lot of unusual items dropping in Tactics that are flagged for tradeskill usage.  Several I have found uses for, but I am still curious about the Diaku blood.  It is the only one I haven't figured out yet.<br />
<br />
I still think I am onto something here, but we will see.  <br />
<br />
On the same token, shouldn't there be a set of armor made from the Plane of Disease?  What about Valor/Honor?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't think there are any foraged components in any of the known planar armours... (I might be wrong). I doubt that the 'rare' component would be something foraged - that'd be far too easy. <br />
<br />
I'm not too familiar with tactics drops, but we'd be looking for something as rare a drop as, say, drop of pure rain or metallic liquid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Troy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I tried Crushing 1, 2 and 3 Highly Polished Gems yesterday. DNC</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kahmon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">3 living coals = DNC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cherryflavour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The Grubs are definately for a rogue poison, advanced poison, 250 trivial, and I am not aware of any temper that use any sort of *bugs* as such</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bobobn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">There is an item called a small sparkling gem that seems to be a rare drop off ogres. It has no tradeskill tag, but could be what ya'all are looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Interesting evidence to support the possible existence of an undiscovered War receipe: You can make an Emblem of War (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=6560&amp;menustr=080070050000), but it has no known use.  It's made using War Wraith blood, not Daiku blood.<br />
<br />
The Emblems from the other planes are required when making armors.  Then again, the Emblem of Valor (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=7627&amp;menustr=080070050000) has no known use either.<br />
<br />
Random question.  Is there any blood that drops in the planes that is NOT used for imbue spells? (Other than Daiku blood, obviously.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>tindiyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">3 daiku head in M/P = DNC<br />
3 keen metal spike in M/P = DNC<br />
<br />
Couldn't find enough  small sparkling gems  , symbol of Zek, or symbol of the diaku( yes I know its used in a quest).<br />
<br />
I like the  idea for this and  the possbile valorous armor. Lots more drops we could check.  I figured If we find the  crushed item, which should be easy to find if it exsists,  we would  be able to find the rest of the combine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">As crazy as it sounds, don't the Boruk and Tanik hides drop in Tactics too?  They're tradeskill tagged, and tailors have been going nuts trying to find a use for them.  Might be worth trying those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>lonewylfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I believe Boruk and Tanik hides are from Torment?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Turlo Lomon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Found a use for Diaku Blood in the new UI.  Poison.  Will be posting an update on research done after I get a chance to work on it tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Turlo Lomon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The posts in tailoring and general state that someone found a torment armor recipe by accident, but didn't take note on everything.<br />
<br />
So, in summary...<br />
<br />
I WAS RIGHT!<br />
<br />
We just need to crack the code so to speak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Turlo Lomon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Ok, random ideas for the torment temper (for now).<br />
<br />
3 tormenter hoofs, plus vial of distilled or purified mana.<br />
<br />
I'm shooting in the dark, as I don't have any of these items.  Possibly grind up 3 hoofs in M&amp;P?  Mmm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I believe someone found a make poison recipe for the diaku blood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Turlo Lomon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Correct (I was one of a few who posted it).  However, since we now got confirmation on a Torment Tannin, I think we need to try to solve that one.  I looked over the other planar tempers and such, and none of them appeared to be tannins to me.</div></div><hr />
