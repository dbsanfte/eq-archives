<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Inyidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've finished patty melts finally (YAY!!!) and went through 5 stacks of truffles to get 2 more skillups.  Since I'm now out of mushrooms, I'd like a little advice what to do next.<br />
<br />
Is it too early to start picnics?  Should I head to JPF and hunt anacondas?  My baker is a level 41 WE druid.  I'm willing to do some levelling up for a bit, if necessary.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kahmon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if you have the smithing, tailoring, and brewing skills high enough to do the subcombines then I think MTPs are way to go. All subcombines yield 10-12 and all materials are easy to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Inyidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, I've been avoiding doing tailoring, so I'm at the point I can do woven mandrake for skillups, and baskets afterwards.  I was just concerned about starting on picnics too early and shooting myself in the wrist, so to speak.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rerashyaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you have any character 55+, I highly reccomend Storm Salmon Fillets.  A nice quiet zone in to skill fishing a little, then a two(!) component combine to take you to 202. Also, I had a really fantastic skill up rate... probably just the RNG playing with me, but 8 stacks to go from 192-202.... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And, after Storm Salmon Fillets you can do Breaded Storm Salmon... assuming you have someone (your own toon or a friend) who can forage Bread Crumbs for you.<br />
<br />
Or you can try buying 'em in the Bazaar.</div></div><hr />

What next? <br />
<br />
<br />
Quit.<br />
<br />
Quit baking, quit tradeskilling, quit EQ. Just go away. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Just kidding, just kidding. :angel: <br />
<br />
Picnics are the way to go. Meat pies are a PITA. Too many subcombines, too much farming, and unless things have changed drastically, you can't sell them on a non-pvp server.<br />
<br />
The griff/anaconda dishes are nice and easy, but the parts don't generally drop in skillup quantities, and again, sales are not that great, if they exist at all.<br />
<br />
PoP meats aren't bad if you can get them, but they are few and far between when looking for 50 points.<br />
<br />
Picnics are a lot of subcombines, but you can do 100 combines of them in 45 minutes if you go to Shadowhaven and buy the rest of the ingredients in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
They are, hands down, the best of the baking recipes. Trust me Iny, would I lie to you?<br />

Wait, don't answer that last question...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Inyidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Of course you'd lie to me!  But you'd let me know, just so I wouldn't miss it accidentally.  How else are we going to keep score? :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
So I did my first run of 100 (well...95...lost a cake slice at the very end).  1 skillup, 6 success for a run of 100 combines.  Currently at 194.  I can tell this is going to be fun!<br />
<br />
But you're right.  These things are easy.  I think the hardest part was making sure I had room in my inventory for everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hehe i did that too right at 192-5.  do 200 runs if you can keep your personal inventory almost empty.  i did meat pies too.  they sell horrible on my server.  i refused to get so little for what it took to make them several times.  gave them away to newbies and guildies.  prolly 240ish pies and 180 jfp combines with a friend and the rest picnics.  takes a couple hours to get everything ready for a combine but its easy to get.  already had the subcombine skills way above trivial though.</div></div><hr />
