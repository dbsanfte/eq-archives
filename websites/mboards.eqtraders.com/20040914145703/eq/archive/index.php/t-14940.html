Don't you only need to level a chanter to lvl 8 so you can enchant clay to make these? <br />
<br />
If that is so, wouldn't this be the most viable route to 222 for non-chanters and classes that cannot imbue things?<br />
<br />
I was searching for the most viable path and happened to level a chanter to level 8 previously to enchant silver for me.<br />
<br />
After opal encrusted, then couldn't you move on to skill up on star ruby encrusted steins?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yep, those steins are a popular choice to use as skill ups.  You can also do unfired planar steins, if you can get the tainted essence, everything else is vendor bought and there is no chanting/imbueing at all.  Those go to 216.</div></div><hr />

Absolutely, except that it's level 9 for clay.  And yes, you can say it's the most viable route to &quot;solo&quot; pottery for a non-enchanter.  Many people use opal steins for this reason, and the reason that it's one of the cheapest ways to get to 222.  A few other possibilities for you exist, though, and shouldn't be ignored.  First, I assume you've reached 199 doing casseroles.  Once there, you can start on opal steins directly, or you can farm for intermediates.  My favorite intermediate is unfired planar steins.  They trivial at 216 and only require you to farm or buy tainted planar essence, which is found often on vendors and in the Bazaar.  The good part is they're cheaper per combine than opal steins.  The bad news is that they don't sell at all, unlike the opal steins.  Once you get to 222, then you can start in on star ruby steins, but you'd better have a HUGE bankroll if you're going to do this all the way to 250.  You'll fail lots of them, and you'll only sell them for a bit less than twice what you paid to make them.  For a side trip that's cheap but farm-intensive, go from 222 to 236 doing unfired crucibles of escape.  They cost about 8 pp per combine, assuming you farm your own heavy clay.<br />
<br />
In both cases, unfired planar steins and unfired crucibles, there's no need to corner an enchanter nor imbuer, so that'll avoid that particular headache.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>drtyaty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think I will definitely do the Opal Encrusted Steins to 222.  I looked into the unfired planar stines but looked last night or the night before for tainted Planar Essence both in the bazaar and through 2 dozen or so merchants in PoK and came up empty; that's the primary reason I was looking for an alternative anyway.  <br />
<br />
I like the Unfired Crucibles of Escape idea to 236, and although I am sure I can locate the answer somwhere, where does the clay that you refer to drop?<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions?  I searched the forums, although I did not see too many alternatives by others throughout all the threads here.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I do have access to a druid that can imbue for me, although it is not emeralds, so I guess it would be pebbles?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

Btw, if you're on Cazic-Thule doing the steins and just dumping them onto vendors send me a tell, the sell price from vendors is only 3pp and change, makes for an almost 8x tribute value ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, but you can get there relatively cheaply, and anyone can do it at any level, not just enchanters, a fact about which I was quite pleased.  I've been called &quot;enchanting&quot;, but apparently that's just not enough. (pout)<br />

Oh, piffle on me.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a cleric, so I'm used to level 8 being a dry desert for spells.  My apologies.<br />

<br />
Quite right.  The price for them in the Bazaar is around 20 on my server, so it's worth hocking them for tribute, but check your own server's bazaar trends to be certain.  On Morden Rasp, for example, they go for 50 to 75 pp each, so no deal there.<br />

<br />
Nope.  Nowhere else, sadly.  Take lots of empty bags, though, since you can hunt the eyes and minotaurs for cashable loot while you're hunting muddites.  And if you're able, don't forget that AE works great on the muddy boys.  Lastly, there are three spots in the zone where muddites can path into the walls and get stuck.  Two are in the tunnel to the evil eye area, and can be found if you just run up the walls until you come to spots where you stop going up.  Then listen, because if there are any in the rocks, you'll hear them walking.  If you do, sit down or drop a very weak AE to agro them, and back down to the valley floor to finish them off.<br />

I think all of us said that before we tried to master skills.  The line to pour buckets of plat into the deep, deep hole forms to the left.<br />
