Sometimes all you really want is a hug. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Then again, sometimes all you really want is a punching bag... heh. <br />

We tradeskill because we are OCD / S+M / AP / just all around insane and liking it. <br />
<br />
How exactly does sadism help with tradeskilling :eek:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Putting a handmade backpack of leather padding in a trade window then hitting cancel may be sadistic, but it wouldn't help as such.<br />
<br />
Good one though Lilosh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Some of my guildmates might consider me sadistic, as I usually deflect their requests to make items with &quot;Bring me the materials, and I will combine&quot;.<br />
<br />
Its honestly a really good deal, but I've had some give up in frustration, particularly if I fail a few combines early on.</div></div><hr />
