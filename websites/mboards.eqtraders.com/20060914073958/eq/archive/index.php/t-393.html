While I'm a brewer(a friend is a GM tailor though), I'm a beastlord...so the leather armor interests me, specifically bracers, legs, and arms.  How rare are the 'flawless tae ew hides'?  And what about the blood vials?<br />
<br />
I'm also after a few backpacks, too...if the hides are common enough, I might skill up tailoring just to sell those :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for your responses.  Or, if anyone wants to sell me the pieces, I'm on erollisi marr:)</div></div><hr />

But as a buyer, the skins seem to be rare, and the blood nonexistant, at least on Bertoxx. I've been looking for this stuff since it was on the loot tables. I have about 6 skins and no blood, even offering 10k per vial.</div></div><hr />

<br />
they are useless without blood.<br />
<br />
Blood is really really REALLY REALLY rare.<br />
<br />
No, REALLY.<br />
<br />
I camped CT a lot.  I never saw blood drop anywhere other than 4c, the temple where Terror Claw, Thulian Tae Ew Adept etc etc are.<br />
<br />
I camped that place a LOT, like several times a week 4-12 hrs a day.<br />
<br />
I got 8 or so bloods ever.  A few were given to me by friends who also camped CT.<br />
<br />
This was over a period of several months.<br />
<br />
Now that virtually no one camps that location, do not expect to see any blood.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />
