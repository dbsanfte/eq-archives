<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lenedien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I said good bye to most of you in game, but I'd like to say good bye to those I missed here:<br />
<br />
Ceggon - You were a good one and I'll miss you. ;) May your furry feet never get dirty.<br />
<br />
Oldive - Can't think how many times I had to say thank you to you. :) May your beard never be cut off.<br />
<br />
Balkin - You helped my friend which in turn helped me. You were a good person to talk to as well. :) May your beer drinking never be disrupted by needing a rez.<br />
<br />
Bye Norrath, we had some good times<br />
<br />
(sorry if I missed anyone that I didn't talk to in game)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Khaarq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You will be missed, Lenedien.  May the &quot;RNG of Real Life&quot; be in your favor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Varlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You're not allowed to quit after all the dang morning dew I've given ya. Stick around don't leave. Just take a break.<br />
<br />
Hope real life treats ya better than EQ and the RNG.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ceggon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ack Len, I'm sorry I missed catching you in game  :(  It sure was awful fun spending time with ya  :D  Take care of yourself, have fun with all the extra time you will suddenly have, and who knows.... maybe we will see you again =p<br />

It's been great knowing you. :) I hope you just take a break, instead of leaving for good. And your friend at well! I'll miss you both.<br />
