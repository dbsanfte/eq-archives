By High Level, I am considering 188+ skill, upto 250 if possible.<br />
<br />
It seems 188~194 is the killer stage as far as (ALL) tradeskills are concerned, <br />
and to avoid that range is the right way to go.<br />
<br />
I know that skill points above 188+ is really expensive, <br />
but after hearing spending 30K~40K just to raise above 200,<br />
I feel whatever the cost that GM charge would not be that bad.<br />
<br />
In short, what are the highest Smithing skill that can be purchased <br />
from the GuildMasters, and if there are several, from whom ....?<br />
<br />

<br />
P.S. Ok, more sinister plan here.<br />
Is it possible to make an ogre alt who stacks about 100 skill points and<br />
lots of money, who is turning to an Ogre Cultural Armor maker ?<br />
No Ogre Smith GM on my server now and ppls are clamouring for one ....</div></div><hr />

Make Poison is the only skill that you can actually purchase your skill all the way to 250 if you wish (and can afford it).<br />
<br />
Stanos in High Keep is where you go to train above 200 skill in Make Poison.<br />

<br />
Us Rogues concider it a tradeskill (more like tradekill..)   ;) <br />
<br />
Hmm, better yet, we call it a way of life.   :D <br />
<br />
I can verify &gt;21 increases with Poison Making though your guildmaster, I've done it before on a different server (Tholuxe Paells) to pass a low end trivial.  This was last summer, though (Summer of 2002).  I cannot verify if it still can (nerfing form a patch?), since I just put my primer in it before.<br />
<br />
I'll try it later on, maybe tonight or this weekend.</div></div><hr />

Casters can max out reasearch skill to 200 by buying points.  I did that also. ;)</div></div><hr />
