<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>data9724</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Whee, after a few weeks work (had all tradeskill at 250 already), i finally got my Aid Grimel Earring.<br />
<br />
Had 2 fails on tunic, was pretty sad by then, HATE those saps.<br />
<br />
Then 1 fail on bow, not so bad though, since guild raids had provided some spare parts in guild bank.<br />
<br />
2 fails on Bristlebanes Party Platter, but not bad, got plenty of stuff for that one.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the stupid saps, i started really unlucky, then the saps just started rolling in.<br />
First try i got 1 in a group, a guildie gave me 1, and borrowed 1 from a guildie, then failed tunic.<br />
Then started counting spiders, got next sap after 24 spiders. Next one after 1 drop.<br />
Next again after 3 drops. <br />
Whee, im happy, went and failed tunic again.<br />
<br />
Then 1 more drop after 1 more spider. Then 7 spiders with no luck.<br />
Then bought 2 saps in bazaar on a mule to get ready for 1 more try, frustrated over the spiders. Then log my druid in, parked in Field2 in fire, and the area is CRAWLING with spiders, usually have to kill PHs to get them to spawn. So decide to clear the area.<br />
Whee, a sap after 2 kills.<br />
Wham, another sap after 2 kills more, got 5 now. Then after 8 more kills, on last spider, i get 1 more sap.<br />
<br />
Then go and make the tunic in 3rd try, give my spare sap to the guildie i borrowed 1 from, and put the 2 i bought back on my vendor to get rid of them again :).<br />
<br />
<br />
So dont give up on saps, suddently its gonna roll in with saps.</div></div><hr />
