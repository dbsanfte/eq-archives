<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quaz</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a Almost Naked lvl 49 DE Cleric Smith I had from before the trivial changes, that has a skill of 132.  Now with this cultural armor i would like to get back into smithing. <br />
<br />
Option #1<br />
<br />
Continue smithing with him.<br />
<br />
His wisdom is only at 180 some so i would have to get some gear for him to help on the skill-up.<br />
<br />
Option #2<br />
<br />
Start from scratch with my Main. ( Lvl 61 Necro).<br />
<br />
Necro has Int of 242 and can swap out resist gear to boost it more.<br />
<br />
<br />
I figure its easier to farm stuff with my necro but from what i have read<br />
skilling up aint what it used to be. And i'd hate to equip my Cleric up since i am looking to put him in Dark Regeant once I can Make it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Both Innoruuk Followers so it dont matter on which guy i use<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Input appreciated</div></div><hr />

Getting to 132 is trivial, so don't think of that as an advantage.. or is it that they're both DE? I guess at least the necro saves you the need to improve gear for a good tradeskill stat.</div></div><hr />

I bought 14 stack of chunk of condensed _____ in bazaar for about 1-5pp per piece (not stack) and made arrow heads till 116. Since i have an alt warrior with a 190+ fletching, i'm keeping them all so he can work on his fletching (since the arrowheads triv att 250+)<br />
of course you could sell them and recoup your cost. <br />
<br />
so if ya got the plat, upping your mains smithing would cost ya about 1k or less. (chunk of condensed _____, flask of water, file)</div></div><hr />
