Have a GM hammer.<br />

This stinks!<br />

Just wanted to vent, I know it is RNG, but if anyone has heard of a bug drop me a line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Unnone</div><div class="date">01-04-2003, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like a bad encounter with the rng.  BP rate is perfectly in line - I quote people 40 percent success.  Bracers are out of whack, but sometimes the forge gets hungry.  Have you remembered to abuse the forge before you press the combine button?  I swear to GOD that I have to beat up the forge before I press combine, or I get a lousy success rate.</div></div><hr />

On the other hand, I went 1/2 with breastplates, 1/1 with greaves (Though, I was supposed to have made another breastplate).  I also went 0/2 attempts with Dark Prince Soverign Bracelets, and 0/2 on Night Terror Chain Bracelets, all at a 250 raw skill.</div></div><hr />
