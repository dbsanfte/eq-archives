<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bouba Lourson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, <br />
I just want to know if someone use foraging machette and notice a change on rare foraging like misty acorn or Yew leaf?<br />
<br />
If some don t know this item, check this:Foraging machette (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7936) <br />
<br />
I use it, but i can t realy test it cause i haven t enough play time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Elerian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I din't notice any increase rate ... (200 foraging)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In my experience, it increases your chance of foraging something (decreased chance of failure), but has no effect on increasing your chance of foraging a rare item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samoht</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That sucks.<br />
I was thinking of asking the same thing about foraging in PoG for the branches.  Back to reading a book and spammig that button I guess.</div></div><hr />

Based on that, the machette is best for a non druid or ranger, as our forage caps at 200, and the only times I don't get something when I forage at 200, is if it's a Lore item, and I've already got one (admitedly rare, but it happens).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I parsed it a while back.  No difference.  The ratio between the different foraged items remains the same at foraging 200 w/ or w/o the machette.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did this quest when Lucan first came out, I gave it a try and found no difference in the chances of foraging a particular item. As was mention it would appear it simply increases your success rate to forage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">An additional note on the Foraging Machette...<br />
<br />
If you have stopped using your machette, you can turn it in for 1,219 Tribute points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For this quest I still need the Vine from MONS zone and the Red Sand thing from Scarlet Desert. Any idea how long this will take to Forage with a Forage skill of 105?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dalur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It varies greatly.  My friend did the quest and he said it too him like 2 hours to get one of the parts (can't remember off the top of my head which one), and when I went to do it, it took me like 3 forages to get it.<br />
<br />
All in all, I would expect within 4 to 5 hours you should be able to get all the parts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mileron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually, the foraging machete is basically worthless for a Bard, whose forage skills cap at 55.  <br />
<br />
61ish forage doesn't make a whole lot of difference :(</div></div><hr />
