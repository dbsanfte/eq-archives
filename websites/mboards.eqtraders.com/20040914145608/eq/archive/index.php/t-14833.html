<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lokase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
I am almost to the point where I can buy my Lodizal Section and complete the quest with the Othmir's for the sheild.<br />
<br />
Once that is done I am thinking about turning around and trashing my faction with them to farm Othmir Fur.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any info on drop rates from the Othmirs? # every hour?<br />
<br />
Other than the sheild I don't beleive I will need the Othmir's faction for anything - I have given up on trying to attain the Prexus Totem from them.<br />
<br />
Any information or tactics on these guys is very much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Furs are not a very common drop.  If you do decide to kill them for furs, note that you can kill ulthorks in EW to get your faction back up with otters afterwards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you think that the Acrylia route is a better path to take?  In two weeks of harassing the Rockhoppers I have about 1 stack of the Flawless.  I have one stack of the Wyrven Hides - should I try to continue the Wyrven path? or a mix of both?<br />
<br />
I really only want to get my tailoring to 200 as it is the last tradeskill I need to max to get to 1450 club.  Only 12 more ticks to go as I got one tick today using the Superb Hide recipe.<br />
<br />
Thank you for any suggestions you may have.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Carmaris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think it's best to go with whatever's available.  I'm currently working on tailoring (only 187 atm...but had 100 solstice robe combines yield 0 skill ups the other night :/).  I've been farming/buying supplies for a few weeks now...I can farm about 1 stack of othmir furs in 3 - 4 hours, that's only 10 attempts.  I haven't tried farming the flawless rockhopper hides myself, but I see them rarely enough in the bazaar that I'm led to believe that they're about the same rarity as othmir furs.  Haven't hunted wyverns yet and probably won't--cash/tribute turn ins/exp is better on othmirs from what I remember of farming wyverns for their stingers back in the day.  But I'm not seeing many hides for sale either.<br />
<br />
Friend of mine told me a few weeks back to forget farming tailoring items myself, to farm plat and buy what I need instead...but it's a seller's market and I don't make plat all that fast under the best circumstances :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KanadWinterstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Othmirs for me drop on average 7-9 furs an hour, clearing solo with a 65 ranger in EP gear. It takes approximately 5 hours of farming time per 20 cap combines (40 furs).<br />
<br />
It really does vary wildly though, I'll go an hour getting two or three then get 11 in the next hour. All in all, othmir fur is still the easiest progression method with farming but it is far from rewarding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Variety is the only way to go with high level tailoring.  Otherwise you go insane.  Wait, you go insane anyway.  Man I hate tailoring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lokase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks again for the suggestions :).<br />
<br />
I think I have narrowed my tailoring down to two recipes:<br />
<br />
- Arcrylia Reinforced Mask<br />
- Mithril Reinforced Leather Mask<br />
<br />
These are the two recipes that I will effectivly be able to farm for and to buy components from the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Any other high level tailoring components I find will be sold in the bazaar - take that pp - dump back into tailoring.<br />
<br />
If I can get my hands on Lodizal and turn in the section of shell I will take a look at the Othmirs as well.<br />
<br />
As of last night I have 10 ticks to go - hopefully it won't take 3 months to max out tailoring (like it did to get my last 10 ticks in smithing) :).<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
