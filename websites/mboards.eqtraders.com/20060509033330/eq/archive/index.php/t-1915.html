<br />
Prices on application and dependent on how many ingrediants you can supply. I am just starting making these armours and this is my main so I am not a millionaire  :roll:  The implication from this is that I have many fails and a limited inventory. This means I need notice to make items. <br />
<br />
However you will find I am cheaper than the normal price for the various peices. If you want it NOW I suggest you visit Zopharrs Trader, Crimson Dwarf in the Bazaar, he is also capable of doing large orders fast.<br />
<br />
So I am slower and on mostly off peak, but I am cheaper  :D <br />
<br />
I often advertise on the auction chat channel.<br />
<br />
I have currently have spent a week gathering the ingrediants for an order for Underfoot BP and Geaves. Most of this time has been spent farming and raising cash for ingrediants.<br />
<br />
Anyway, give me a tell in game or leave a message here please if you have enquiries or wish to place an order. I will not get into a price war on this board so please leave your &quot;in game&quot; name so I can send you a tell.</div></div><hr />
