<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>greebmushroome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, a friend asked me to make him a BP for his warrior alt (currently lvl 40 but levelling fast).  I looked up Night Terror, Hurricane and Tae Ew Plate BPs.  None were great warrior stats, we thought (no STR and so-so HPs).<br />
<br />
Are there any good, smithed warrior BPs?   He might have to look to cultural armor (I'm a high elf, and I can't find him to ask the race of his war).<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

<br />
Check out the Fierce Heraldic Armor for followers of Rallos Zek. You can't make it, but if you can make HIE cultural, you may be able to work up the cash to buy it.<br />
<br />
I still have a few pieces myself that you can see in my Magelo, below.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But either a Cultural or Non-Tradeskill Armor would be the way to go.</div></div><hr />
