<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shamata Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, <br />
<br />
I know of three (3) players on Rodcet Nife who have a research skill of 200 or better and use a 5 % mod device as well. I do not want to name them here without their permission. However I do have a few questions for them or anyone that has a 200 or better research skill.<br />
<br />
Have any of you done any successful combines of Druid spells?<br />
<br />
What type of trivials and success rates are you seeing?<br />
<br />
How do I go about arranging for combines of spell combines I have in game without being a nuisance?<br />
<br />
What would the charge be for someone to do a single combine and or multiple combines?<br />
<br />
Well any help and response will be greatly appreciated. I am including my e-mail address below for those of you on RN that might want to help out but not make a public announcement of it.<br />
<br />
Regards and thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Veldin Darkfire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Currently I have a 199 and the geerlock.  I have combined some shaman spells and either a druid or cleric...can't remember offhand.<br />
<br />
Trivials for the spells that are below 58 seem to be roughly around 185-190ish. The 60 spells I don't think are triv at 200.<br />
<br />
Research does not go above 200.<br />
<br />
Not really sure what I would charge for combines seeing as the ones I have done have been for friends and I don't charge friends. If you brought me a component I needed for one of my spells I would do combines for free...heck catch me in the right mood and I'd do them for free anyway.<br />
<br />
What do You think is fair for making one of your spells?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shamata Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey Veldin,<br />
<br />
Well I suppose what people are willing to pay and or charge is really a function of a lot of different factors. Do they have any pp to speak of, either party. Are the spells for them or friends or guildmates or are they selling them etc etc. Does the combiner have the time or the interest. My situation is as follows<br />
<br />
I have 7 combines so I would be willing to pay around 100 pp for the service success or failure. I would provide all the components including quill and parchments. Then out of the 7 combines I would add an additional 50 pp per sucessful combine. <br />
<br />
Something along those lines I guess. I do not know if this is adequate or over kill or what as I always do combines for free when people have the components, heck I have also provided the components for free before lol lol, But I am doing ok for pp and would not want to impose on a player that could really use the pp.<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Veldin Darkfire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh well we can all use the plat at times :).  I would be happy to do combines for you for whatever :).<br />
<br />
Was curious what you thought was fair seeing as I have yet to price this as a service. I did a ton of combines of swatches for Zabu and he gave me a ton of dyes for robes. Worked well becaues he can't research and I can't forage :)<br />
