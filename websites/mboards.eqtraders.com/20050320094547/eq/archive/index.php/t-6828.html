<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guillemot</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a proposal.  I like to keep stats of things and know how well or bad I'm doing with things, if for nothing more than personal interest.  One of the things that drives me crazy is the vague success/fail messages.<br />
<br />
You have fashioned the items together to create something new!<br />
You lacked the skills to create the item.<br />
<br />
Loosely quoted as I'm not at a machine that I can see those messages ;)  Anyways, I propose that they add what item we created/failed to create to the messages.  Something along the lines of:<br />
<br />
You have fashioned the items together to create: Item Name Here.<br />
You lacked the skills to create: Item Name Here.<br />
<br />
Now, I also thought of a reason SoE might not want to implement such a thing, since you'll be able to see what you're trying to make without actually having made one.  However, this has always been possible if you were grouped with someone because you could see what they made/failed.  I don't really see any problems with adding anything like this, but I figure they'll listen to an entire tradeskilling community a little more than they will listen to one gnome with an idea.  So I thought I'd make a post here, get some feedback and send my idea to sony :)<br />
<br />
Just click yes, reply saying &quot;yea, this is a great idea&quot; and send a link to eqmail@soe.sony.com :)<br />

Like having a skill level of 200 and doing an item with a trivial of 50, and on failing to create it getting that message. The should just say something like : The RNG strikes again, Ha Ha ha!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You did not succeed at fashioning: Item Name Here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For failure of making trivial items &quot;You failed to create that item&quot;<br />
For failure of making nontrivial items &quot;You lacked the skills to create that item&quot;<br />
<br />
That way we'd know if something was trivial even if we fail =)</div></div><hr />
