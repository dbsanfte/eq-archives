<br />
The mere fact that Dwarves don't have an INT caster among our many fine, fine examples of Norrathians should not be held against us!  And yet when it comes to tailoring, this small deficit in an otherwise awe-inspiring race seems to have been exploited into a very egregious pun:  we ain't smrt enuf fer to do da robz.<br />
<br />
Bear with me, all ye mighty needle wielders, as I implore to you to enchant me with appropriate paths or areas I may explore that will take my basic suit-making skill (187), whip me into a Martha Stewart frenzy, cutting and sewing and brewing and doilying right up to the point where the name Baldaek is synonymous with Armani, Donna Karan, and Joan Rivers!<br />
<br />
Please, do tell...<br />

Robes didn't exist before loy, but gm tailors did.. so whil it might be a touch more challenging, it can be done.<br />

Look over the top 3-4 pages here in taiklroing, and you'll have more info than someone as short as a dorf can process.. without imbididing more booz... er.. brain lubricant.</div></div><hr />

Oh well, at least the new UI means tradeskills are now a break from clicking :-D Guess you'll be  farming rockhopper, panther, drake and wyvern hides, same as me :)<br />

<br />
But seriously, you can indeed make robes.  And armor.  All sorts of paths are open to you, so don't fret not being able to make robes for the bookworm types.  Your best bet, having broken 187, is to take up the tailor-driven extermination of the rockhopper menace that plagues Luclin (there's a cave in the Dawnshroud Peaks that's nigh infested with them).  Failing that, and assuming you have access to a Tunare worshipping cleric or druid, you can make ceremonial Solstice robes.  Both are fine choices for someone with your sturdy fingers and the hides and blessed Tunare silk have a high tolerance for drunken dwarves spilling ale on the materials.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />
