<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ringo</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm about to go whole hog into a trade skill mostly because I have a decent bank and tailoring while fun is too time consuming.  Even with enough money getting the components for skilling up past 200 is becoming a problem on my server.  So given that info.    I play an Iksar warrior.  I am willing to make a toon just for skilling up the trade skill I go with.  That said I am trying to find the best race for making a high end smithed armor that my iksar warrior can use.  I've looked through the listed smithed armor stats, and I hope I'm wrong but it looks like the best smithed stuff that Iksar can wear is Skyiron armor.  I am hoping that I missed something somewhere such as they can use some other form of smithed armor.  Any info or help here is appreciated.<br />
Thanks for all your help<br />

Its been well established that Iksars got the figurative shaft on players smithed items.  There may be some of the new PoP items which are okay for an Iksar, but they're not widely available yet.  You might try the PoP recipes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The stuff from the Plane of Storms looks well-suited for a ShadowKnight.<br />
<br />
You can also wear the CT 2.0 armours... assuming you can stand hunting for the still all-to-rare drops.</div></div><hr />
