<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Elandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi everybody.<br />
<br />
I am a long time lurker, first time poster!  I have used many of the guides from this site, advice and shared silently in your rants!!<br />
<br />
I just wanted to say yay!!!  250 baking!!!  And Trophie on the first attempt!!!!!<br />
<br />
I skilled up originally for the Shawl Quest (which I am the proud owner of) and after the quest I swore of TS forever.  Then I decided to get baking up, as I was sick of summoning black bread.  So Pally melts to 190 and then tried to farm Griffon &amp; Anaconda meat.  I ended up with a total of about 2 stacks and alot of frustration.  <br />
<br />
So I went on to the infamous MTP.  I made bucket loads.  I was slowly skilling up, as I would only do combines once a week.  Then this weekend I just sat there and made the picnics til I got 250!!!  <br />
<br />
So thank you for all the advice, even those who don't post walk away with the knowledge!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go ahead and buy (if you can) the parts to make a few Party Platters.<br />
<br />
I personally had a 60% success rate on them, and I think it was well worth it!</div></div><hr />
