<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zeek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Aiite I have a few questions .. <br />
<br />
1. How much would it be to get Alchemy to 250?<br />
2. Can all the things be bought in PoK or Bazaar?<br />
3. What is the complete gain from Alchemy?<br />
<br />
I know these questions have most likly being asked over and over again.. But me and my friends have just desided to go into Tradeskilling and im looking at the Aid Grimel quest and seeing that i need to get all the basic Tradeskills up i mite as well get Alchemy up as well .. I looked thru all the stuff about Alchemy and still didnt really understand it .. If someone could point me to a Alchemy for Dumbes or just a basic step by step from what skill to what skill i should be doin combines that would be great :cool:  <br />
<br />
Thank you for your time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'll tackle some of your questions; <br />
<br />
1.  A lot.  Alchemy doesn't reach all the way to 250 skill as it is level-capped.  You can earn 5 skill points per level, start at level 24.  That means that at level 65, you can reach the skill rank of 200.  Alchemy is not a cheap skill, so expect to use up a great deal of coin in raising it. <br />
<br />
2. Most of the things you need to make potions can be purchased from Alchemy vendors.  The complete list (http://www.eqtraders.com/sources/source_trade_page.php?st=Alchemy&amp;menustr=110020000000) is too long to post here, so I just linked it for you. <br />
<br />
3. Alchemy allows you to have potions to fill gaps in your abilities, buff yourself, and do other things you couldn't without the potions.  The benefits take a little imagination to see, but are certainly there.   Blood of the Wolf potions grant SoW. There are potions to add to your resists, potions to add to your stats, potions to transport you, and even potions to do snare.  <br />
<br />
If you're going to do Alchemy, take it slowly, work on it bit by bit, and it will be smooth sailing.  It is both expensive and frustrating to try to do it quickly.</div></div><hr />
