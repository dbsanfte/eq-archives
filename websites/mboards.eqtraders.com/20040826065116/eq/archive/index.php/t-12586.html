I have spent APPROX. 17 hours raising my BREWING skill to 212. That's it. I have had runs where I didn't get ONE skillup for over 300 combines.<br />
<br />
Now, I was just chating with a friend at work when I thought...<br />
&quot;Dude, all my components are STORE bought, and cheap for my skillups.......what if I were doing tinkering?&quot;<br />
<br />
My question to you guys is this. As I'd like to GM every tradeskill, how do you guys do it? I mean..... Not only for the cost per skillup but the fact that you need to farm as well. I guess this is one of those trades you just can't PL through.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kritta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here's what I did:<br />
<br />
- Flameless Lanterns to skill 68, average 2pp an attempt<br />
- Spyglasses to skill 95, average 23pp an attempt <br />
- Stalking Probes to skill 102, average 16pp an attempt <br />
- Powered Gloves to skill 122, average 45pp an attempt <br />
- Catapult to skill 135, average 55pp an attempt <br />
- Aqualungs to skill 148, average 210pp an attempt. <br />
- Rebreathers to skill 172 ... (thank goodness Luclin stepped in at this point) <br />
- Geerlok Planing Tool to skill 192, average 26pp an attempt (Need Belt of Leathery Fungus Flesh from Paludal Caverns) <br />
- Collapsed Toolbox to skill 242, average 4pp an attempt (Need Coiled Spring from PoI) <br />
- Anizok's Gauze Press to skill 250, average 154pp an attempt (Need supplies from PoI) <br />
<br />
Alot of tedious farming, but that's just part of the deal. For me GM in tinkering was a self pride thing and that's what kept me going. Although when I was skilling up on rebreathers (~1k a pop) it hurt, big time. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
But how long did it take you? I can't imagine going through what I am now with brewing in Tinkering. I'd be poor. And my hands would fall off.<br />
<br />
Do you notice faster skillups when doing Tinkering as apposed to Brewing? Meaning, because brewing has everthing to level store bought, the programmers made that one harder by limiting the amount of skillups?<br />
<br />
Cause getting my Baking to 200 didn't take NEARLY as long as it took me to get brewing to 200.<br />
<br />
Cheers!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cerpicio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">First question Stabi, you are a gnome right?  Only gnomes can tinker.  You probably knew this but I just wanted to make sure.<br />
<br />
As for skilling-up past 200, I used the geerlok devices they added in LoY.  You need to farm things on the shore in Gunthak, but that isn't too hard if you are 40+.  You can often find things on the vendors there, too.<br />
