<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xaanru</div><div class="date">12-30-2002, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My main chars are on another server, but I have a monk here I like to play on occasion. I'm hoping to upgrade his equipment, and am willing to farm spider/spiderling silks for the following prices:<br />
<br />
Spiderling silks - 50pp per stack<br />
Silk threads - 105pp per stack, saves me space, saves you time :)<br />
Spider silks - 100pp per stack<br />
Silk Swatches - 205pp per stack<br />
<br />
Post here if you want some, and I can deliver any reasonable quantity at this price within 2-3 days.<br />
<br />
I'm basing my prices on what I think is pretty cheap, compared to what I have seen in the bazaar lately. However, I have been out of town for a week, so if things have changed drastically, I'll post an update, after I arrive home Jan 2.<br />
<br />
Btw, my monk's name is Carrpe.</div></div><hr />

Must have been a good price, because it all sold while I ate dinner.<br />
<br />
If you need silks or pelts, let me know, still farming my way up to better gear, and exping on spiders and fur bearers in the karanas.</div></div><hr />
