<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TraderJoe1998</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was told that to do fletching i should get my DEX stat up to 255 so the skill up points come more often.  I know that for other trade skills i used INT or WIS at 255 for quick skill ups.<br />
<br />
I'm not so sure DEX will help with fletching.  My warrior has low INT and WIS, but high DEX and STR.  It would be really hard to get 255 INT or WIS on my warrior.  I can have 255 DEX or STR easily.   I noticed that the Grandmaster Fletcher's Knife has 10 STR, 10 INT, 10 WIS, and no DEX at all.  Therefore, i would conclude that possibly 255 STR may be used instead of INT or WIS, but 255 DEX is an unlikely factor.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if STR (or DEX) can be used to skill up quick in fletching?<br />
<br />
Also, i read some posts where people raise both INT and WIS.  In my experience, if you raise INT to your max, then you can ignore WIS.  I think you only need one high stat, and then raising the others is irrelevant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the gm fletchers knife is the general main tradeskill trophy.  the same as pottery, baking, brewing, smithing, jelewry, tailoring.  it has all those stats to fit with all classes.  the rouge and shaman ones are special.  i think the tinkering one is different as well.  <br />
<br />
str is a no go.  it only works for smithing.<br />
<br />
dex should work but still there are hell levels of sometimes 300+ combines between skillups.  rangers get dex and not as much wis and almost no int.  they are focused on bow use.  soe made it use dex so they could skill and not get the shaft.  warriors can smith with str for similar reasons.  plus it even makes rp sense.<br />
<br />
again dex should work.  str should not.  th rng is weird and will trick and abuse you.</div></div><hr />

For fletching: raise dex, int, or wis. You only need one of them to be high.</div></div><hr />
