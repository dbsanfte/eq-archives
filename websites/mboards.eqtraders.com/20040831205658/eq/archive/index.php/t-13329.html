<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xiff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone gotten a pair of the pickbringer chain gloves to try the Fire Bolt recipe yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Labios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I heard they are on a vendor is Shadow Haven, I can't verify that however, as I haven't checked myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Libbie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They are indeed.  Head to the Stout side of Shadowhaven (where all the right-sized folk are).   You'll want to head into the area where there's a giant meeting circle.  As you pass the Lost Turnip bar, hang a right and go into the building with the two smiths.  I think it's the female dwarf that sells the Pickbringers Armor.<br />
<br />
To be even more specific, it's #33 on the EQAtlas map of Shadowhaven.  Even says it right there: &quot;Deepcarver Plate and Pickbringers Chain armor&quot;<br />
<br />
If I recall correctly, the gloves cost around 40pp-ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tom Gardengnome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">31pp'ish for the good looking gnomes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Silverphoenix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Combines today (skill 96) and was trivial.  Side note, GoD tradeskill window gives trivial at 68.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mavick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That trivial was lowered by about 100 from the pre-GoD original of about 196.   I guess they didn't like a store-bought method of getting that high.<br />
<br />
Mavick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Libbie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nope, guess not.  Well, quite a few people in this forum will be really really happy about that.<br />
<br />
Me? I'm just really happy I did it while it was still 195.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>zanfugal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yep, I'm upset, just bought all the things for 40 combines of flame bolt and it said the new trival. Lost a bit of cash on that one....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Maddoc stopped by the boards briefly, in another forum, and I asked if the reduction by 100 was intentional.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Maddoc, the King of Tradeskills said: <br />
Flame Bolt did have it's trivial reduced, it was just a little too easy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wonder if the flame bolt fits in the catapult somehow...</div></div><hr />
