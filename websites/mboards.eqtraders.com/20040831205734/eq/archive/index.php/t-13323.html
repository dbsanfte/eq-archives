<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am just starting Fishing and I have about 60 points available for Training with my Guild Master.<br />
At what point in Fishing should I use these Training Points?<br />
If I make it to 180 skill, could I use the 20 points in Training to become a 200 skill?<br />
What is the most amount of Points I am able to put into a Trade Skill from my Guild Master?<br />
Is there a point when skill levels slow in Fishing, so should I wait till then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">only the first 21 points are buyable.  from 0-21.  <br />
its very sad to use points on fishing as it is the easiest skill ever.  :D<br />
fishing skillups slow down around the time all skillups do.  160+.  <br />
good luck and i don't recommend using points on fishing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cerpicio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I thought you could train fishing up to 200.  I know you can train Spell Reseach to 200, I just topped mine off.<br />
<br />
My fishing is up to 200, and I'm pretty sure I trained it somewhere in the 100s.  I got the last few points the hard way though.<br />
<br />
Of course, the higher your skill when you train, the more it will cost you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">:eek: i might be wrong then.  huh.  i didn't think so.  its still not really worth training.  fishing is the cheapest per combine skill in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cubwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you can train fishing to 200 at your guildmaster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was just told that you can Buy more than 20 Training Points from your Guild Master.<br />
If you had the Plat and wanted to do it the easy way......could you actually use 100 Training Points in Fishing from your Guild Master?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, you can use as many points as you have available to train fishing, of course, the higher you get, the more each point costs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Taushar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I spent the points on my last 10 points of fishing going from 190 to 200. It saved me hours of fishing and was well worth it. Is there a difference between 190 and 200 in fishing as far as rare catch and making fishing poles? Not really but I do notice a slight difference and that's good enough reason to spend the money to get it up to 200.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm level 50, with a Fishing skill of 170. During all that time, I think I've spent around 20 points on Fishing - and only 2 of those were spent when I first got started.<br />
<br />
My advice is to spend the skill points if you can spare them, but don't bother doing fishing lures for skill-ups. They're not worth it, since they're used up just like bait. You're better off either selling the spiderling silks used to make the thread, or training Tailoring enough to make Leather Padding and using the silks for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Davina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My fishing is currently at 196 (fishing as I post this *lol*) and I didn't spend any points in it. It took a long time to get it up, but I think it's somewhat enjoyable and relaxing. I worked on it when I wanted to chat with friends but didn't feel like doing much else. Good luck. :)</div></div><hr />
