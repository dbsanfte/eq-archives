<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xorithra L`Amante</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello!<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if this is the right place to say this, but I want to try and give something useful to a community that has nurtured many of my characters =)<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how many others out there have corresponding situations, but I have several caster characters that have pretty high research.  I two box with my boyfriend, who also two boxes, I with my enchanter and cleric, he with his shadowknight and rogue.  Therefore, I keep all the loot, including research components.<br />
<br />
Well, I found it a pain to try and figure out what spells I could make, so I created a spreadsheet that tells me.  You keep an inventory tally (not so much a tally as just a rollcall.  Didn't care to add the AMOUNT of spells you can make, though that would be a pretty simple addition.  Hrm, maybe I'll do that.) in one sheet, and another tells you which spells you can make (indicated with a YES).  I'm not sure if this would be useful for others, but if it is, I'd be happy to hand a blank spreadsheet to Our DenMother to make available to our fellow artisans.  I couldn't find a section on the site that is devoted to this, hence I'm posting here.<br />
<br />
Thank you for everything!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xorithra L`Amante</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">read this earlier tonight and considered it a boot to the behind on finishing the spreadsheet (added the amount field so people know how many spells with their resource).  im a bit of a procrastinator.<br />
<br />

<br />
