<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tcrazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys I just became a master (101) at Pottery and would like to know what I can make at this lvl to make some money? I have looked in the recipes area but I could not find anything that I think would make money. If anyone could help I could use it. :angel:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd answer your question, but I don't like your sig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aruzdail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's been a while, but I don't remember much of anything that you can money at in pottery at (101). :(   Or nothing that you can't get better or more easily by killing mob_01.<br />

<br />
He's just hunting Dogs.....I assure you that he's just striking one in retaliation for the unjustified persecution of cats by dogs in the past!  They've had enough! :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zephaus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, you might make some money when you can make small wisdom deities and (non-golden) Idols of X, but I doubt it, with all the wisdom gear on the market these days.  You'll need to be able to make Golden Idols or Faith/Spirit/Soulstones before you can make any money, and even then it won't be what it used to be.  :boggled: <br />
<br />
Your best bet is to get GM, and hope that they add a a lot of new recipes in the next expansion :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sadonumspa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aruzdail hit the nail right on the head. There is no real recipe at 101 or really up to 250ish that can be profitable any more.  <br />
<br />
Sorry to say.  Skilling up has flooded the market of all the &quot;lower&quot; level items so the only &quot;real&quot; profit makers are the 250+ recipes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fyste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/agree Zep and 	Sadonumspa<br />
<br />
Pottery's just not profitable until you can make the pieces for Solstice Earring kits. Once you can make the Ruby stiens you'll make a small profit. When you can make the Golden Idols, you'll make a little more. I'd advise at that point finding a REALLY good friend that's a Tunare worshiping healer to imbue a mess of gems for you.  Then find someone that's reselling them for a guild ( or guilds ) and make them en-masse. <br />
<br />
For now, Poison Vials trivial around 148 and if you gather skins yourself they're really cheap. You might make a couple pp selling them in the bazaar... but it will be slooooow profit. <br />
<br />
Beyond that, Pottery's just a cash-sink at this point :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cragzop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did poison vials as my skillup path and made some small profit on them. For skins I used zombie, they were an easy farm in SK at the undead temple.<br />
<br />
I'd not suggest animal skins for the vials, you can make more money using those for padding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not true.  I did almost all my vials with animal skins.  Folks tend to forget that Black Wolf and Puma work for vials.  And since they CANNOT be used for padding, it works out very well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i think the kitty is aiming for somebodies parakeet.  still a bit small to fight fair.  interesting sig though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gareen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Poison vials no longer are worth anything (or very, very little) for profiting.  NPC Merchants now sell all poison vials (including sealed, etc., vials) for a little over a gold piece each.  They used to sell them for a plat and a half (for regular poison vials).  Nobody buys them in bazaar anymore for a plat each.<br />
<br />
That said, I check merchants aorund the deserts of Ro for sand of ro and make small wisdom deities that sell for 30-50 plat in the bazaar--a 25-45 plat profit each.  Not fast sellers, and not much absolute profit, but a good relative profit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cragzop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You are correct Slippy - I was referring to the ones that can be used for padding and not the others</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>darksisco007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">heh, there always was the rare spawn merchant in wfp that sold vials, but not many knew about him</div></div><hr />
