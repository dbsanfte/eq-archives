I'm trying to make my level 24 Mage water pet spell.  I have all of the said ingredients, but I can't seem to create the level 20 spell, which is needed for the combine (I don't want to go to OoT).  I put my Spell: Minor Summoning: Water (level 16 water pet), Ice of Velious, and Words of Domination all into my Elemental Grimoire, and when I clicked combine, I got the message saying that it wasn't a recipe etc.  I asked a 65 Mage on my server and he said research was pretty worthless cause you can find all the spells in PoK now.  So I looked around in the library for my pet spells, but I only came up with the 24 Earth one.  I even went all the way to Katta looking for them but couldn't find them.  Then I checked Freeport and Ak'Anon, but my search turned up fruitless.  Anyways, I'm rambling now, but I'm just really frustrated and confused atm.  I want my new pet spells, but I can't research it for some reason and I can't find it on a vendor...and I checked the Bazaar.  I'm sure it's something very blatant that I'm overlooking, but it would be great if someone could point that out for me, thanks!</div></div><hr />

Put the above 3 items in your book and hit combine. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Once you have 2 copies (one to scribe and a spare), put one copy of the spell + words of domination in your book, &amp; hit combine, to get Spell: Lesser Summoning Water (lvl 20) (assuming no failure.)<br />

This is the part I'm stuck on, I have the level 16 spell.  I'm putting the spell, Ice of Velious, and Words of Domination into Elemental Grimoire but it won't let me do the combine. :o</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is listed as requiring Words of Domination in the creating of the level 20 water pet spell should actually be Words of Dominion!</div></div><hr />
