<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rissenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So there I am..my happy new cleric on another server.<br />
<br />
So I decide to do some smithing for fun to see if there is any noticable differance between INT and WIS skill-ups. Just for fun, mind you, just for fun...<br />
<br />
*SMACK* 76 smithing...<br />
<br />
Then I help on a 8th shawl run. And realise that the 8th shawl would be really cool to have on a cleric. And I found the kromrif royal blood on a trader for 50pp a little while back anyways.<br />
<br />
But I overcome my urge! I decide that NO, there shall be no tradeskill hell again.<br />
<br />
Then I notice how fast Iron Rations seem to be consumed..and I think to myself that my Fish rolls usually last a bit longer. Hmm..maybe learn some Baking..just so I can make fish rolls myself.<br />
<br />
Run and buy stacks of fish and bat wings, go to the oven...and combine, combine, combine. I realise that with the new tradeskill system, it is going real fast and easy. OH, 135 already?? Hmm..wait..I am about to make the baking for the shawl quest..might as well get some cheese for Patty melts to practice..<br />
<br />
*SMACK* 191 baking...<br />
<br />
<br />
HELP!!! I am yet again a tradeskiller!! I have already saved some tae ew blood vials for when I get to 250 smithing. *Sigh*<br />
<br />
Where is the Tradeskiller's Anonomous when you need them...my poor cleric needs therapy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hmmmm, you got me thinking now... 8th shawl would look good on my cleric.<br />
<br />
NO NO NO.... aaargh!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have 8th shawl, im at 1743 (7 tailoring points to go) . My shaman also has the 8th shawl. My GF's beasty has a lot of my old WIS gear and has all skills over 100 as well... and will probably be working on the shawl soon....<br />

Hi. My name is Splunge. (Hello Splunge). I am a Tradeskillaholic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Rissenn, I have the same problem! Every alt I make takes up tradeskilling as soon as I let them loose.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Same boat here...I finished my Cleric's 8th shawl back in January and have been playing my Enchanter and Necromancer on and off...and considering when I should start their shawls...<br />
<br />
Starting shawls on TWO characters at once! /sigh<br />
<br />
/em signs up for the Tradeskillers self-help group...making a note to bring collapsible containers to share</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Only way I've escaped the Tradeskill bug on (most) of my alts is to convince myself &quot;This isn't a real character - I'll probably just delete him anyhow.  So no need to invest that time that's just going to be lost&quot; despite the fact that I've never deleted a character (on any server other than Test) that's lvl 2+ ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's very had to avoid, even for people who &quot;hate&quot; tradeskills.<br />
<br />
I started my druid, I got tired of all the silk he acquired, so he made swatches for my main who was making Wu's at the time.<br />
<br />
Instant level of 15.<br />
<br />
He made patchwork armor, even did a little baking.<br />
<br />
Resistance is futile<br />
<br />
My chanter, same thing with the silks.  Wait, she could use some low end JC items, skill went up to 20 making a few enchanted silver items.  Noooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Resistance is futile<br />
<br />
Every toon I make I have this uncontrollable urge to at least buy a sewing kit, and I also try to do the newbie armor quests.  All that together gets your TS up.<br />
<br />
Resistance is futile<br />
<br />
After that, I just said the heck with it and let my toons devolop the way I want them to, if they end up making TS items in the long run, so be it.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Resistance is futile</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sadly, I am a victim of this as well.  For the longest time, it was lore in my guild that I was the only guildie without alts.  I ran myself into the wall trying to store goods for all seven tradeskills, and arbitrage, and guildmate-goodie-making storage, so I built an alt, for gear storage and for Bazaar selling.  On a lark, I decided to level my Bazaar trader up using only quests, and I made him a foraging class so I can get foraged goods for my main (just the basics like veggies and fruit).  Well, after spending a few late nights AEing Crushbone and buying every bone chip I see, he's level 18 without ever having fought anything at all.  And I figured, since he shops for me, why not get a sewing kit and convert silks and stuff before I pass it to Silverfish?  Saves on space, right?<br />
<br />
He's gotten to 93 tailoring &quot;just to save space&quot; because when he finds woven mandrake or greyhopper hides, it's just a few plat, y'know?  How could it hurt?  And I forage while I'm tailoring.  Yeah.  That's it.<br />
<br />
So I make an enchanter, and hand her a box of bone chips, and she's instantly 9th level, to enchant clay for Silverfish's pottery addiction.  So while she's idling while she meds back up from mass enchanting clay, why not sit next to an oven and make subcombines for Halas pies?  But oh, those combines are difficult.  I MUST run some stacks of batwing cunchies and patty melts, just so I don't fail those meats in cream sauce, right?  It's multitasking.  Yeah, that's it.<br />
<br />
A group of my friends decide that it'd be fun to build newbies to play different roles, so I build a shadow knight because that's about as different from a cleric as I can get.  In leveling him up, he needs to med a lot.  While he meds, what's the harm in a pile of silks and woven mandrake (gotta make picnic baskets for Silverfish, after all) and some greyhopper hides and hey, here's an old stack of HQ cat pelts with a sewing kit, while he's medding of course?  And wow, how'd I get to 113 tailoring already?  It's efficient use of time.  Yeah, that's it.<br />
<br />
Now I find I've got bricks of velium and acrylia.  Lots of them.  And I need space for them.  So I make a mule.  But this mule isn't a mule, he's a cat.  A warrior, because he needs strength to move the bricks from the bank when I need them to go to others or the forge.  And it's not very efficient to have all these bricks on a character who can't at least convert them, so maybe I should put some time into getting his skill up to make sure the conversions don't fail.  He's naturally strong, after all, so the skill points come easily.  At first.  So where did all these dairy spoons come from?  And hey, did I just &quot;accidentally&quot; buy him a smithy hammer?  It's saving money on reduced conversion failures.  Yeah, that's it.<br />
<br />
So I've got all these research components just taking up bank space...<br />
<br />
Help me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So I leave EQ and my 200+ smith/multiple mid 100's other stuff guy behind for the green fields of Vana'diel (FFXI).<br />
 <br />
I'm now 55/100 skill as a tailor there, 20 Fishing (it's actually a good moneymaker in FFXI), and a smattering in other skills. :P<br />
 <br />
Once you're bit, you never quit. Even if you quit EQ. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Armaged</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hehe  Heaven help us.<br />
<br />
My Ranger and my new project (enchanter) have no completed the third shawls already.<br />
<br />
My 'chanter is but 51 now, and thanks to boxxing him with my ranger:<br />
<br />
In one day, I collected the 10 biles both need and the 75 threads for the chanter.  The next day I collected the 75 threads the ranger needs for the 5th shawl.<br />
<br />
Last night, I got a total of 7 unrefined diamonds, 3 unrefined emeralds, and 1 unrefined sapphire.<br />
<br />
On the plus side, all this farming is great XP for my chanter right now :)</div></div><hr />

Best way to go...saves you the need to do smithing on one of them;)</div></div><hr />
