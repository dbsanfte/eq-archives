I like making Hero Sammiches.   They sell for good coin, and for some reason, making them cheers me up.<br />
<br />
Being level 34, parts are hard to get.   Recently Nimphe gave me quite a few as a christmas present, and I was a happy little hobbit.<br />
<br />
I ended up with 11 Spiced Parts, and 1 Smoked part left (Since Nimphe gave me quite a few of the prepared parts.  &amp;lt;grin&gt; )<br />
<br />
So, I went the the bazaar looking for 16 Hero parts, to finish the run.  I saw two people selling them.  One person for 200p, the other for 105p.   The 105 person had 60 of them.<br />
<br />
I sent him a tell asking why his price was so high, and he semi-politely told me that he was convinced they would sell.   He agreed that if they didnt sell overnight, he would talk about reducing the price.<br />
<br />
THEY ALL SOLD.  Apparently, the bazaar went from 0 Hero Parts, to a fair number of them, that people will pay STUPID prices for.<br />
<br />
I have never been able to get more then 50p-ish for a sammich, so at this point, other then being handed them by friends, I will not be getting any more hero parts.  No more Sammiches.  No more joy.  I wish I had more friends who had access to tier 2 planes.  Or is it tier 3?  My guild is mostly 30s-high 40s, with a very rare few early 50s, and ALOT of late teens and twenties...<br />

Components from the higher Tier Planes will only make those people richer and buyers poorer.</div></div><hr />

I was playing an Alt my mine and I found a stack of Hero Parts in Neriak.  I sold them to a guy for 150pp for the whole stack and I thought I was getting a good deal.
