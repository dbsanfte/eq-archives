<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Charmour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The trivial lvl for the Lined poison vial is 162. <br />
<br />
Is there something that is made with the Lined poison vial (no thread?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Are you saying the -Unfired Lined Poison Vial- is Trivial at 162, or the firing step?<br />
<br />
If the Unfired... which pelt (or pelts) were you using?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Charmour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am useing zombie skins.<br />
<br />
Unfired of course, you get no exp's for fireing anything....right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Noted the contradiction... It just seems a bit unusual that it would be off, since the lined poison vials have been around for a long time which people have skilled up on.<br />
<br />
As for their use... they are used to put poison in of course</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Firing trivial is generally (if not always) much lower than the unfired trivial, but, assuming your skill was low enough, I would expect to still get skillups from firing things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You needn't guess about firing.  When I made poison vials for practice, I gave them to a friend who got to 12 in pottery by (mostly failing at) firing them.  The boards here say most firings trivial at 15 and that seems to be a good rule of thumb if it isn't completely accurate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Calliopeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Since I just did pottery on Sunday night, I skilled up to 165 with no trivial message yet on Lined Poison Vials.  I also used zombie skins in my combine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The trival on the kiln is 17 and is virtually no fail afterward..with a few exceptions.  <br />
<br />
Aid Grimel is not trival at 230- and some can attest to failling the kiln firing.  And a few other pottery combines are not.  I'm pretty sure the Pop Kiln combines are no fail but I can't be sure.<br />
<br />
Quests based are not necessarily trival but I believe the majorty are.  I don't believe I ever failed a single vial all the way up ..Though I do have like 20 stacks of Advanced vials on a gimp somewhere. Was out of money had now money for sheets of metal.<br />
<br />
And to answer the orginial poster lined posion vials are used in poison making.  One reason the gm trophy summons vials ....  I believe the posion vender in pok has unlimited sealed and lined vials for this reason.</div></div><hr />
