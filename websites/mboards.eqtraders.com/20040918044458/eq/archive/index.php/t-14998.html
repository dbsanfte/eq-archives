<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spirish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been on allakazham trying to find out where these little suckers camp is.  I need the shade silk for the silk tailoring.  Does anyone know where these little guys hang out.  I've only been able to find a few here and there but nothing of any number.  <br />
<br />
I can find tons of Gor Taku, but very few of the Shak Dratha.<br />
<br />
Can anyone offer any insight?<br />
Thanks<br />
Spi<br />
:rolleyes:<br />
<br />
P.S.  This is in shadeweavers Thicket btw. <br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is a trick with the Gor Taku and Shak Dratha. <br />
<br />
Gor Taku spawn during the Norratian &quot;Day&quot;<br />
Shak Dratha spawn during the Norratian &quot;Night&quot;<br />
<br />
Here's the catch, you can't check game time in Shadeweaver's because the sun doesn't move there :boggled:<br />
<br />
If you have been killing in the caves just keep killing they will cycle once the sun goes down over Antonica.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spirish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've only been able to find a few in the caves.  So, what you're saying is, kill the gor taku until the sun goes down and they will spawn into the shak dratha?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mileron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No...<br />
<br />
They share spawn points.<br />
<br />
However, if the spawn points are all gor taku, they'll stay gor taku until you kill some at (or just before) night, so they respawn at night as shak dratha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thundergug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">AHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!  hehehe  I was wondering what the trick to getting them to spawn was...  hehehe  I've tried dozens of things, from killing the gor taku warlord, to leaving shak dratha senteries at the mouths of the caves, and every thing in between.  I use the condensed shadow to finish off my fletching, and have gotten so frustrated trying to figure out the spawn cycles....<br />
<br />
Thanks so much!!!!!  :-)</div></div><hr />
