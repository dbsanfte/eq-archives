<br />
We all have read on the plethora of boards how grateful the Trader Community is for the attention given to us by Tanker and Maddoc.   Thank You both! <br />
<br />
EQT? Could a rant &amp; whine thread exist :rant:, someplace just for some basic questions to be passed on and a delight if maybe were answered or a passing promise to be researched further. <br />
<br />
I do use /feedback and am excited when a suggestion is later  implemented after a few of patches.  Someone is listening.<br />
<br />
Before the &quot;transparent&quot; GUI's and /Bazaar were implemented the ingame Message Boards currently found in both Qeynos &amp; HighPass were useful.  Perhaps in today's Norrath merely a /roleplaying nicety, but even /gems once found an audience. :boggled: <br />

Smithed Sewing Kits - make it a Large rather than the 2-slot Small one?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">While it is nice that Tanker and Maddoc have come by here, and have been both very informative and helpful, ETC is not the place to come for getting bugs fixes or feature ideas passed on to Sony. <br />
<br />
The /feedback command is for sugguestions and general commentary in EQ. <br />
<br />
The /bug command is for reportting bugs. <br />
<br />
Sony has their own message boards at http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/index.jsp.<br />
<br />
With those options available to you, you can see why we're reluctant to swamp the few developers who communicate here with additional issues.   <br />
<br />
So, in short, please use the actual means provided by Sony for passing on bugs and feedback, and not EQTC.</div></div><hr />

You have requested data that the server has decided not to provide to you. Your request was understood and denied. <br />
<br />
{I think the period at the end of jsp. breaks the link}<br />
<br />
So I removed  the .jsp. and tried again. :grumpy:<br />
<br />
<br />
We're sorry, but The Station is being updated <br />
 <br />
<br />
This downtime is important as we continue<br />
to improve and expand our games for our users,<br />
and we apologize for the inconvenience.<br />
We think you'll like our improvements,<br />
so please return later. <br />

But the basics still hold true... We do not want this to turn into the &quot;bug SOE&quot; boards.  We still prefer to have it as a place SOE wants to visit, and we fear adding an area like you suggest because people have shown many many many many many many (ok my point clear) times over that they will not censor themselves, and they will let it get out of hand if we make such an area.  Such an area would need a moderator sitting on it being there to see every post as soon as it is posted... it would just be a nightmare... a nightmare we are not willing to show to SOE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
But in a way hasn't it already become that?<br />
<br />
Respect and alms to the Overlord it was not overtly suggested as such.  I spoke of an intent and an audience, knowning as I have suggested that it would not be the best place.  Find me another place with such a niche.<br />
<br />
I agree focused on tradeskills, but elsewhere have I been already that SOE even pays an interest to a community with it's own resound voice?<br />

<br />
Should they not, when an objective of many is to improve Norrath in away that was not considered viable to programmers and GM's that have their own overwhelming jobs to keep pace with us?<br />
<br />
I perhaps question a logic and an expectation that I'm not as motivated by levels, loot or coins.  You dismiss a challenge on the table as a proper forum that shoud be heard to be at least isolated into a topic of a concern to be a voice which emanates others who haven't stepped forward?<br />

You suggest a moderator, fair enough, I only  suggested the idea of a &quot;sticky&quot; thread for such OT posts.  If it were to be read and answered, why then flex muscles when a captive audicence can choose to answer, or not.  I have no malice or expectation that either developer give credence, but then a snowball starts at the top of hill, when it reaches the bottom who shall question it's girth upon it's eventual squash?<br />
<br />
I truly :love: what EQT has been to EverQuest.  I have done my part to support you all.  I advocate it constently in chat and as a Guild backbone.  Do I ask something that no  others are willing to question?<br />
<br />
Ngreth I'm but a lone voice, but one that is not so easily dismmised as one who has questions the rules before and does raise outcome to a level that has it's own judgement.<br />
<br />
When I speak up and debate from the side of a visible minority, doesth it not give you and the others a reason to consult an intent of other's to speak their own peace?<br />
<br />
I didn't offer a topic here that expected such a resitance, but one that had an opportunity to be addresssed by those who can make changes happen when there was reason to consider a voice in common.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kronepsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Unfortunately, in a site this huge, the odds of everyone who visits the site actually complying with such a thing -- only keeping Qs to SoE in one thread -- are zero.  You WILL have random selfish jackass #543 who posts in a seperate area to try to get more attention, or start posting useless crap, or otherwise just wasting bandwidth.  There's just too many people to account for.  Remember, the main site got like &gt;100,000 hits a day...imagine how many the board gets. -_-;<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind that recent &quot;Oops, we went over our allotted bandwidth again&quot; shutdown in February.  An idea like that put into use would have EQTraders down 3/4ths of the month, if not more.</div></div><hr />

We are not here to do their jobs.  But I warn you that such boards existed in the days of Verant and were shut down due to the incredible rudeness people exhibited there.  I don't think SOE is any more keen to bring that upon themselves than we are.<br />

You only are getting upset with us for refusing to accept a burden that would easily equal the amount of work we already do.  <br />

These boards will stay reasonably friendly and organized or they will be closed.  We are not willing to let them become unfriendly and chaotic as a Zen experiment.  Calling it a snowball wouldn't make it any more pleasant.<br />

We appreciate that but it does not give you the right to make demands.  If we have done such a good job to this point, I think we deserve a little trust in our decisions on how we want to continue running.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We still like the analogy that these boards are our Home.  We invite folks to our home, and we expect folks to behave in our home.  We like that VIP's come to our home, and do talk to our guests about what is happening.<br />
<br />
But it is our home.  We chose not to then especially invite the VIP's for a &quot;political&quot; debate.  We believe that doing so drives the VIP's AWAY from our home.  We believe, and it has been proven to us by peoples actions... that it invites people MISBEHAVE in our home.<br />
<br />
One thing we have to remember is... SOE developers are not required to come read our boards.  People may have opinions, even strong ones, that they should be required to come read our boards and site... but the plain fact is... it is not actually required of them.  While I am sure folks would like to debate this point, it is a fact and debate of it here is pointless.  (If you absolutely have to talk about this point of it, take it to primal screams and leave it out of this discussion)<br />
<br />
Because they are not required to come here, yet they do come here, we want to do nothing to drive them away.  Because we want them to stay, we insist on making this as friendly a place as possible.  A sticky thread like you say will NOT be a friendly place… especially if you want it un-moderated as you seem to indicate.  If we were to moderate such thread it would take a very large amount of work to moderate it becasue people have proven time and time again that they will misbehave.</div></div><hr />
