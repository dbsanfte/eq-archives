<br />
&quot;So godawful that it ruptured the very fabric of space and time with the sheer overpowering force of its mediocrity.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Talked to anyone like that recently?   :twisted:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds like a really really bad movie review ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
But other than that, I would swear that I said that.<br />
<br />
And I love you too Khev.  :-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username"></div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When do I use then? <br />
<br />
When do I use than?<br />
<br />
Then is properly used when it is dealing with telling time or giving the next item or person an order.<br />
<br />
Examples:<br />
<br />
Pat and Tom went swimming then they went to the park.<br />
<br />
Pat will jump over the puddle and then Tom will jump.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Than is properly used in a comparison situation.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
Sally can run faster than Kelly can. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps Lilosh.<br />
<br />
Your welcome.</div></div><hr />

Your welcome.<br />

It is considered intelligent to spell your own words correctly when correcting others, smart guy.<br />
<br />
Now, go ahead and claim that you did that on purpose, as a bit of humor.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I did that on purpose, as a bit of humor.<br />
<br />
Not a claim... it was actually intentional in reference to your earlier post on my spelling, kinda like saying:  &quot;I'm correcting you now because you corrected me then.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever you say bounces off of me and sticks to you.<br />
<br />
/em sticks his tongue out at you.<br />
<br />
So there :) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yakk</div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Delf, the right way to do that joke is to leave oblique references to the mistake elsewhere in your reply -- the reversal of mistake and correction, post and reply, can then be proved, when the target complains about you're mistake.<br />
<br />
Making a mistake, and later claiming it was on purpose, isn't kosher -- for all we know, that apostrophe was added not as a joke, but because you didn't know better -- maybe your seplling sucks, and are just a nit picker.<br />
<br />
Bah, I'm not very good at it.  I need more practice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username"></div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem seems to be widespread on this board.<br />
<br />
I was once told that if everyone else in the world appears to be an idiot, you yourself may be the idiot.<br />
<br />
So in the four or five times I have made way to subtle remarks that were humerous to me, and lost on most everyone else (or as in this case, corrected as it was so subtle as to appear to be a mistake)... I must conclude that it is in fact my bad.  <br />
<br />
Sorry again Lilosh, every future mistake will be genuine without a doubt a mistake uncontested.<br />
<br />
P.S.  I may forget this post sometime in the future, as it is in my nature to make myself laugh, often even if it goes under/over everyone elses heads.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You may have meant &quot;way too subtle.&quot;  I'm sure that's another unintentional mistake meant to annoy Lilosh.<br />

2 - More than enough; excessively: She worries too much. <br />
4 - Very; extremely; immensely: He's only too willing to be of service.</div></div><hr />
