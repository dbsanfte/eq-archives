To do so of course I need a 9 slot tailoring container. I went to open up a loom in PoK but I cant seem to open it with either a right or left click. Are the looms 'broken' or am I doing something silly?<br />
<br />
These are the tanaan looms at 142, 1457 and 85, 1477 <br />
I tried both<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">claver</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find it easier to stand to the side of it and open the loom from there. It is very hard to open it while facing it directly.<br />
<br />
Btw carrying a deluxe tailoring kit has no bearing on opening a loom since I have one myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stryhf</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Click on the wooden part of the loom.<br />
<br />
I had the same issue.  I quit the game for a long time (over a year) came back and realized that the 10 slot sewing kits are no longer sold.<br />
<br />
I tried to use a loom, and it never worked for me.<br />
<br />
Finally when I was turning, I clicked on the wooden border and it opened up.<br />
<br />
The actual cloth part of it doesn't appear to be part of the container, it's only the wooden frame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chenier</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right...just stand in front of the loom and page up so you're looking at the top horizontal beam. Click it. Should open.<br />
<br />
If you look at the supplies location list, it will give you the listing of &quot;real&quot; looms and their locs. I think there used to be a list of looms that weren't real (like, for example, the loom on the first platform off the newbie lift in Kelethin is not real).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thunderheart</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, another way is to just use mouse look all over at the loom and keep pressing the U key to Use.</div></div><hr />
