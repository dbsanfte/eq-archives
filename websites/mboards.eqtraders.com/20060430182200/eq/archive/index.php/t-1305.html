I'll be starting on some in the next week or so (after I'm wearing a full suit  :D )<br />
<br />
The only stuff I've seen for sale on my server is Fierce Heraldic.  Usually in small quantities (0-8 a week approx.)<br />
<br />
So, what human BD armor pieces are the most marketable?  Or, is there a better way to make sells than the bazaar?  I would appreciate any ideas and comments.<br />
<br />
Thx,<br />

Fierce heraldic will be sold more since every pieces have +hp and hp is generally considered &gt; all by most people<br />
<br />
So you're looking at Mith Marr, Innoruuk and Rallos Zek as the most popular choices. Shame Erollisi Marr armor have to be pink :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ero marr imbue for heraldic IS NOT pink. Rodcet nife is.<br />
<br />
You're thinking of imbued field plate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this is the fashion page linked to from EQtraders main site.  They were missing a couple images of heraldic, but is a good reference.<br />
<br />
Erollisi Marr is an orangish/bronze color I believe btw.  I'll be the pink cleric runnin round (rodcet nife).<br />

<br />
To answer the original question: Fierce (Rallos Zek) is far and away the most popular flavor of Heraldic, with the greaves being especialy liked. A distant but clear second to Fierce is Luminant (MMarr), many pieces of this seem attractive to MMarr pallies. I have had no interest at all in Innoruuk or Veeshan, and very little RNife or EMarr business. I have done a few pieces of Karana, mostly for twinks, and some non-imbued.</div></div><hr />

Karana clerics seem quite rare. When I was wearing the old Karana cultural I got asked again and again about what armor I was wearing, as nobody had ever seen it before on Bristlebane. Funny though, in my guild there now is one other Karana cleric and a good friend is a third Karana cleric I know of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aarial</div><div class="date">12-22-2002, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">---heheh---<br />
<br />
I constantly get asked what armor I'm wearing.. If I can sow or port someone. I got that wood elf illusion hat to so that doesn't help it. I'm the only green human cleric I know though. So I'm unique if anything else which is what I was aiming for 8) Didn't care for skyshrine blue. ;P</div></div><hr />

<br />
On my trader I will generally keep Pauldrons, 2 Bracers, Boots, Neck, Face, BP, and Legs. <br />
<br />
If I'm feeling lucky then I'll also put 1 of each kind of bracer on the mule as well. Sometimes the Mith Marr (Luminent) sells as well, but on a rarer occasion.<br />
<br />
Most of the time I simply do armor to order due save for the Fierce, since I still have items sitting on my trader that have been there for 3 months now.  :?</div></div><hr />
