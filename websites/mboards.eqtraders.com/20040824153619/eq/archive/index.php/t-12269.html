<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">To those of you who skilled up from 200-248 on Minotaur Hero Brew: How often did you get skillups?<br />
<br />
I have 305 wis, and from other tradeskill report posts, the often thrown-around number of combines per skillup is around 30 at that int/wis.<br />
<br />
So i figure triving Mino brew would take 72 stacks of combines (72x20). <br />
<br />
Yesterday i went from 200-248 in about 25-30 stacks of combines (didnt keep exact records, i just wanted to plow thru it, but it sure wasnt anywhere near 72 stacks). I went from 239 to 248 in the last 4 stacks.<br />
<br />
Also i didnt go more than a stack and a half without a skillup.<br />
<br />
Have other people gotten this sort of success rate recently?<br />
<br />
I play on test server and we are dealing with some new changes (and bugs) all of which havent been noodled out yet.<br />
<br />
Might this be a slight bump in skillups? Might have the RNG fairy decided to smile upon me this day? Or is this normal for Hero brew?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did mine several months ago, but I went from 200-248 in about 5 hours, iirc.  I don't keep stats for skill ups, so can't help you that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arghargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">200 to 248 took me just under 53 stacks of MHB.  Doing that in less than 30 stacks is very good (lucky).  I doubt it means anything has changed though.  Your good luck is just there to balance all those poor souls who when 300 combines with no skill ups.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I seem to recall doing 200-248 in about 45 stacks with my wizard at 255 INT. My longest stretch without a skill up was about 80 combines. You had a really good run! Woot!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kritta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm currently working on them and went through 3 stacks last night without a single skillup. I'm a warrior and was working with 225 int.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ruffi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">WTF It took me about 500 combines for 200-202. That's with 355 int.</div></div><hr />

Smithing 199 to 200 took me 1 combine.  249-250 brewing took 4 combines.   I've never seen a run longer than 102 (baking 198-199).  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kritta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It double posted on me, excuse this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Alano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">190-200 I did an average of about 50 combines per skill up.<br />
201-223 16 combines per skill up.  <br />
<br />
355 int.<br />
<br />
Its so mind numbing, one day ill get to 250 hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eternyty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">don't keep exact stats either, but my norm was about 30 per skillup.  One streak of 100 before skillup, but finished nicely with 244-248 in 16 attempts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Barli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just started doing these.  I'm a dwarf warrior with low WIS/INT.  Buffed up my WIS is only ~160.   I am averaging one skill-up per 40 combines.  Best luck I had was 2 skill-ups back-to-back - but soon followed by a run of 65 with no skill-ups.<br />
<br />
Now at (212).   I usually only make MHB's for about an hour.  That's when my wrist hurts too much from clicking.   Sure I could go out and buy more WIS gear - but I'm a glutton for punishment.  Dumb Dwarf Brewers can get to GM too!!<br />
<br />
You'd think us Dwarves would be able to brew easier than other races.   Just try being a warrior and get to GM!   Oh the sweet pain - my wrist is talking back to me......   =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tudamorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've done GM brewing twice.  Each time it was the usual 20-25 combines on average, with the usual lucky 3 skill gains in 10 combines and the usual 60+ combine dry periods.  I posted the first set of logs on the old board but they're long gone.  Each time I had maximum INT, 255 in the first set and 355 in the second.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lanalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I did a run of MHBs today... went from 200 to 220 in about two hours. I averaged probably 20-25 combines per skillup with 325 wisdom. It cost me a whopping 16pp total, and I gave away two stacks of booze instead of selling those. ;)<br />
<br />
Going to go for 248 tomorrow!!! Wheee</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Marteeny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ugh, tried skilling up brewing on an alt last night.<br />
<br />
600 attempts of these things got me from 188 to 193. :(<br />
<br />
And to top it all off, I am doing this on  my foraging mule so that I can forage while skilling up. I did all the combines in Kelethin in hopes to come away with a bunch of morning dew for my smithing. After 3+hours of killing my wrist, I managed to forage 1 lousy morning dew. Given, my foraging is only at 115, but geez!!!! I foraged at least 15-20 of the heartfruit which is supposed to be more rare than the dew. <br />
<br />
Make it stop!:(</div></div><hr />
