<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Isembold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings, I was wondering what people felt was the best place to hunt for droppable dye components for either the type A or Type B components. <br />
<br />
I have found that the orc camps in Lfay are a good source of Sylvan Berries (type A) but I'm not really sure about the type B components. <br />
<br />
I thought that the goblin camp in Dagnor's Cauldron would be be good for Cauldron Prawn and the first night I camped there I got 15 with some patience. I have gone back since and haven't seen one. I did however see many of the collector's water rings (sometimes 1 dropping from each of the 4 mobs at the camp). <br />
<br />
Did they drastically change the drop rate in DC for the 5th anniversary? <br />
<br />
Is there another place that would be good for type B components?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>euridice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if u have the chance to make cultural robes, farm the composant for them, u'll can use the ribbons you make saving you time &amp; money.<br />
if u cannot I found kobolds a pretty good source in stonebrunt mountains</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tibbwini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If by type B you mean the components that go into the slightly higher trivial ribbon combines, then I've had more success foraging ashweed in Lavastorm than anywhere else. Like anything else it's pretty streaky, but a few hours slowly rotating at the druid rings usually nets me a decent stack of components.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ChaseFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have also seen ashweed drop from the camp of goblin warriors where the Erudite Necromancer spawns (can't remember her name, sorry). Ashweed also drops from lava imps (but not the sprite), and the relatively rare Goblin Scout spawn (not to be confused with the fairly common a fire goblin scout). While I really, really hated and resented the week or so I spent in Lavastorm (wall to wall greens except for the vendors), in comparison to most of my other attempts to get supplies for ribbons, it was probably one of the more fruitful.<br />

As a ranger, you may already be familiar with Jaggedpine Forest. It is a fear-kiting mecca, and if you forage as often as the button pops (turning off attack if you need to), you can rack up a stack in a night or two of hunting (3-4 hour sessions), and get pretty good experience from the griffs and the anacondas. Stonebrunt also yielded up a goodly number of bamboo shoots by hunting pandas and foraging as often as I could, but I can't remember off the top of my head if those can be used for the golden and platinum ribbons or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aniien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have seen some of the dificult tradeskill items drop from Plane of Mis, recently. Mainly runes and pages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Anaxo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My preferred ribbon dyes are Lichenclover and Steamfont Springwater. Springwater drops from the southwest kobold camp in Steamfont mountains; one clearing usually nets me about a quarter to half stack. Lichenclover drops from the drachnids in Firionia Vie, I have yet to farm these mutated half-spider people so I do not know the droprate for them. It also has the added bonus of spider silk, good for later tailoring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>tibbwini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Only trouble is they're the type A dye components, for the recipes that trivial at (for gold) 162 as opposed to 167. I spent a couple of days at kobolds getting Sping Water, only to get 162 in tailoring on the second combine, then realise I couldn't skill up off it till I started on platinum, which I don't want to do until I'm sure my failure rate will be lower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Muldamai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have been doing High Elf Cultural robes for quite a while now, and I stick to Sylvan Berry stuff, since I don't need to forage. If you are referring to &quot;B&quot; parts at Rune of Sorcery, pg. 115, and Tears of Prexus, I do find Tears of Prexus to be, by far, the most prevalent item out there. But do not pass up the Runes, pages, etc, as using Tears is the most exspensive way to go. If you could clarify what &quot;B&quot; list items are, that would really help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>shadowrings</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've  come to discover on Povar at least it seems there is a higher forage chance for plant shoots for Jaggedpine Dye in Nedaria's Landing than in Jaggepine itself.  You still get some of the JP quest armor forage items in NL but not as frequently as you do in JP.  Also one can do some of the collection quests for plat and a bit of xp while foraging in NL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mileron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Springwater drops from any kobold or minotaur in Steamfont.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aamdor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Steamfont Springwater also drops from Earth Elementals.</div></div><hr />
