<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did but this was before the last patch which may have changed sell back. Cost me 30-40k I think to go from 202 to 240. (not 100% sure on this figure tho it was around the release of PoP)</div></div><hr />

When people skill up on bows, do you sell the bows back to the vendor to save some plat?  <br />
<br />
It's not a question of saving some plat, it's a question of making it a remotely viable skill-up path. For example, making darkwood + hemp up to 215:<br />
<br />
Ellis Cloudchaser tells you, 'That'll be 226 platinum 7 gold 9 silver 9 copper for the Darkwood Bow Staff.'<br />
Ellis Cloudchaser tells you, 'That'll be 1 silver per Hemp Twine.'<br />
<br />
Ellis Cloudchaser tells you, 'I'll give you 204 platinum 7 gold 7 silver 1 copper for the Rough Darkwood Recurve Bow.'<br />
<br />
So a failure costs you 226.809, but with sellback a success only costs you 22.038.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darkedge Thornblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thanks, it's costing me about 20pp a bow, but now im at 220 so with the extra cams it's alot more, hopefully my 100k covers up to 243 or so.</div></div><hr />
