There is a new MMPG on the block and it's not pulling any punches.  I was curious about it when I saw it mentioned on Fires Of Heaven's web site so I gave it a shot.  BIG mistake.  Imagine a MMPG with no monsters and solid, wall to wall, open ended, infinitely varied tradeskill systems (plural) on the one hand and a tech tree which takes 6000 people+ a year to explore jointly.  A game where the whole purpose of the game is to interact, help each other and advance the society as a whole.  A game where the GMs appear almost instantly and even give out their cell phone numbers over the server-wide chat.<br />
<br />
As an avid tradeskiller I was instantly hooked.  And it doesn't help that the damned thing is free to try until you get to a level of competence which demands you register.<br />
<br />
I'm plugging this cos I love it.  If you like EQ's tradeskill system but are getting burned out by ridiculous camps then give it a bash.  It's free after all.<br />
<br />
And it's at www.atitd.com<br />
<br />
Enjoy<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trewayn</div><div class="date">04-15-2003, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it's free to start with, but after a couple of days you really have to pay to be able to get into the deeper game.<br />
<br />
Which a laughable concept by itself.  At the moment the &quot;deeper game&quot; means the stuff we have unlocked after 6 weeks uptime.  The game itself is designed to last for a year so god only knows how much stuff we have yet to find.  There are a few thousand active paying members so far and we have collectively barely scratched the surface.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, forgot to mention.  This game is not completely open ended.  There is an ultimate goal (the construction of seven pyramids) at which point we'll have completed the game and it will restart.  Pretty nifty, huh?<br />
<br />
It's also nice to play in a game where the GMs can be seen to actively listen to the people who play.  Which is another thing.  There is an active, in game law system where anyone can propose a new law (if they get enough signatories) and, if the populace gives the vote a 2/3rds majority, the game designers will actively seek to code the law into the game engine provided it doesn;t completely upturn gameplay.<br />
<br />
How's that for customer service?<br />

Unfortunately I quickly realised I barely have time to be be involved in one MMOG, yet alone two =/<br />
<br />
ATITD looks like a good contender to switch to if I wanted to quit EQ tho  (So did Shadowbane, but they don't want my dirty European money :roll:).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">neipa</div><div class="date">04-19-2003, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got ahold of this game a couple of days ago and haven't played any eq since but not because i think this eq is lacking and this is in no way a replace meant for my beloved eq but my routers is wacked out and i can't stay connected to eq for more than 10 minutes but any way back to the main topic<br />
<br />
this game is fun even more if your a huge fan of tradeskills i love it its huge theres no zoning though unless you pay for an account and learn the navigation skill theres a whole lot of walking but its worth it damn is it fun if you play yourselves I am know as akbif and I am a member of the guild theopolise (that might be spelt wrong) and currently reside in the valley of the kings its in the top left corner of the map look me up and i can give you a hand</div></div><hr />
