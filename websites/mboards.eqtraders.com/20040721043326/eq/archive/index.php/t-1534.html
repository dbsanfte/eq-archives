<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, it dawned on me the other day that at the rate (or, lack of) I have been skilling up on tailoring lately, I might as well go ahead and GM baking, currently holding at 190.  <br />
<br />
I calculated that by the time I get to 200 with tailoring, I will have gained a few more levels, funneled my exp into AA points and gained the ability to GM another skill, if I'm crazy enough or rich enough (or both) to keep pushing the needle through the hides.<br />
<br />
I shake my head in wonder when I realize that I have started this whole mess over again with Euell, currently at 135 and facing the dreaded Wu's run, just to try to make the haversacks.<br />
<br />
Sad, really.  What is wrong with me!   :roll:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's very not worth it.  I'll do your haversacks for you free (with components of course).<br />
<br />
I'm finding the whole tailoring situation very depressing right now.</div></div><hr />

I've got about 5 stacks of tufts on Euell, with more coming in every day.  I may chuck the whole thing and come see you yet.<br />
<br />
... Meanwhile ...<br />
<br />
I deleted one of my mules this weekend, and started a gnome chanter.  I PLed him quickly to 9, but got sidetracked with an invite to KC with Zabu (One full yellow in an evening!  It's been so long...)  Soon I will have my mana vials, a tinkerer, and he can continue to be my sales mule, as well.<br />
<br />
Also started doing worked silver chains with Euell to get smithing high enough to make the vale kit to start processing the brute and HQ brute and acorns I have been stockpiling...  [deep breath]<br />
<br />
I wonder how much I could get for 18 deluxe sewing kits...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I have sold a few for 1k each on Povar, If that is any help.<br />
<br />
<br />
But it is a SLOOOOW market.  You'll be lucky to sell one per week.<br />
