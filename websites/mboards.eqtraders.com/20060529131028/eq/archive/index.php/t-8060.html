I have also added the eight general character inventory slots across the bottom of the window. It can be downloaded at EQInterface.com (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1500)</div></div><hr />

The new UI system that went into the game almost a year ago was designed specifically to allow you to tailor the interface to your own liking and style of play. It is not possible to use the UI to do anything in game that you would not be able to do in the default UI (with a few very creative exception).<br />
<br />
Moving window elements around is certainly well within the intended capabilities of the system and would not be a violation of the EULA. The shared bank slots themselves were introduced in the last patch (June 11) and it would not have been possible to create anything like them at the client level.</div></div><hr />
