I like the look of the Velium Blue Diamond Ring, and it would be nice to be able to create one for myself (once I get to the point of actually being able to progress through the quest).<br />
<br />
Also, I assume there's no way (or at least no known way) to make this ring outside of this quest (in other words, there's no other source for the etching dust, right?).</div></div><hr />

The ring can not be made with out being upto that point in the quest those because you need to use the previous earring in the combine and you need the dust you mentioned also. The dust you should be able to get as long as you have the flag/skill but the previous earring requires you to do the quest up to that point too.</div></div><hr />
