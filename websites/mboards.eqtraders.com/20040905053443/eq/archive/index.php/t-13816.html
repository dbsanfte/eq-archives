<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eqNichola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As some of you will remember, I have always been a big supporter of the new UI since I first heard about it and saw it on Test. I don't care how easy it is to make stuff, or to skill up - I didn't get into tradeskills to compete with other people, I got into tradeskills to MAKE NEAT STUFF and anything that helps that is fine by me.<br />
<br />
So from when I first heard about this new system, I held off any skilling at all (my skills range from 212 to 250) on the basis that soon it was gonna be way easier, and there was no point punishing myself. I've got lots of nice raw materials stockpiled too.<br />
<br />
Finally the new UI goes live. And... guess what? About 20 recipes per skill are AutoLearn. A further, ooh, FIVE or so are CanLearn. What's that about? Nice Mr Developer comes along and explains that it's not up to him what gets marked as what. Fair enough. But someone somewhere has been majorly slacking off given that 95% of all recipes have yet to be categorised (this doesn't count as a personal attack since I don't actually know who it is?). And while we're at it: Why should any recipe be deliberately CannotLearn? Reasoned arguments welcome!<br />
<br />
In short: Lovely new UI. Pity the data side is so woefully incomplete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">all shawl items can be not learn for all i care.  takes one sucess to learn it anyway.  ag stuff.  anything that gives a lore item or no drop item is fine.  why are you making 2 anyway?  the velium bits for the phylactery quest is a fluke.  they didn't inted it to be a skillup path.  if you want to do it still just do the old ui like everyone has before now.  <br />
<br />
i imagine since this is all done server side they are trying not to use too much more data storage by making some stuff cannot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bakamon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The new Tradeskill(TS) UI was supposed to be the best thing to ever happen to the dedicated TSers.  I spent over 2 years working almost exclusively on TSs to become a Supreme Grand Master, and I was like a little boy on Christmas morning running down stairs to see his new pony, only to find a cardboard cutout leaning against the wall.  To say I was dissappointed is an understatement.  So far I can make celestial essense and dough with it.  Everything else must be done with the old click and drag method.<br />
<br />
I would be fully satisfied if some rational was presented to us on just how items were selected for the receipe list, autolearn or can learn or whatever.    As I see it now, all the work was spent on making the new UI work, and Very Little was spent on the receipes.   I am hoping that is the problem, and not &quot;...system is working as designed..&quot;.  I am hoping that most or all receipes will be released to the UI in some form.<br />
<br />
A couple of questions.  Whynot...<br />
<br />
1) ...make ALL receipes Can Learn to Grand Masters (GM)?   By then, the GM is past all the skillup nonsense and is ready to concentrate on making the items he paid so dearly for with his time, and energy, and pain.  Where is the exploit?  Farming or buying the components has not changed.   The time sink is still there; the money sink is still there. Make GM a valuable goal to reach, not just a stop sign at the end of the road.<br />
<br />
2) ...consider allowing #1 above if the GM has a Trophy in that skill, if the above cant stand on its merits alone.<br />
<br />
3) ...set ALL receipes so that they can be learned after some type of test?  After making them successfully xxx times, or /random xxxx after each success to set it as learned, or maybe even a quest.<br />
<br />
All that said, I get the feeling that Sony is going very slow on this new feature so that they dont get caught with a huge exploit rampage like the plat dupe one.   After going through all my skill containers last night and seeing the large number of receipes left out that had no skillup or exploit value, I'm believing more and more that this is the case.<br />
<br />
..but in the back of my mind is a nagging little voice saying they did it again...   promised the pony, delivered the card board cutout....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thicket Tundrabog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">*shrug* ... I like the new interface. I did 100 Shadowscream combines last night and got 5 smithing skillups (now at 239 without Geerlok). The new UI interface made it easy.<br />
<br />
Metal rings were on the menu.<br />
Humming orbs were not on the menu until I did one successful combine. Then they were there.<br />
Shadowscream boots were also not on the menu until I did one successful combine.<br />
<br />
It actually was a pleasure doing the combines.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">baka read the general disscusion.  they didn't leave things out they didn't put them in.  before you whine about it they are still working on it.  you could have put ideas in the thread to suggest ideas in but instead you complained.  baka.<br />
<br />
how did you come up with that name?  digimon?<br />
<br />
most all recipes can be learned after you succeed once afaik.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd say it's a brilliant move getting the &quot;I walked uphill both ways in the snow&quot; crowd up in arms over putting the new UI in while putting enough recipies in to irritate the people who actually want to use it.<br />
<br />
Conceptually, I'm very impressed with it but the execution was poor.  One hopes that enough items will be added to make this a worthwhile addition to the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Annalina Romanov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm filing this under &quot;yet another TQM failure&quot;. Chances are, they'll complete this with a patch in a month or three from now, much as the bazaar was not implemented for a while after the release of Luclin.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just because you don't use a name doesn't mean you're not pointing to a particular individual.  C'mon guys, why on earth do we have to get so snide, with the devs and with each other?<br />
<br />
Has it occurred to anyone at all that maybe it simply wound up being more work than they'd expected?  Maybe something didn't go as smoothly as expected?  Or that maybe the Powers That Be at SOE didn't allow enough time to start with, so that the folks doing the work ran late through no fault of their own?<br />
<br />
Constructive criticism is one thing but this is getting ridiculous.  Just...chill.</div></div><hr />
