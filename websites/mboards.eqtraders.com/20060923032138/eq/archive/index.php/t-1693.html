<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Narith</div><div class="date">12-31-2002, 04:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I need some advice, I am looking to GM tailoring and though money is not a major concern (I will explain in a sec) I need to find a way to skill up at a decent rate on mostly player bought material (you know, what the level 20s and 30s sell in mass quantities because you hate to farm them yourselves).<br />
<br />
Ok I have gone from 172 to 186 in the last 4 days at a cost of 40k (yes 40, 000 plat). Though money is not my concern, that rate is just ridiculous. I pay no more than 30p per velium piece (some people sell em on Brell for 100 each) or 60p per small/large brick or block, I pay no more than 50p/100p respectively for their acrylia counterparts as velium temper costs alot more I am willing to pay more for acrylia... Anyways I do not think I am overpaying by much for materials and have been trying velious leathers as pelts are much easier to attain (I fish in CS for cod while casting c3/4/or 5 for pelts to the quad kiters). The problem with velious studded armors is that you need 4 tempers for 2 studs at 25p each is 100p for 2 mask combines in temper alone which I still fail 19/20 and have to sell to a vendor for 6g and change on the one I do make. Count in buying velium I am going through about 300p or more a combine.<br />
<br />
So I tried Acrylia armor, acrylia is a bit more costly from players and I tried farming it myself in acrylia caverns and gave up after 2 hours and seeing 3 bricks. Still it is cheaper to buy from players this way... The problem is that the hides needed I have yet to see for under 300p each and up to 500p, now for something that I cant sell back to players for more than 50p I refuse on principle to pay that much so I farmed them myself. Again the quantity I received farming became a problem... I could keep half of the DS rockhopper cave cleared before respawn and after 5 hours a day for 3 days I manage 12 superb and 14 flawless hides. That will get me to 250 in oh about 14 years.<br />
<br />
So I moved on to ceremonial soltice robes. Being a 250 JCer I did the chains myself, it cost me 10k and I managed to make 7 chains. Buying imbued emeralds I paid 30p each for 4 stacks (2400p total) a little more than what I probably would have paid if I offered a good chunk of cash to a druid to imbue and bought the gems myself, but I didn't have to wait for them. 5p each for the celestial essence from the newbies (needed 160) and so on ended up putting me in the hole about 12kish after I sold the 3 I succeeded on for 1k a pop and still left with 4 chains.<br />
<br />
Now then as for money I have a few hundred k to deal with, but 40k for 14 points is what I deem insane. The robes seem to be the balance between higher availability than the acrylia and cheaper than velious leather. Velious leathers are a bit easier to come by (I can farm 2 stacks of panther skins a day,  if I could find a yew leaf supplier), but unless Sony ups the buy back rate on vendors it is a huge money sink. Lastly, Acrylia... The drop rates on the pelts are horrid, drop rate on the ore is horrid, it's just all round a horrid and painfully slow way to go.<br />
<br />
Can anyone please, please, please think of an alternative route. Something that I am not spending 3k+ for 1 point, but is fast enough that I can spend an hour a day getting enough material for 20+ combines. My best bet right now is the robes as far as I can see......<br />
<br />
But seriously, there has to be a better way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you farm everything yourself, it's not really that expensive.  Now you said you had the money, so I'm going to assume you don't have the time.  Just start dumping loads of cash into tailoring.  So far. 40k is nothing if you are going that route.  Tailors have been known to spend upwards of 400k to GM this skill.  <br />
<br />
Since you said money isn't an issue, hopefully you have a large bankroll guild supporting you or profit from another tradeskill, there really isn't a 'fast and cheap' way of Tailoring.<br />

<br />
Never, ever say this.  If you do, it simply means you do not understand the quantities of money you will need to spend.<br />
<br />
According to my vender logs (  here  (http://www.eq-viatores.org/cgi-bin/vend.cgi) ), I have had 353k pp pass through my vender and go back into tailoring.  This is since the last time I cleared my vender log.  This is not including the estimated 50 to 70k I've made on Leatherfoot Haversacks (gross, not net).  This is not including the tailored items I am wearing, that my guild is wearing, that my friends are wearing, that I've traded for other items.  This is not including the value of items I farmed myself.  This is not including the 70k in BD armor I have personally delivered to people who couldn't make it up to the bazaar because of their raiding schedules.<br />
<br />
In regards to money for tailoring, if you have to ask, you can't afford it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You see, impatience is your main enemy here.<br />
<br />
You could have saved 1320 for emeralds, by asking a druid friendwith a few spare moments.. maybe one from your server forum here. :) <br />
<br />
You paid 560 more for CE, then you'd pay combining it yourself..<br />
<br />
Thats 2k from your 12k estimate right there.  Add to that fact that you seem to be selling your successes for 1k each, and 7 chains = 7k.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Thats 3k for 80 attempts.   Statistically, thats 4 skillups.  People have collected data and found that 20 is the average number of combines per skillup.  There are some long 100+ combine skillups, and some consecutive skillups. <br />
<br />
But as you said, you didnt want to wait.  And if you are a tailor without patience, you can't expect the best of both worlds.  You wont have bazaar convience with farming prices.   :) <br />
<br />
Keep at it, and you'll be 250 in no time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Handor</div><div class="date">12-31-2002, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want a skill you can buy to 250, take up jewelcraft.  Tailoring is only for the hardcore tradeskiller.  I would estimate somewhere around 500+ hours farming greens/light blues for tailoring and tinkering drops and doing other non-experience tasks (like fishing/foraging).  I'm just glad we had our wizard quad so many wyverns when they were still experience. :)<br />
<br />
If we hadn't bothered with tailoring and tinkering, all our chars would be 65 with tons of AA's.  We figure that conservatively we have spent over 150K pp so far buying only the stuff that doesn't drop and farming the rest.<br />
<br />
And you haven't even hit the fun part yet -- when you get to the 190's it gets *really* fun.  We went through at least 1,000 wyvern hides to get from 190 to 210.<br />
<br />
Though it is easier now with acrylia and Solstice robe options, it's still not easy.  If you just want stuff you can buy up, stick to Solstice robes.  You should be able to buy imbued emeralds, silks, probably even celestial essences on prod servers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valorale</div><div class="date">12-31-2002, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Handor, 4th paragraph of original post, first line. ... the guy is a 250 JCer<br />
<br />
Lilosh pretty much hit the nail on the head here. Your problem is you think because you have money you can buy a 250 in Tailoring, thus your impaitent. Hate to break it to you but unless you have over 7 figures in your bank account that is unlikely to happen without a LOT of clicking... or will have to find someone to come to your house and do the clicking for you. <br />
<br />
If you REALLY hate the idea of combining 3000 Celestial essence, I hear rumors that there are programs that can assist with this. <br />
<br />
With the number of Emeralds you will need it may be in your best interest to PL yourself a druid or cleric to level 29 so you can do those imbues, thus the emeralds only cost you 13pp, 5gp each and the time to imbue them .. again I hear rumors that there are programs that can assist with this. This would be especially easy if you have a 2nd computer and 2nd account, you could do the C5 yourself. <br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong .. having the money helps alot but dont think because you have it, by throwing it at the skill it will go up faster. Expect to spend at least 350,000pp for a 250 skill assuming you planed your route out and did everything with care, time and paitence. <br />
<br />
Last .. 10,000pp for 7 gem studded chains? Are you sure your JC is 250? Do you have the +5% mod tool? Were talking a sapphire, a ruby and an emerald per combine along with the metal chain that should cost you no more than 2pp. So total per attempt were looking at what? 275pp at most?<br />
That is over 36 attempts and you mean to tell me you only made 7 chains? You either need to recalculate how much you really spent, or check that JC skill because that is some BAD BAD combines. At worst you should have had at least 15-18 chains made.<br />
<br />
Edit| One more thing .. yes the buy back rate sucks .. I seriously hope you didnt go into tailoring thinking you would get rich did you? BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA</div></div><hr />

<br />
At 250 JC I make about 1 in 3 chains.  1k each is a decent estimate, slightly cheaper in the long run.   A bad run of luck could easy make him go 7 for 20 to 30.</div></div><hr />

Come on .. at some point you have to stop and say &quot;Whoa I just did 6 failures in a row ..that isnt right&quot;  .. step back from the machine take a walk outside, come back and try again.<br />

Macroing programs are not only a Violation of the EULA, but seriously frowned upon by people here.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't suggest running one, no matter how timesaving.   If SoE miracuously finds a way to detect these tomorrow, you can have all of your PHAT LEWTS taken away, and possibly end up banned.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not to mention if we abuse the fact that CE is totally vendor sold, they will nerf it.   There is no maybe about it.<br />
<br />
Play by SoE's rules, or don't play.  It's that simple.<br />

<br />
The good news, you can increase your rate of success on all jewelcrafting, if you put aa points into Jewelcrafting Mastery.  The last time I had chains made, the friend who did my combines had put points into the JewelcraftingMastery.  He made 19 out of 20 chains! (I was hoping for 10)!  That would cut your chain cost almost in half, and definatly worth it to people who you do combines for.  I know people who have gone out of their way and paid more for a jeweler with JCM, simply because they wanted a greater chance of a successful combine.<br />

<br />
Macroing programs are only a violation of the EULA if you are running them without being present. If you are two boxxing on the macine right next to it, you are present and therefore can run the macro on the second machine. <br />
<br />
That isn't to say I endorse them, Or that if they &quot;detect&quot; you doing it, they won't take your &quot;phat lewt&quot; away. Just that it isn't in violation of the EULA to run a script or third party application while present, as long as it doesn't provide you with &quot;unfair&quot; information/advantages like spawn tables etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for 18 failures out of 20 on the chains ... ouch ... Maybe I am just spoiled, I have done about 80 attempts on the chain and have had roughly 35-36 successes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rassy fleetfoot</div><div class="date">12-31-2002, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a couple other money saving tips. <br />
<br />
while its a giant pain in the butt, making your own coldain temper saves about 15p per temper over buying from the vendor. 9-10p is much more preferable to 26 for me. brewing isnt hard to raise and is relatively cheap to about 158 where all this stuff is trivial. <br />
<br />
you also said you didnt think you overpaid &quot;much&quot; for things..stop overpaying! yes i know thats kinda iffy, but if the standard price for a block of whatever is less than you're paying, you're paying too much. tipping someone who brings you a lot of ore is nice but no need to go throwing money around for no reason.<br />
<br />
lastly..allll those annoying CE combines. i believe you posted you paid 5p per to be combined. try 1p per. MAYBE 2. if you need 1000 ce made, find a newb or 2, offer them 500p for 500 combines..thats a good chunk of change for lower levels..your server may vary of course but even people in your guild may jump at that. 500p for 30-40 minutes work (if that) is a nice return.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meirril</div><div class="date">12-31-2002, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, a more direct answer to your question is that the Solstice Robes are the easiest of the combines to collect materials for (as most of the components you'll need are either vendor sold or dropped for low to mid level players). If you want to cut down your costs signficantly I suspect that the dracnids in DL might be a way to do that. They certainly drop silk, and plat coins. They also drop spell components. I'm not certain if they can be used for making CE but even if they are too high of a level for that, they could probably be traded for components that can be made into CE. Just make sure to copy the full list of known combinables (heck, try all the ones you get. List may not be complete) and have at. Trade C5 for a stack of imbuned emeralds (you provide emeralds) or better yet find a HE smith that will imbune emeralds if you'll imbune mithril. Even just shout &quot;looking for a tunare cleric/druid&quot; should get some response.<br />
<br />
Chains?...everyone else here knows more about JC than I do. Good luck with those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Narith</div><div class="date">12-31-2002, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye I did have a nasty run on the chains, bought up material for 30 combines and at the worst point failed 9 in a row... ended up with 7 successes of 30 even with my eyeglass equipped.<br />
<br />
Also you are all right I am impatient. I have 400kish to work with so that's why I said money was not a problem, but it was my own fault for assuming that since I GMed jewelcraft and brewing, hit 200 with smithing baking and fletching all on about 40k total that 40k was too much for 14 points.<br />
<br />
Looks like robes are the way to go. Best bet seems to be just c5 a level 29 druid, hand em 5k, all the emeralds he can hold,  and tell him not to stop imbuing til his fingers start to bleed. Ugh and I so hoped I was done silk farming, already bought out bazaar twice over on most of that stuff.<br />

The problem you have is not realizing from the start how much plat it would take going this route... hence your suprise.<br />
<br />
I occasionally buy velium now, and pelts.. but i'm very patient with purchases.  No more than 15pp per wyvern or raptor pelt... no more than 25pp per small brick.  I don't bother with the large bricks or blocks, they're just one more click where the &quot;less than intelligent&quot; 5% minimum fail rate can spring up.  I make my own ce, and tempers... costs around 200 a stack.  <br />
<br />
My suggestion is, &quot;because you have money&quot; isn't a good reason not to spend it wisely.  Set caps on the costs you're willing to pay for items... and don't set them high.  If someone is overpriced.. simply don't buy it.</div></div><hr />

A word of warning on Solstice robes , once you start to hit the 210 mark you start to make LOTS more robes. Pre 210 I was making around 1 Robe per 40 combines , since getting to 210 I have been making about 1 Robe in 10 Combines :(</div></div><hr />

If you want an easier route to skill up Othmir caps if you can kill them(never see furs for sell in bazaar on Terris-Thule. I average about 1 fur per 4 kills).  Since you are an enchanter you can make your own vials.  They use no velium or acrylia just store bought silver thread(around 1-2pp each).  <br />

If that comment about someone buying their way to 250 with 900k-1000k is correct, then I think it's something that deserves to go in the faq, maybe thusly:<br />
<br />
Q: I have lots of money, can I just buy everything I need to skill up to 250?<br />

My spouse was quite upset that it took 40 combines to go up just 2 skill points from 158-160 and wanted to know if there was a better way to do this.  Well, I can explain that there isn't, we just have to tough it out like everyone else in the tailoring community.  Probably won't be happy about it, but maybe more accepting. :)<br />
<br />
We had managed to farm 2 stacks of superb hides and enough acrylia to do them all and then some.  Talk about time consuming, but we are fortunate that we still get exp for hunting rockhoppers.  Scarlet Desert has been kind to us.<br />
<br />
Been looking into the velious armors and starting to collect skins/pelts for those.  Also looking into farming the velium too.  Already make our own coldain velium temper, so saving money there.<br />
<br />
At least we agree that we should collect the items ourselves and only buy pelts/skins if they are cheap enough.  We'll make it to 250 eventually.</div></div><hr />

I now have a backpack full of the things I can't sell for 500pp each. I think from now on I'm just going to stick with reinforced hopper to about 230, and then switch to Wyvern. I'm one of those weird people that believes that there is a sweet spot in skilling up on certain items at certain skill levels. Anyway....The DS hoppers are about as easy to quad as the wyverns as a druid at 52 since the wolves don't aggro on me...most of the time. The flawless aren't super uncommon. If you can get yourself kei you should be able to process the hoppers fairly quickly. The Flawless hides also drop in scarlet and mons letalis.</div></div><hr />

MONEY... More Money... hehe<br />
<br />
Solstice robes are your &quot;quickest&quot; way to get the number of combines you'd need to buy your way to GM status... but it is a HUGE pp sink, lucky for you money is no problem.  Acrylia studded/reinforced armor is your best bet at skill points/per combine though, but as you said, hard to buy in quantity.<br />
<br />
Note for helping you do reinforced acrylia:<br />
<br />
  Buy every pelt you see for sale in Bazaar, just keep buying them til you save up a few stacks.   Spend your time farming the ore (I'll let you pick the spot).  Use some relaxing time with a couple friends to farm certain spots for the ore and maybe a lil xp.<br />
<br />
Good luck, some of us pp is a restriction... hehe</div></div><hr />

Im price matching in bazaar, i wont undercut just cos im price matching the guy who's already undercutting..and at a skill of 189 im afraid to do another batch of robes for fear i'll be stuck with a giant non stacking bunch of them i cant get rid of. <br />
<br />
guess its time to farm some velium again...<br />
<br />
yes its expensive, i cant imagine having 100k in the bank to play with in any event, let alone a million...**** you verant! :p</div></div><hr />

Did I mention you need a lot of patience to farm.  It takes time and energy to gather components to get tailoring to 250.  Most people give up it is so hard but it sounds like you and your wife are determined so welcome to the club of tailoring addicts.  The more things you farm yourself the better it will feel when you hit 250.  Try to find spots that can get you exp while you farm and it will not seem like a chore.  Not sure if you posted your chars' levels and classes but if you do I am sure people here can help you find good spots to exp and get a nice supply of tailoring items.<br />

So you'll get Exp and Hides for tailoring.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On my server there are always a few people selling solstise robes in the bazaar for under 200 pp.   On the weekend you can probably go vendor diving in PoK and find solstise robes on vendors for around 17 pp each.  I'm afraid the solstise robe market is about as dead as the market for acrylia masks.  You can make them but don't plan on selling them.<br />
<br />
There are still some things that can be sold for break-even or better.  Some of the cultural things sell well -- haversacks and many of the LoY robes.   Acrylia tunics sell, and sometimes cloaks, leggings, sleeves, or whatever.  Cobalt drake belts.  Black pantherskin armor has sold surprisingly well for me.  Ice silk caps or cloaks if you have a high enough success rate.  If you stick to those sorts of items you can make most of your money back from sales, if you're very patient.  But on the whole, you're really just looking for ways to reduce the costs from 300 to 200 or even to 100pp per combine most of the time.  Farming components is very effective at that, but remember how much money you're losing from not selling those components in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

I spent about 200k, but I made most of it back.  I leveled with mostly reinforced when they were affordable and I was able to sell all of my stuff.  Now I'm making alot of cash with the haversacks, but ........ my main is a 65 cleric!!! And I want to do the multi- GM quest, which means tailoring all over ago, (bangs head on wall).  Now prices on flawless and AW have double and solstice robes have died.  I'm at 212 and only plan to get to about 225-230 so I can do quest. IMO, CS is the best place for tailoring, not only fo AW and CD pelts but velious gems also.</div></div><hr />
