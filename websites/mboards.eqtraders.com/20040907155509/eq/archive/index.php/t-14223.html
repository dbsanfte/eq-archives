<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>treebouncer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">this is some research i did based on my server so it may very some.this is basically the demand for the various smithed ele armor by slot.<br />
<br />
bracers (med demand)<br />
the bracers are decent demand because there arent a ton of bracers that match the stats of ele smithed bracers. ele bracers hae some of the highest HP of buyable bracers.<br />
<br />
guants(low demand)<br />
i would not suggest making the guantlets or gloves unless you have someone who will buy them once you make them.  there are very similar in stat gloves out there for much less. or there are much better gloves for just a little bit more then the price to make ele gloves.<br />
<br />
arms(med demand)<br />
arms are one of the better pieces to make do to the fact that there are not a ton of good arms out there.  one of the better pairs of arms goes for over 100k and there around 80hp.  this is only 20hp more then earth arms and around the same hp as the water arms.  also there arent any arms that i could find that mached the mana of the fire arms.<br />
<br />
helms(low demand) <br />
there are a bunch of better helms out there then most of the ones you can smith, the only exception might be water or fire helm but like the guants i would suggest pre arranging a buyer.<br />
<br />
Tunics(med-high demand)<br />
The tunics are one of the pieces that arent very hard to sell.  if i make one of the tunics i can have it sold in a day or 2 and for a good price.  Fire and Water tunics are in very high demand, mainly because of the high mana/HP on them.  there were no BP's that i could find that matched the HP/mana on these BP's.<br />
<br />
Legs(med-high demand)<br />
The legs can be based on the same principals as the tunics.<br />
<br />
boots(med demand)<br />
there are very few boots that match the stats of ele smithed boots for the price.  they have more hp/mana then most you can buy for a decent price.<br />
<br />
this is just the research based on prices on my server and they might vary some from server to server.  but i would assume they are about the same market</div></div><hr />

<br />
People scoff at paying even under cost at 80k.<br />
<br />
They say tae ew chain not all that different and mention the small difference in AC (although they don't seem to mention or think that +40 HP is worth the cost).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Due to the rarity of the temper drops, Elemental armour (especially the Plate) is too expensive for the value.<br />
<br />
Someone was asking 300kpp for Fire Plate Boots in the Bazaar on Xegony.  I can buy Boots of the Storm for 95k or Bloodied Boots for 45k... do you really think someone would pay 300kpp?<br />
<br />
Heck, I can buy an Ornate Boot Mold for 80k!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daikoku Ashikaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Maxed out Sta, livestone is only 10-20 HP more then Tae ew<br />

<br />
Depending on  how ND, PE and PD work for chain classes.</div></div><hr />

Thanks,</div></div><hr />

More or less. The rest of the junk is too rare, or sucky in the case of inferno :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>drtyaty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What are the names of all the elemental plate?<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tricsun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">stuff from PoWater is probably the best stat wise, but it's also the toughest to farm, and the stuff is VERY rare, so it's not even worth the trouble.  PoEarth is farmable with one group for all the armor pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tricsun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Farwater = Plane of Water<br />
Inferno = Plane of fire<br />
Livestone = Plane of earth<br />
Windessence = Plane of Air</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>RoshenW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Most the drops are too rare, and it takes FAR too many drops to make it worthwhile (ie, 6 tempers for plate BP or Legs combines).<br />
<br />
Failure rate is EXTREMLY high on these pieces too.  I've combined a TON of different EP pieces, with less than an ideal success rate.<br />
<br />
The stats on this armor is on par with ornate drops (although water has more HPs and Fire has more mana...)<br />
<br />
All in all, its neat armor if you have the pieces sitting around, but not worth paying 20k per shimmering fish gill or metallic substance in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>TheGiantOne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Farwater and Livestone are only ones you will prolly ever see but even those I have been extremely lucky at times and made 60% ratio of success but other times 10% and thats GM 250 plus trophy in smithing.<br />
<br />
And I only do the combines for others.  I do not collect or buy any of the materials.<br />
<br />
Lets put it this way I did Farwater and Livestone Bp's and the costs to the person who brought me the materials was around 300k (for materials) by time he was done on just 4 attempts on each.  Only was successful on 1 bp.  No one in their right mind would pay 300k for 1 bp.<br />
<br />
Then another time I made same 4 attempts on each type bp and ended up 6 out of 8.  So that person was extremely happy and sold 6 making a very nice profit. <br />
<br />
Just look at the price of an ornate breastplate mold as an example which would run you around 140k.  If you were practical would you pay 300k for the livestone or farwater bp or buy the ornate mold and turn it in with some nice stats and effects?<br />
<br />
But in short the demand for the elemental armors is small indeed unless you want to have a full set just to say you are one of a handful who own a set and you have a boatful of plat to burn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mudcrush Durtfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">are one groupable.<br />
<br />
I have farmed water, fire, and earth for drops.  Fire is rarest... only the magma dudes drop metallic substance and they do it very rarely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>RoshenW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The main difference between ornate and EP smithed armor is the EP smithed stuff is dropable.<br />
<br />
Ornate, you may pay 140k for a BP, but once you quest it, that 140k is a sunk cost.  EP smithed armor, if you buy it in the bazaar, and outgrow it, you can sell it again, and get some cash back.. or hand it down to another guildee</div></div><hr />
