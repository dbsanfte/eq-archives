<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litetta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For those who care about the specific details of all the steps for the freebie fletching quests in the Abysmal Sea, here's the information I gathered.<br />
<br />
Imildu Woodstreak gives you the &quot;freebie&quot; quests in the Abysmal Sea. Say &quot;aid&quot; to him to receive the parts for each step. This works for all four steps.<br />
First step text:<br />
Imildu Woodstreak nods to you.  'You are as welcome here as a shade tree in the Desert of Ro, friend.  I and others have created the components needed to make arrows for the Wayfarers.  I would be grateful if you could do the final assembly for me.  Just take a Wayfarer Arrowhead, a Wayfarer Shaft, and a Wayfarer Fletching and combine them in your fletching kit.  There are many chores that need to be completed.  If you assist me with them, I might be willing to share with you the secret for treating the Chunks of Taelosian Rock to create the useful Taelosian Stones.  When you have those arrows finished, please bring them right back to me and I will make certain that they get to those that need them.'<br />
<br />
Combine the Wayfarer Arrowhead, Wayfarer Shaft, and Wayfarer Fletching he provides you in a fletching kit to make the Wayfarer Arrow. (Apparently they don't need nocks *shrugs*)<br />
Wayfarer arrow: Magic Item, No Drop, WT: 0.1 Size: small, ALL/ALL no stats, stackable<br />
Trivial 31, learnable recipe<br />
<br />
Second step in the freebie fletching quests text:<br />
Imildu Woodstreak says 'Hail, traveler.  Thank you for taking the time to help me.  I have several bow staves and strings that need to be assembled.  A simple enough task, but time consuming.  All you need to do is place the Wayfarer Bow Staff and the Wayfarer Bow String into your fletching hit and combine them.  These bows will be needed soon, so please bring them directly to me when you have them assembled.'<br />
Successfully combine 100 Wayfarer Bows and turn them in to proceed to the third step. The bows ARE stackable, so as always be sure to turn them in unstacked. <br />
<br />
Wayfarer Bow: Magic Item, No Drop, WT: 1.0, Size: small, ALL/ALL No stats, stackable<br />
Trivial 38, learnable recipe<br />
<br />
Text for the third step:<br />
Imildu Woodstreak says 'Like warm fire on a chill northern eve, you are welcome.  We have run low on bow staves.  New wood has been hard to find, but we have several staves that can be repaired with some careful work.  Place a Scavenged Bow Staff and a Wayfarer Honing Stone into your fletching kit and combine them.  The stones are not of the best quality, and will be worthless by the time you fix a single staff, but stone is not difficult to find.  When you have repaired the staves, bring them to me so I can get someone to assemble them into bows for use.'<br />
Again, everything is stackable and you need 100 successful combines to turn in before proceeding to the fourth and final step. <br />
<br />
Wayfarer Bow Staff: Magic Item, No Drop, WT: 0.5, Size: small, ALL/ALL, no stats, stackable<br />
Trivial 46, learnable recipe<br />
<br />
Fourth step text:<br />
Imildu Woodstreak smiles at you.  'You are the stars on a clear night.  I am grateful to you for your assistance.  We have several ill-prepared or damaged arrowheads that we would like to repair and put into service.  All resources must be watched carefully.  Please take a Salvaged Arrowhead and a Wayfarer Honing Stone and combine them in your fletching kit.  Some of these are badly damaged, but I think you have the skill to repair them.  Bring them to me when you are done.'<br />
<br />
Wayfarer Arrowhead: Magic Item, No Drop, WT: 0.1, Size: Small, ALL/ALL, no stats, stackable<br />
Trivial 54, learnable recipe<br />
<br />
Yep, you guessed it, 100 successful combines, returned to him unstacked. But look on the bright side, you're done with doing his dirty work! When you've completed the 400 combines for him and speak to him again, he says:<br />
Imildu Woodstreak beams a bright smile at you, one that softens his usually dour face dramatically.  'May Tunare bless you, friend.  I can no longer keep you here.  Certainly you too wish to get back out under the sun and see the new land.  Your help has allowed me much freedom, and for that I thank you.  Take this compound.  Using it when you work with the Chunks of Taelosian Rock and the Chunks of Discordian Rock will allow you to work them into the shapes you desire.'  The smell of the liquid leads you to understand what he has given you.  You will be able to incorporate that material into all of your fletching kits and work with this new stone easily.  In fact, you believe that in time you can improve on the compound and get better results.<br />
<br />
You should now be able to convert the stones in your fletching kit yourself. I haven't made it this far yet as I've only had the expansion for one day. <br />
