<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ariene</div><div class="date">12-26-2002, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I decided to try to make my spoon.  Figured I can afford one loss so I would go for it.  I noticed someone selling the Artisan's Seal in the bazaar for 8k...is this reasonable?  I actually have all the gems and I was going to ask a friend to make it for me but depending on cost I thought it might be nice to just buy it instead of asking for help.  I was prepared to pay 3-5k but 8k seemed high to me.  Anyone know what the actual cost to make these are?<br />
<br />
Also, if anyone makes them on a regular basis, I have enough gems for three combines.  Only part I'm missing is the 8 bars of velium per combine and the vial of purified mana.  I also considered getting my JC up enough to make my own mounted gems but either way I'll need an enchanter for the purified mana and a grandmaster jewler for the final combine on artisan's seal.  <br />
<br />
How did you guys do this?  What is reasonable to pay and how would you recommend going about this?</div></div><hr />

Diamond = 200pp<br />
Jacinth = 180ishpp<br />
Black Sapphire = 200ishpp<br />
Velium Bar = 262.5pp (x8)<br />
Vial of Purified Mana = 600ishpp<br />
<br />
The mounted gems have a triv of less than or equal to 142, the unfired seal has a triv of less than or equal to 102. Rumours and lies has it that the difficulty of the unfired seal doesn't reflect it's trivial, I've blown up 3 in the 8 I've made, at 240+ skill, could just be RNG tho.<br />
<br />
Cost of about 3700pp or so for the ingredients and 5 combines that should, in theory, be at a 95% success rate.<br />
8k ? mebbe, especially as a one off where you can blow up the ingredients =(.<br />
Check the bazaar for the Purified Mana and Thurgadin sells the Velium bars.<br />
<br />
Oh, and as to how I did, I have 2 GM trophies on my characters. One has JC the other has Pottery =).</div></div><hr />

I did fail a couple mounted gem combines.  I say &quot;all&quot; because I failed the final item combine (GM smithy hammer) 4 times. :(</div></div><hr />

I was 247 Pottery before I attempted it though, and got my GM Potter's Sculptor the second try.  Boy was I sweating it.   :D<br />

*edit*  Just noticed that you're in VF.  Zaelicor is a GM Jeweller isn't he?  As is Kraxia.  Might ask them for the vial of mana as well as the combine.</div></div><hr />

Both are and I know either would do it for me no problem.  In fact Kraxia was the friend I was planning to ask.  But I sort of got an itch to just do it at a time neither was online.  Then I saw 8k.  I'm still considering getting my JC up enough to do my own mounted gems just cause I like tradeskills.  Why anyone likes clicking the button an insane amount of times just to see numbers (xx) on the screen I don't know but I do and I'm adicted.</div></div><hr />

Bought the 6.5 one and failed my first spoon.  :)</div></div><hr />
