<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Coramel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi Everyone, I have a question about pottery. When I was looking for a recipe to start pottery, I found some but under each one had a unfired or something like that. It said I should do the unfired one first then the actual item but the trivials were way higher.<br />
I'm confused! lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Finae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Every Pottery item u make is first an unfired version, when i did my low skill pottery i just made the unfired version then dropped the stuff, was fast and pretty cheap until i made steins back then, i would only fire items if u wanna actually use the item or it is expensive to make, hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Unfired items are made on the pottery wheel, and usually trivial higher than firing an item. Finished items are made in the kiln using the unfired item + a firing sheet. Basically think (RL) baking, with the unfired as making cookie dough and the fired as making the actual cookies from the cookie dough. Gotta make the dough before you can make cookies, only (as often happens with RL baking, though unintentionally) you'll probably end up skipping the actual cookies and just make dough. ;)<br />
<br />
Most kiln combines will be trivial after a very short time doing the skill, so for the most part you want to stick to the wheel. For stuff like bowls the firing sheet you use to make the actual bowl from the unfired bowl will cost more than the finished bowl sells back for. So in many cases you don't want to fire the stuff you've just made, it's actually cheaper to destroy it or just litter the ground with it since you don't have to buy the firing sheets that way. Plus way less hassle.</div></div><hr />
