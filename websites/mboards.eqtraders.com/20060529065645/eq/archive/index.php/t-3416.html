<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lling</div><div class="date">02-05-2003, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been trying some new chain pieces, which are far superior to the cultural chain. So far I've made Hurricane, Nightmare, and Tae Ew BPs.<br />
<br />
I saw the Tae Ew BP priced at 25k, which I thought was pretty fair. So I priced my Hurricane at like 22k or so - it is marginally less &quot;good&quot; though the components are tougher to get. Then I saw a Nightmare tunic priced at 25k.<br />
<br />
I don't want to have pricing that is out of whack, so I'm looking for some opinions on what seems reasonable considering skill, components, and quality of the final product.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

That's probably your reason.<br />
<br />
I am planning on charging in the 25k range for both Tae Ew and Nightmare once I finish outfitting all the guild rangers in purple and green.<br />
<br />
So far 4/4 on Tae Ew Tunic, 3/3 on leggings and 2/3 on shields.</div></div><hr />
