<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, the delivery was not what we wanted, but, last night at 6:25 little Charlie was born.  He weighed 8 pounds 11 ounces, and was 21 inches long.  He was a week early.<br />
<br />
The day started off with me getting ready to go to work, and joan and Elizabeth snuggling in our bed before I had to get her ready to go to day care.  Joan got up, and felt something trickling down her leg.  Looked down, and there was a small puddle between her feet.  We thought her water had broken.  Elizabeth stayed home with her grandma, and we went to the hospital.  She was 5 cm dialated, where as she was only 3 cm on Tuesday.<br />
<br />
Her doctor came in, as he was the one on call yesterday, and checked her out.  It turned out that her water had not broken, it was only cervical mucous.  But, he decided to have her admited, as her contractions were 5 min apart, and she had progressed in dialation.  He had another patient to tend to at another hospital, then he would be back to see how she was doing.<br />
<br />
He came back about 4pm, and broke her water.  The baby did not like that, as his heart rate started to drop really low.  They had her swith positions many times, rtying to avoid having to do a c-section.  Finally, things went ok, and the baby settled down, and his heart rate went back up.  They waited about 15 min, then started her on pitocin.<br />
<br />
About 6:00 she was feeling pressure in her bottom, so they brought in the resident doctor to check to see if her cervix had changed so she could get an epidural.  Unfortunately, when she was checked, the doctor discovered that the umbilical cord had slipped past the baby's head.  So she was immediately wheeled out of her room and down the hall to have an emergency c-section.  Joan is in some pain, but she is recovering nicely, and baby Charlie is doing quite well.<br />
<br />
If all goes well, they will be coming home either Sunday or Monday.</div></div><hr />
