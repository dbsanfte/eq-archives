<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>morromid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been using items from my Guild's  Vault to make this but now I find Scent of Marr can be bought from merchants. I don't have a price but the merchants are: <br />
<br />
East Commonlands<br />
Lyth Spellstar <br />
<br />
Plane of Knowledge<br />
Loran Thu`Leth (Location is -114, +1406, -108 ) <br />
<br />
Qeynos South<br />
Hanlore Escaval <br />

<br />
Celestial Essence = Celestial Solvent + Scent of Marr combined in Mortar and Pestle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sorry but that's old news.  http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=2968&amp;menustr=035000000000</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I find it somewhat humorous that its even used in baking...  You take a piece of paper with words on it and combine with some liquid then bake it into pies... mmm good eatin!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>morromid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sure its old news but the database has it under Scent of Marr. <br />
<br />
You have to look at every single ingrediant combo for Celestial Essence to find one thats sold by a merchant, whereas my post points you right to one you can buy for Celestial Essence.<br />
<br />
 It's not the vendors that's important here. I merely added that  because I had the data, it's the fact  this is the ingrediant you can buy and not wait for a drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think the upshot of what hes getting at is.. for those newbie tradeskillers who dont know where to go for Celestial Essence... if they go into the database and look up CE, there should be a special note that says:<br />
<br />
'You can make CE from 2 store-bought items, Celsetial Solvent and Scent of Marr (purchasable in blah-blah zone)... and you can also make it with all these other dropped research junk...'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just don't forget Lyth Spellstar is extremely picky in who she sells to!  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/rant on :steamed: <br />
<br />
Why is Celetial essence not sold in PoK?!?<br />
<br />
2 items, both sold<br />
No Fail combine, anyone can do it.<br />
<br />
So why not skip the combine and buy it ready made, and I don't mean go to Bazaar and buy it there for double what it costs to make.<br />
<br />
Please, if you feel this way after making a batch of Velium Tempers, please /feedback, I have.<br />
<br />
/rant off :angel:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yeah but it would cost you like 2pp or so to make and buy from merchants for 5pp then.  then if you didn't want to make it fine.  cvt was made for about 10pp and sold at 26pp so that is what i think would happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naeadiene Needsamap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Because if it were easy it wouldn't be as rewarding when you make the final product.</div></div><hr />
