<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rubyflame</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've gotten my alchemy skill to 115, but now it won't budge. I've been making Greater Potion of Negation and also Kilva's Skin of Flame... both have a decently high success rate and yet my skill is not going up anymore. It's getting really expensive, especially the negation... anyone know if this is just a normal time for skill increase to slow down or if there's something I should be making instead to increase my skills?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rubyflame</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Forgot to mention that I'm currently level 48... this isn't the skill cap for my level is it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Velvett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think this is the correct formula for skill cap<br />
<br />
(Level - 25)*5<br />
<br />
(48-25)*5=115<br />
<br />
So .. until my formula is corrected by those more in the know .. I'd say, yes.. your skill is capped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Azirux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From the Learn Alchemy page:<br />
<br />
(Your character level minus 24) times 5<br />
<br />
(48-24)*5 = 120<br />
<br />
DUnno what to say other than make sure your wisdom is as close to max as possible. Getting KEI helps if you are not.</div></div><hr />

From the Learn Alchemy page:<br />
<br />
(Your character level minus 24) times 5<br />
<br />
(48-24)*5 = 120 <br />
That is correct.  Alchemy is first available at level 25.  If the formula were lvl-25 times 5, you wouldn't be able to start until level 26.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mogley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Skill Cap for alchemy is level 1 trhu 50 (130)<br />
Skill Cap for alchemy (180) at above level 50<br />
<br />
And yes alchemy is on eof the most expensive trade skills in the game. With KEI my wisdom is 280, and I still have poofs once in a while. Hope this helps you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Azirux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Skill Cap for alchemy is level 1 trhu 50 (130)<br />
Skill Cap for alchemy (180) at above level 50 <br />
<br />
Say What?<br />
<br />
Skill cap is as described above. it goes up 5 points per level. Final cap is 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It is definately 5 points per level over 24, not as described by Mogley.  I learned it piecmeal as I levelled, and, could not even start it until level 25.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It is either (Level-24)*5 or (level -25)*5 + 5<br />
<br />
Both work out the same but the highest you can go is 200 in alchemy.<br />
<br />
Now If I could just get my froglock Shaman to 65....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes you can only raise your skill 5 points per level, unfortunately.  But if you consider the cost of it, works out well for those that don't have a million plat laying around.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Hunt for a level, save all your plat for the next 5 skill ups hehe!<br />
<br />
Not really that bad, but yeah .... seems like it sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>PeatMoss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Question:<br />
<br />
You have all stated that Alchemy cannot go above 200.<br />
<br />
Isn't there an AA skill increase for tradeskills?  Wouldn't that allow it to go above 200?<br />
<br />
Peat Moss<br />
EC'i</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There is an AA, Tanaan Crafting Mastery, that allows you to raise additional tradeskills over 200, but, Alchemy is capped at 200 regardless of whether or not you have another tradeskill over 200, so no, it will not allow you to raise Alchemy over 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>grizzly89</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hi<br />
So what lvl do you have to be to get to 200 in alchemy?<br />
I am lvl 50 and am stuck at 130 in alchemy.Using the<br />
formula i would think you cant get to 200 until you are<br />
lvl 64?<br />
Someone correct my math or point me in the right<br />
direction,please.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
