There are a couple others around. My perspective is the demand for items is way down these days. There is enough hand me down RZ armor out there especially to make it relatively low demand.<br />
<br />
I would not recommend going into smithing with the intent of doing human cultural to make a lot of pp, I think that window is somewhat closed. You will still certainly find a few people that want some pieces, but you are going to be not only in price competition with all the other human smiths out there, but also with all the people selling their old RZ armor they have upgraded.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, there are still people trickling in asking about armor. A few of those actually have the pp to afford some armor.<br />
