<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilosh</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 03:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">http://tv.yahoo.com/news/wwn/20030319/104808600007.html<br />

Apparently somebody claiming to be &quot;From the future&quot; turned $800 into  $350 MILLION over two weeks playing the market.<br />
<br />
He claims to be from the 2200s, and have knowledge of all kinds of things.<br />
<br />
<br />
But the fact is, with an initial investment of only $800, in two weeks' time he had a portfolio valued at over $350 million. Every trade he made capitalized on unexpected business developments, which simply can't be pure luck. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The past year of nose-diving stock prices has left most investors crying in their beer. So when Carlssin made a flurry of 126 high-risk trades and came out the winner every time, it raised the eyebrows of Wall Street watchdogs. <br />
<br />
&quot;If a company's stock rose due to a merger or technological breakthrough that was supposed to be secret, Mr. Carlssin somehow knew about it in advance,&quot; says the SEC source close to the hush-hush, ongoing investigation. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The part that really gets me is this...<br />
<br />
<br />
Officials are quite confident the &quot;time-traveler's&quot; claims are bogus. Yet the SEC source admits, &quot;No one can find any record of any Andrew Carlssin existing anywhere before December 2002.&quot; <br />

<br />
All he wants is to be allowed to return to the future in his &quot;time craft.&quot; <br />
<br />
Hehe, I'd love to hear his information on the location of Osama Bin Laden and the cure for AIDS.  Wouldn't it be freaky if he was actually right?<br />

The future must be pretty bleak if someone comes back to now just to make a fortune on the stock market.   :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Weekly World News will continue to follow this story as it unfolds. Keep watching for further developments. <br />
<br />
<br />
This is not a real story, completely and utterly fiction.  Saw it a few days ago on another board.</div></div><hr />

I love the Onion *looks over at his daily calender* and the Daily Show.  Sometimes fake news is better than the real stuff.   ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delfontes</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Daily show is factual news for 75% of it, they just say it in a humerous way.<br />
<br />
Like they'll show the looting of bagdad with actual footage, but just show the office furniture, and make jokes about how it was a shortage of chairs that was ruining the country.<br />
<br />
They do make stuff up, but I don't think they've ever tried to pretend something was real.<br />
<br />
Like the satellite feeds to bagdad when you know the guy is in the studio, hehe.<br />
<br />
When they totally botch translations for humor, it is very obvious what they are doing I think, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quinner Sparrowhawk</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What really amazes me about these &quot;Newsrags&quot; is that they will maintain that all of their stories are true, as if Fox, CNN, and MSNBC wouldn't be all over these stories in a heartbeat. The mainstream media is so desperate for ratings that no story, no matter how silly, is ignored. There are no &quot;scoops&quot; in the communication age.</div></div><hr />
