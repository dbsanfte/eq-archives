<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Diania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Idea rattling around in my head for a few days now, been trying to think of some holiday related recipes that you can make in game, and for some reason I can't think of many.  Was gonna bake up a bunch and stick them on my bazaar mule to sell (who's now outfitted in very bright christmas colors).  Just for sheer roleplay value, and it's the holidays, I thought it would be fun.  Can anyone else think of some holiday related foods to bake up ingame?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There were several great ideas posted in this thread (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=12018).<br />
I'm sure folks can come up with more though.</div></div><hr />
