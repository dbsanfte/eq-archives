<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mojobeastie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering since I do not currently own GoD, Can I skill up on the recipes from that expansion?  Either purchasing the items or having others gather them for me.</div></div><hr />

The only exception to this would be for PoP combines  that utilize the Tanaan/PoK containers.</div></div><hr />

There's one other exception.  If you can't get to the Abysmal Sea, you can't do the quests or reach the folks who refine materials, so having unrefined materials would be useless.  So, even though raw pale nihilite and Taelosian tea leaves are droppable, they're of no use to someone without GoD.<br />
<br />
If you get someone else to refine them or take them to the refining NPCs, then you're covered. <br />

Unless i'ts a droppable container IE planar fletching kit etc ;D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One of those planar kits is ND. I think it's fletching, or else it's sewing. But it's still amusing. <br />

Or annoying.... <br />
