<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>illovich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just curious, given that the smithed Surefall fletching Kits are no drop, I guess I have to get my smithing skills on my ranger up in order to make one.<br />
<br />
Out of curiosity, how many people bothered to go that far, and how many people went to say 100 or so and just ate the cost of the combines until you had a success?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you are trying to make just one of them for use, then if they are cheap enough, just try the combine a few times.  I bet you succeed before long.<br />
<br />
I had found a bunch (25) of unfired opal encrusted steins on a vendor.  With 0 pottery skill, I fired them, and succeeded on like 6 or 8 of them (no skill ups though).  It was easier to do that then to transfer to my main who has 120 pottery and would have fired all but 1 of them (gotta throw in one failure.  LOL.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My halfling alt took his smithing to 120. With that and his geerlok smithing hammer he succeeded on his first attempt at his rivervale sewing kit and on his second attempt at his surefall fletching kit.<br />
<br />
Neither kits use parts which are hugley expensive and the thing to remember about trivials is that they are not required levels just caps on the skilling experience you can gain. You can attempt any combine even at skill 1 and have a small chance at success.<br />
<br />
Don't forget to make your steel working knife when you make your fletching kit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ixiola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can't speak to the Karana bows, but before you dismiss needing to learn smithing, make sure you read all the recipes on what's needed to make the high end bow.<br />
<br />
I'm a wood elf fletcher, so am extrapolating based on what I have to do to make the BFT (the high end Tunare bow).  I (initially) thought I'd ask someone else to make the fletching kit for me (similar to just trying a lot until you succeed) until I started looking closer at the recipe.  What a found is that many of the subcombines require wood elf smithing to do.  So either I have to hunt down a wood elf smith every time I wanted to make a bow or arrow, or I could just bite the bullet and train smithing to around 150 skill.<br />
<br />
I chose the second route..</div></div><hr />

Yup, this is the way to go. I made my fletching kit at smithing 122. My fletching went from 214 to 224 making the steel arrows, my smithing went from 122 to 171 during this. I figure by the time my fletching is 230 my smith will be 188.  The only disadvantage is the steel arrowheads might be a bit more expensive skill up to go up to 188, but the ease of skilling up both overwrote that for me.<br />

PS. the RNG loved me during subcombines for smithing, I skilled up about 1 outta 4 or 5. I'm taking a tradeskill break right now after 8k and 120 combines to get 1 fletching skillup  /sigh</div></div><hr />
