17APR2003 ** UPDATE *** Released v1.01 <br />
- Removed some duplicate recipes that snuck into the data<br />
- Added brewing recipes for Zek Bane weapons<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
I finally finished the brewing compendium that goes hand in hand with the baking compendium that I created earlier.  It will work completely stand-alone but will work even better if you use the baking version also.  Each recipe ingredient is tied to it's own recipe if one exist (the exception to this is water flasks and short ale, they are used far to often and are common merchant items)<br />
I've also added a few recipes that weren't listed on the EQTraders brewing lists.  I'll get them submitted soon. <br />
<br />
You can download the file from here:<br />
obsidian.efrontco.com/regression/LothBake_108.zip (Baking Version)<br />
obsidian.efrontco.com/regression/LothBrew_104.zip (Brewing Version)<br />
obsidian.efrontco.com/regression/LothPott_101.zip (Pottery Version)<br />
obsidian.efrontco.com/regression/LothComp01July2003.zip Baking, Brewing and Pottery in one download<br />
<br />
Just unzip the file to your storyline directory using full paths.  No files should be overwritten unless you have a previous version installed.  If you have a previous version installed, you may want to delete the files associtated with it just to get a fresh install.</div></div><hr />

If you mean tradeskills, yes.  I'm currently working on pottery (which so far has been the hardest one).  I'll continue to update the existing mods as I get new info also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love using the compendiums in the game and thought I'd make sure to let others know that they exist as many in my guild had NO idea how I could answer questions about recipes so quickly.<br />
<br />
EDIT: well I just saw for the first time the entire section devoted to guides and UI mods, LOL, but in case you had missed that section like me, now you know it is there.</div></div><hr />

I just need to get into the game and test it along with the new pottery compendium. So, be on the look out over the next few days for an update to this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LothanEQ</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wanted to bump this since it was updated today. I guess edits don't move the post in the list.</div></div><hr />
