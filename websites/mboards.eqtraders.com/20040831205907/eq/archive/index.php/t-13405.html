<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rissenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Right now I am at 204+5% and counting.<br />
<br />
I am currently doing the Opal encrusted steins for skill-ups, but have to stop every so often to sell them of as each stein take a full slot in a bag.<br />
<br />
Now, what i wonder is if any of you have any good options to skill up on that:<br />
<br />
A) Are stackable,<br />
B) Sell back to vendor for only a slight loss OR, <br />
C) Will sell in Bazaar eventually.<br />
D) Trivials between 210 and upwars.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any help or ideas would be helpful.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Iannyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1. No<br />
2. No<br />
3. Only if you want to try and get skillups off of planar pottery focus items.  Oh, and the occasional Golden Idol of X (where x = common diety)<br />
4. See above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That was concise LOL<br />
<br />
No finished pottery items besides ceramic linings stack as far as I know.<br />
<br />
Nothing sells back to a vendor for anything close to what you spend on it.<br />
<br />
Golden idols of tunare eventually sell as people need more solstice earring (and star ruby steins will a bit too).  Faithstones/Spiritstones can sell but mostly on a custom basis and so are hard to skillup on - planar pottery items sell well but don't expect to find a lot of the materials needed to make them and expect to fail rather frequently.<br />
<br />
Check the trivial list for pottery in the recipe section.  Stuff to make are crucibles of escape, some of the different bands, old style idols and the star ruby steins and golden idols.  Except for the last two the others make nice gifts but never really sell well, ok, except the crucibles for the people really good at marketing.<br />
If high end pottery items were used for some skill path high end smithing or tailoring combine stuggling potters would be set for life.  I share your pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I did it, I trashed the opal encrusted steins when I ran out of space.<br />
<br />
The cheapest option as I recall was the planar stein, don't recall off hand how high that will take you though, and can't access the main site from here.<br />
<br />
I did mix in golden idols of tunare, as they do sell in the bazaar, at a profit even, so long as you can get your success rate up to 60% or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Iannyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh, and I left out the non-golden idols.  But those aren't gonna pay for themselves either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xorithra L`Amante</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My best route was Cazic Thule idols.  My boyfriend had levelled up a mean little troll shaman for his steelweave tailoring, so it only took a little coaxing and some puppy dog eyes to get him to imbue stacks... erm I should say bags.... bags and bags of ambers.<br />
<br />
Very little loss compared to the other routes.  Didn't fire them.  So... you can either make friends or, if you don't mind putting a little time and money into it (a lot initial instead of a lot throughout as opposed to the non-imbued gem encrusted steins), level up a Cazic Thule shaman to 29.  You could even buy him the cheap horse, meaning you would lose about 3k (sell back is about 66% I think).  If you have any mana battery friends (bards, necros, and enchanters, though they dont fall into the mana battery category), this would be great.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, back to the drawing board.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

Hope it helps ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rissenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the input all.<br />
<br />
Ardath - seeing those result scores make me cry...I have INT 275 and have made around 320 attempts on opal steins, resulting in 2 skill-ups.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is time..I am now gunning for 65 and uber-INT. I have tired so &lt;curse words here&gt; so I want max chance of skilll-ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There's one option that everyone is skipping, probably because you asked for over 215 combines, but if you're at 204 right now, try doing unfired planar steins.  They're 11 plat for store-bought stuff, and 6 more if you buy your tainted planar essences from vendors (more if you get them in the Bazaar).  That's cheaper than most other items and doesn't require you to run down a friendly enchanter or find imbuers.  They'll get you to 216, and you can fire them into steins that sell (the peridot ones sell for the Beginner's Stealth Manual quest, and others will move, although not fast at all).  After that, drill steins and sell them, or drill white ceramic bands and throw them away, depending on your patience level and bankroll.  After 222, go to non-golden idols, with side trips into crucibles as you can get or farm heavy clay.<br />
<br />
Good luck with your throwing!<br />

That's why I stopped doing them to do idols ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I honestly saw no significant difference in skillup rate regardless of what item I was creating at the time.  I got unlucky for a while on casserole dishes, same for star ruby steins.  Other times I got lucky with the exact same items.</div></div><hr />
