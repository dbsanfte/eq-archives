<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xedric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dragged a group out to the 2nd cy last nite,  on the last 2 mobs got my 3rd sap and a solidified magma and was feeling pretty lucky.  Nope!  Failed tunic attempt #5  then turned around and failed the burner combine as well, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jora_Delossian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I hear ya.  I've failed that darn tunic eight times now.  Once I finally have this earring, I'm going to kill that halfling if I have to recruit half the server to help me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Succeeded tunic first try with 220 skill (and a geerlok).<br />
<br />
Proceeded to fail twice on the bow with 227 + geerlok.<br />
<br />
But I'm done now. ^_~<br />
<br />
And yes, Aid Grimel ranks up there on my list of &quot;mobs that i'd kill just for the sake of killing if i could&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm angry at PoF for another reason entirely...<br />
<br />
Nobody ever goes and kills the MoBs that drop Metallic Substances!!!!!  :irked:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xedric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Failed attempt #6 too, grrr.<br />
<br />
On a positive note I took a day off the fire farm,  went to sol ro's for a few hours got two ornate molds, went to earth got the components to drop and made a stonewood compound bow, then after 9k in the casino won some holgresh elder beads  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xedric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sigh,  up to 8th failure now  :grumpy:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rhyianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">metallic substances are stupidly rare angel.  have done pof a lot, and i have 1. and i dont remember seeing them drop at raids either.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xedric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">YAY, bought the other 3 saps she had and on attempt 11 finally got the **** tunic made.  air bow made on first attempt and had party platters already made as well. /hug new earring   :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jora_Delossian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Grats.  I managed to make mine on try #9.</div></div><hr />

I've been told they drop off some MoBs around some bridge?<br />
<br />
Basically, the MoBs are out-of-the-way from Raids and too close together for Groups to bother trying to separate them.  :irked:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm seriously considering rousting out a guild raid with the sole purpose of clearing PoF (or giving it our best shot, anyway) so we can farm tradeskill bits.  We could REALLY use some of the drops from there.<br />
<br />
Of course, convincing our guild leader (never mind 60-odd members) that getting a Metallic Substance is just as good as getting a 100hp or 100 mana piece of armor is another story ... they just want to go farm named, then grind exp in Earth ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, it's a longshot, but if the &quot;100 mana&quot; is desirable, point them to the fact that 2 Metallic Substances will give you a shot at FireHide Pants (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=6915&amp;menustr=080110160000) .<br />
<br />
Like I said, they probably won't come rushing.   Unless they are Aid grimel skillers, too.<br />
