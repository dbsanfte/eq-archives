<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Halabut-Rathe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Need a tradeskill farm camp issue cleared up for me.<br />
<br />
The Haze Panther camp, in WL - assuming a person can keep the spawns cleared, can a single person claim all the panthers in zone as 'camped'?<br />
<br />
Do folks share this camp at all, or do single people take turns?<br />
<br />
What generally happens when someone is farming them by themselves, and another tradeskiller zones in to farm also?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any answers given,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Myrron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Since it's an outdoors area where the mobs wander all over the zone, I never really have considered it a camp, much like I would not consider the crag spiders in EK a camp.  So to that end, if there are multiple people farming, I say whoever finds one first gets it.  That's just my perspective though, I'm sure others will differ in opinion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>maedie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm on Xev, and I haven't had too much trouble when I go to farm haze panthers for tinkering.  If there is someone else in the zone when I zone in, I usually just send them a tell to see what they are there for. (it's a fairly underutilized zone.)  If it's haze panthers for eyes/skins, then I just farm something else until they are finished. If it's just regular panther skins, I offer them some of the panther skins I collect also, in exchange for eyes that drop. Sometimes they are open to that exchange; it's not the most fun zone to camp so two people slaughtering panthers is better then one. :)  But basically, I consider a call of &quot;haze panther&quot; as a camp, since they are so rare and are &quot;spawned&quot; by the work of slaughtering regular panthers.  (and the zone area where they spawn and wander is easily trackable; usually only a section of zone, not the entire zone.)<br />

Random roaming trash, is not a camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sluggo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I detest fighting over camps. Although Haze panthers tend to spawn in one area more often than others in WL, I do not consider it a good idea for one person to claim &quot;all panthers in the zone&quot; as a camp. I generally go and see if anyone else is there. If no one is there I camp them.<br />
If I am camping them and someone starts killing too. I share it. (you may get the rude person who comes in, starts killing then demands you stop even though you have been there for hours, but, hey, there are jerks everywhere).<br />
I would say, try to share on that area. Just send tells, be friendly, and the vast majority of the time people there will be happy to share. (It is a very quiet zone on my server).<br />
See Ya! Sluggo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Remi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Outdoor, random spawning mobs over most of the zone is not generally considered a &quot;camp&quot;.  However, if, when I arrive, I find someone else is camping them, I'll respect their efforts and come back another time.  If two or more are camping them, then it's impossible to determine who spawned the Haze panther and I'd think it's first to engage the Haze Panther.  <br />
<br />
When I've been camping them and one or more arrives and insists on sharing the camp, generally I'll stop killing normal panthers, wait 20-30 minutes watching for haze panthers since those would be the ones I spawned, then leave the area and go camp for some other tradeskill ingredient.</div></div><hr />

It's like someone in CC answering &quot;orcs&quot; to a camp check. Some people think they can have them all. It's selfish to think so.<br />
It's not right to try to camp a whole zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a different situation.  I've never done this particular camp, but I've had problems with trackers swooping in in the SW corner of EW when I kill walruses and snap up all the man-o-wars that I spawned by killing the placeholders.  If they want to kill the manos, they better be helping me kill the bloody place holders.</div></div><hr />

Actually, orcs dont spawn all the way throughout CC so it is a tad different.  There is also the slight issue of being able to keep them all clear.  Unless you are AEing from the zone in down to the city you can't keep everything clear (at least, Ive never seen it done, and yes, I do solo AE from the ZI down to the city gates if there is no danger of training anyone).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sallidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have been camping Geos in CC for a while now and I have seen many many people come in to do miners in CC. 65's come in quite often, round up every orc in zone and kill them in about 5 minutes then wait for the respawn. I check tracking every 30 seconds or so from habit and when there's not an orc in the zone, it's noticable. And happens pretty often too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Camping is really a player ideology where we as players attempt to respect another’s hunting area or MOB. If you ask a GM they will most likely if not always tell you to share. <br />
<br />
Of the GM speakers I’ve seen at DragonCon and perhaps those that have been to Fan Fair will know that there isn’t any true “camping” that is recognized by the GM’s, everyone is entitled to hunt a particular area as well as a particular MOB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>dmuerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">When i farm the orcs in cc i do them all unless there are people there all ready gettign exp or velium themselves.  <br />
<br />
Usually im about it in the zone. I run through aggro every thing that moves and pbae them till they are dead.<br />
<br />
If there are people there allready its not worth the stress to fight with people over ts supplies.  Make an agrement and move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>gnormy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My experience as a non-tracker trying to hunt these guys is that my chances of getting there ahead of a tracker are pretty darn slim.  Now if the dispute were between two or more trackers - i could see how this could easily escalate into a contention.  Best advice is try to talk about to some agreement or accept that the area isnt big enough for the both of you and rather then fighting - just come back another time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">In general, you can't claim roamers.  First-to-aggro rule applies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What usually happens for me is that when I'm there, I'm the only ones killing them, grats me. If another person/group comes in, once I notice, I'll usually take off. It's not fair to either of us since we are both overturning the spawn of black panthers and then it's a race to the haze panther spawn, so I usually leave.<br />
<br />
No, I don't think it's a call-able camp, but I do think only one person/group can farm them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fufinski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">When I do CC I would only bother if I was the only person doing them as I could melee them all and wait for respawn.  Once other peopel came in I would usually finish the cycle I was on and leave as it wasent worth my time to just do a small number.  <br />
<br />
<br />
As for haze panthers I never activly hunt them.  I will usually be in zone doing Tigeraptors and trying to forage Yew leaves.  I do tend to slay a few panthers when nothing else is up just to kill time, but would probably leave haze panthers to anyone activly camping them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rendlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Random, roaming spawns do not equal a camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Random, roaming spawns do not equal a camp.<br />
Well, they really aren't random. There are specific spawn spots and the panther that spawns there follows a specific path. They just path over half the zone. =)<br />
<br />
If someone is there farming for haze's, then it's unfair to both you and them if you start farming for haze's too because when one pops, you'll both race for it.<br />
<br />
Frogs in PoStorms aren't a camp either, but it's so not worth picking a fight over them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Cragzop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Interesting - on Xev ZI frogs and Forest Frogs (FF) are pretty well respected camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">One druid/necro/chanter/bard/ranger/sk/wizard can keep the forest frogs clear, so there's some logic behind calling them a camp, even if it is selfish and retarded (which is why if I need a pet to go giant slaying, I'll just grab one), but zi frogs?  there's like 30-40 of them in the caves and the first 10-12 are easy to pull without caster humanoids with faction hits adding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Thicket Tundrabog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">&quot;Play nice&quot; is always the preferred approach. Nevertheless, panthers/haze panthers is not a camp, in my opinion. These are not static spawns. You have to race over a large section of the zone. Trackers have a tremendous advantage.<br />
<br />
Orc miners also aren't a camp unless you are in a static spot (in my opinion) such as pit bottom. I can keep the zone clear of orc miners by single nuking them. There is a definite pattern of spawns and a miner has an average life span of less than 30 seconds. It would be very difficult for someone to 'steal' the miners, if you have the spawns timed.<br />
<br />
Another oft-contested 'camp' is shades in Twilight Sea which are farmed for Swirling Shadows. I personally do not consider the island a camp, even though I can keep the entire island clear. There are differing opinions though. Although the shades roam, they are restricted to a relatively small island so many folks consider it a camp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Oh, PoS forest frogs are a &quot;camp&quot; on The Rathe as well - I just don't think they are, so I just don't go there. I don't piss off anyone, myself included.<br />
<br />
Lately, I've been going into PoN, politely stealing a stalker (ask whomever is killing them if I may have one for a pet) and then kill slargs. Not great xp, but kinda fun. I need to get better at charming anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'm with Chen. Many people consider places or spawns &quot;camps&quot; that I would never consider a camp, but it's not worth the aggravation to argue with people. I'm always ready to move on rather than argue about it.</div></div><hr />
