<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crun Chiewenwet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't pay a huge amount of attention to this forum, so it's possible this could have been hashed out already.  However the last time I looked it seems to me that the consensus was that skill level did not affect the item fished so much as the likelyhood of catching something vs nothing vs trash..... ie if you caught something good your chances of it being cod were as good as your chances of catching snapper or fresh fish..... and while that may in fact be true, I do have an interesting tidbit to add to the discussion.<br />
<br />
I recently found myself spending an inordinate amount of time fishing in AS.... big surprise there:) ..... with my 53 cleric who has fishing skill of 200.  I caught a wide range of fish from 5 to 15 pounds, and enjoyed myself for quite a while.  However I got to a point where I needed the cleric for other things, and didn't much care for the trip, so I grabbed my 47 necro who had a fishing skill of oddly enuf 47, and took him out there instead.  As expected I got a lotta no catches and sandels etc etc, but what threw me was when I caught a 1 pound saltwater tuna..... my cleric NEVER got a 1 pounder.  I had taken 64 stacks of bait, and after about 15 stacks I noticed I had around 17 1 pounders, and 19 2 pounders.  I was reading a book while I fished, and throughout the day I spent probably 6 to 7 hours total using up all the bait.  What's interesting, is that when I went to sell, I had not caught a single other 1 or 2 pounder, the same stacks of 17 and 19 were never completed.  I would guess that when I first saw those stacks, my skill was somewhere between 80 and 100, but that's a very rough guess, couldn't have been over 110 or so though, cuz I checked the skill at 120 not too terribly many stacks after that.  So, what I see is that it took less than 15 stacks to catch 17 1 pounders, and over the next 49 stacks I caught exactly 0 1 pounders..... this would seem to indicate that skill level has a direct link to the item caught, and specifically that after a certain skill level it is impossible or nearly impossible to catch fish below a certain weight.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>vovinit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">at 200 with the summoned fishing pole I never catch a fish lower than 7 pounds. With a regular pole 6 pounds is the lowest. So yes skill does play a factor in the weight of the fish caught.<br />

On a side note somone mentioned in another post that fishing had been nerfed in abysmal on test. I tried to get there earlier but Nedaria's was bugged badly and I fell through the boat as did another guy that was there. I didn't get the opportunity to see if this was true or not. Has anyone fished on test in the last day? If so what was nerfed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Elder Neodoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">according to all reports, it has been nerfed :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brildary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh, it's so sad...the one and only golden moment in fishing,where you could actually cash in on all your time and effort, is just a memory. Man, it was sweet while it lasted...6 stacks of bait, 600 plat. Dreamy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aalar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just happen to sell a fish back to the vendor shortly after the expansion came out.  I could not believe what I got for it.  I made several thousand plat fishing there before the nerf.<br />
