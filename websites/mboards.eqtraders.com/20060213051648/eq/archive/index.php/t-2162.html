<br />
IF any yuz can help making him tempers fer EE bricks let im know<br />
<br />
Fulorian got +15% Gloves too<br />
<br />
( IF +15% goes OVER 252 smiffing  does that make him hmm a 287 smith? thus making him the highest smiff in Xegony?? )<br />
<br />
<br />
Heard that + Med % items no go over 252 nub sure if this tru OR if it includes Smiffing )<br />
<br />
OOH an Gamgan is now 230 smiff + Hammer</div></div><hr />

<br />
2) Plenty of Brewers, just have Umgrog write down a few names and try looking 'em up. ;)<br />
<br />
3) I've got 4 Orbs, 4 Staffs, 6 Shields, 3 Yaks, 31 Folded Sheets of Acrylia &amp;amp; ~40kpp waiting for you.  I'm also starting to run out of finished weapons. :D<br />
<br />
4) I'm out of Sickles again, even after finding someone selling 'em at 2k and buying them out. ;)  I really need to find a way to get Angel's Smithing skill up so I can make a few of these things myself!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Will get stuff ready then so wen we meet gamgan will turn them all  into Worked versions so we can stock pile dem<br />
<br />
When gam gots higher level smiffing then will turn them into Finished items <br />
<br />
( Worked = trivial around 170 smiffing )<br />
<br />
( Finished items = Trivial over 250  )</div></div><hr />

If I happen to be peeking in on my mule, I will buy supplies for Gammy.<br />
<br />
I pay 125-150p for Acrylia Blocks... depending on my mood, how much room I have and who you are. ;)<br />
<br />
I pay 350-450p for Blue Diamonds...  See above.<br />
<br />
I will pay no more than 500p for any SSoYs, MM Shields, Shimmering Orbs, Staff of the Observers or Runed Falchions.  We're pretty stocked up on EBMs, Obsidean Shards &amp;amp; Sharkbone Hammers, so I won't pay more than 50p for those.</div></div><hr />

If you have large bricks of acrylia and don't need them, I could put them to use.  Let me know how many and if there's anything you'd like in exchange for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Several weeks ago, I talked with Gamgan about doing some combines.<br />
<br />
I 2box an ogre warrior/shaman pair.  So my goal would be 2 rallos zek swords and the rallos zek shield.  Now, I know how rude it is to show up with missing components... so I plan to have absolutly everything.<br />
<br />
Since that time, I've slowly collected 10 blue diamonds... 4 ssoy's (OMG talk about price inflation) and a crested mistmore shield (stupid thing is lore).<br />
<br />
I also took brewing to 187 *hic* (what sellback), did the wander the swamp thing and produced 5 bile templars.<br />
<br />
I still need to get the acrylia and get with a guild smith to premake the infused sheets.  My smith is only 119 and while trying to help nail down the trivial on the folded sheets would be a noble effort... I can't afford that kind of gamble :)<br />
<br />
I figure it will take me about another week to raise pottery high enough to dust the blue diamonds and raise the money for the acrylia blocks...<br />
<br />
Once I get everything together, is there a usual time that your in the grobb area that I could bring the components.  I've looked for Gamgan in the game for a few days and haven't seen him...  If he's gone, or if I took too long and he's already maxed out his trade skill then I'm going to have a couple of really unhappy ogres :)<br />
<br />
Craig<br />
<br />
p.s.  If the RNG smiles and you make more than 2 ssoy's, the extras are yours... of course.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're not too late.  Just a few suggestions...<br />
<br />
1) Mistmoore Shields are Lore, but you have 2 characters. ;)<br />
2) The Tempers are the stopping block right now, specifically Swamp Veggies.  Bring extra if you can, please. ;)<br />
3) If you have trouble locating Gamgan, come see me (Adelie) in the Bazaar (or one of my characters on the rare nights I'm out playing).  I'm more than willing to trade finished items for supplies, preferably on a 3-1 basis... but Gammy has stated 2-1 is fair.  I have a few mules in the same area, so I can take multiple Lore items.<br />
4) If you have any reason (or just random chance) to come across Runed Falchions, Shimmering Orbs or Staff of the Observers... please bring them along.  Every little bit helps. :)</div></div><hr />

If you still need to dust the blue diamonds, I'll do it for you.  Just bring me the supplies.  I'm usually in Felwithe, but PoK and Bazaar aren't a problem for me either.  Pottery skill is 220 + Geerlok.</div></div><hr />

Yes yes, Angel needs to get out more ;)<br />
<br />
Veggies kinda pain in gaduk to get fer gam<br />
<br />
So what do these veggies look like, on the ground in the swamp?<br />
Main reason I'm asking is, I'll probably be in the Guk area with my paladin, and could grab a few...  Except I'm green colorblind.  So I was kinda wondering how hard they are to spot.  (like if someone could respond with a screenshot, that'd be great ;) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goresmash</div><div class="date">02-11-2003, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They look like little (And I mean tiny) blue (For mushrooms) and red(for veggie) little spots on the ground.  Generally when I am looking for them I have ultravision up since I find it easier to see them in all that swamp.  And generally they spawn right near or in the water.</div></div><hr />
