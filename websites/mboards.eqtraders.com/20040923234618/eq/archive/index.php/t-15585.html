<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SeylIt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm currently a 56 druid. Total spent on smithing so far is around a couple hundred plat I think.<br />
<br />
Well, I hit 127 on Cultural Needles and didn't want to make more needles and essence, so it was decision time. <br />
<br />
A) Buy HQ ore, make rings, and go the Ornate route to 146 or 162. I was thinking of buying the ore because I can probably make more plat killing in the time it would have taken me farm FS weapons. And I could some exp at same time.<br />
<br />
B) Farm the FS weapons and do the conversion thing.<br />
<br />
Then I was reading these wonderful threads and learned about the possibility of Vale Sewing Kits or Steel Arrowheads... at least for Karana worshippers.<br />
<br />
Vale kits require either farming FS or buying it... then there are the inevitable, although hopefully small, combine failures.<br />
<br />
But the arrowheads... 6.1 plat each, successful combines resell to vendors for 1p, 9g, 5c and you make two per successful combine. Sounded promising. So here's my data. I had to do them in sort of small runs due to the steel bars not stacking.<br />
<br />
All purchases and sales were made with Charisma of 112 and combines with a geerlok and 255 wisdom (including a KEI mgb). I'm also just paranoid enough to think maybe it helps to keep my strength up, so I had a Fo7 (from that same mgb session).<br />
<br />
Starting skill: 127<br />
<br />
These are listed as number of attempts, number of skill, number of arrowheads produced (each success yields two heads):<br />
<br />
10 attempts.... -131 skill .... 8 arrowheads<br />
15  .................. -135 ......... 12<br />
15  .................. -141 .........  20<br />
15  .................. -144 .........  24<br />
15  .................. -147 .........  12<br />
10  .................. -149 ...........   8<br />
16  .................. -152 .........  24<br />
15  .................. -157 .........  24<br />
15  .................. -162 .........  16<br />
15  .................. -163 .........  22<br />
15  .................. -165 .........  30<br />
20  .................. -168 .........  28<br />
15  .................. -171 .........  28<br />
15  .................. -172 .........  30<br />
15  .................. -174 .........  26<br />
15  .................. -177 .........  26<br />
15  .................. -179 .........  28<br />
15  .................. -181 .........  28<br />
15  .................. -182 .........  30<br />
15  .................. -183  ......... 28<br />
15  .................. -185 .........  28<br />
10  .................. -186 .........  20<br />
10  .................. -186 .........  20<br />
15  .................. -186 .........  28<br />
13  .................. -188 .........  26<br />
<br />
Total Combines: 349<br />
Successes: 287 for 574 arrowheads<br />
<br />
Costs: 2,232 plat for materials<br />
Minus  1,119 sale of arrowheads to vendors<br />
Total:  1,113 plat.<br />
<br />
I recouped this plat from one run of Kaladim Constitutionals made in 20-30 minutes and sold overnight (42 attempts, 100 KC's made).<br />
<br />
So this seems like a cheap and easy route for a Karana druid. Port into Surefall, make em til you need more space or plat then port back to Nexus and run into Bazaar bank. Port back to Surefall and repeat.<br />
<br />
I have learned so much from these forums, I hope I can help someone else with this route. At least it seemed like a good one to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did these before the nerf and actually made money on the Arrowheads, but still, it's a great path for us Karana worshippers. <br />
<br />
I wish I'd known at release that choosing a particular deity actually would mean something some day...</div></div><hr />
