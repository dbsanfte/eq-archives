<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i have a lv 3 warrior i am only twinking through player made items from my main though he can keep anything he loots.  after the thread about role-playing vegetarian cooking i wanted to try this.  so far he is in a complete suit of fine plate and look rocking.  my main is a wizard so warriors are a bit strange to me.  <br />
<br />
obviously i need an enchanter to enchant the metal.  i have jc at 100 but will get more.  i was thinking of the gold geode rings from ldon.  figure i need at least 180 to start though its pretty cheap since its foraged if i can get the gem cheap.  <br />
<br />
smithing is 165 and want to get it higher when i get another stack or 2 of leather padding again.  have geerlock which is how i made the fine plate in the first place.  want to put him in gothic ldon armor.  plan to switch from the weapons i have on him atm to combine acrylia when i can get the temper.<br />
<br />
baking is at 212 atm so he is eating some halas 10lb pie.  <br />
<br />
any other suggestions.  after my lv 43 wizard it is fun to play a toon that can just beat stuff up.  :)<br />

baby warrior (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=764711)<br />
<br />
any suggestions or ideas?  this is more of an experiment atm.  going to see what the cost to make everything is when i have equipped him (assume no fail, lol, yeah right) and see if i could get better mob dropped gear in bazzard for cheaper.  i think so but i also enjoy that he is only wearing stuff i made.  make he proud hehe.  now to get up brewing to 200 and attempt a few grobbs. :)</div></div><hr />
