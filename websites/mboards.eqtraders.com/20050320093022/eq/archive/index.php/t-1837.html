How do I turn OFF the automatic marking of threads as READ when I have not read them?<br />
<br />
There are many, many posts that I simply do not get a chance to read everyday in all the forums, but when I make the time, I notice they become marked as READ after some XX number of days.  Is there a way to disable this?  I would like to have threads I have not read remain UNREAD to me until I get the chance to read them myself.  It's getting confusing not knowing which ones I have read and which ones I haven't now.<br />
<br />
Please.... help!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way that this can be fixed slows the boards down to about 25% of the speed it has now (because of the marketplace forums) and causes some errors that deny access to people when a certain thresh-hold is met.<br />
<br />
SO basically... there is no fix for this.<br />
<br />
I make sure I will ahve a chance to read all the boards at once when I sit down to read them, and note the timestamp listed at the top of the forums and just read everything newer than that timestamp :/<br />
<br />
And you are lucky.  For MANY people as soon as you read ANY thread, or make a post (it is inconsistant) ALL threads are read, even if one is not through with their reading.</div></div><hr />
