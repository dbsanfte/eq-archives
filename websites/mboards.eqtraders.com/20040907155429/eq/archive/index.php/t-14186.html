<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mirquendie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Skilled up to 250 in Thurgadin, with Grimthor Brewbeard peering over my shoulder and mocking me for making weak ol' elfy drinks like champagne.  (I'll have to come back and show him later.)  So Drinal server has one more GM, and I have one out of seven checked off my list and 385 skillups left to go for the 250 club.<br />
<br />
(For those who are curious, when Gates came out, that was 414 skillups left to go; I started tradeskilling in October 2003.  The major difference in speed I've noticed with the new UI is that I can now tradeskill even after spending four hours killing my wrists chopping ice out of the frozen-over driveway.  Hurray for fewer clicks!  Thank you developers!)<br />
<br />
Thank you to EQTraders, and yes, when the tax return gets here, some of it is going to your Paypal account.  ;)</div></div><hr />
