<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i used search and couldn't quite find what i was looking for.  i have killed tons of basilisks in rathe and bb without ever getting an egg.  are they rare?  am i not killing the right ones/zone?  is lavastorm better or try for jaggedpine?  v 41 erudite wizard with a 200 point pbae for farming and still no eggs.  have 24 mammoth meat so was going to make some pies but dont want to use snake eggs.  thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naeadiene Needsamap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They are foraged in RM.  The lava basilisks have dropped them rather well in the past, but I haven't farmed them in a couple of months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trixzie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Easiest way I have found to get the eggs is to zone in to JP from Blackburrow. You will be right by the caves that have basilisks. The cave basilisk genitors drop eggs as common and you can get as many as 4 eggs per kill. The cave basilisks (not genitors) drop chunks of meat and basilisk eyestalks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">cool. if i can get my bud to come with might try and take the cave.  lag spikes make quadding esp, and even kiting hard and wizard dont melee well.</div></div><hr />

 I am currently hunting in Lava for these. The Basilisks are dropping them on a semi-regular basis for me.<br />
<br />
 I figure about one Bask in 4 drops an egg. Sometimes (rarely) I get more than 1 from the kill.<br />
<br />
 I don't have the experience to know if other areas would be better for you or not, but I thought I would add my input.<br />

I am a 32 (JUST!) Necro on the Rathe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you are of the level to kill in Jaggedpine the drop rate can be much better. There is a cave near the worshipers of brell on the west side that is full of Basilisks and Basilisk Genetors. They are placeholders for each other. There are usually 5 or so Genetors on my round through the cave and on the average the drop about 2 eggs per kill but I have seen up to 7 before on very pregnant Basilisk Genetor :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">do they assist?  might be able to drag my buddy with me to hunt there. hes a mage and we might get exp still off them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kalysto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Don't recall them assisting when I was helping a friend there.  The genitors will KoS you though if you get too close.  Mage pet would tear through them no doubt!  :) <br />

<br />
a basilisk genitor (the mob with the eggs) will attack you whether or not you are fighting<br />
<br />
a cave basilisk will ignore you unless you attack it, i.e. a cave basilisk will not assist<br />
<br />
Last time I was there, you could get exp up to level 47, but at that point it gets a little slow because none of the basilisks are blue any more, they are light blue and green</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The best place to farm basilisk eggs is dependent upon your level and whether or not you have tracking.  <br />
<br />
LAVASTORM<br />
Basilisks are lower level<br />
Every basilisk can drop an egg or two, though many don’t drop any.<br />
Basilisks roam the entire zone, making hunting difficult unless you happen to be a tracker.<br />
<br />
JAGGEDPINE<br />
Basilisks are higher level<br />
Only specific basilisks drop eggs (a basilisk genitor) <br />
Some genitors drop no eggs and some drop several<br />
You have to kill many (a cave basilisk) to get the genitors to spawn<br />
Basilisks are static spawns, no tracking required</div></div><hr />
