<br />
Woohoo!<br />
<br />
**does the happy dance**<br />
<br />
I was beginning to HATE those things....and of course they mocked me when I made enough supplies for 10 attempts to make my last 3 skill points figuring I'd probably need more, right?<br />
<br />
Of course not! No skill up on the first try but 3/3 on the rest. Time to ditch the extras!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodybeard</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found Wu's to be fairly painless.  My cleric had been collecting silk swatches as he leveled and by the time he was ready to tackle Wu's, he had ten stacks in the bank.<br />
<br />
About once a week, he would brew eight stacks of heady kiola, collect two stacks of viscous mana vials from my enchanter and make 40 attempts at tailoring Wu's armor.<br />
<br />
He had 45 silk swatches left when he hit 158 a couple of weeks ago.<br />
<br />
Now, he's SLOWLY collecting odds and ends for acrylia armor, arctic wyvern hide armor, and ceremonial solstice robes and building up his wisdom (currently 204).  I foresee a long road ahead of him.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pojodan</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Man, everyone seems to have had it easy with Wu's.<br />
<br />
Took me over 250 combines to trviailize it for me.  :cry: <br />
<br />
My WIS was 152 at the time, but that's still not -that- bad.<br />
<br />
Boy did I tire of making Kiolas (Shall we start a petition to have SoE lower the number of kiolas per combine to 2?)  I mean, Acrylia armor takes -one- Paelea Bark tannen, why does Wu's need so much sap smeared over it?<br />
<br />
I, too, am very very slowly collecting stuff to make a shot at Acrylia studded, but I've been having doubts lately.. consdering the idea of simply selling my 20 or so Superbs, 40 or so Flawless, 40 studs, and 18 bonings, use the profits to invest in gear someone -else- has made and just grin and bear it for the shawl quests.<br />
<br />
I'm so affraid that I'll hit one of those dreaded slumps (Despite being able to get my WIS to 240 now with KEI) and get only 1 or 2 skill ups (Or none!) with the 80 or so combines I hope to get soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe, just kidding. Congrats on Wu's trivaling. I hated it....just cause the brewing sucked!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhazheal</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 05:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Woot, grats!<br />
<br />
For me it wasnt so bad, I had 343 swatches that i had farmed in 2 days (thought Wus was gonna be bad) had my guildie enchanter make 160 vials, with me twitching once in a while, and made the good **** Kiolas, they were the bad part. ok so first I made only 6 stacks of kiola, and went for it, got from 131, to 142.<br />
I thought, heck, i will make as much Kiola as I have Vials left and I had maybe around 90 vials left, so i made 320 kiolas hehe yup 16 stacks.<br />
<br />
And went for it, and guess what, in the end when i counted the used vials for 131-158 I had 67 vials left so, for me to trivial Wu it took 93 combines for 27 skill increases, pretty good if you ask me, I had 260 int all the time if that matters</div></div><hr />
