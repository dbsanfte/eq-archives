<br />
I see this and variations of this often.  I don't understand.  In what way are they easier to use?  You click on a title and read a message, if you want to reply, you click add reply, if you want to start a new message, you click Add topic.<br />
<br />
If you want to see your message before you post, you click preview, if you don't you click submit.<br />
<br />
If you want to mark all messages read, you click mark messages read.  If you want to only see new messages you click only see new messages.  I just don't get what the difference is other than color scheme and the (in my view) incredibly annoying way it forwards you to someplace you've already been when you'd clearly like to go someplace else.  Also the way it dynamically adds sigs and personal titles so you can't ever see where you were when you posted, or someone else posted, you only see how they are now.<br />
<br />
The only thing I think that could possibly construed as 'easier' is that you no longer are required to remember anything at all, you can highlight and add tags by clicking.  This is good for the novice, I suppose.<br />
<br />
Besides the deep seated hatred some people seem to harbor for ezboards for no apparent reason, what is it that people find so much better about phpBB?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Turonyen</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well for one, the boards dont crap out on you every 3 or 4 days and have no control at all over it. In this case you do. The admins also have much more control with these boards then ezboards. The search command actually works on these boards unlike ezboard which seems to have been designed by a 14 year old that flunked math.<br />
<br />
The most important part is  IT COSTS LESS<br />
<br />
And that's the bottom line.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nizanko</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also like how phpBB doesn't make all the thread topics show up as blank when I try to view the list of them.  Didn't have that trouble with ezboard, either, though the reasons that phpBB is better have already been mentioned.  On the other hand, vBulletin doesn't agree with my ad-filtering proxy for who knows what reason, and so I can't see the topics list on those boards, which is really annoying....</div></div><hr />

Search I'll give you, although EZBoards search has been improved, it's still not very good.  <br />
<br />
I don't give you the boards crapping out every 3 or 4 days, because they just don't.  You won't find a more dedicated lurker than me and I just don't believe it's true.  EZBoards is very reliable even when we were pounding them very hard.  Not to mention those annoying outages eqtraders was having itself for a while, if that happens again, BOTH will be down.  When they did go down, they gave free days of compensation, as well.<br />
<br />
Cost is a toss up, it really depends on how much you pay for the bandwidth.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
While searching is certainly important, I still don't think it explains the venom in some peoples descriptions of EZBoards.  Your problem with the subject lines, Nizanko, is most likely the result of your ad-blocker deciding the posticons are webbugs and messing up the table html trying to remove them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One of the things that Racknine did for us was promise that the boards are hosted on a separate machine from where the main site and it's databases are hosted.  Soooo, if there's an outage with a single machine, we'll have one or the other up.  It's only if there's a router gone south that we'll have both down.<br />
<br />
I, too, have a hard time understanding some of the venom folks are directing at EZBoards. However, after seeing the cost for renewing gold status for a year versus doing it ourselves, I can understand why some sites are folding, selling out, or just moving their boards elsewhere.  When you're talking about an amount that may be upwards of $2000 SAVINGS for a year (depending on how much traffic surges during that year) by doing it ourselves, it becomes a significant chunk of change.</div></div><hr />
