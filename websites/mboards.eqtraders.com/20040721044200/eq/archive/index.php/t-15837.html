<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The items in this post are flat-out rumors.  Most come from questionable sources and NONE are verified.  Heck, I didn't even send these in to the developers.  Most likely, all of these are false.  I just wanted to share them with you folks for their humor value.  Again, most likely, these are incorrect, so don't go quoting me on them! :)<br />
<br />
Rumor: The next expansion is due in July, and will raise levels to 70.<br />
<br />
Rumor: EQ is on a much tighter budget than we suspect.  Apparently there isn't enough programming manpower available to implement all the changes the devs want, let alone all the enhancements players are requesting.<br />
<br />
Rumor: nVidia will be releasing a new high-powered card within a week or so.  This will be a new high-end card and push some existing cards down in price.  (This one was told to me directly by the nVidia rep at the Fan Faire, so I'd judge it more reliable than the others.)<br />
<br />
Gah, I can't find my notes.  I had a nice list of various rumors I'd overheard, but I can't find it now.<br />
<br />
Anyone else hear any juicy rumors they'd like to share?</div></div><hr />

(This one was told to me directly by the nVidia rep at the Fan Faire, so I'd judge it more reliable than the others.)From the Tom's Hardware (http://www.tomshardware.com) web site:<br />
NVIDIA has seemingly pulled out all stops in an attempt to deliver cutting edge graphics with its GeForce 6800 Ultra. After gamers for too long have had to be content with mere incremental improvements to graphics performance, NVIDIA new card delivers a performance jump not seen for a long time. The device is also solidly engineered as well as insanely fast.</div></div><hr />

From HardwareAnalysis (http://www.hardwareanalysis.com/content/article/1708.8/)(mostly refererencing max-setting performance)<br />
<br />
At the end of the day the level of performance, it beats the best ATI currently has, the Radeon 9800 XT, by 60 to 120%<br />
From Tom'sHardwareGuide (http://www.tomshardware.com/graphic/20040414/geforce_6800-26.html) <br />
<br />
With the GeForce 6800 Ultra, you can play UT2004 with 4xFSAA and 8x anisotropic filtering at one resolution higher than its rivals [ATI Radeon 9800XT] - and still get better frame rates!</div></div><hr />

No, the takeover of Blackburrow would be a major pain in the butt.  They'll probably either have to put a city deeper into the continent of Taelosia, since the globe in Skyfire shows a continent about the same size as Antonica, or they'll need to put a city of some sort on one of the three large islands that are between Odus and Taelosia.<br />
 <br />
If it were on the islands, I'd say aviaks or humanoid avians of some sort with a natural levitate ability at 20 or so, scaling up to Flight of Eagles at 55ish or so. <br />
 <br />
Considering that there's a city of Zebuxoruk somewhere on Taelosia, I would figure that's where we'd see a new race appear.  The question would be, what they'd look like, but they would honor Zebuxoruk, rather than worship him.  Based on what the game lore says about him, I'd expect that they'll be neutral.</div></div><hr />

In most of the lore analysis I've seen, people figure Zeb's city is in fact PoK / PoT, not an actual city on Norrath.  Of course, this is all just speculation, so you never know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Na, gotta be a Beetle class with octal-wield.<br />
This just struck me.  Beetles are insects.  They have six legs, not eight.  I guess they'd have hectal (hexal?) wield, or some such. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Taadieri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Rumor: The next expansion is due in July, and will raise levels to 70.<br />
<br />
I heard this rumor from a player from either Test or Stormhammer.  As Kilauea said, the level increase was reportedly intended to be part of the GoD expansion and will be implemented for the next expansion.  <br />
<br />
Reportedly, the biggest issue preventing it from being done in time is that there will be a level limit based on how many AA points a character has.  If this RUMOR is true, you would need to have earned (or maybe spent) 50 AA points to be eligible for level 66, 100 for 67 and so on up to needing 250 AA points to reach level 70.  Again, this is a completely unconfirmed rumor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Wow, that brings a whole new meaning to &quot;XP grind&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Reportedly, the biggest issue preventing it from being done in time is that there will be a level limit based on how many AA points a character has.

Again, this is a completely unconfirmed rumor.<br />
<br />
So does that mean you still have to grind the level AND spend the AA's or just put 100% into AA's, spend them, and boom! next level? (I realize this is just rumor; trying to sort it out in my mind).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Liandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Hmmm.  The way i read it is that 50aa's unlocks the posibility of gaining lvl 66.  100aa's unlocks lvl 67.  So you would have to grind both.  I hope im reading it wrong though.  Grinding the normal lvls is bad enough. /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Kaysha Soulsinger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">If that is true, they will be separate AA's, new in the new expansion. And maybe they'd purely be AA's to open up the next level, without any other benefit ...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I sit here and contemplate this rumor<br />
<br />
(Raising Level to 70, but to proceed beyond 65/66/67/68/69... you must have XX AAs spent... increasing at each level)<br />
<br />
And I can see some sense in it... Why?<br />
<br />
1. When the Upper limit was 60... you could then earn experience and get AAs... and you could earn them starting at Level 51... But did people actually bother with AAs when they reached 51? Only some... and those only for Run 3... <br />
<br />
2. When they raised the limit to 65... with more AAs to get... where you had to be level 61+ to get the PoP AA Skills... did most players bother with AAs (other than Run 3) before they pushed to Level 65? Not many at all...<br />
<br />
Players tended to consider AA Skills to be &quot;icing&quot;... not critical to success. They always saw increased levels as being more useful than any of the AA skills that were offered.<br />
<br />
I admit, I look at some of the Class specific AA Skills for a Monk, and I say &quot;Huh?... why would I want that?&quot; Well... I see only one or two Class Specific AA skills as being useful to the way I play.<br />
<br />
I look at the General AA Skills..and say I don't care about increased INT/WIS/CHA on my Monk! (most melee would agree). While caster would say I don't need increased STR/DEX/AGI on my Caster...<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
Now with the reverse restriction... You must have ## AA Points SPENT before you can reach Level 66/67/68/69/70... it will encourage players to actually spend TIME at those levels experiencing the content at those levels (the various PoP Zones, the GoD Zones, and the new expansion zones) at the levels SOE intended them to be experienced, rather than simply seeking to ZOOM up to Level 70... then trivialize the content because the characters are overpowered for them.<br />
<br />
I am continually annoyed that a majority of the playerbase has gotten so jaded that they believe the only &quot;fun&quot; way to play EQ is when the content is trivial and there is no challenge.<br />
<br />
Why would anyone want to go to Blackburrow and beat up gnolls when they reach level 20+?  Or why would you want to go to Neth Lair when you reach Level 40+? The reason folks don't is not because they are trivial at those levels... but because they get no experience at those levels. No gain.<br />
<br />
The only reason people go back to Rathe Mountains to beat up Hill Giants at Level 60+ (solo) is because of the profit they can make easily (coin/loot).<br />
<br />
SOE tried to get you to spend time traveling (boat trips/running across the zones)... and players complained...now we have PoK Books... and Gnome Dock Workers... Magus Porters... <br />
SOE tried &quot;Trivial Loot Code&quot;... and that flopped..<br />
SOE tried &quot;Flag restrictions&quot; (PoP Progression) ... and that worked for a time... but now they added in access if you reached 55/62... because of complaints that not all buddies could join in<br />
SOE tried &quot;LDoN Groups with Level constraints&quot; ... and that has got people complaining because they can't go and take 3 level 65 with 3 level 50s and overpower the adventure. But they haven't broken that yet, since it has gotten a lot of positive response.<br />
SOE tried AA skills as optional after level 50... and players ignore it... they think AAs are too &quot;wimpy&quot; before you reach max level.<br />
<br />
SOE WANTS you to take the time and explore the world... and see the content... the player base IGNORES it...<br />
<br />
(sorry about the length.... but one though led me to another...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>uncleshmoozo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">That is possibly the worst idea I've heard recently. <br />
<br />
I agree.  It's an awful idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Ixiola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Actually, I'm probably what most would think of as a casual player as I play maybe 20 hours a week and am in a family guild.  But I don't think it's that bad of an idea, as long as it's any AA that work.  I don't really like the idea of having to 'purchase' AA who's only purpose is to allow you to level as that just means they are making every level past 65 hell levels squared. )  But requiring you to have say 20 AA spent in something to ding 66 doesn't seem unreasonable.<br />
<br />
I have delayed leveling to 65 with my cleric because I want to continue to group with my friends / guildmates in LDoNs, and staying within level range of my better half means I have more options to grouping with others.  As a result, I've been grinding AAs a lot instead of leveling.  But I think people often think that levels are greater than all.  This is unfortunately short-sighted.  Is my 63 cleric with 62 AAs not as good as a 65 with &lt;6 AAs?  I would disagree.  My AAs make me a lot more efficient healer.  Sure, I could be 65 now, but as I said, I chose to level at the same rate as my friends.<br />
<br />
If you make it open to anyone, I guarantee you'll see folk who'll level straight to 70 with virtually no AAs because being higher level means they are 'better'.  Why not require just a little investment in other stuff?  <br />
<br />
What I think this would do is give folks a general idea of what level of player they are getting. (And no, I don't mean skill - that has nothing to do with your level.)  When they get a level 66, they know that that player is not only 66, but also has at least XX AAs.  Right now, there's a huge disparity in what a '65' means, and short of looking at someone's title (which is dependant not only on how many AA you have but also WHERE you spent your AA) or inspecting their gear, how do you tell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I don't even have 50 AA yet (working on it!) but I would see nothing terribly wrong with setting # of AAs necessary to &quot;unlock&quot; levels 66-70.  (This would be similar to the requirements SOE put in SWG for people to unlock the Jedi character slot.)<br />
<br />
I agree with Ixiola though, it should be based on AAs spent, without any restrictions as to where they were spent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>elty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">It is a good system. Lv 65 is so meaningless now. A lv 65 with 0 AA is much worse than a lv 65 with just 100 AA.  250 AA is not high. It barely covers the essential one. I figure I can stop at 280. By then all I will cover all defense and offense AA and the rest is just eye candy</div></div><hr />

Most do. It boggles me. As Quartic loooves to remind me, I'm paying $12/month x 2 accounts for this game... when I got out of Sullon, I told Phabos (and Kiz when he transferred) that &quot;I want to SEE what I've been paying for for a year.&quot; <br />
<br />
And I have. I've xp'd in Marus Seru. Sol-A. Overthere. Kaesora. Mistmoore and Unrest and Velks and Droga without fear of being trained (by someone other than myself *embarrased*).

I'm having hela-lota fun now. But then again, I am not normal and you are not to take my experiences as approaching standard. ^_^ <br />

<br />
<br />
Oh, that. When Kiz was still on Stormhammer and let me on the drood, I made him take me to Tactics one day. And other days there were other new zones. I was all like, &quot;WHAAAA omgosh lookie lookie PRITTIES!&quot; and he was like, 'no more sugar for you.'

re lvl 70... <br />

&quot;That is possibly the worst idea I've heard recently.&quot;<br />
/agree. <br />

altho, Tunare please forbid they raid lvl cap, it should be friggin hard to get there, with little reward along the way until you get to the end. <br />
<br />
<br />
And I'm afraid I failed my save roll, so yes I of course wonder how this will affect PVP on Sullon... <br />
And yes, I'm just as tired of thinking about it as anyone else is of hearing about it...  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Oh it's a great idea for those who want to absolutely certainly know that the person joining their group is uber enough for their tastes. I mean really, quite a few people have asked for some way to tell the posers from the powers (all the people who mentioned PoP was horrible since 60th lvl used to really mean something and now any old shmuck could get to 65th lvl, which clearly is a horrible thing) and to do that it would be a great system. It guarantees that you'll never have to group with another &quot;newbie&quot; again because you didn't know he had fewer AAs, no reason to take that maybe new maybe not 65th lvl now when you can get a guarantee of someone with more AAs by going over that limit.<br />
<br />
Now if this system had been in place in some form from the start I could agree it would be a nice idea, but as it is it would just widen the gap between classes. And here I mean player enforced classes like grinder, raider, casual, newbie, oldie and so on, not your character's class like warrior. So yeah, I hope it remains just that, a rumor and nothing more. Yet a part of me fears that it isn't. Maybe I'm just disillusioned, there's always more grind being added it seems to try to stretch out content for far longer than any sane human could possibly enjoy it.<br />
<br />
And trust me, the people grinding away at AAs so they can level aren't going to be in all those unused zones, they'll crowd together in the same old zones for xp. The options for planar level xp aren't exactly overwhelming y'know. Don't give me that &quot;try the other zones&quot;, they have lower ZEM and history has shown they would not get used as long as PoP zones give more xp per hour! While I personally enjoy visiting older areas on occasion after the newness wears off I realize why they were deserted in the first place. *coughkedgecough* The achiever mentality has won in that aspect of the game, adding steeper acheiver requirements will not break that mindset. If anything it will compound the problem even more as people set about on maximizing their xp per hour so they can level again. It would give them a clear and probably a very tempting goal to grind their AAs away other than &quot;so I can get Exodus&quot; or so on. The only thing that's ever made people stop to smell the roses has been when they've been forced to do so by the game and even then they NEVER spread equally throughout zones to enjoy all the different content in the past because surprise surprise, the zones weren't designed equal!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>sumamael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Hmmm hmm 250 AA to be able to reach level 70. Hmm hmmmm.<br />
<br />
Oh well, looks like I might not make level 70 with my cleric within a week of the expansion going live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Cantatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Keep in mind, it's just a rumor.  That means it's possible it's not even true.  Even if it is, nothing says SOE couldn't change their mind and go about it a different way.  The expansion hasn't even been officially announced yet.<br />
<br />
We've seen these rumors come and go.  I can remember one rumor for just about every expansion:  Kunark was rumored to have earthquakes.  Velious was supposed to have weapons made of ice that would melt if you left the continent while wielding them.  The Vah Shir in Luclin weren't supposed to be able to wear pants.  PoP levels, spells and abilities were only supposed to work in PoP zones.<br />
<br />
So, don't put too much stock into this rumor until you see it announced from SOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I personally love that idea.  I don't have all that many AA's, under 100 atm, however, it is a bit irritating when I do something like an LDoN.  I try and create a group (/w all lfg 65) and I have to remember who is &quot;good&quot; and what not. I feel bad that all the 65's are not equal, however, I want to succeed at hard LDoNs and a 65 warrior with no AAs cannot tank as well as a ranger or even a BEASTLORD with 100 in the right place. It is sad, but true.  The level restriction on AAs would help keep these in balance so that we can create groups without having to worry about getting a less experienced replacement.<br />
<br />
Expansion &quot;X&quot; will also be creating new AAs.  The slow leveling will make these AAs harder to get, as they will probably be level restricted.  This will encourage existing players to get their valuable PoP AAs before the newer ones as they will not be able to access them.  I don't know how many shaman out there are truely awful even though they have 150+ AAs, because they spent them on Spirit Call 5 and Hastended Rabid Bear form!  I wish there had been more restrictions on your AA progression in PoP....<br />
<br />
/hijack off I'll stop now, I don't even remember where I started with this in the first place...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">What I think this would do is give folks a general idea of what level of player they are getting. ... Right now, there's a huge disparity in what a '65' means, and short of looking at someone's title (which is dependant not only on how many AA you have but also WHERE you spent your AA) or inspecting their gear, how do you tell?You check for doodspeek in their LFG message.  You check their guild tag to be sure they're not guilded with known jerks.  Then you hunt with them.  If they stink, you avoid them in the future.<br />
<br />
I actually think this would make the general population of levels 66-70 even dumber than everyone says the general population of 65s are right now.  Why?  Well, if you have the time to accumulate several hundreds of AAs and a few more levels within a few months (or even a year plus some) then you're probably in the zones where there's a few flags between you and the unwashed masses, so you're not really part of the general population.  For the rest of us, we're going to be faced with either becoming effectively newbies again (because who wants a 65 when you can have a 67, or a 67 when you can have a 70?) or turning to ebay or powerlevelling.  You think there are a lot of dumb people out there now?  Wait till you're in a group tuned for level 70s and both the cleric and chanter just bought their characters.  Or just spent four solid months in BoT grinding to 70.  Because when expansions offer little more than end game advancement then many, many people will do anything to get it to keep up.  Others just want to see all the zones they paid for.  Can't say I blame that group, really. <br />
<br />
The gap between the power gamers and the casual players was widened like never before with the introduction of raids required to get to entire sets of zones.  The kind of change rumored here would effectively put a brick wall in that gap, due to the sheer quantities of time it takes to get hundreds of AAs (plus levels).  Not to mention that casual players will have a smaller set of zones to do it in, most if not all of which give slower exp than those that are only accessible via raided flags.<br />
<br />
I may be only 65 with 49 AAs (and two leadership points :p) but I am an excellent shaman.  I've played Verdandi almost exclusively for almost five years straight now.  I know Norrath inside out, at least the parts I'm able to reach.  And I know how to play my character very well.  The idea that the quality of a potential group member can be determined best by looking at level and AAs simply isn't true.  You can gauge the raw strength of the character that way, but absolutely nothing about their ability to use that strength competently.  And competence is what I think most people really feel is lacking when they say the general population is dumb nowadays.<br />
<br />
If this rumor turns out to be true, level 70 would be a guarantee of time that someone, somewhere spent pumping exp into that character.  Nothing more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Hear here, Verdandi ^_^ <br />
<br />
Who said that Norrath isn't a world anymore, but that EQ is a game? <br />
The designers keep trying to offer content to 'keep the old people' by making the string longer, when really they're going to end up driving a lot of people away, those who know they'll never reach the end of the string. It's an odd paradox in a way... and they won't please everyone. They can't, anymore. So the burden on them is chosing the path that drives away the fewest people.... <br />
<br />
For once, I don't want to be in their shoes. <br />

I was the one who was saying this for a while, based off of a quote I stole off of the Enchanter forums.   Everquest has moved from being a world to a game.  :-(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I agree Verdandi, my previous post was an oversight of the eBay aspect to the game.  My experience is based off most of what you said, checking the guild tag and known associates of the members in my group.  At this time, when I search for a group, I check the EP/Time guilds for members because they usually will have the AAs that make them more viable in the upper tiered zones.  However, you are correct that no amount of in-game experience can account of actual gaming experience...I wish there was a way to prevent the eBay factor in the game =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>sumamael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Yep, checking guildtag is probably the best way to go.<br />
<br />
It can be kinda funny when some dude asks every single member of my guild if they are LFG for some LDoN when we are raiding Rathe in PoEb tho  :rolleyes: I guess he had some good experiences with us and now he can't start a group without getting Landslide members into it  :boggled:</div></div><hr />
