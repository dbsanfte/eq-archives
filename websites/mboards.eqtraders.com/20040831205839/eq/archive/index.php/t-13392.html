<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>FastRT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok guys, thanks to your help I am up to 222 skill in BS.  Now I read that many of you did the Acid Wash and Filthy BP to get 5 easy points in BS.  My question is: How did you do it?  I have combined it correctly 10 times in a row and everytime you combine correctly you have to run all the way back up to Grimel and get another!!  Is this how people did it, just by running to get a new BP 100-200 times?  I only say 100-200 since My last few combine to get 222 took about 40 tries.<br />
<br />
Let me know if I am missing some easy way to do this.  Am thinking of using a COH mage to transport me back and forth from Bind to Forge but wanted to know if there is a faster way.<br />
<br />
Thanks, FastRT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There's two good ways to do it that I found.  If you're a caster, get a coh mage and park him at the forge.  Have him coth you then do the combine then gate (have your bind point right in front of grimel) then hit your hotkey that asks for a new bp and if your mage is good he's half way done casting coth again by then.<br />
<br />
If you aren't a caster then get one mage at the forge and one at aid grimmel.<br />
<br />
The other way to do it quickly (without having to take the elevator up) requires you to be a caster.  Bind at grimmel again.  Make sure the elevator is in the down position.  Get sow, and cast or click levi onto yourself.  Get a bp, and levi down the elevator, then click off levi, one to the staircase near the forge building, and drop down the middle.  Run to the forge, combine, gate, get new bp, levi, rinse repeat.  You could probably do this by taking the elevator up and levi/drop down but it would take much longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Of course, it's easiest being a druid or wizard.  Bind up at AG, get your bp, port to PoK, run over to next building and the forge inside, combine, gate back up, rinse, repeat.  I don't think I would have had the energy to do this if I weren't a porter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lanalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Same as Tinile for me. I wouldn't have had the energy to run back and forth if I wasn't a druid. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Collwyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wish I'd had a bot mage.  I had use of a wizard and tried binding at gimel and having the wiz translocate knowledge.  Unfortunately, after doing this once you have to camp or zone to have tl work again.  (That was frustrating to discover.)<br />
<br />
I just ended up doing exactly what Tudani described.  (Which was amusing to see in text!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gryfalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hehe, I think my method is slightly faster (not too much).<br />
<br />
Bind in front of Grimel.  Speed Float down the elevator shaft.  Float around the corner to the door, head to the front door.  Open that door and then head forward/right into the angled wall panel near the open mini courtyard to your right.  Go up the wall a bit and fly through the opening.  Then fly through the other opening and turn right.  Use the slanted wall there again to get a bit higher and just go over the wall and run down towards the smithy.  If you time it right you can land at the door and open it, do your combine and just gate back.<br />
<br />
No having to recast lev and, as you get better at it, you never even slow down as your ramp up the walls.  Plus it looks reallllly funny.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Yroc Morf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am a warrior so I could not do the things being suggested that easily.  My wife is a cleric and her daughter is a mage, but we know another cleric and borrowed his account for a couple hours.  Our thought was the CoH would use too much mana and she would run out.<br />
<br />
Here is another way to do it.<br />
<br />
Die twice falling down the elevator.  <br />
<br />
Corpse one at grim.. Corpse two at the forge.<br />
<br />
A cleric at each location chain casts rez.  I pick up a chest... accepted rez... combine... accepted other rez... pick up a new chest... accepted rez... etc.<br />
<br />
Just another option for all of you.<br />
<br />
It took me 8-9 stacks of combines to get from 220 to 227.  Keep in mind my str was at around 268 or so because of the rez effects instead of its normal 305.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">well dieing to tradeskill now has a new meaning.  :)  nothing wrong with the idea.  lol.  very creative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Endara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Do you have to be 220 to do this quest? I am at 212 (just finished bunch of LDoN plates) and also have a 5% mod to equip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">he responds to 220 unmodified yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Quikpick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I did this for a friend who has a druid bot. He got bound in front of Grimel, I'd stand by the forge he was using and just TL'ed him to bind while he was doing the combine. Druid waiting at Grimel would GG him down to the gate in point. After awhile, it was just faster for him to run down the elevator shaft with levi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>AbitooXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I bound up at Aid Grimil, and made a hotkey:<br />
/pause 2, /tar aid grimil<br />
/say I am well versed in the art of blacksmithing<br />
<br />
I was doing my runs in batches of 20, so after prepping 20 acid wash, I would gate up to Grimil and hit hotkey.<br />
<br />
I had levi and scaled wolf illusion,  run down the tower.  On the way out of the library is a tree, if you catch it right, you can get high enough to go over the wall. If you catch it wrong you can almost literally get stuck in the tree. Get to forge. Combine. Gate.<br />
<br />
You can use mage/wiz bots to help. Pearls increase cost by about 3gp per attempt.  My cost without pearls was roughly 100pp per stack. Got 3 skillups (222-224) on combines 12, 19 and 21 of my 40 combine session. Total time was about an 1hr and that included making my own essences</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Yroc Morf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I forgot the mention.<br />
<br />
There was about 1.5 hours of my 3 hour rez timer left when I hit 227.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tingteng</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">63 trips, 5 hours and 2 pots of coffee I made it from 221-226. <br />
<br />
that was close enough for me when I ran out of Celestial essence.<br />
<br />
(305 STR all i used was SoW)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ixiola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Okay, related stupid question.  I've previously dismissed this as a skillup path for my better half, as we have no flags yet.  I understand to actualy do the aid grimel quest for the earring, you need flags as well.  But can you do this subquest without the flags?  My guess is no, but wanted to confirm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>tsbaity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yes, you need the Bert flag to get the BP from Aid. My smithing stayed at 220 for quite awhile waiting while my guild got up to him (BTW, thanks again to them letting me come grab the flag even tho I was watching football when he died). I used the PoK port/gate method Tinile described as was 227 in short order.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is the reason why I would not do this method, rez effect. The usual skill up difference between 268 and 305 is big. It would take about 50% more combines to get the skill up at 268 than at 305. If you are a caster, the rez effect seems to hit wis/int harder than str. Not really viable for me, though it's a creative solution.<br />

If I had to do it again, I would have used an item like that +50 str weapon from Seru mini that I have seen rot in front of me serveral times.  I would have been 305 str with it upon rez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm a melee. I did the running back and forth thing for 2 stacks of acid wash and I've gotten one skillup. Then I said screw it and tried the other combines and got my finished BP on the second try.<br />
<br />
If I ever try using up my other stacks of acid wash for skillups I'm going to hire mages, I think. That running sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kialya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">A druid bot and myself both bound at Grimel (btw i found out if you are next to him and say the text he will give you the bp, you dont have to target him). Anyway, get the filthy bp, have druid gate to PoK. Run from port in to forge while druid gates back to aid grim. do your combine and gate back to grim. Rinse and repeat. Got it so that the second i hit combine, the druid would start to port and a second or so after i arrived and got my bp we would be porting again.</div></div><hr />
