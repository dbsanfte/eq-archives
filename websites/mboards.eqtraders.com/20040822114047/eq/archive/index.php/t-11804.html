<br />
Took 3 tries to get my Trophy... Well, at least I'm happy now hehe.<br />
<br />
One interesting thing I noticed was a particular bad patch around the 235 mark, with multiple failures. Not sure if anyone else experienced that.<br />
<br />
I would go 19/20 or 20/20 combines until ~235, then it was approx 16/20 or 17/20 all the way until around 243, where it went back to 19/20 20/20.<br />
<br />
All in all, think I spent around 1k+ from 195 to 250. Maybe because my INT was only 209 with KEI.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Around the 230 area was a pain for me also.  It seemed like skill ups were few and far between.  I have several runs of 200+ combines before I would get a skill up.  I had the best luck during that time by logging in during my lunch hour and crafting for about 15 mins then logging.  I would get 1 or 2 skill ups.  Seems like the longer I crafted at one sitting, the harder it was to increase skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Phrajile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Agreed. I experienced the same as well, enchanted 100 bars, then went on a non-stop crafting session, skill ups were extremly rare.<br />
<br />
However, whenever I went for a break, came back, enchanted 10 bars and crafted, I'd almost always get at least 1 skill-up.<br />
<br />
Too much of a good thing is bad for you? LOL :p</div></div><hr />
