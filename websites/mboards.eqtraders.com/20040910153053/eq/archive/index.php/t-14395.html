<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Magus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi , i looked up the forged firebrand morningstar &quot; 1 fiery sheet of metal , 1 fiery temper ,1 oak shaft , 1 spiked ball mold &quot; <br />
    I got all the stuff, Then it doesnt let me combine in the forge , i then tryed adding a flask of water , no luck, so i tryed taking out the flask and adding my smithing hammer... still no luck .<br />
       I figured id register and mention it , i will play around with whatever i can think of and let you know if i find anything...i suppose this could be a bug even ...i am on Xev server <br />
         Thank you for having such a cool and helpful website DenMother.          :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">why did you make it?  curious mostly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Magus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">lol , i wanted a Cheap Magic weapon with decent damage for my twinke cleric, its not a bad weapon for the low levels</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ok.  i looked at it and couldn't understand why i should go farm for it.  at 30 i was killing giants in ew and getting velium weapons so i never bothered with my twink.  might do some of the new pale stuff when i get GoD for him though.  very nice on a level 3 warrior.  just have to see what they put the reccomended levels at.  <br />
<br />
centi longsword not lore not restricted can farm in 40's.  nothing comparable to player made.  its all i'm wanting.  get me some ts twink gear hehe.  stick 2 velium fire wedding rings and a velium black saphire necklace on a newbie and watch them own.  weapons have always been so much worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Emron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just out of curiosity, I crafted a forged firebrand scimitar.  I had hoped it that all the forged firebrand weapons might have something similar about the graphic, to differentiate them.  The plan was to use them as a sort of &quot;badge&quot; of our guild.  With all the different types that could be made, everyone in our guild could have one.<br />
<br />
I made the scimitar, which looks cool, and then a longsword, which is rather plain.  The two have nothing in common.<br />
