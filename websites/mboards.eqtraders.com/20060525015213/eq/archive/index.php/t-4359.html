Smithing: 164<br />
Fletching: 140<br />
Baking: 135<br />
Pottery: 125<br />
Tailoring: 92<br />
Jewelcraft: 16<br />
Brewing: 16<br />
<br />
Working on advancing all of them (particularly those last two).<br />
<br />
Also have geerlocks for most skills and the bulk of the various portable containers and implements.<br />
<br />
If I'm not otherwise engaged I'm willing to make any nontrivial combine for free if provided with ALL the materials necessary to do so. In most cases I'm willing to supply any implements needed, but everything else you need to bring.<br />
<br />
For anything where I have to do any shopping I charge double the cost of the supplies (IE, banded mail costs about 5pp for the materials, so I'd charge you 10).<br />
<br />
If farming is required and I don't already have the supplies for what you want, a heavy donation is probably going to be required - just like everyone else my time is money, and if I'm hunting green spiders in WC for silk that means I'm NOT hunting in Velious/Luclin where I can get plat and XP.<br />
<br />
For trivial combines where you supply the materials, a reasonable donation is expected - talk it over with me. For something small and easy like tattered armor for a newbie I'm usually willing to go with a thank you or maybe a couple gold, for bigger stuff like adamantite armor going to a high level character some plat would be expected.<br />
<br />
For those people willing to put in a few extra minutes to research *exactly* what needs to be done to make their stuff, tell me the recipe, and give me the supplies, I'm going to be a lot less demanding of PP than people who just want some item I've never heard of and have no clue what to farm to get there.<br />
<br />
Unless another arrangement is worked out with me specifically, any materials you give me for combines are your problem if I flub the combine. I *ALWAYS* inform people of the odds before attempting something, and if they're not acceptable to you I'm cool with that - If you want me to attempt a nightmare robe I'm more than happy to try it for you, but with a 5% success rate I'd strongly advise you to look elsewhere. I will group with you before attempting combine so you can see whether it is success or failure, so you don't have to worry about me cheating you out of supplies/completed goods. I never expect donations on flubs.<br />
<br />
For any orders of items (full suit of banded, that type of thing) I pretty much charge standard rates on Tholuxe - If something is NOT trivial I'm more likely to give you a break on it a little bit. Doing business with me is more expensive that way, but if I accept a deal you'll definitely come out of it with the item you wanted rather than the risk involved with just bringing me supplies.<br />
<br />
My magelo profile is:<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=493992 - I keep it more current with my tradeskills than this post, so if my numbers at the top of the post look a little low check my magelo since they might have gone up.<br />
<br />
If you need anything, send me a tell in game or drop me a PM.. I prefer tells if you already know what you want and are ready for me to work, but if you want to talk things over first a PM is prolly the way to go. When I'm in game I usually don't want to chat about stuff (If I'm not working on tradeskills I'm usually raiding so can't chat) but I'm MORE than happy to talk over PMs especially if you need advice on farming areas or figuring out what item(s) would be best for your character. :) I tend to be online during the evenings PST, but I've got a fairly erratic play schedule so you never quite know.<br />
