<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Belhaven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok, I REALLY don't expect anyone to say where they found it...but perhaps we can say where we tried and DIDN'T find it. <br />
<br />
the central room (with the bridge over the lava) <br />
the Luggald Abominations &amp; Initiates where one hunts for Pure Blood.<br />
<br />
Both of these dropped research components - but nothing for a 50+ spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mileron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most of the mobs in those two rooms are under 52 anyway - that is, they con dark blue/yellow to my 49 ranger.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the Nautilus room (where the Broodmother spawns) or near Hate's Fury, down on the docks, would be good places to go?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>salomeasillverfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thanks for keeping us updated. Sal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>filobeto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have spent days in Nadox charm killing, I have never seen this rune drop there (or anywhere for that matter).  Sure, RNG is a pain in the butt, so are urban legends.<br />
<br />
I've looted plenty of 73 Rights (NOT in Nadox, NOT in Nadox), but never this rune.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe near HF zone imo.........<br />
<br />
We have farm inny/broodmother for a few month and never found a single zeph</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>filobeto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm convinced that it does not drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Inien of Vazaelle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The fact that it's in neither magelo or lucy's item databases suggests to me that the rune doesn't exist or is not dropping as it should.  I think a dev might want to look into that. :faint:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>salomeasillverfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">we complained at Fan Faire and got blown off by being told it dropped in Nadox which no one has ever seen it do /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well I am embarrased to admit this but I have SEEN it drop. Not thinking anything of it I sold it to a merchant. It has been about a year since I saw it though (and no I don't recall where I was at the time) :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kaysha Soulsinger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It makes me wonder ...<br />
<br />
They keep logs of virtually everything that happens (although it gets deleted after a while I guess, most likely due to space restrictions). Why can't they simply use some tools to parse those logs to compile data? Things like droprate and such can easily be derived then. And those compilations then clearly show some glaring bugs in those drop tables - like with the Zephyr rune.<br />
<br />
They should be able to tell how often a specific item ID has been created by the game on any specific server and which mob was the lucky one to carry it around. By the looks of it, I take it that such a parsing would show a big fat 0 for the Rune of Zephyr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Daeanor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm convinced that it does not drop.It does. I purchased it from a vendor in PoK once. Of course, that's no help finding where it drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>AtrixWolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Rune of Zephyr drops in Hates fury off a named priest.  <br />
