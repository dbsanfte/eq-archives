<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beriberi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I don't really have a kingdom, but I'm trying to organize a den of thieves, and you can have a high ranking postition in its administration....<br />
<br />
Seriously, has anyone seen/found/heard of these dropping lately? I've found none in the bazaar, seen none on merchants, and seen a few other players constantly auctioning wanting to buy. I need one (at least) to mount for a XXXX, and really don't need it for awhile, which is fortunate as there are none to be found. Anyone have anything to add?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frerin the Smith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have found close to a stack in the last week on various vendors.  Found 3 black sapphires last night alone (ironically, now need more jacinths to make seals as I sell jacinths in the bazaar at night and am currently out).  Check all the merchants in PoK and then hit zones where high level people on your server want to port to at the end of a group to sell and split cash.<br />
<br />
It amazes me that I can find things on vendors that I know a ML sold to split cash on.  Like the time I found 3 blue diamonds, 2 jacinths, and Aegolism in three concurrent slots along with trash loot from Old Sebilis.  He just sold everything and split the cash, I am certain!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sikle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They tend to drop fairly often from the named vamps in TM. Don't know if you can solo them though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smyrt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They drop semi-regularly in level 65 LDoN adventures. Check the Magi in each of the camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beriberi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually I found one on a merchant, so assuming combine success I&quot;m good. I also found one in the bazaar, for an outrageous price; I wondered if this post had anything to do with that, hehe. So, I edited my original so no one knows what I'm talking about. <br />
<br />
But, my original question was answered; they are dropping, but I guess they are being kept by the players. <br />
<br />
I tried looking on the mage merchants at the wayfarer camps, but those fill up fast and excess is destroyed. Found lots of other cool stuff that I needed while looking for my gems, which made me quite happy. Now if I could just find a few more....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh I had the same problem when I just GMed brewing last week.  I borrowed a couple from a friend who had them in the bank but have since gathered seven off of various vendors.  Some were Maguses, so I do think they're still dropping in LDoN.  One here and there on obscure vendors in PoK, still my favorite source of odd items like this.<br />
<br />
I know I see them on the vendors in the Thurgadin bank often, so that might be a good place to check after the servers have been up for a while.</div></div><hr />
