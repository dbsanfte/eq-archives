<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>iasmin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Baroness Zera recently posted the link to her updated and wildly popular smithing guide. It got me thinking about tailoring again as I marshall the energy to move beyond Wu's ... I think someday I'd like to see a tailoring guide written with the quality and attention to detail of Her Excellency's well-reasoned smithing writing. <br />
<br />
I should probably say I think we have some really decent guides that many people have used in their careers. I'm curious, though. Has anyone revisited them recently? Has anyone taken a look and really thought about the skillup paths they took or are taking to make it through what many people argue is the most difficult of tradeskills?<br />
<br />
With the release of GoD I've been curious to see if there are some options that people thought they might trade out of the standard skillup path. Unless I missed them, I haven't really seen any so far. GoD is a pretty high-level expansion and many a new EQ player likely won't visit there for some time to come I think. But not all tradeskillers start at their early levels, so that's okay...<br />
<br />
I'm specifically interested in the GoD expansion here (but any answers are good). Are there new combines from GoD or other things you've recently though were acceptable side-trips in the long haul through tailoring? For example, in baking skillups, truffles are a small respite in the world of pies and picnics.  <br />
<br />
Idle musings and curiosity on this pre-coffee morning...enjoy the weekend, folks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not much of a skillup route there, unfortunately. :(</div></div><hr />
