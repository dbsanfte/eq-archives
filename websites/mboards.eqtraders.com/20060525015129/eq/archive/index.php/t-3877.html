if i furnish all the ingredients for the corking device...<br />
<br />
The one on sell at the bazaar atm seem to be a bit to high price for me (1400ppp).<br />
<br />
What would you ask for that king of help?<br />
Keep in mind that I want to be a GM baker, not brewer :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">npc01</div><div class="date">02-17-2003, 07:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">given the bits required ...<br />
branch of sylvan oak (foraged),  (bought 150-300p)<br />
blue diamond (500-700p)<br />
... 1400p doesn't seem too out of place ... not sure success rate on them ...<br />
<br />
Kantreach maybe able to help you ... he has the required Tinkering to my knowledge ... not sure what he'd charge for a combine if you had all the bits ... (he's on late Aussie timeslot for the most part)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lyla</div><div class="date">02-18-2003, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi!<br />
<br />
For the branch of sylvan oak, they are free for me, im foraging them<br />
at EW, and trying without succes to sell them at ... 9gp at the bazaar.<br />
<br />
For the blue diamond, i bhought some at 300pp and less from plp outside the baz, so if hes willing to make the combine for a small pay, i think i will save some pp :). And since the one that i saw at 1400 that i didnt bhought, im not seeing any on sell atm...<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info, ill try to get a grip on him :)</div></div><hr />
