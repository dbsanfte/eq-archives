My problme is I can't find Medium sized BP molds anywhere . I looked on supply page and went to Freeport, bought the mold but it's a large FS Bp.<br />
 Anyway any help would be appreciated.<br />

<br />
I've gathered you did look at this:<br />
<br />
http://www.eqtraders.com/location/smithing.htm<br />
<br />
There are plenty of other places to get this. Search that page for plate armor molds, you will even see them as medium in that listing. <br />
<br />
Another prominent and easily accessible source is right in the middle of the bazaar. The guy on the left that is in the group of 3 merchants sells medium (human selling medium, barbarian iirc selling large, dorf iirc selling small)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The item listed as 'fine steel breastplate' with SIZE: LARGE on the right click is the right item for the quest.  I've made literally dozens, and everyone asks.  A large fine steel breastplate would list as 'large fine steel breastplate' with SIZE: LARGE (or whatever it is, think it's large).<br />
<br />
EDIT: Freeport doesn't sell large molds, you have the right breastplate.  Trust me.</div></div><hr />

It has nothing to do the race-related-size, TINY, SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE, GIANT are just related to whether they'd fit in some bags.<br />
<br />
If a human can wear it, it is medium and the correct size for what you need.<br />
<br />
If a halfling or wood elf or gnome can wear it then you have small.<br />
<br />
If a troll or ogre can wear it is would be large<br />
<br />
(not all-inclusive, but just a few key races you could look for).</div></div><hr />
