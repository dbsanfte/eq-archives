<br />
Anybody else experience this or took notice?  <br />
<br />
Food for thought.</div></div><hr />

I have had it happen both ways, get a success and also you lacked the skill etc. It seems to me that more times than not it will fail if I do something wrong on the combine then fix it and retry. It has gotten so that now when I make an error by putting to much or not enough or even getting a stack of items in by mistake that I remove everything, and close the container. Then go buy or sell something to force a save, and then go back to work on the combines. This seems to help.  :D</div></div><hr />

Exactly yes yes yes *nods*<br />
<br />
I don't seem to recall ever seeing a successful combine when I've messed up.<br />

Your last sentance is also very priceless.  Word to the wise or to the Superstitious.</div></div><hr />
