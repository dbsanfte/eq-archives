<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rendael Brigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Q: How good can I get at a tradeskill?<br />
<br />
A: Of the 7 main tradeskills (baking, brewing, fletching, jeweling, pottery, smithing, tailoring) you may only have one up to 250, while the rest are capped at 200. Regardless of whether another skill is above 200 or not, other specialized tradeskills are as follows: Alchemy 130 before level 51/180 at 51+; Poison Making 200 pre51/250 post51; Tinkering 250, fishing 200. <br />
<br />
<br />
I think that explains it all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Where did you find that little gem? <br />
<br />
As far as I can see in my current sleep-deprived state, both the Main Site FAQ and the FAQ section here an the boards have the correct information. <br />
<br />
Point me at it please?  I like to fix these things as quickly as possible. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's in the general tradeskills FAQ... although it does mention Tanaan further up the page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Another thing to note, the alchemy cap is incorrect in that FAQ.  It is (level-24)*5, with a cap at 200.</div></div><hr />

Another thing to note, the alchemy cap is incorrect in that FAQ.  It is (level-24)*5, with a cap at 200.  <br />
What is incorrect about that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This thread is referring to General Tradeskills FAQ (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=22) in the FAQ section of the board.<br />
<br />
The alchemy level cap formula (&quot;It is (level-24)*5, with a cap at 200.&quot; posted by GraemeFaelban above) would be a change to the two references in the document to &quot;Alchemy&quot;, both of which are (exactly) &quot;Alchemy 130 before level 51/180 at 51+&quot;.<br />
<br />
The original post was referencing the *third* question discussing tradeskill caps.  The first two have an &quot;Update:&quot; discussing &quot;New Tanaan Tradeskill Mastery&quot; (although it is called &quot;New Tanaan Crafting Mastery&quot; ingame), whereas the third version, &quot;Q: How good can I get at a tradeskill?&quot; does not have this update addendum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, sorry, I tacked it on to this thread, as it was discussing the general FAQ, would have made a new thread if I were talking about a different FAQ.  I'll try to be more clear about it in the future.<br />
<br />
To reiterate, Dunthor is correct, I was talking about the references in the General FAQ which state  &quot;Alchemy 130 before level 51/180 at 51+&quot;.</div></div><hr />
