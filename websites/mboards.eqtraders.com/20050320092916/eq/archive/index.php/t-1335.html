Old UI, We Hardly Knew Ye<br />
<br />
After much faithful service, it's time for us to bid a fond farewell to EverQuest's Classic and Velious user interfaces.  In yesterday's Test Server patch, the old interfaces were disabled.<br />
<br />
While adding many features to the new interface over the past six months, including the built-in MP3 player, item links, compass, and enhanced /bug reporting tool, we've done the best that we could to keep all three interfaces, at the very least, usable.<br />
<br />
However, some of the features that we've been quietly working on over the past weeks have unfortunately forced our hand. <br />
<br />
We don't want to spoil all of the upcoming changes at once, however, in yesterday's Test Server update, we released the first run of the new EverQuest windowed mode that's been in the works for quite some time now.  (In a game that was originally written for a much earlier version of DirectX, it's a lot more work than many would think.)  Soon, it will behave in a manner similar to other applications that support both full-screen and windowed mode and can be toggled back and forth.  As a part of this change, the account bans related to the use of third-party EverQuest windowing applications have already been reversed.<br />
<br />
In addition, the long-rumored &quot;Bard Box&quot; has also been revealed on the Test Server.  For those who are not aware, we've been wanting to add a second Effects window that would hold selected short-duration beneficial effects, most notably many bard songs.  Initially, for tuning, the new effects area will allow six additional songs to be placed upon your character. <br />
<br />
These updates will remain on the Test Server only until after the new year, as we expect that much additional testing will be required.<br />
<br />
We hope you'll be as pleased with these latest changes as we are, and we look forward to bringing you many new features in the coming months.<br />
<br />
- The EverQuest Development Team<br />
<br />
<br />
Translation:  EQWindows is now fully supported (and soon, INTEGRAL).  A Bard Buff window will soon be here (and will allow for 21 total effects, factoring in 6 bard songs).  And who knows what else.<br />
<br />
What this means for tradeskillers:  The ability to surf EQTraders while doing your combines!  And we'll no longer have to tolerate endless hours of &quot;Okay, I've masterdd metal bits.  What do I make now?  Where do you buy the parts for that?  What skill level does it take you to?&quot; on the serverwide channel!<br />
<br />
WOO-HOO!</div></div><hr />

They may be lazy, but now we at least have an answer for &quot;Well, I'm not going to spend an hour logging off just so I can look this one (HA!) thing up!&quot;<br />

It's not always lazyness Ngreth.  I have asked recipes a few times on the channel because I forgot the recipe from webpage to character :P</div></div><hr />

Heck, no!!  My binders are my security blanket!  I was thinking more along the lines of Elf Bowling during downtime :D</div></div><hr />

&quot;I do not exist to provide you with information you can readily (and easily) gain on your own, sir.  Furthermore, if your only reason for not looking these recipes up yourself is that it takes too long, then you obviously feel your time is more valuable for mine, for you wish to exchange my time in explaining rth erecipe to you for your time in looking it up.  You, sir, are a nincompoop, and I wash my hands of you.&quot;<br />

Something like that  =)</div></div><hr />

Every time Shoi or I bring this up in serverwide, we get heckled and called rude.   People with horrendous spelling come in and tell us that the only reason that the channel exists is so that we can give them skillup paths from 0-200 in all tradeskills.<br />
<br />
<br />
When we point out that we dont mind giving a forgotten ingrediant, or troubleshooting a DNC, or narrowing down a forgotten trivial, then nobody is listening.  When we are there to provide answers to questions that people ask, nobody notices.<br />
<br />
<br />
But when someone comes in, and has been asking for help with every step of a simple recipe, who has come in doing ZERO research other then hearing part of the name of the it they want to make, and when we tell them in no uncertian terms that we refuse to hold their hand, and they should take the time to log out of the game to do the research for  the recipe that is so precious to you that you MUST have RIGHT NOW....<br />
<br />
When that happens, everyone in the channel criticizes us. And calls us names.<br />

I wonder why it took em so long to do it.  I think  the &quot;reasonable suspension of belief&quot; that they wanted to maintain an immersive fantasy game flew out the window when people started listening to Drowning Pool while xp grinding...<br />
<br />
...so does this mean accidentally hitting alt+tab accidentally instead of alt+1 while chanting a stack of velium will cease to crash me to desktop?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morpheaous Mindtap</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">nah.. not sarcasm.. just wanted to cheer you up some.. albiet, it wasn't the best way possible, just what i could come up with easily..<br />
<br />
as for crashing.. for right now.. it'll still crash.. again, they only added it to the test server.. when they do add it to the live servers.. i would assume that they would work with the common alt + tab combo to switch windows, and probably alt + enter to toggle between full screen and windowed mode.. but then again, this is verant we're talking about.. it could be anything. We'll have to wait and see.</div></div><hr />
