Current skill is 194 but it's slow going for a Thief *grin* Need some Druid/Shaman/Ranger help in DSP hunting down those Rockhoppers faster than I am able solo.  At least I get some guildies to help at times :)<br />
<br />
Concerning the 100 percent weight reducing bags you are referring too, here is the address that lists them, just scroll down until you find Leatherfoot Bags.  It's under Halfling Cultural.<br />

So keep all foraged tufts of dire wolf fur hehe.  At my skill of 170 now, i can probably make a 4 slot 100% one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am currently at 235 Tailoring (higher by weeks end) and have my Tailoring trophy. I'm making the leatherfoot Haversacks currently.<br />
<br />
If you need any of the sacks OR the Druid, Ranger or Paladin Karana armor made look me up. I'm currently wearing the Karana druid tunic and legs.<br />
<br />
My price on the haversacks is 5K. Less if you supply some/most of the components.<br />
<br />
If you cant reach me in the game look for my main Timaeus.<br />

I think I'm going to park my alt ranger in EW for a few days and gather as many furs as I can get my hands on. Can't help much with the blue diamonds though  :? <br />
<br />
Dubius, <br />
If I can supply you with all of the components needed for the druid armour, how many sets would you need to be reasonably certain of a successful combine ? Is 3 enough ? I know you can never guarantee with this stuff.<br />
