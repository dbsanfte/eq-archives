So much that I had to pack up gammy's mule with them...  :D Ok, I could of packed it on my mules... but then I wouldn't be able to log them on during raids and such to give em to ppl... <br />
<br />
Anyways, I have..<br />
<br />
So much assortated baking goods that I had to dump some on lomeloth for ya angel... <br />
3 mug of sea foam for Kelloran<br />
<br />
Anyone doing barbarian cultural?  I got a essence of winter (or something) which haven't been claimed yet...  <br />
<br />
PS: Wyst, tried hunting those sarghlings with Allayne... All I can is DAMN TRAINS!!!  Poor Allayne, I almost killed her twice... Well, we had to evac twice and ended up calling it after that... :(  Any tips on hunting those? pathing is so screwed up there :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wystie</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you guys start at one end and then kill across?  They can be harmonied/pacified so single pulls should be pretty easy.  (though I'm spoiled with the whole mez thing so I don't usually notice if they come in multiples :P )  They're light blue too but *#&amp;!* casting druids... /rude DoTs.<br />
<br />
If I can, I'll go with you next time and see where you guys set up camp.  I would imagine that you can park on the dock too (it's an awfully safe spot) then just pull them across the water if that seems any easier?  (btw, awesome safe spot to sit and fish for Nightmare Chichlid)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allayne</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While there might be no blood ravens around to charm, it sure as heck seems a lot easier!<br />
<br />
The problem wasn't really single pulling them...it was that the pathing where we were trying them seem really messed up.<br />
<br />
We were to the left of the mob, and when pulled it went right and came back with a friend!<br />
<br />
I'm up for trying the docks though.<br />
<br />
Oh yes and I have decided I don't like anything that can dot for almost as much as I can.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wystie</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, you guys started at the hobgobs end and then worked back towards the spiders?  I usually do that opposite.  Start near the spiders (just down the ledge from the werewolf things) then clear towards hobgobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qallainx</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well.. that would explain our big mistake...  :D   Can these be pulled single at 65? or would you need harmo/mez?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angelsyn</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If they're light-blue to Wyst, then she can't single-pull 'em without Harmony/Pacify. ;)<br />
<br />
Good luck...  I wouldn't mind 5 of those Poppers myself. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wystie</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 09:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, honestly, I can't recall if they were all single pulls... didn't make any notes.  But Angel, you'd be surprised how many light blue, or even dark blue mobs a level 65 can pull without adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fulorian</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Slargs come solo or in twos if your puller is 65, none of the ledges agro... but they don't come solo all the time even at 65.</div></div><hr />
