<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PumarahStormweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently ran in to what appears to be a small quest in which a PC asks us to find and bring him some &quot;Freeport Stout&quot; for which he would give some coin. (Sounds like a variant of the Bard's Mail theme) At any rate went around to all the known taverns in Freeport didn't find any selling it, has anyone seen it for sale and where, or is this a brewed item for which I have not yet been able to find a recipe? Anyone seen a recipe for this stuff?</div></div><hr />

More info would be good though, like who asked for it, what zone was s/he in, actual text from the quest? =)</div></div><hr />

Sold at the Grub and Grog Tavern in East Freeport; the vendors are on Freeport Militia or Coalition of Tradesfolk Illegal (Freeport rogues) faction.</div></div><hr />
