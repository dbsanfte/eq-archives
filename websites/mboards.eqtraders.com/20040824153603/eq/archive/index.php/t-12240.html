We had a hose on the washing machine burst in the middle of the night flooding the house. This was October 3. We got our check last week. We still don't have the carpet and tile replaced. We had to switch contractors because, after two weeks of requesting it, we still hadn't gotten the carpet samples to look at. &lt;sigh&gt;</div></div><hr />
