<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can Arctic Wyvern Armor only be made by specific classes? Is it a Cultural Armor like in smithing? Or can any class make Arctic Wyvern?<br />
I couldnt find answer in search.<br />
Is there such a thing as Class Specific Cultural Armors in Tailoring like in Smithing.......or unlike Smithing, are ALL Tailoring recipes open to all classes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">While on the topic............at what skill level should I attempt to start making Arctic Wyvern?<br />
Do you think I can be successful at cpmbines on this at skill lvl 180? Or should I wait until 200?<br />
Is this a decent way to get skill-ups, or is Solstice Robes recommended over this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>lonewylfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">afaik, wyvern is open to everybody.<br />
<br />
And yes, there is cultural tailoring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dalur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From my personal experience, I would save off the Wyvern hides until after you have done the solstice robes.<br />
<br />
I did solstice robes from about 188 till 210 and then did the 2 freebie points and then gained 1 more points from finishing up the stock of solstice robes that I had left.<br />
<br />
After that I started doing mixes between WE cultural tailering and black panther and wyvern hide stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How did you get 2 Freebie points at that skill level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The conventional wisdom is this:<br />
<br />
Do Ribbons to 189<br />
Do Solstice Robes to 210<br />
Do Ethereal stuff ill 212<br />
Do Hoppers/Velious armor till 248/250</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Galain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When you look up a recipe it tells you if it is a restricted combine.  For example Tunarean Scout Boots (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=7867&amp;menustr=035000000000)  are a restricted combine.  This is shown in the following line:<br />
<br />
To make tunarean scout boots (Tailoring: Yield 1, trivial &gt;250), (Restricted) Combine the following in a fier`dal sewing kit<br />
<br />
If it doesn't have the restricted label, anyone can make it.  Also, you can click on the restriction to find out what the restriction is.  For example, some items are Race restricted, while others are current skill level restricted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">By freebie points we mean you make ethereal silk swatches, which use a commonly dropped planar item+brewed temper made with vendor ingredients. <br />
<br />
Most tailoring skill-ups at that level don't come that easy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>PetrosDaroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What everyone else is failing to mention is that at skill level 210 + Geerlok, your effective skill is 220, which is the required skill level to make the ethereal swatches, but you can still get skill points from 210 to 212 since they trivial at 212.<br />
<br />
Hence, 210-212 on ethereal swatches = &quot;freebie&quot; so long as you have a Geerlok, which are easily purchased in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually id like to make a correction...<br />
<br />
Arctic Wyvern armor cannot be made by just anyone.<br />
<br />
It is only made my a very select group of people: The completly insane.<br />
<br />
And im not talking about the normal, garden variety yelling-screaming obsceneties, scaring the neighbors, running around wearing nothing but a hello kitty necktie, doing horrid unspeakable acts to garden gnomes type insane....<br />
<br />
This kind of insanity is much worse.... much more sinister..<br />
<br />
Its the kind which drives some poor schmuck into alternately yelling, crying, dancing and praying in front of a computer monitor for days and days... forsaking friends, family, food and jobs...  just to see a 3 digit number increase by 1.... and then 1 more... and then.... one... more...... skillup.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Splunge is right.<br />
<br />
:sing: <br />
<br />
wow, I just saw the 'Dead horse' smiley!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Seedling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">acrylia studded/reinforced might be a better way. It'll get you to 242, and some of the items fetch a fairly good tribute.</div></div><hr />
