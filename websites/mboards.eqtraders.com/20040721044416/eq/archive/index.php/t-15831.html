<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nyllith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I seem to have run into a wall with Brewing, and was hoping somebody here might be able to shed some light on why this is happening.<br />
<br />
I used Minotaur Hero's Brew to get from 188 to 200, and the skill-ups were moving along at a moderate pace.  Once I hit 200 skill, however, the skill-ups seem to have stopped completely.<br />
<br />
I'm currently doing MHB in batches of 80 combines, have 238 WIS (KEI buffed), and am using a Geerlok Fermentation Device.  After the first batch netted 0 skill-ups, I figured it was no big deal, just a bad run on the RNG.  After the second batch netted 0 skill-ups, I was beginning to wonder if maybe I needed to go shopping for more WIS gear.  After the 3rd, 4th, and 5th batches gave 0 skill-ups, I'm convinced it's bugged, or I've missed some Tradeskiller's secret along the way.  Granted, the 238 WIS is a bit lower than I would like for Tradeskilling, and I expected I would probably see a mediocre rate in skill-ups, at best, but 400 consecutive combines with 0 skill-ups seems a bit excessive.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions as to why this might be happening, or what I can try to improve my rate of skill-ups would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nitpaac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just to make sure... you don't have another tradeskill above 200 and are now missing the three AA to get brewing higher than 200?<br />
If not, I guess it's just the RNG laughing at you.<br />
When things like that happened to me, it occured that my next skillup session started with a skillup within the first combines..just to make it more sarcastic :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Furyrpied</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, double check that you don't have any other Trades over 200, or make sure you spend those AAs you need.<br />
<br />
If that's not it, I hear sacrificing a gnome is good luck... But I'm partial to the wee folk.<br />

As with what others said, be sure you don't already have a main tradeskill higher than 200. That having been said...your run of 400 combines is unexpected, but not out of the ordinary. I suspect the PRNG is simply just treating you poorly. At the risk of hijacking the thread, I once went on a click-fest of 1000 baking combines and got a single skillup. Hang in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Joltz Panacea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ack, 400, curse the RNG  :mad: .  I did 160 combines last night, skill 188 and skill 315, nada for skill-ups  :( .  88 successfull combines so the percentages should have gotten at least a couple of skill-ups, but oh well, at least it's cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>sudanger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Then i can consider myself lucky. 600 combines brought me from 226 to 248.<br />
<br />
btw 187int being my highest skill :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>papyscott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">While it could be the RNG, hitting the wall at 200 is fairly suspecious.  Definitely make sure you have New Tanaan AA sufficient for your number of tradeskills &gt; 200<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kumulas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When I was doing my baking combines to get to 250 I did 400 combines of MTP's and went from skill of 239 to 240. I was a little unhappy about that and was in a &quot;I hate EQ&quot; mood. Then I loaded up the rest of my gathered supplies and started the next 400 combines. Same buffs, same day, same oven in the same zone. I went from 240 to 249. <br />
<br />
Guess all I can say is the RNG is playing with you and you can scream to the gods of Norrath but in the end you just have to load up the supplies and hit the combine button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ahye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I had something similar happen to me, although I hit the 'wall' at around 160. While working on brewing tonight, my monk (int and wisdom both around 125) was doing just fine until I hit 160-ish. Then I started getting roughly one skill up every 800-1000 combines. I realize that my stats are a bit low, but the lack of skill ups seems a bit excessive. I've managed to struggle up to 203 so far, but its slow going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Myrron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd really consider getting some tradeskill gear to boost one of those stats (wis may be easier for a monk since BSTs and Druids also wear leather).  The money you spend on gear will be repaid when you are doing hundreds less combines per point.<br />

This is what I do... check my profile and you'll see I have a set of wis items I use when tradeskilling.   I also get a KEI, hehe, 25 wis a big help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Psychax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">All I can say is wow.  After 50 combines no skillup I get pissy.  I maxed baking from 226 with aprox 600 combines  Wis was never over 240.  The stuff i was making was never more than 70 points from my  current skill level.  It was also all mob dropped.<br />
Sorry for your luck...but i'd also go with you having another trade skill over 200.</div></div><hr />
