<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>natureofreality</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am on the E'Ci server and have gotten to 189 in JC. I was curious what I could make that would sell well to help pay for further skill ups and just to make some coin in general. It seems that players these days can buy items better than what can be made with JC and at a cheaper cost than what we would need to sell an item just to break even. I was thinking about electrum jaded bracelets, but just not sure. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm not wanting to make uber plat, just enough to justify even doing JC and make it worth the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Phrajile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are probably about 2 years late in trying to get much in terms of profit from crafting jewellery using store-bought ingredients. <br />
<br />
Nowadays, they're pretty much useless, given the massive influx of better accessories into the market.<br />
<br />
The only remote way of generating any form of profit from JC'ing would be to reach 240 (with Trophy) and make Tier 1 or Tier 2 PoP jewellery (ie. Glittering Rings of Judgement, Valorium Rings of Gallantry), and hope you don't fail so much that you end up losing money instead.<br />
<br />
Some of us are praying for GoD for a revival of tradeskill relevance.</div></div><hr />
