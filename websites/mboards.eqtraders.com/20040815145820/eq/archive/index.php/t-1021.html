<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Currently.....for selling to vendors.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping it'll turn out to be for a new Baking or Brewing recipe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kuamena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got some from fishing in PoN and from Fishing in PoT, so far non from PoV. been selling then to vendors but i think I am going to save them from now on  :)  maybe if not for Baking could be for Alchemy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daeanor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Arg, I hate stuff like this, you never know whether you should save it or not. Nine times out of ten, it's junk and not worth the bank space. But I still remember seeing Blue Diamonds by the half-ton on vendors and debating whether I should buy them. There was no known use at the time. To my grief, I did not, and a week or two later usages for them were implemented and the prices skyrocketed.<br />
<br />
Then there were Cobalt Cod - every fish you caught in CS was one, and I fished up STACKS of them. I was very happy to turn them into stacks of oil.<br />
<br />
All that said, these seem to be easily gotten and fairly common, so I wouldn't go too nuts.</div></div><hr />
