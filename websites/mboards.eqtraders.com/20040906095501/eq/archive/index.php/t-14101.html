Yes.  I did walk to school.<br />
<br />
Yes.  It was uphill, but only one way (obviously).<br />
<br />
Yes, I believe in helping people learn the basics of something in order to get them started.<br />
<br />
But why, oh why, must we give them a free ride for 56 (going by memory on this.  I seem to recall that's what the &quot;simple shirts&quot; trivialed out at but I'm not positive and I'm not at home right now to check) skill points?!<br />
<br />
True, you can only do a limited number of combines and not everyone will actually hit 56* by the time they are done with the shirts.  I just don't understand why they felt they needed to give away free skillup materials for this quest.<br />
<br />
Couldn't the Wayfarers have asked for Tattered Belts/boots/pants/shirts or Silk?  (Of course, then I would also recommend they lower the number of turn ins required to go along with this.)  They could have used existing recipes for all of these quests instead of giving away free skillup material.<br />
<br />
Someone please explain to me why, why, why?<br />
<br />
(Yes, I know this isn't much of a rant.  It' smore of an expression of disbelief, but I figured it would wind up moved to here anyway and figured I'd save the mods the work.)</div></div><hr />

To get more people started in tradeskills.  Really.  That IS what it comes down to.  Tradeskills were always an afterthought in EQ, but the newer devs are trying to make them more of an integral part.  That means though, that they need to attract more folk to even trying them.  And besides, most people toss 21 training points in, so it's not many more free skillups then it would be anyway.<br />
<br />
I have to admit, I'm toying with taking one of my played characters and raising baking all over again, using just the starter quest and the tuna and crab, just to see how it works out.  My baker isn't a played character anyway....</div></div><hr />
