<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DaluinRizzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When doing lined and sealed vials, I always fired them so that I can sell them back.<br />
<br />
Don't do this with advanced!  Unfired advanced vials sell back to the vendor for ~1 gold (maybe more or less).  Fired advanced vials sell back for 1 copper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Voltai Ausra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Speaking as both a rogue and a master potter I don't understand why you are selling the vials back to the vendors in the first place.  There are a lot of lazy rogues that don't want to take the time to learn pottery (I should know I was one of them for months!) that just goto pok and buy the vials from the poison merchants.  It's expensive yes, but so much easier and faster than making them yourself.<br />
<br />
Potters with a skill that is high enough to make advanced poison vials that sell them back to vendors are wasting a great source of income for themselves.  Making the vials costs half of what it does to buy them from the vendors.  So make the vials put a 25% mark up on them and sell them in stacks of 20 in Pok or Baz as you prefer.  It's an easy way to make money as a potter, besides finding yourself bakers and farming off worthless kit on them. (bowls,tin,frying pans and the like)<br />
<br />
It's something that anyone who is a Potter with some skill might want to consider. Heck I make them for my guild and it's allies at a 10% markup.   It's bought me the patterns for alot of my ornate chain quests.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've had 6+ stacks of Lined poison vials and 8+ stacks of Sealed poison vials on my trader in the bazaar for months on Xegony and they aren't selling...<br />
<br />
I have the lined for 2 pp (merchants charge 4+ pp for them) and the sealed for 3.5 pp (merchants charge 6+ pp for them))<br />
<br />
I had hoped to find that plethora of lazy rogues as well, but apparently Xegony doesn't have any lazy rogues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had the same experience on Seventh Hammer.  I had a couple of stacks sitting on my vendor for months at about those same prices until a guild member needed some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>HoverCraaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">With the ease of getting pottery up to lower lvls (120ish), there may not be a high demand for these for some time, but keep faith.<br />
<br />
There is a rumble in the distance, as more and more rogue's will turn to poison making with the new stackable poisons. I, myself as a rogue, was never interested in making poisons when they were single-charge, unstackable items. There used to be so many reasons NOT to go after poison making, that I'd say 80%+ of rogues never bothered.<br />
<br />
My point? There is/will be a market for vials. Make em, stick em in the long lost trader satchel in your big bank inventory, and sell them in another couple weeks/months to some rogues that have seen the light. =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I doubt there will ever be much of a market for poison vials.<br />
<br />
No one makes old world poisons for actual use. They are only good once and by once I mean one proc.... they're not a 10 minute duration proc like PoP poisons. A few people make them for skill but you need so many that its just so much easier to buy the needed vials from the merchant.  Also, keep in mind that many (if not most) rogues choose to simply buy poison making up to 250 at their trainer rather than bother with actual skilling.<br />
<br />
As for PoP poisons, well.<br />
<br />
Failing to make a PoP poison returns the advanced vial.<br />
<br />
When you make a 10 shot poison out of 10 singles, you get all 10 advanced vials back.<br />
<br />
Bottom line... you only ever need 10 advanced vials.<br />
<br />
And most rogues still don't bother with the hassle of it all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>HoverCraaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Those lazy little worms! :p<br />
<br />
Why don't they spend countless hours and hard earned PP to get that last 50-60pts!<br />
<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
I am approaching a skill of 190ish now on Bavek, and will most likely take the same route (judging from past attempt VS skill up rates). <br />
<br />
But on a sucessful 10 dose PoP poison combine, the vials will in fact be used (therefore requiring the purchase of MORE adv poison vials). Furthermore, if what you say is true about rogues just buying the vials instead of making them themselves, that furthers my point that there is a market for them.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that if you fill 10 trader sachels with vials, you gonna be rich by Monday morning. I'm not saying you EVER get rich off these glass shards. :p I'm saying that if you made vials to get your pottery skill up, DONT SELL THEM TO VENDORS/DESTROY THEM!! Fire them suckers and put em in your trader sachels for sales down the road to recoup *some* of your investment. You can charge less than the vendor (yes you'll still loose money this way, but it more than you'll get from Mr. Destroy Button), and they will sell in Bazaar. <br />

<br />
I couldn't resist...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You get all 10 advanced vials back when you combine 10 singles into a 10 shot.<br />
<br />
Said it before... I'm saying it again. Whoever told you otherwise is wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>HoverCraaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Due to recent changes, I have to retort what I said earlier about firing the vials and selling them to PC's.<br />
<br />
Since you can now buy any poison vial (all three are priced the same) for 1g 4s or so, there is ZERO profit to be made from the sale of these items back to the PC market. In fact, the cost of the firing sheet is twice that (or more) which you will recieve when selling back (4sp per fired vial to NPC).<br />
<br />
So please disregard everything stated earlier, as it's relevence no longer applies. <br />
<br />
Thanks SOE for @#$%ing the one source of decent income for Rogues in the tradeskill market. (I see no reason to up other skills, as I have a WIS class for this)<br />
<br />
Thanks offline Macro-users for @#$%ing us over so that SOE made such changes.<br />
<br />
Sigh... /rant off</div></div><hr />
