<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Keep in mind the way I gm'ed my skill is not necessary the cheapest or most efficient way however it worked for me. I am also only skilling up to a 240 skill as I have a geerlock. This guide will work for any race however I am a Iksar.<br />

0-21 Buy skills from your gm or make ale (barley, cask, malt, water flask) all the ingreadents are found on the vendors right next to the bank water is in west cab next to the guy to get your LoDN aug<br />
<br />
21-68 ale (barley, cask, malt, water flask)<br />
<br />
68-135 Ol'tujim's Fierce Brew (barley, cask, hops, malt, yeast)<br />
<br />
135-240+ Minotaur Hero's Brew (cask, malt(3), short beer(2), water flask(2), yeast)<br />
<br />
All of this stuff is buy able in east cab except the water flasks which is in the next zone. The trivs are high I know this is so that you do not go through as many casks heck your not doing this for a profit are you? Also I did not use my geerlock because I wanted to fizzle. This is the cheapest skill to gm<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goldenly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unless you are KOS to the vah shir guys, after the fetid essence, you can make vah shir essence to upper 180s. All you need to do is run around the zone the Shar Val POK stone takes you looking for trees with purple leaves and the payala fruit ground spawn under them (not all have them, but the same ones always do - 1 payala fruit, water flask). My kitty bard and my druid run a around the zone for a couple of hours and get 8 to 10 stacks of the stuff (depending on distractions :) By the time I make a circut of the zone, the fruit has respawned.  The little hoppers drop LQ - HQ hopper hides too, so when I get bored....<br />
<br />
There is one tree between the banker and the merchants that I start at.  Then there are 4 or 5 trees with ground spawn next to the merchant area heading away from the bank..<br />
