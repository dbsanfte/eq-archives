can it be? is it true? can the utopia smithing market (where everyone price matches and no undercutting) continue? time will tell!<br />
<br />
i probably just jinx it.. but it was interesting while it lasted  :P</div></div><hr />

Maybe the idiots with more money than sense have finished now?  We can always hope!</div></div><hr />

oh well. sold all mine at my previous price.. im happy  8)</div></div><hr />

I don't imagine sickles will ever have a &quot;set&quot; price again :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i dont' have a problem with undercutting.<br />
<br />
but do it right, it's a perfect market. just go 1p lower then the lowest guy. dont' go 100, or 1000 less, just 1p less.<br />
<br />
people will buy the cheapest. whether they save 1p or 100p, they don't care as long as it's the cheapest.<br />
<br />
and that's why i'm 1p lower then the guy that had the lowest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i guess my point is.. if everyone has the same price. .. everyone will sell their wares...   (in a perfect market)<br />
<br />
so if you place sickles at 1pp less.. i price match.. then you undercut by 1pp again.. and I price match again...  repeat, repeat.. repeat.. ad nauseum.</div></div><hr />

Someone tried that with me on Halas pies last weekend.  I had over 500 of them, in addition to the 15-20 stacks my warrior already has, and dumped them on one of my son's lesser used chars as a secondary trader.  I price matched the lowest seller at 7p per pie, which seemed kind of low, but anything is better than holding them.  Subsequently I made another run, and put 90 more on my regular trader.<br />
<br />
Next thing I see is 4p.  I matched.  Then 3p 9g, then 3p 5g.  I dropped to 3p.  I played the game and forced them to 2p.  When they were off-line, I ended up selling most everything I had on both chars at 4p. <br />
<br />
What a joke!  I understand, though I can't condone, undercutting on high ticket items to make some money, but for chump change? <br />
<br />
Hopefully, he got his 2p  :roll:</div></div><hr />

Lately I have either not bothered bringing up the trader, or when I do, I make sure the prices are where they *should* be, and just wait for the undercutters to either run out or disappear.<br />
<br />
Of course, if I can catch them down low enough, I guess I could always buy them out and resell at the &quot;corrected&quot; price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">it doesnt always work when buying them out if there is combined total of about 50-60 robes on the market ...  that would eat up alot of investment pp to try and normalize price...  and what if they just replace what you buy right away?  <br />
<br />
damned if you do... damned if you dont.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think i'm mostly responsible for the price of Robes today.  Sorry guys... when you've got 150 robes and no cash... a brotha's gotta do what a brotha's gotta do :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>matteo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't see the robe market recovering ever.  It is very good option to raise skill from 180ish to 230ish.  For that reason people are going throw their entire stock of robes on the market and undercut each other.   If each person would put up one robe a night at 1k everyone would sell them.  Instead you have lots of people putting up 10- 60 robes at 500pp. <br />
<br />
Up until last week I was still pretty cool with doing robes for skillups.  Then I went 12/20 at 237 skill without a skill up.  Used up my chains and became annoyed.  I sold off the rest of my blessed tunare silk to someone lower in skill. <br />
<br />
I have 13 points to go.  Going to finish out with AWM (have 500ish hides).  Picked up a cheap stack of yew leaves and already had the rest of the components so will mix in some black/haze panther gear and woodelf blue diamond cultural.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Disso... im pretty the potc earring market has already been saturated and on average I would say 2-3 worth of tradeskill sets are sold on average per day... putting out your entire supply wont make it sell faster =(<br />
<br />
unless of course its a new expansion coming out that adds a new race.. then you can probably get a rush of buyers for twinking  :shock:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ilona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Unfortunately, when it comes to PotC items, they will sell at a steady rate no matter what the price.<br />
<br />
That means your putting robes at 500pp instead of 1k or 2400 (yes, they used to sell for that!) won't get any more robes sold, it will just mean that you get less for them.<br />
<br />
Also note that there are some traders in the bazaar that will let their prices stay static if you price-match but undercut you if you undercut them first they also always have robes despite not gaining skill on them more (ie Nucer).<br />
Then there are those that insist on undercutting you if you pricematch, to the point of pettiness.  They especially do it if they don't like you (ie Icelion).<br />
Occasionally you will see someone that has just one item to get rid of after upgrading, and will price at MUCH lower (ie half everyone else's price).  That person isn't a threat to the market unless everyone else decides to undercut them in return (which isn't worth it if you have high skill).<br />
The last set of people is those that will priceMATCH on whatever they're making.  They will continue to price match when the undercutter lowers, but not undercut in return.<br />
<br />
The above categorisation comes from a LONG time of watching the prices of tradeskilled items in the bazaar.  Thankfully I am not making robes for skillups at the moment; I find it deplorable that they sell for under the cost to make at max JC and tailoring skill.  I make them occasionally for friends and guildies only.<br />
<br />
Anyone want to help me level to get JCM aa so I can afford to do robes again when Ilona learns to tailor properly? :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aandaie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">(Oops, after making this big long post I just realized this topic was for the RODCET NIFE server. So basically disregard.. I don't play on that server. OOPS. So this would be more general on the topic)<br />
<br />
Undercut is a derrogatory way of saying &quot;compete.&quot; Instead of Undercut I prefer &quot;being in business and using good business practices.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you match your price with everyone elses, what shopper is going to buy yours? This is why stores in real life compete with sales.<br />
<br />
I don't want them to buy yours, I want them to buy mine and yours can rot. That is what good business is. The market is limited, everyone is not going to buy sickles or whatever while I'm selling for 8 hours overnight. So temporary sellers are more liketly to use &quot;good business practices.&quot; I want the money from selling now, not tomorrow.<br />
<br />
I disagree with the poster who says putting a robe at 500 plat won't mean you sell more than if it is at 1 k or 2k. When I was getting POTC items I WAITED for the best prices, over days, while I continued to make more money. A person who put up a robe then at 500 plat would have sold it instantly to me, then he would have sold another instantly to another player doing the same. It makes a difference when players are not going to pay 2k. You seem to be of the mindset that I want to buy a potc kit and have unlimited cash, so if components are 2k or 4 k I'm just going to say &quot;oh well I guess they are not going to get cheaper!&quot; and buy them. I'm not going to do that, you can't force me into paying more than I can afford.<br />
<br />
I originally got my druid two POTC earrings, then I was much more frugal in getting my cleric one. I still have not bought one for my sk troll, in no hurry to pay a premium for the parts. I should start checking prices again, maybe I'll find some healthy competition and some bargains.<br />
You will sell more at cheaper prices because other players do the same thing, especially with twinks. If you have 500 plat to your name and see the robe for 500 plat, you buy the robe now. If you have 2 k to your name and see the robe for 2 k, you don't want to blow 2 k all at once on something that might get cheaper.<br />
<br />
Profit is profit and the bazaar is the only true realm of PVP in this game, as it should be ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I agree in &quot;competing&quot; for business.. but that only works if you have a near unlimited supply of product and constant buyers.  However, you dont need to compete with someone else when they only have one for sale.. who might be just trying to sell for quick cash (see Ilona's comment posted early about those types of traders)<br />
<br />
I make anywhere from 0-4 sickles and sell every single one at 1800pp (or whatever reasonable price match I can find).<br />
<br />
PotC robes are down to 400pp.   I think im going to sell off my components and just focus on arctic wyvern hide combines instead.  Even if I dont make any profit, at least it will save my wrist from all that mind-numbing subcombine work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">go take a course in micro economics.<br />
<br />
there is no differentiation in our products. and only the lowest price sells. there is no barrier to entry. that is a market called Perfect competition.<br />
<br />
like i posted earlier, i price my items for sale at 1p lower then the lowest. this maximises my marginal revenue. and does not damage the overall market price. granted, i'm not competing in the solstice robe market (yet, if at all, hopefully arctic wyvern is a bit easier, but i havent researched it yet). <br />
<br />
if pushed, i have no problem doing the full accounting, figuring out my marginal cost for each product i make and setting my marginal revenue at that point.<br />
<br />
in a perfect competition there are no Economic profits made (Revenue - Explicit costs - implicit costs= Economic profits).<br />
<br />
the only option to try and set the price is the formation of a Cartel, unfortunaltly one of the items that prevents a cartel is that we lack a barrier to entry. anyone can spend the time and become a tailor flooding the market with items that undercut ours, and many times drastically. <br />
<br />
i have no problem cooperating with any of these measures, but as long as &quot;lowest price&quot; - 1 is greater then my marginal cost. that will be my price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ilona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">i have no problem cooperating with any of these measures, but as long as &quot;lowest price&quot; - 1 is greater then my marginal cost. that will be my price.<br />
... and as long as it's an item that (a hypothetical) I can be bothered making, then I will always match your price...<br />
<br />
Hence the problems start... hypothetically both you and I will be checking our vendors often, you will always be undercutting by 1pp, I will be matching you.  This will continue until you have lowered your price to your marginal cost, at which point I imagine you leave it there when I price match.<br />
<br />
Why not just save the hassle for both of us and put the item up at your marginal cost in the first place?  It would save both you and I a lot of time.<br />
<br />
*Note:  in this case I use an *I* where it could be any one of a large number of tradeskillers that do the &quot;price match but not undercut&quot; option from the list on the first page :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">tell you what.. you make sickles and sell them to me for cost + 1pp.. and I will be glad to buy them all off your hands and resell at &quot;market value&quot; <br />
<br />
have you guys noticed the price of solstice robes lately? BELOW cost...  yikes... guess I will save the 6 robes i have for twinks to make earrings or sell earring sets...  that just insane!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ilona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Yes, I saw robes at 250pp when I last looked.  That's the cost of the gem studded chain, assuming NO failures.<br />
<br />
I'm glad I'm not making those any more :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, it's really icky.  I always match the lowest price, though.  When I started selling, they were at 700pp or something, and they've kept dropping to 250pp.  I guess robes are just the byproduct of skilling up so they aren't concerned about profit in the first place, or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Praetor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">In other news, I bought several sickles for my twinks for 300-500pp each last night.<br />
