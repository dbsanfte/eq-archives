<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">first for some reason i am enjoying fletching way too much.  i plan on getting it to 202 and actually like it so far, unlike tailoring which is getting annoying with drop rates.  atm i am trying to decide what to take over 200 brewing or baking but if i start getting enough drops i might choose flecthing instead.  <br />
the question i have is since i have a shaped oak 1 cam bow on my ranger alt would a trueshot be enough of an upgrade to do this quest with my main or wait and do it for rp as my ranger.  ranger will do it either way unless its a pita but main might not.  looking at it the stats look like an easy increase if i have to do teh quest a few times once i get to 200 and geerlock for 210 skill.  doesn't even look expensive and my main is a 39 wizard with good quadding skill so the clockworks will porlly die.  just wondering if the quest was much harder than it sounded or if i should go for it and have the ranger make another one himself later anyway.  did i mention i liked feltching and this seemed a fun thing to do anyway.<br />
<br />
reading this again i think i answered my own question.  i gonna go do the quest it seems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mayera Silverwinds</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd say personally that either the Trueshot, or if you're alt is a Tunare worshipper, the Blessed Faydark Stinger, are both worth the trouble. If you want to spend the money on skilling up your alt, you only need to get to 156 in order to make it. Personally, my Tunare ranger used both until he got a Cloudburster. He used the Stinger while running around, or pulling, for the stats, and then used the Trueshot while skilling up for dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ether_sphynx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Trueshot is only worth it as follows:<br />
<br />
1. rite of passage for rangers<br />
<br />
2. below approx level 30<br />
<br />
Once you get 100 fletching, start trying to make it. Took me 10 attempts. Others take less, some more.<br />
<br />
The 20 DMG 45 DLY realy is not much different than the Wood Elf cultural other than the stats.<br />
<br />
Trueshot 20/45 ------&gt; 2.25 ratio (lower = better)<br />
Stinger 20/60 -------&gt; 3.00<br />
Swiftbolt 23/55 -------&gt; 2.39<br />
Cloudburster 25/55 ------&gt; 2.20<br />
<br />
If just using for pulling, ratio is irrelevant and DMG is everything. Max inflicted damage = bow DMG + arrow DMG + modifiers. 20 vs 25 bow DMG... not much different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pondlife</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My $0.02 on this.  Trueshot is definitely worth it for a number of reasons:<br />
<br />
1.  It is a Ranger quest, and with that comes a certain pride in achieving it.  One to do after the newbie armour and sword quests, that involves travelling to places one may otherwise not often see.<br />
<br />
2. The bow is fairly cheap to obtain (notwithstanding the cost of increasing fletching skill) and can be sold on for a profit (especially on Stromm - I've sold four for 200-250pp).<br />
<br />
3. The Range, Delay and Damage can only really be improved upon with top of the range darkwood and shadewood bows, which cost a lot to make in comparison.<br />
<br />
Note that, from memory the Micro Servo drop from clockworks is No Drop, so your Ranger will need to collect them.  They drop very infrequently, and mostly from the smaller Rogue Clockworks nearest to the Windmills in SF.  The Drops from the larger RC's nearer the Mino layer seem very rare.<br />
<br />
I failed this at around 70 Fletching skill, and didn't fail once past 140.<br />
<br />
Ether_S - the BFT is WAY better than the other cultural bows.  I presume you didn't mention it due to the &gt;250 trivial.  The other cultural bows will still prove attractive due to stats, especially on Range.  Surely for Pulling, Range is the most important stat and damage the least (unless you want the aggro)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Pondlife</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh, and one other thing - the Trueshot is Lore, so one at a time only, in case you were thinking of using it to skill up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mayera Silverwinds</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah the main reason I used the Stinger over the Trueshot for pulling was the range. The Trueshot had the better dmg/dly so I generally switched to it if I was skilling up archery and/or trying for bow dps in a group at low level.</div></div><hr />
