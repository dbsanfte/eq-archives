<br />
I made some of these this morning... A LOT of these.  Since most of us here can bake for profit... here is my question...<br />
<br />
What should we be selling them for?  I plan on giving 80% of what I made to the guild, but I was thinking about throwing a few on the mule ( I may never make another Halas pie now that the 3000 I made 2 weeks ago are gone) and seeing if they sell.<br />
<br />
Let me know what others are selling them for, and lets all try and make a few coins this time around.<br />

<br />
I actually haven't seen any for sale in the bazaar yet, and all the ones I make go to my guild and friends. However since it takes effectively 3 Hero Parts to make 2 sandwiches I'd say they should sell for more than the average price of a MTP.</div></div><hr />

Hopperr trapped my poor enchanter into making a ton of them and then stopped selling :P Mean old hobbit that he is. <br />

I actually think they should be significantly higher than picnics, given the fact that the main ingredient needs to be hunted.<br />
<br />
Skinny... I am so sick of pies I could scream.  People are selling them for pennies, and frankly I no longer need the money :)  Sorry that you made them all, but if you want to put them on my mule, I have no problem with that.  When I did Fay this weekend, I actually took 600 pies to my raid and gave the dang things away... whether people wanted them or not!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ariene</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL!  I force feed my entire guild Halas Pies as I've been skilling up on them.  <br />
<br />
As far as a price, I made a few of these and gave them away to the guildies who helped me hunt the meat.  If I were selling though I think I would probably start high and see how they move.  The ingrediants aren't easy to get and 4 sandwhiches for 3 meat assuming no fail will keep these pretty rare I think once people go through the meat they had stockpiled.  <br />
<br />
The melee in my guild turned them down saying that the halas pie was just as good for them but the casters and hybrids were pretty impressed with the stats on these.  With Halas Pie selling for 3.5p now  :(  I think these should EASILY go for 10p but I would start them at 40-50p and see if they move and then slowly lower it if they don't.</div></div><hr />

Oh yeah, and I'm now out of hero parts, so what I have left on Brew is my total stock left.  Started with about 22 stacks, first batch I used 12 stacks, and just used the remianing 10 stacks last night.  So unless I get a nice hefty supply, I won't be able to make more for awhile. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rydex</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">50pp sounds like a good place to start, if they dont sell takem down a couple plat. I thought Justice Fruit Pies might sell for up to 40pp but I cant seem to sell them when I am on /trader for 35pp. Other servers report Justice Pies selling like hotcakes, maybe Bristlebane dosnt have the food aficionados.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mad Baker Hobbitt</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gonna go With Brew's price.  Had a conversation with her the other day, and a lot of the prices on BB have gotten simply terrible.<br />
<br />
I see nothing wrong with 50pp per sandwich.  I have quite a few stacks of the meat, and If I am going to bake anything, I would like it to be something different.  Still, I do plan on giving this to a lot of my guildmates... They deserve it first in my opinion...I can bake like I do in large part to their efforts as well.<br />
<br />
Rydex, with the Justice Pie, I think a lot of the hurdles in selling those is just getting a few people hooked on them as stat food.  I was one of the first to mass produce Halas pies on BB... even so, I had to start somewhere.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mad Baker Hobbitt</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been selling these on and off.  Have kind of set myself to baking only one day a week, so I really have not had a lot on my mule.  Here's the deal though.  I sold a LOT of these sandwiches (and accidentally destroyed a satchel full) for 100+pp each.  They have been averaging 75p, and they all go when I put them up.<br />
<br />
Just remember... Just because you can have a second 100% weight reduction bag for getting your trophy... No rent means no rent... the blasted thing disappears (with all your sandwiches in it) if you happen to log.<br />
