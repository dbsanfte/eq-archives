<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>matteo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Made Mithril Champion Arrows from 204 - 250.  <br />
<br />
Total combines 1667 - ~36 combines per skill up<br />
<br />
Cost is 32pp per every 2 combines<br />
<br />
Total cost = ~26688pp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arrica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What was your dex/wis/int sitting at for the majority of your combines?  I'm currently at 217 dex, and it's pretty easy to get to 255, so I may want to look into mithril arrows as a possible skill up route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>matteo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dex was 305.  Int/Wis were both around 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dalur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Is that the final cost after you made and sold (I'm guessing you just sold back to the vendors?) or cost of just making?<br />
<br />
Sounds like a pretty good way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>matteo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Each arrow sells back to vendors for 1sp.  <br />
<br />
I have about 5000 arrows which I loaded on a couple mules.  I will probably attempt to bazaar them for whatever the going rate is on my server (haven't checked).  At this point I have just written off the 26kpp and am happy to be 250 skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dalur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the info.<br />
<br />
Also, does dex/agi really  matter when it comes to fletching?  I thought it was only the higher of your int/wis that counted (except for smithing where str helps).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">in the faq but dex is to fletching what str is to smithing.  kinda unfair to the rangers to let wizards max flecthing with 255 int while range have probs getting to 255 wis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>straatius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This is basically the cheapest route to 250, besides farming, correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">for wood elves yes.  farming acrylia arrows is the only cheaper route.  think this takes dews though.  not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As far as I know, the arrows made with acrylia need condensed _____ (shadow, ice, fire) arrow heads.  Chunk of condensed ______ (shadow, ice, fire), file, water flask in a forge.  Yield is 2.  Trivial at 116 smithing.   According to the recipe section, they don't need the dews.<br />
<br />
The components for the mithril arrows can all be bought though.  If you want to make the large brick of mithril needed for the shafts, then you need the dews.<br />
<br />
Chek out the recipes here. (http://www.eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=39&amp;rsa=Fletching&amp;sb=item&amp;sub=&amp;menustr=080060000000)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ok.  it doesn't look like you need dews for flecthing.  :boggled: semms really unfair to hie cultural but anyway.<br />
<br />
acrylia arrows use only water.  sorry i didn't seperate them better.</div></div><hr />
