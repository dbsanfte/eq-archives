<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, you've spent the time making 100 (insert popular subcombine).  You know you have your set price, and have always had your prices there, usualy the lowest in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
You /bazaar to see who else is selling them and how many they have.  You see another tradder selling 100 at the same price.<br />
<br />
Do you play fair, and take a 50-50 chance of selling them and keep at the same price, do you under cut him by a copper or silver, or under cut him at a noticeable discount (say 10%)?<br />
<br />
 Edited poll questions to remove the value  judgements.  Please, for the sake of all that is civil and good, do not turn this into a flame-fest or allow it to descend into personal attacks. ~Lothay</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends on the situation and the item.<br />
<br />
If I'm selling food, filleting knives, or non-stick frying pans (I rarely stock frying pans), I usually match. <br />
<br />
If its HMPs however, I do tend to undercut. I rarely stock more than 2 or 3 stacks at one time, and there are usually others who have several hundred HMPs for sale, so its price vs. volume.<br />
<br />
If I'm selling leather padding or skinning knives, I undercut. <br />
<br />
Not tradeskill related, but I also go buy stacks of Fuzzlecutter from Ping in West Freeport and sell them on occasion, and I almost always undercut on those. <br />
<br />
However, I rarely undercut by more than 5gp on anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fulminate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If I dont know what the market is on the item, I tend to match. <br />
<br />
If I know the market, and the other guy is considerably under, I set my usual price and figure he will sell out soon enough, leaving the future to me.  <br />
<br />
If I am consistently undercut for a long period of time, I figure the market value has changed and match the new market.<br />
<br />
If I am not being undercut, yet the stuff in my vendor bags is gathering dust (ie, it just isnt selling) I cut the price, regardless of what others may have their price set at, figuring that the market is overpriced.<br />
<br />
And I -always- check with a merchant before setting or resetting prices.  You'd be suprised how many people sell stuff for less than the NPC merchants will buy it for...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Serenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I rarely change my price if it's a longstanding one, unless it's been long enough that I think the price has changed.  If someone is significantly undercutting me, and I know I can consistently sell out at my price, I often will buy them out, leaving my price the same.   Occasionally I'll test the waters by raising my price if I'm significantly lower then the rest of what is out there as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's a matter of circumstance.  When I put something up for the first time, I'll generally match unless I'm hard up for cash or bank room.  I'll leave it that way for about a week or so, then periodically recheck prices and adjust.<br />
<br />
I never undercut by like 1gp...that's just silly IMO.  And on the other side of the coin I won't buy from someone who is undercutting by small change.<br />
<br />
I never buy to resell.  Just too lazy. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If there's a wide range of prices on something I want to sell (like Tae Ew Shields), then I usually match the second-lowest person.<br />
<br />
I'm also a big-time reseller...  I'm always on the look-out for people selling good stuff at bargin rates.  Spotted a Broken Skull Clan Crest (FT 1 Neck for healers/casters) selling for 25k after I'd bought one for 45k.  I picked up the 25k one and sold it within two days for 45k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Carmaris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just leave the price at my normal asking price.  Even with people underselling, my wares (usually Kaladim Constitutionals) sell fairly fast--@ 20pp each, I average 640 or so per week.  I also keep a supply of Grobb Liquidised Meat @ 10pp--they don't sell as well (average price is about 5 - 7pp) but that's fine by me, I mainly brew them for a friend who I don't charge.  They do sell when no one else is selling though, and usually pretty fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If only a few people are selling the item, and I know it's hard to make, I'll match prices... I know they'll sell, then it'll be my turn. And I'd rather not start the downward spiral that means tomorrow the average price for the item is a lot lower :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I generally match prices.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I undercut if I just want to get RID of something, however, as someone said above, I check the price with a merchant before I reprice something. If where I was going to sell it is less than the merchant will pay, I'll just sell to the merchant to get rid of it.<br />
<br />
However, now there's a new plan in town. I find myself holding on to things to see what the tribute master will give me for 'em. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kolotha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My prices are always the cheapest bar none (principle). If someone undercuts me I will undercut them, if they ask me if I will match their prices I will. If someone undercuts me for one copper or something ridiculous like that on a 10k item, they will no longer be able to sell that item as long as I compete with them as I find it extremely insulting.<br />
<br />
(my sig is really out of date now I have a troll, human and ogre gm smith)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Qutie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would say 97% of the time, none of the above would be my answer.  I generally keep a trader up 24/7, I know how much I want for the things I sell and I price them accordingly.  Now, if they don't sell in a week, I may lower the price, but it's generally based on My feelings about what is selling.... even with lower prices in the bazaar, I usually sell my items for what I priced them at originally. <br />
<br />
The other 3% of the time, I'd lower it because it's prolly an item I want to be rid of fast, but rarely do I take into consideration the other bazaar bots... I wouldn't ever sell something at the xpp 9g9s9c because that just irritates me to see....and, Iwouldn't Buy from someone that does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sylphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I voted for match.  I've been known to raise my prices just to give the other guy a fair shot, and lower my prices again when he's gone.  Also I often choose not to match at all... I can leave my trader up both on weekend nights and weekday mornings, and the market is different.  If I matched prices on weekends I'd be undercutting all the weekday traders (or vice versa in some markets).<br />
<br />
And, really, I don't generally want to have the lowest price anyway.  Prices fluctuate naturally in the bazaar.  I prefer to be middle-of-the-road, with a few people cheaper and a few people more expensive.  Also, for trade supplies especially, it's not all about price.  If I'm selling 300 trinkets at 100 pp each and someone else is selling 12 trinkets at 65 pp each, I'll sell out first.  Simply because traders like to buy supplies in LARGE lots, hundreds at a time instead of dozens.<br />
<br />
But people like Kolotha, who try to be cheapest on 'principle', are the enemy.  Lowering prices to compete is one thing but when you are bound and determined to have the lowest cost no matter what, without thinking at all, you are irrational.  You are a deflation engine of the worst sort, one of the drivers of mudflation.<br />
<br />
First I send them tells and try to get them to behave sanely.  Actually talking to people is always better than remaining strangers.  But eventually they undercut me after promising not to or lower their price farther than they said was their minimum.  Then I send tells to the others to try to get them interested... it's amusing when there are two Kolothas both undercutting on 'principle'.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, it's time to take them on.  We might go back and forth undercutting eachother for a few hours and then I'll put my prices back up... or remove my items from the market without selling them.  Or I'll buy up all the supplies, if it's something they're doing for skillups.  Sometimes they'll get all heated and reduce their prices to 5pp instead of undercutting me by 5 silver at a time... then I buy them out and resell the stuff at fair prices, or even resell them to a bazaar merchant.<br />
<br />
I'm just as likely to lose... sometimes I've been driven out of unprofitable markets by these folks.  But they are still the enemy and anything I can do to make their mission more difficult is a pleasure.  I can always go back later and buy one item (from them) and start undercutting them.  I may have only-one while they have 1000, but their 'principle' won't let them ignore it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Let's not start calling people &quot;the enemy,&quot; nor discussing price war techniques.  <br />
<br />
Discusing marketplace dirty-tricks, price-fixing, price-gouging, etc., only serve to inflame people.  I'm keeping this thread open for now, but if it gets at all snippy, mean, or heated, not only will I close it, I'll remove it.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dawnlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If I'm selling 300 trinkets at 100 pp each and someone else is selling 12 trinkets at 65 pp each, I'll sell out first.

<br />
I've never played into this.  In fact it disgusts me.  It's like on Fennin when I would see one person with 380 windstones for 500pp each or a bunch of people with 1-10 for 250pp each.  I run around buying the cheaper ones.  People with the mindset that &quot;just because I have more means I can charge more&quot; really annoy me.  In normal markets, buying in bulk is cheaper.  People have more so they'll cut you a deal to sell for less.  Why do bazaar people seem to think they're so different?  Yes yes I know, EQ isn't normal.. but still.  <br />
<br />
If someone is selling something in bulk why must they put their prices well above market average just to take advantage of traders they know actually NEED lots and lots (and LOTS) of something.  Sometimes people pay it because they have no choice.  I've seen traders more than once go buy out everything other people are selling, then jack their prices up just because they have so many and no one else has any.  Yes it's good for the bazaar people that don't actually enjoy the &quot;game&quot; (you know EverQUEST, actually playing the game for quests, XP, hunting, adventure, tradeskills, etc etc), but instead would rather sit in bazaar all day thinking they own because they're making so much money off of everyone.  But for those of us that play the actual game, the tradeskill community in particular, it just makes things a little more tough to enjoy.<br />
<br />
You wanna know why you sell at those prices?  Because the people with 1 million + pp in their bank that want to burn through TS's for Grimel earring or whatever buy them just so they can get to 250 fast.  The people that do tradeskills because they like them (and not because they just want the end product) are the ones that suffer.  <br />
<br />
Bleh I'll stop ranting because this comment just made me realize why I hate the bazaar so much and I could go on and on =P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This has turned out to be rather interesting.<br />
<br />
Every option listed is &quot;fair&quot;.<br />
<br />
Match their price, give both of you the same chance of selling the item.<br />
<br />
Undercut by a few silver / copper - You now have the cheapest item in the bazaar and that's one of the strives of a free market economy.<br />
<br />
Undercut significant - chop the price, fair to the buyers since what you're selling may be sold in bulk (say arrows or enchanted items).  Whiule undercitting by a few copper will only yeild a few solver savings, undercutting by say 5gold to 1 platinum can save 10-20PP per stack.<br />
<br />
Buy out &amp; raise the price - still &quot;fair&quot; - the first person sold all theirs (which was the point of having it on the trader) then you put all the ones you've bought and raise the price.  I've had this done to me several times while selling MTPs at 7.5-10PP each and everyone else is at 20-50PP.  Trader_01 buys 200-400, doubles his supply, and also ensures himself that much more of a foothold at his price leve, he must be selling them there or he wouldn't have bought them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aandaie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I sell everything below what others sell it at, even bone chips or spiderling silk.<br />
I want them to order the list by price, then come and buy mine. Its good business.<br />
<br />
I never find it worth it to buy and sell for just a few pennies under someone else. If I see an item in the bazaar for 4 plat, with another guy selling for 3 plat 9 gold, I'll buy the four plat one just out of spite. But if its 4 plat and 2 or 3 plat, I'll buy the lower.<br />
<br />
If someone bought out my stuff to sell higher, I'd love it. The only thing I want to do is sell my stuff.<br />
<br />
Its all fair, just like in real life.</div></div><hr />

You mean the days where the bazaar was in East Commons?  :D<br />

Oh, and I remember when they DIDN'T stack (I do not miss those days).  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zacatac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If we are talking about something I looted while hunting, then I'll often match the lowest price I find.<br />
<br />
However, if we are talking about tradeskill made items, then it's highly dependant on just how much or how often I can actually make the items.<br />
<br />
My BD cultural smithing for example, I have a set price.  I don't care if you want to pay less.  I don't care if you saw some guy last week with 1k lower price.  I sell at these prices or I don't sell at all.  I've been at 250 for a long time now and have no desire to make items over and over again for no other reason than to sell on the market if that market isn't going to pay what I want for my efforts.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, way back when I was making Mistletoe cutting sickles, MST's or Solstice robes for skill ups, I'd often match the lowest price in order to sell the inventory.  Knowing that I was going to be making more each week, every week, until I maxed skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>ZealSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">if I made some item, usually it's got some kind of profit margin on it, or it's going back to the vendor.  I will price about 10-25% less than others on an item I actually crafted so that my items don't just sit in bazaar for days. As for tradeskill components, then I can price them at average cost or higher, since they'll sell a lot faster.  of course, this is because I am tradeskilling for money- if others aren't I don't see why they are in bazaar in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">With most of the things I sell, I've found that they will sell.  Its just a question of when.  Sure, I can price it at 50%, and will probably get the sale pretty soon.  But I can price it at my standard &quot;full price&quot;, and it will take longer, maybe a few weeks, but it will sell.<br />
<br />
I rarely hit the 80-item limit (at least not with items of significance), and my influx of &quot;good&quot; items is relatively slow, so if I sell it tomorrow or in two weeks from now, I'll still be getting the &quot;next one to sell&quot; in probaby the same amount of time.  So I'll take the extra money from going &quot;full price&quot;, rather than undercutting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Full price&quot; varies as to what I determine it by - usually either what I consider it's &quot;worth&quot;, or the mode price in the bazaar (historic or modern, depending on the item).  If the &quot;worth&quot; is less than the mode price, I'll go with the mode price always.  So most of the time I either match or price higher.  Only exception is with something I've had for months, matching the lowest price(s), and I just want to finally get rid of - then I'll undercut by as much as I can stand (and it usually doesn't sell anyway, heh).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It depends on the item, the quantity of them that I have, the speed in which I want to be rid of the items, etc.  Most items I will not change price of if 1 person comes round with lower prices, as they will usually go away and my price will be fine and sell well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>xasia steinfiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">i match 90% of the time. i dont like adding to the allready high problem of buying tradeskill parts high and selling the end part for much less then cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Cerpicio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I usually match.<br />
<br />
I *hate* (I can't stress that enough) when people sell items for an insignificant amount less than someone else.  As someone else stated, I'll often buy the &quot;more expensive&quot; one out of spite.<br />
<br />
Another thing that annoys me is when someone makes an absurd quantity of an item, then undercuts everyone.  Fortunately  they usually only do that once, and don't return when they sell out.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I typically match whatever the low price is, unless its somethign like 8 people are selling tae ew shields for 2500-3k, and one guy has one for 1200pp. In that case, I'd buy the 1200pp one, and match the next.<br />
<br />
IF, however, someone UNDERCUTS me, I will undercut them back, until I drive their prices so low I KNOW they aren't making money, then hold mine there til they sell out. Then I return mine to normal.<br />
<br />
Funny story, also on tae ew. I had 4 longswords up for sale for 2000 each. Some guy bought them all. I checked bazaar. Same guy now had TEN for sale, at 3500. Well, I went, made 6 more, and next time he wasn't in the bazaar, I put mine up for 2500 which was prevailing price at the moment. Check back later, and this guy has his for 2400. OK, undercutting me, bam, mine go to 2k. His go to 1999. Mine go to 1500, his to 1499. I ended up getting him to price his down at 499pp, in response to my 500pp price. <br />
<br />
Then I ran over and started buying his. I got 6 of the 10, before he dropped trader. :D <br />
<br />
Yes, thats right, I SOLD him 4 swords for 8k total. Then BOUGHT those same swords, plus two more, back from him, for under 3k.<br />
<br />
This particular guy always bugged me, as I had often watched him corner the market on items (dropped ones) by buying ALL that came up for sale, and reselling at an inflated price. He had a corner on Centi LS for a long time. I guess he figured he could do the same on tae ew.<br />
<br />
Oh, btw. I put the swords (my six, plus his six) back at 2500pp, and sold out in about a week and a half. Oddly enough, I've never seen him selling tae ew swords again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">My pricing method is both simple and infuriating to some folks.  I price my goods by deciding what reasonability allows.  Blue diamonds sell on Bristlebane for 600 plat.  I sell them for 450 because I buy them off merchants for 262.5 and that's what I consider a fair markup for something I don't have to manipulate in any way.  Golden Idols of Tunare sell for 1700 when I'm not around, but for 1250 when I am, because I can make them for about 250 plat, so a 500 percent markup seems more than fair.  Same with Crucibles of Escape, which I sell for about the same markup.<br />
<br />
I have been known to undercut, but the simple fact is that I don't undercut because I want to undercut, I undercut when I think the market is out of line.  It's ludicrous to me that leather padding should sell for 30 or 40 plat each, considering a half hour of AEing in Everfrost can yield a stack of it.  I get bombed by angry tells when I put a bunch of it up for 8 plat each, but I charge that much because charging 30 or 40 would make me feel like a price gouger.  Besides, I figure that by reducing the cost for the budding smiths, I hold prices down on finished armors as well.<br />
<br />
In short, I sell at the price I'd like to pay.  To those who yell at me about ruining the market, I tell them simply that it's not about them.  A strong economy benefits everyone.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Axterix EnObelix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I'm with Xaanru, pretty much.  I'll match the going rate or else charge a fair price if I believe the going rate is nuts, most of the time.<br />
<br />
There are 2 exceptions to this.  One is if I get an item and I just want to liquidate it.  A resell, a find on a merchant whatever.  I'll charge lower just to clear it out.  The second is if someone starts to undercut me.  Then I teach people how exactly the prisoner's dilemna works.  They undercut me, I match them.  They do it again, I undercut them.  If they keep doing it, I'll undercut by greater amounts.  Typically, they get the message after a while and leave the tinkering field.  <br />
<br />
You can match and we're all good.  You can do a price you think is fair that's lower than mine, and I'll match it if I think it is worthwhile.  But trying to get all the market...not a smart idea.  The only advantage you have over any other person is the willingness to make less per item.  Best be sure they aren't more willing than you before you start.  Just like the Hungarian mob in the Usual Suspects.<br />
<br />
Done something similiar to the Tae Ew sword thing.  The guy didn't get his initial stock from me, but he did start a pricing war which me and a fellow tinkerer kept up until he lowered his prices into the gutter.  Then I bought him out and resold his wares=)</div></div><hr />

Feel free to buy out my trader and put the equipment on yours with increased prices. You can't really corner the market because anyone with a tradeskill can always make more of whatever you sell, unless you can kick me and everyone else out of every zone the components drop in.</div></div><hr />

There are some items I try to keep in stock and will set my own price and will not fluctuate regardless of what everyone else is sell the item at. <br />
Also, I have had days that I just want to empty my bags for new stock so I will cut all my prices in half to make room.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Libbie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I match prices.  As a career tinker, I do my best to maintain a certain level of pricing of items with fellow career tinkers in the Bazaar.   We're the ones putting up our gizmo and gadget stands nightly in hopes that someone will need a rebreather or a spyglass.    By matching each other, we keep our prices up and ensure a decent profit for all.  It might take a little longer, but we do sell them in the end.<br />
<br />
It cheeses me off to see people undercut by large amounts on certain items.  However, I also realize that these people are the fly-by-nighters who aren't in it for the long run.  A lot of them started tradeskilling because of the new UI.  A few of them don't have the patience to put their items out daily to sell.  And as far as geerloks go (*shakes her head miserably*), people who bought them for the tribute points are now trying to offload them.  <br />

They might price their 20 rebreathers at maybe 10pp over cost.  But you know what?  The same night that person did that, I sold my one and only rebreather at twice the price.</div></div><hr />

I'll check prices when I start trading, and several times during the day if I can.  I don't hesitate to raise my prices either if I'm the lowest seller in the bazaar.  its in my best long term interest to see that prices don't erode.<br />

I have gotten into the accasional price war.  I won't undercut, but I will match price as someone else lowers it.  I sometimes try to /tell them to keep the price up.  In general, I try to avoid price wars since these are usually with people skilling up.  They just want to recover their costs ASAP, not make any kind of profit (700pp mistletoe cutting sickles for example).  A few times, I have gone an bought some of those cheap sickles for resale.<br />
<br />
I do have minimum prices.  Given how much time some items take to make, it just isn't worth my time to sell too cheaply.  I'll also keep my prices higher if I know I won't have the componants to make more anytime soon (velium, tea leaves, blue diamonds, etc.).    <br />
