<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BartRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">One of the critical recipes for all Livestone armor is broken. Please send a /bug if ya would. You cannot cruch your chips of granite into powdered granite atm. I have talked to several GMs but the louder the squeeky wheel the faster the grease goes on it IMO.<br />
<br />
AND you would think they would do a swap for me since it is no-fail but alas the rules prevent such :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BartRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">HMMMMM, just noticed on the pottery forum someone saying this recipe was moved to a mixing bowl?!? WTF how do you crush granite in a mixing bowl hehehehe. Oh well, will log  on and see if it works (fingers crossed)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Have you perhaps tried this combine in a mixing bowl?  Many no-fail combines were moved from the mortar and pestle to the mixing bowl so that we could use the new UI for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>javalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">lol sure would of been nice if they posted this in the patch msg like i stated in the CE msg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm, sure I kept my M&amp;P to crush sandstorm Pearl's in. If I can dump my M&amp;P for good then great, will do a few more checks later :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Maddoc-the-Wayfarer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I moved quite a few recipes over from a MnP to a Mixing Bowl -- That said, I'm absolutely sure that theres a couple that I missed. <br />
<br />
Feel free to post it somewhere or give it to one of the handy-dandy Mods to PM me with a complete list, I'll get those moved over as well.<br />
