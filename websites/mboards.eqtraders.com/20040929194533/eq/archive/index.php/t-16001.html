Besides geerlok's and trophies, can people post good items for a paladin.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ChaseFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The more WIS, the better. Depending on your level, two of the easier items to come by would be a Polished Mithril Torque (+13 WIS), and a Bracelet of Sense (+15 WIS). Neither is cheap, but those are two of the biggest WIS boosts available for us melee types.<br />
<br />
The Testament of Vaneer (+10 WIS) should be fairly easily come by too, from what I've heard of the quest.<br />
<br />
I'd say check my magelo alternate Wis Kit profile, but a lot of the items are either RNG/chain class specific or not droppable outside of FV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mileron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Polished Mithril Torque is No Drop on non-FV servers.<br />
<br />
If you get higher level, the Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic is popular, for 12 int/wis in primary...<br />
The Darkwater Pearl Necklace has 7 int/wis...<br />
I replaced my big int ring with a Flesh Eater's Ring...<br />
I use Ice Forged Helm, Greaves of the Orcish Master, Wind-worn Chestplate...<br />
Oddly, a lot of my regular exp gear is tradeskill-usable, too :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taushar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can make a couple of suggestions on items you can use. First is shield of baning warding. It's a quested item but it is droppable. It provides 20 wisdom on the secondary slot. I even had LDoN +6 wisdom augmentation in there for additional wisdom just for tradeskills. Also, check out Glittering Ring of Judgement, player made ring from PoJustice dropped items. They have 20 wisdom and not lore so you can have two. Again, you can augment with two, +6 wisdom items. If you have the shield, two rings and augmentation, you can gain 78 wisdom in 3 slots. Not too bad. <br />
<br />
Another item for your neck, don't know what you have, for cheap is Velium Polished Quartz Necklace made by players from LDoN drop. It has 8 wisdom on neck slot. If you don't have a trophy, you can skill up fairly cheap on brewing and get the cork. It adds 10 wisdom in range slot. If you don't already have, you can get earring of solstice, it adds 8 wisdom on an ear slot. <br />
<br />
Of course, this assumes that you have lots of pps to buy them from others.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rerashyaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Being a bard with low, low base wisdom, I had the same dilemma myself. While people are suggesting a few items with huge amounts of wisdom, I searched around for cheap/farmable stuff for every slot.  Check your gear, and whatever doesn't already have decent wis (5+) on it, look around for things that have good wis, but terrible ac/other stats.  Shouldn't cost too much, especially if you enjoy hunting down good deals/mobs.<br />
<br />
Oh, and don't forget to trade out your wis suit when it's time to raid... You'll get ribbed in /gu for a looooong time.  :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Studded Acrylia Cloak (10wis in back slot) should be very cheap in Baz,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Being a bard with low, low base wisdom, I had the same dilemma myself. <br />
<br />
But as a 65 Bard, you should know that Bards are INT based, not WIS based, and bard gear is FAR more likely to have INT on it than WIS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree.  That's exactly what I did.  You'll likely come across something that is pretty cheap that will give you far more WIS than the item you are wearing.  Just keep searching, and you'll find more.  I did this recently with my Druid, though I was looking to raise WIS for mana purposes rather than tradeskilling.  But I found a lot of nice stuff that was cheap.<br />
<br />
If you are 45+ (or is it 46+?) remember to get a KEI.  That will cost you like 30pp or so, and will raise your WIS by 25 points.  On my server (Drinal) KEI's are almost always available in the PoK behind the big bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Romidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I was in the same boat and didn't want to spend the cash for things like Glittering Rings and a Shield of Bane Warding.<br />
<br />
Here's what I purchased just for tradeskilling (or already had as actual equipment):<br />
<br />
Darkwater Pearl Necklace (+7 Wisdom; moderately cheap or get yourself)<br />
Acrylia Studded Cloak (+10; VERY cheap)<br />
2x Velium Jasper Rings (+7 each, +14 total; cheap)<br />
Mithril Bracers if you don't have BD cultural.<br />
Adamantite Epaulets (+7; cheap)<br />
Ivandyr's Hoop (+6; cheap)<br />
Velium Ruby Veil (+8; cheap)<br />
Golden Efreeti Boots (+9; moderately cheap)<br />
Othmir Fur Cap (+6; VERY cheap)<br />
Mace of the Fallen Crusader (+8; VERY cheap)<br />
Darkwood Bow of Suffering (+7; cheap)<br />
Charred Guardian Shield (+9; cheap)<br />
Buckled Shale Belt (+8) or Belt of the Cenobyte (+7 but much cheaper)<br />
Runed Mithril Bracer (+5; cheap)<br />
<br />
Odds are you already have some wisdom equipment (paladin BD cultural is a good source), but the ones above will boost you up without breaking the bank completely.<br />
<br />
I was able to boost my wisdom to 301 and wasn't willing to spend a huge amount to get my wisdom higher (if I were working on, oh, tailoring I might ;)).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Taushar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was in the same boat and didn't want to spend the cash for things like Glittering Rings and a Shield of Bane Warding.<br />
<br />
Well, technically, you don't have to spend money on either items. Shield of Bane Warding can be had for a quest and nothing I remember cost money for the quest. You just have to spend time and help from a few friends. I admit that it is a long quest but it's very rewarding. <br />
<br />
As for the Glittering Ring, I made both of them myself after farming the items I needed from PoJustice. Again, I don't remember requiring anything I have to buy for the components other than what is dropped. If your JC skill isn't high enough, you can ask a friend who is or you may have to pay someone to combine for you. <br />
<br />
Again, the tradeskill is about tradeoffs, farming versus spending pps. In this case, I chose to farm rather than spending pps.<br />
