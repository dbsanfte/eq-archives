Shame the way EQ handles rangers - I would have liked a little poison making in my skills - I see my character as a cross between the rogue and druid instead of the warrior and druid.<br />
<br />
I feel they should add an AA point where you can pick any skill you don't have in your class and for every AA point you apply you can train five points in the skill - with limits.<br />
<br />
Skills I want - Pick Lock, Safe Fall, Apply Poison, Make Poison, and Pick Pocket. Then I would be a cross between a rogue and ranger</div></div><hr />

Are you sure it was a left page? I have tested this combine myself and it did work a while ago. The right page does DNC, though. I really hope you just mistyped because otherwise all the combines would need to be tested again  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tobin Itharel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well now I'm not sure if it was left or right - I sold the page to a merchant. If it was right then I made a mistake.</div></div><hr />
