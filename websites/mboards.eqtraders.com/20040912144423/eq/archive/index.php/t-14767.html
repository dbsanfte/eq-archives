<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zatx_Woopyoax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys!<br />
<br />
Well I have started the wonderful Shawl quest and I have now mastered Pottery, Fletching, Baking, Brewing, and Tailoring.  This was all due to the wonderful guides on EQTraders.  But when it comes to Jewelcraft I am somewhat confused.<br />
<br />
I see posts on these boards about taking Jewelcraft from 0 to 200 in one day.  How is this done?  Is there a guide out there somewhere?  If there is, I havent been able to find it.<br />
<br />
Your help is very much appreciated.<br />
<br />
I'm a 65 Wood Elf Druid with max stats.  Also, money is not an issue.  If it takes me 20k, so be it.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You should visit Gumkak's (http://www.valendor.org/gumkak/jewelcraft.asp) and read the F.A.Q. (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=38). <br />
<br />
Those two sources should tell you everything you need to know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zatx_Woopyoax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank you for those links. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>tdunlap104</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In order to go to 200 in one day, you'll need at least 200K to do it. LOL good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tower</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You dont need 200k to get JC to 200, i did get JC to 250 in 2 days and it cost me around 15k, and i only used vendor used items and nothing enchanted.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rezilaturb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm,  with new interface if you use it right, you can get from 0 to 200 JC in about 2-3 hours.  I lost around 5k while I did this last weekend. For guidelines about what to combine I used the thread where a fellow JCer posted his failure rates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">200K?  No way.<br />
<br />
If you are careful (click slowly, use geerlok, etc.), 3K can get you to 200 in a few hours.  But you'll need about 8-10k operating capital near the end.<br />
<br />
I made this spreadsheet when I was on my first toon.  Its optimized for cost.  I'm still using it for JC skill ups on every toon.<br />

 <br />
From skill level of 19 to 170 in 4.5 hrs and a total of 2.3k.<br />
<br />
Had my alt Enchanter buy the materials and sell back all successful combines in her home town.<br />
Had to be done in order to do the next stage of my shawl quest. Do I ever want to see another jewerly bag again ?<br />
NO Thank you !</div></div><hr />
