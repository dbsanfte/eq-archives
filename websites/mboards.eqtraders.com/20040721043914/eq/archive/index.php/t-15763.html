<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dazmilar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since the new UI allows us to see our modified skill while a container is open, it gave me the chance to test an old suspicion of mine.<br />
<br />
Turns out that Grandmaster Trophy modifiers do not work from the Ammo slot.<br />
<br />
I'm 250 + trophy in Brewing, Baking and Jewelcraft, and whenever I equipped any trophy in primary, secondary or range, they'd push it up to 252; but when wearing 'em in ammo, I showed only 250 skill. This held true as well when I opened my tackle box with a Yappin Doggy Circle Fly (+4% fishing) in ammo.<br />
<br />
So caveat faber -- let the crafter beware.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aethn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Modifiers, stats or any other item has never worked from Ammo slot since day one of this game.  It has only worked from Ranged.  This is not a change or a bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What does that do to fishing bait that has modifyiers on them?  They are equipped in the ammo slot only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aethn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have always said that bait stats never worked, so this just proves my point.  Ammo slot has never worked for anything more then a bag slot in the 5+ years I have played Everquest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nanndas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just for added info. Don't put an augment on the GM Trophy. I added a +3 wis augment from mmc and now I can't put the tropy in the ammo slot. When fighting I used to store it in the ammo slot and have my idol in the range slot. With it augmented I have to bag it now......  :irked: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>banazir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What made you think it would still go in the ammo slot Nan?<br />
<br />
I mean, none of the augments had ammo on them, it is clearly not going to go in ammo slow augmented, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just for added info. Don't put an augment on the GM Trophy.

Your augment probably had slot restrictions, many of them do.  If you have an all slot augment, there will not be any restrictions on where you place your trophy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cantatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, none of the augments I saw actually fit in ammo.  That means if you augment something that does go in ammo, you no longer would be able to wear it though.  I was hoping there would be an augment with an effect on it since effects work from ammo (eg mage summon stones), but no luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aeryl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As established in this thread and previously, you don't get stats out of the ammo slot in the first place so why would it matter if you augmented a GM trophy or not?  You'd have to put it in primary, secondary or range to actually *use* it, so aug it to your heart's delight.  I put a +10 WIS aug on my GM smith's hammer because I'm a melee.  I use the trophy any time I'm buying or selling and in range any time I'm doing a tradeskill that requires WIS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I believe (worn) effects work in Ammo.  This might be why people thought skill modifiers might work in Ammo.<br />
<br />
I wonder if any items where nerfed by the transition of (worn) effects to stats?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gnormy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No effects work in the ammo slot.</div></div><hr />

I thought the mage summoned Coldstone gave UV in Ammo slot?<br />
Summoned: Coldstone<br />
MAGIC ITEM NO RENT<br />
Slot: NECK PRIMARY SECONDARY AMMO<br />
AC: 5<br />
Effect: Ultravision (Worn)<br />
WT: 0.1 Size: TINY<br />
Class: ALL<br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
The stats didn't work, but for some reason I thought the UV did.  I am quite possibly wrong.  (L 29 mage spell, one could check quickly)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The UV from the Coldstone works in the ammo slot.  I've used it myself a few times.  The AC does not work from the ammo slot, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>NVekRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Back to the subject of fishing bait for a moment.  <br />
<br />
This actually just came up for me the other day as I was making my first blessed fishing poles and thought I'd grab a 5% rock crab from Gunthak to help me out.  Of course, we all know that stats don't work from the ammo slot... However, fishing bait ONLY goes in the ammo slot far as I can tell.  (I took off my primary, secondary, range, and ammo items and tried it out with various baits just to be sure).   <br />
<br />
Soooo.. why the heck are there 4700 different kinds of bait with various fishing mods on them?  Am I missing some secret way to make them work, or is this just some sort of developer oversight? Will the bait work from your bags, like stat foods?  (Did not seem to that I could tell.)  <br />
<br />
Just seems odd to have all these different baits with varying amounts of modification, including player-made ones, and basically, in actual practice they are no different from the regular old plain bait?..  I'm a little fuzzy on the timing, but I'm pretty sure modded baits have been around a while, like at least 2 or 3 expansions, and they keep adding more (i.e. bookworms in PoK)...  So, does anyone have more info. about whether or not they actually work ?  And, if not, have the devs ever commented about this?<br />
<br />
Thanks - Oonagh</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you ever fished or spent time with a fisherman?<br />
<br />
It is a running joke that fishermen obsess over which bait to use, thinking that one is better than another for a particular situation, while you can't tell the difference in actual performance while fishing.<br />
<br />
Doesn't mean it is true, but it is an old joke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Trepan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Bait works like stat food... except, since it raises skill, you don't see it's effects in your skill list.<br />
<br />
So, the topmost bait in your inventory (even in ammo) modfies your fishing skill, and lessens the chance of your spilling your beer (who cares about actually catching fish?  SAVE THE BEER!)   :cheers:  :fishin:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Buuuuut....<br />
<br />
...modified bait is pointless for those of us with a modified fishing pole... ie. anyone with a fisherman's companion. Because skill mods don't stack. <br />
<br />
(I haven't checked that bait gives you extra % in an inventory slot... that's a new one to me)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Liandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Maybe so, but the Fisherman's Companion has a 3% mod and there is bait out there (crab from Gunthak for example) with a 5% mod on it.  Normally the higher would take effect.  However in this case the bait mod doesnt seem to work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Heartsong_Steelsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It is a running joke that fishermen obsess over which bait to use, thinking that one is better than another for a particular situation, while you can't tell the difference in actual performance while fishing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Trust me, as an angler who has seen one person catching with a gold and orange hottentot and one person not catching with a rock bass colored one and that change when the one switched to a gold and orange one... bait definitely matters while fishing in the real world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I never put bait in my ammo slot... All the bait I have I just use out of inventory. Never had a tacklebox on me though so I don't know if I'm really getting a mod difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tanker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">So Absor went aggro about this around the office, so I talked to the guys who had it removed in the first place.  Turns out they had to remove all spell effects (worn) from Ammo items for [unimportant story].<br />
<br />
I asked for and got the ok to make %-skill mods wor for Ammo slot items.  The code is done.  It'll go up..... sometime (I don't control that, sorry).<br />
<br />
Go Absor, champion of the Fishing mod bait.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Aethia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Maybe I'm missing something (or maybe it's because I'm now a necro) but I aug'd my trophy with +10 charisma (iirc).  Why? because as I necro I often have lower charisma.  <br />
<br />
At first I thought my trophy was broken until I was reminded stats in ammo slot don't work.  But what I don't get is why this seems to be a big issue for so many people given drogmars/horses, which go in the ammo slot.<br />
<br />
Now, I understand not everyone can afford a horse (my monk never could).  Maybe those who have horses/drogmars don't tradeskill.  But on Stromm there are usually so many horses/drogmars in the bank you can't move. <br />
<br />
So my ammo slot holds my drum and I swap out my trophy when I need to use it for tradeskilling.  <br />
<br />
Just looking for the 'other side of the fence' view so I can understand this issue better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Turns out they had to remove all spell effects (worn) from Ammo items for [unimportant story].<br />
Um, Tanker, the spell effect (Ultravision) on a Summoned: Coldstone (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=10323) works from the ammo slot, on live servers.  The AC does not.  This sounds like the reverse of what you're describing, unless I'm missing something.  Or was a special exception made for Coldstones?<br />
<br />
On a related note, does this change now mean that tradeskill trophies will give their tradeskill mod when placed in the ammo slot too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tanker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Sorry, yes I meant to say all spell effects EXCEPT Ultra- and Infra- vision effects (which was a special case added when people complained).<br />
<br />
And yes, Percentage skill mods will now work in the Ammo slot.   Well, they will whenever we patch the code I checked in today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Hum, most interesting indeed.  Yes, I can imagine people getting a bit upset over that. =)  Thankee for the reply.<br />
<br />
I'd assume then that stats (like AC or stamina) not working from ammo slot items is also by design?  You didn't mention that, but it sounds like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kendricke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I'd assume then that stats (like AC or stamina) not working from ammo slot items is also by design?  You didn't mention that, but it sounds like it.<br />
<br />
I'm curious about this as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Wow, that is quite a quick response.  I assume other +skill mods will work as well in the ammo slot, not just fishing bait.? (i.e. trophies?)<br />
<br />
As to the Necro who doesn't like to hold his trophy in the ammo slot, this is a matter of preference.  I put my drogmar either in a bag and take it out when I summon it, or I keep it in a empty bag slot (which, thanks to cleaning out my bank, and finishing off skills, I now can regularly have 3!!)  I do this as a matter of pride, I take no joy in having people inspect me and see that I have a mount, but I do have  a sense of pride in my alchemy trophy that I keep there to proudly say I am a shaman, an alchemist, and hopefully the newbs that inspect me will stop asking me to Virtue them when they see it! (hasn't worked yet, but /shurg, I even stopped going /role because I'd rather be asked for 7th all day long than Virtue once a day.)<br />
<br />
Back on subject, thanks Tanker =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Thorvari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Will the +25 ATK effect on the Shuriken of Eternity (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=14733) work if it is put in Ammo? or just Tradeskill % effects?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>AbsorEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Yes, +stats (like AC, ATK and all that) don't work in that slot by design.<br />
<br />
Yes, any +skill item should work in that slot once things are pushed live.<br />

Basically, anything that stacks isn't going to work in that slot.<br />

All I can say it, don't go throwing your trophies at your enemies.  If you do, don't blame us.<br />

I just caught this; for some reason I'd missed it before.<br />
<br />
The first two statements appear contradictory.  +% bait stacks, and it goes in the ammo slot.  The first statement says it will work (and this is supported by the rest of the thread), but the second statement says it won't.   :confused: <br />
<br />
And please tell me that third line there is a joke.  It would be a sad, sad day if people started losing their trophies just because they hit Ranged Attack without checking their ammo slot.</div></div><hr />

+% skills dont stack.  Only the highest takes effect.  As opposed to +Wis (for example) which stacks adding to your total and so will not work from the ammo slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Jarak_akn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Just agreeing with the above logic.<br />
<br />
I think that Abs is talking about the bonus stacking not the item.<br />
<br />
So Bounses that don't stack will work (even on items that do stack)<br />
Bonuses that do stack wont work (even on items that dont)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I think that Abs is talking about the bonus stacking not the item.<br />
Doh!  I misread that completely.  I thought he meant stacks as in &quot;leather padding stacks&quot;, not as in &quot;attack bonuses stack&quot;.<br />
<br />
OK, now it makes sense. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Yay patch today made mods work from ammo slot!  Woo woo 4 trophies~~</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Just tested it yesterday with trophies.  When you equip a trophy in your ammo slot, your tradeskill value goes up (as reported in the new interface), but your normal stats (WIS/INT, CHA, etc.) don't change.</div></div><hr />

Thanks a bundle, Absor and Tanker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Well, the patch message did say it was the skill mod that would work from ammo, not that we'd get the AC or stats from them as well, but the skill mod working means we can equip 4 for those cross skill combines and that if we put bait with a skill mod in the ammo slot, we'll get that boost on our fishing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I checked this after patch and all is as Tanker said.  Skill % mods now work in ammo slot but stats remain unaffected.  Thanks Tank!  This is a great step forward and a very cool move on you guys' part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Ixiola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Okay, I'm confused. How are you guys equipping this in the ammo slot?  Both my better half and I tried it on a lark because of the patch, and neither the tinkerers spanner nor the jewelcraft one will equip there.  Also, the trophies do not say ammo, which is not suprising since they weren't intended to work there originally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Huh? Stealth nerf? Click this magelo http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=715906 and check out the ammo slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Ulaxmi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Ixiola, I'm guessing that you've put an augment on your trophies. Since no augments are ammo slot equippable, the augmented trophy loses it's ammo slot tag.</div></div><hr />
