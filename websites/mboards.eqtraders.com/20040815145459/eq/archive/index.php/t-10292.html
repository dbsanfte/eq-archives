<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wilsonqc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is this item Vendor-sold - if so where (zone, loc and name please!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">King's Thorn is sold by a single Vendor, in Steamfont Mountains... a Gnome... Who's name escapes me... but he is a lone, and somewhere near the windmills. Sorry I don't have the location.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it's a She. Ennixy Frennor, 825 x -1380.  Allakhazam's says she's on TheDead faction, and some other QueenBigBadLady faction, IE something a Tunare woodelf druid has probably already trashed. She wasn't kos to my high elf no-faction-work mule runner, but she wouldn't sell, either. <br />
<br />
<br />
I think you have to get a necro-type person to do your buying for you; anyone who has decent TheDead faction should be able to get this. <br />
<br />
<br />
I can't figure out why.... there's one thing to program class interdepedancy, and there's another thing to program faction dependancy... odd. <br />
<br />
but anyway, hope it helps . <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My Tunare Woshiping Wood Elf Druid was dubious, and no selling to me! LOL<br />
<br />
My Sol Ro Worshiping Erudite wizard could buy from her though... WTH?:eek: :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqNichola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sol Ro worshipping is quite naughty :)<br />
<br />
Presumably Sneak-capable characters have no problem getting behind this vendor and using the secret handshake?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ounce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Do you think the Alliance chanter spell would take care of her reluctancy to sell?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xenephex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I took an erudite enchanter and cast illusion gnome and had no problem buying from her.   This is a level 25 testbuff chanter on Test server so I know that this toon has never done any faction work of any sort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ironic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes, chanter faction-enhancing spells like Alliance work on her.  Fortunately, if you're buying the King's Thorn to make Bayle's Delight for Qeynos Afternoon Tea, you don't have to buy a lot because of the yield on both the Bayle's Delight (12 per combine, iirc) and the tea itself (6 per combine).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SSGRanger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'll probably end up kicking myself in the ass for this, since its going to mess up the re-sale market:<br />
<br />
The thorns are also available in one of the Inns in East Commonlands...no sneaking required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>merkell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Umm I live in EC and never saw Kings Thorn for sale there.<br />
Can you be more specific please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Diania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">only reason it would be on more than one merchant would be if someone sold it to them, IIRC the only merchant who has a normal stock of kings thorn is the one in steamfont who has faction issues with my tunare wood elf druid.  Although, when PoK came out, one of the poison merchants there had it as normal stock for about 2 weeks until it was yanked out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SSGRanger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It did suprise me to see it for sale there, the fellow had a stack+, since I bought a stack from him to see if it was only 1 or 2 available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Beriberi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think king's thorn is also sold in Plane of Knowledge in the tradeskill merchant area at the back of the zone, on the dark elf poison merchants. I'll check next time I'm in game.<br />
<br />
B</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I found King's Thorn regularly on a DE poison merchant right after POP was released, but only for a week or 2. Since then i keep going back, hopeful, but he never has it anymore. i think some gnome was bein funny by picking it up in steamfont and selling to POK merchant to thwart me. darn gnomes and their sense of humor!</div></div><hr />
