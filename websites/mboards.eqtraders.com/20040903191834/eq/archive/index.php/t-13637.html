<br />
I got bored of grinding out AA's early last week, and decided to do some tradeskilling. My baking at the time was 199 and I decided I was going to try doing some MTP's, and wow, it worked out great!<br />
<br />
I had a set up in my bank, with most of it being 10 slot toolboxes for space....<br />
<br />
I'd prepare sub combines, so that I could do 300 MTP combines at a single time. THus requiring 1.5 toolboxes for 300 of each component, except for The Cake, which required 3 total tool boxes.<br />
<br />
I found that it cost about 500 PP for these 300 combines...and the wooven mandrake for me was the worst part, since My tailoring is so low.<br />
<br />
So over the week I'd do 2-3 batches of 300 a day, and in a week or so, I went quickly to 250. With only 230 Wis(I'm a Ranger).<br />
<br />
Got myself a ton of MTP's, sold them all for 10PP each and made roughly 30K just skilling up!<br />
<br />
I love Baking!<br />

DING 250 Baking on Povar!<br />

I'd prepare sub combines, so that I could do 300 MTP combines at a single time. THus requiring 1.5 toolboxes for 300 of each component, except for The Cake, which required 3 total tool boxes. First, congratulations. Having just dinged myself I know the work involved. Second, an observation...<br />
<br />
I found myself doing much the same thing as you with the toolboxes, however, I think there's a way to reduce the space.<br />
<br />
Cut the cake last. Leave one toolbox on your toon with enough spaces for the cakes you'll need and two extra slots for cake slices. This *vastly* reduces the amount of space you'll need.<br />
<br />
Edit. Typos, i hAte typos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Uinan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">*Smacks my forehead*<br />
<br />
<br />
Oy, that would of saved a ton of space....<br />
<br />
But oh well...I don't plan on doing any more batches of 300 combines of MTP's. LOL maybe just 100 here or there for cash. hehe.<br />
<br />
Now to wait until the UI to GM Brewing in a couple hours. LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Grats.  Just what I need.  Another baker to cut into my profits:rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Just kidding.  It is hard work.  I generally do 200 combines at a time, and only slice the cake when needed per 20 combines.  Saves space.<br />
<br />
Now all you need is your Spoooooon!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Congrats!<br />
<br />
Just made 250 a couple weeks ago on my druid!<br />
<br />
I do it in 200 combine incriments myself, Can hold up to 180 combines on me at once, or all 200 if I don't slice the cake till last. :) Works out pretty well!<br />
<br />
Now get that spoon!<br />
<br />
/cheer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nice work...<br />
<br />
Of course, I personally got to 250 without ever making a single MTP. ;)<br />
<br />
PoP Baking is your friend, especially if you've got friends who save baking drops for you.</div></div><hr />
