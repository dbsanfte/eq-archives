<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">On the main site there are some guides for the various tradeskills.  I can't access the main site from here, so I can't help much more than that.<br />
<br />
Basically though, look through the recipes sorted by trivial, and check the prices of components, find the cheapest one that is not trivial, and have at it with that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From Ugzugs Guide to Alchemy:<br />
Skill Progression<br />
When developing my skill, I soon realized that if you did not have a plan for how you were going to achieve your maximum<br />
200-skill level in Alchemy, one of two things would happen:<br />
1) You would quit, disgusted with your failure rates and losing customers due to the fact that you can’t make potions at<br />
a marketable price, or<br />
2) You would be too poor to continue<br />
So, to address my own concerns in these matters I focused on how to achieve the best rate of skill increases without breaking<br />
the bank. (Well, without breaking the bank any harder than you have to.)<br />
This chart is my recommendation for a skill progression path. It is not necessarily the best path if money is of no concern for<br />
you. I have attempted to balance out the cost of a potion’s reagents with the likelihood of success at that particular skill level.<br />
Also, I have left out options available again from the old alchemy recipes. I did so due to the difficulty or time it takes to<br />
acquire some of the reagents. Feel free to tune it to your own situation – but I guarantee that this path will take you to the<br />
maximum skill level of 200. Also, ensure you look at the next section that discusses another type of skill progression<br />
path that may be the absolute cheapest path.<br />
<br />
<br />

181-191  / Hawk’s Eye Tonic (increase Archery skill by 10) – probably trash, or sold very cheap to try to recoup<br />
some cost<br />
192-200 / Elixir of Divine Endurance (+10 to all saves) – Great all-around raiding potion<br />
Mystical Infusion (+50 mana) – probably trash, or sold very cheap to try to recoup some cost<br />
<br />
<br />
Alternate Titan Potion Progression Path<br />
<br />
Due to the increased costs of the reagents to create potions, many alchemists will start making Titan potions once they<br />
trivialize Purity potions (skill level 103). Although Titan potions are not trivial till 180 and the failure rate will be extremely<br />
high at such a low skill level, the cost of each attempt is much lower. Skill increases will still occur despite the failures. The<br />
drawback to this method is that you will have fewer potions to sell for your efforts. However, there is a horribly small<br />
market for the non-trivial potions from skill level 104 through 150.<br />
Essentially, the path is once a shaman achieves skill 104, making Titan potions may be the cheapest and simplest path to 180.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Some of the potions listed as sellable have an extremely small market at best.  The ones I move regularly are Gate (to bind) potions, Quintessence of Knowledge, and Kilva's Skin of Flame.  SoW sells, but, it generally not worth it, as it sells too close to cost to make.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know what server you're on Graeme, but I've found that to not be the case on EC'i.  Sow potions are sold in  bazaar for around 80 pp for a 10 dose.  They cost less than 55 pp to make (at least at my skill level).  That's a 25 pp profit, which might not seem like much, but the cost vs profit equaltion as compared to other potions (such as Gate which costs 230 pp to make &amp; sells for as low as 275 pp on a bad day) is much better.<br />
<br />
Especially when you consider that you can make 20-50 potions in one sitting for a profit of 625-1250 pp in bazaar in under a few hours.<br />
<br />
To test this, I decided to sell only sow potions for a period of 3 days.  While I was able, I kept my screen up so I would know when I sold out, then made more sow potions to sell...at the end of each night I made about 30 potions and turned off my monitor and went to bed.<br />
<br />
In that 3 days I made 12775 pp in sales, and I only started with 3000 pp.  That's not too shabby.<br />
<br />
On second thought, ignore this if you're on EC'i.  I don't need any more competitors driving my prices down lol.<br />
