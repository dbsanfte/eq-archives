<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>imjonah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got a ton of money and would like to skill up my Alt Tinkerer.<br />
<br />
  I do not mind buying dropped items off of merchants or traders there just are not enough for sale, it seems.<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
  What is the fastest expensive way to get from 130 or so to over 200.   (a. for 40k total net investment or b. for 100k net investment)<br />
<br />
    Since I do have 130 Smith, Footwarming Boots  seems like an option.<br />
<br />
 or have you had luck just going from Merchant to merchant and getting enough ingrediants to do the number of geerlocks you need to level up, Geerlocks.  Are there anny Merchants outside of Shadowhaven who are known to have a ton of dropped items for geerlocks?<br />
<br />
       Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Laearya Lifeblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not overly possible for as high as you'd like to get, sorry.  Rebreathers are about the highest store bought item you can get, and not exactly the most cost efficient.  Go farm some blocks in Neth Lair for geerloks would be my suggestion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ceno65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just did this last week.  You should buy up all the small pieces of acrylia in the bazaar, make the smithing gearloc till 215.  Its easy and fast.<br />
<br />
After that your looking at footwarming boots, farming gunthak harbor, or poi drops.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Noni DeeCups</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Haha, same thing I was wondering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I suspect it just means he has an alt with it, but I suppose you could blow a LOT of cash on this, right?  Every combine has a small chance of success, and every race can tinker, just at zero skill (except for gnomes) with no hopes of improvement.  If it really is a 5% chance no matter what, if you have 20 artisan seals (and metal bits and sharpening stones) to blow, you could just cut loose and hope you perform up to the expected value of 1.<br />
<br />
Also I think if you shop in Gunthak bank you can often get geerlok quill drops in bulk, perhaps other items as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Watch merchants - I found 3 bags of belts of leathery fungus whatever-they're-called as well as numerous sensate lens thingies...<br />
<br />
Springs and such, well, get used to just *loving* PoI. =P<br />
<br />
My biggest run of skill ups came, however, from elemental bow cams (as Tart was started to help my guild out with bow cams, her first run garnered 10 skill ups and a success rate of about 75%).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>lupobolt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Cheap and easy from 238 if i recall on is Molten Bow Cams .<br />
<br />
 Thier cheap tons of em on the market , only draw back is if u dont have a forage class handy for grease from PoI .<br />
<br />
I had my kids and me forage em for a week , got 1000 greases and 500 molten ores walla did the combines in 1 day 232 to 250 Tinker all done.<br />
 <br />
 Its a time sink but cam cheap if u have a forager and it beats all those other nastie Tinker Hunt , forage , bazaar buy combines by far !!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kaneau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Maybe I am confused or my definition of cheap is greatly different than yours.. or the folks are Torv are just greedy... However unless you have access to the Plane of Fire you have to purchase Bricks of Molten Ore off players or the occassional merchant if you are lucky enough to find it. Currently players are selling these for 250pp each and the going rate with NPC's is about 85pp but chances are slim to none that you will ever see one on an NPC.  <br />
<br />
Coiled Springs - 500pp<br />
Mana Battery - Class 6 - 250pp<br />
Haze Panther Eye - never seen one in the bazzar<br />
Knuckle Joint - 600pp<br />
Clockwork Carapace - 1000pp<br />
<br />
<br />
Come visit anytime in PoI and bring beer!... I typically get 3 coiled springs for 8 hours of farming! ugh!<br />

Stuck in hell at 236!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I would like to know why Silicorrosive Grease is so expensive on my server -- rarely under 400 plats.  As far as I know, it is only used in making the Ceramic Hammer Of Innovation.  I wouldn't think there would be much demand for an Enhancement Haste IV item.<br />
<br />
BTW, my best buy in a long time... two Haze Panther Eyes for 50 plats each!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ilona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sillicorrosive grease can also be given to the gnome in the windmill for xp.<br />
The main reason it is expensive, though, is probably because it is used in the quest for the Greater Cloak of Pernicity.</div></div><hr />

ooh, you lucky dog! :D Yes, I paused nearly two whole seconds wondering if I should attempt to contact the trader to tell them that their price was too low.  :D</div></div><hr />

As someone who's played the game casually, but enthusiastically for 3 years and hasn't ever seen more than 3000 pp in the bank, this sort of cavalier attitude toward 50,000 pp makes me want to pull my hair out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try powering Smithing or Tailoring to 200 or 250 through sheer power of plat, instead of farming, and you'll see that JUST 50k is , in fact, an absurdly low number.<br />
