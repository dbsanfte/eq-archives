<br />
I just started to farm some trade supplies in the Wakening lands and was wondering if any experienced tailors could give me any hints for finding those **** Yew leaves ;-) My druid has managed to forage a few but arn`t they a ground spawn too ?<br />
<br />
Any advice on Haze panthers while we are in the WLs too ;-)</div></div><hr />

Silly me didnt make a local copy. Anyone out there has it ?<br />
<br />
I did write down the loc where i found a leaf last time. Maybe we could consolidate this info here:<br />
<br />
My leaf was at:<br />
<br />
p1061, n2345<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">freyya</div><div class="date">12-31-2002, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best tip I ever read here was to equip a fire beetle eye as a light source when looking for ground spawns.  It makes the yew leaves give off a greenish glow and they are much easier to see.  Also, the same poster (Wyrdlan I think? sp?), suggested dropping a yew leaf on the ground that you already have and 'practice' finding it.  I found both tips very helpful.<br />

Good luck!<br />
