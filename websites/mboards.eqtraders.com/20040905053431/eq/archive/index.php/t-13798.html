<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sharrah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well the casino is back.<br />
Batwings don't work.. a friend tried it..<br />
<br />
But is the return of this 'zone lagging, plat stealing beast' really anything to be fussed over?<br />
<br />
One friend spent 3k in chips to get 4 x 5 int food, and an inventory clickable item, with 5 charges of 650 hp grp heals.<br />
<br />
One other bought 3 tokens, got a golden ticket, and handed it in for a helm simular to a Raldukans (wasn't named that tho)<br />
<br />
My luck extended to 1,..  5 wis no drop bread. For 300p.<br />
<br />
Whatcha think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dropped 10k in the casino because I don't have any buyable upgrades left really.<br />
<br />
Was fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've had reasonable luck with it.  Dropped 10K over the couple of hours I played.  Won a Beer Goggles (not as a golden ticket; I just won it), a few stacks of stat food, some fireworks, four illusion potions, and one each mana and HP potions.  <br />
<br />
The mana potion could be very valuable indeed, depending on how much mana it gives back.  The HP potion restores 100hp ... for a level 65 tank.  Joy.  The Illusion potions could be good for shock value, if nothing else.  The stat food ... well, let's just say I don't need to worry about patty melts and fish rolls for a while.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From what I've seen so far, I'd probably go put a Golden Ticket on my trader if I won one, instead of actually using it.<br />
<br />
Last night, I blew 4k in the casino. Even winning about 30 tokens, all I ended up with were 24 Wheat Breads, 4 Sweet Breads, a Crushed Topaz, 2 Gnomish Fireworks (both the same type), 2 Essences (High Elf &amp; Wood Elf), and Beer Goggles. <br />
<br />
After blowing that money and going to make some HMPs to sell, I've only got about 477pp left, and I'm not going to blow that in the casino.<br />
<br />
I already have a Fisherman's Companion, so the Beer Goggles do me no good. (Why do Beer Goggles summon ale, instead of short beer?)<br />
<br />
One person in my guild blew 3k, and all he got was a few stat foods, and another one blew 500pp and got an Essence of Human and a Grilled Kabob.<br />
<br />
There was another player there who won a couple of good items, but he spent about 30k.</div></div><hr />

I got a pair of gloves with +15% apply poison  from the casino dealer that claimed he had stuff best suited for clerics, druids, and shaman.

The one thing I really want in EQ is a Guise.<br />
<br />
Spend 400K last night. Not only did I not get a single Gold Ticket, I didn't get anything worth keeping at all. Nothing fun. Nothing useful.<br />
<br />
That's just broken.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't care that there are people who got a Guise in 12K. The Casino just shows how broken the RNG is. (I know, over 1 million iterations of it, it was random. I'd like to see the tests they used to show randomness. &quot;1111122222333334444455555&quot;, it's random! Every number came up 5 times!)<br />

<br />
Heh.  I do wonder what they use as the output from the RNG.  Most RNGs I've seen have output in a fixed range, which is then squished into the desired range (usually along the lines of ( ( (randNum - minRand) / (maxRand-minRand) ) * (maxDesired-minDesired) + minDesired)).  Thus creating the potential for output that looks really, really random to look extremely streaky when the range of possible outputs is small.<br />

Not exactly an optimal output run for a RNG, but it still &quot;looks decently random&quot; and its something that would produce the sequence you mentioned.<br />
<br />
Had one run reciently, where in 10000 trials I never got above the lower 30% of the possible range, lol.  That was an annoying sample :p<br />
<br />
But ya, if I ever do the casino, all I want is a Guise, really.  Mostly because its a fun toy, and partly because then Neriak would like me a little more ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Somebody doesn't appear to understand random numbers.<br />
<br />
Or casinos, for that matter. ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
And, yes, the casino is gone again after it broke the world servers again. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aandaie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you spend $300,000 on powerball tickets, you are still going to be crying when the guy who spent $1 wins the lottery.<br />
<br />
This is the same thing. The odds of getting the guise are probably insane EACH TIME you play, so spending a total of 400,000 means you are not ONE BIT more likely to win the guise.<br />
<br />
Its a casino, for very rare items. Its not a way to BUY the guise. If they intended the plat sink to be BUYING THE GUISE, they'd simply have a vendor selling it for 200 k plat and some people would pay it.<br />
<br />
This is like saying the RNG is broke because some goofus camped the AC for 25 hours without an AC, while I was there for 2 spawns and got an AC. I had the same chance to get the AC EACH spawn as he does, I just got the very rare roll. That is exactly why I never camp anything like the AC for more than an hour or so, you are no more likely to get jboots by staying longer.<br />
<br />
So take a few rolls, then hit the road. Later try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">currently accepting gifts of plat from people who can blow 300k on casino and just be annoyed.  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Itek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">sigh...<br />
<br />
so many RNG-is-broken / casino-sucks threads...<br />
<br />
The last one cost me a very cool .sig<br />
<br />
A string 1111122222333334444455555 of outcomes with a random(5) run 25 times is a valid outcome. In fact in a true random universe it's no more or less likely than 1234512345123451234512345<br />
<br />
or 1325422315415344312551432 for that matter.<br />
<br />
Listen, and understand... (movie quote, points to the person who recognizes it first)<br />
<br />
Random Number Generation is a MATURE TECHNOLOGY. There are some small improvements here and there, and that's well and good. But basicly even the most TRIVIAL pRNG (pseudo-Random Number Generator, the real name for a computer driven random) is much better than can be detected by human beings.<br />
<br />
Please... unless you've written a new and innovative piece of code for random number generation... accept that SOE uses a decent RNG and has no POSSIBLE reason for NOT using the best one it can implement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">several hundred mino's last night.  2 skill ups in a row, then another string of nothing and then a pair of skillups again.  it probably means nothing but it sure looks freaky.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for casino's, the ones in game seem to be the same as the ones in RL.  House always comes out on top (if they didn't there wouldn't be any!).<br />
<br />
I steer clear of them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Noni DeeCups</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I wasted 12k last time truing to get a DE mask. I am too stingy to gamble however I really wanted to be able to get up steps in places like Kael! Then they closed it down ( whew! ) and I quested the wood elf mask! Now I look like all the other druids! WOOOOOT!!</div></div><hr />
