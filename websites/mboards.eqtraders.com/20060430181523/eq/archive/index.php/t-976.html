<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rassy fleetfoot</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, in this thread http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=517 , which is an awesome guide BTW, it says to start a faction attacking another camp, kill the named of the race you wish to initiate an attack. I can find NOTHING anywhere else about the war, allakhazams has zip and all old posts got wiped, so here i am :)<br />
<br />
I just have an issue with this prescribed method, as i killed named owlbears and both named sonic wolves only to have the grimlings turn around and attack both of these camps. <br />
<br />
So my question..how do YOU! (those who do the war out there) start it? i found that by killing the 2 grimling bodyguards in about 10 minnutes someone will attack them. I had this work twice in 1 day (first time someone had a gm reset zone when i left for something) Im not sure if this is just pure luck or actually some kind of method. <br />
OH also..is there a specific place to farm the substances once you have the camp taken over? i was AE'ing 10-12 owlbears at a time once they took over the grimlings and by the time i had 12 a monk who was also farming had 3 stacks..do the outer islands drop more than the base camp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arghargh</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With almost 1000 shadowscream combines, I have some experience with he Hollowshade Moor war.  After a server reset, or just a zone reset (rare, but GM can do it), the war is on auto pilot.  One camp will randomly attack another.  Often, two attacks will be in progress at once (owlbears attacking grimlings, while sonic wolves attack the owlbears).  Once one camp is taken over, the automatic attacks stop.  It might be that killing a wandering named will restart the auto attacks.  <br />
<br />
Its been mentioned that killing a named makes that race launch an attack.  I haven't seen this, but I don't discount it completely given how buggy the whole war is.  I have seen the war in a state where killing a named caused that race to be attacked.  On two occasions, I was able to flip-flip control of the south islands back and forth between owlbears and sonic wolves by killing the mob at the grimling chieften's spawn point.  More often, I got there ASAP after a patch, then I just waited for the correct auto-attack to occur, and kill the defenders.  I don't believe you need to kill the guards (or the named when auto-attacks are happening) in the south camp, but killing them makes killing the defenders that much easier.  <br />
 <br />
If you get the zone wide messages about the attacks, then the war is on auto-pilot.  If the war isn't on auto-pilot, and killing the named doesn't trigger any attacks, then the war is bugged.  If the east caves, or the area betwee the east cave and the river, has zero (or nearly zero) mobs, then the war is bugged.  If one mob controls the whole zone, and nothing is happening, then the war is bugged.  <br />
<br />
If by &quot;base camp&quot; you mean the camp where the grimling cheiften spawns, then you were in the wrong place.  I've never seen any substances drop there, although other have reported then dropping.  I usually farmed the largest island (not technically an island since its connected to the main land).  There are about 50 mobs on that island.  Drops on both substances were between 1 in 3, and 1 in 4.  Dual boxing 56 shaman, and 57 warrior, I could get between 30 and 65 per hour, with an average of about 45 per hour.<br />
<br />
On petitioning:  In all the times I petitioned, and /bugged this zone, I got zone resets twice.  All petitioned are answered by guides, and guides can't help you.  Only a GM can reset the zone.  Ask for your petition to be &quot;escalated&quot; to a GM.  Then you get to wait for a GM to actually get online, and atually get to you.  <br />
<br />
I can't prove it, but it seemed to help if I explained to the guide I was working shadowscream quest, shar val quests, and/or smithing, but the mobs I needed were bugged.  When I said I was working on the war quest, I was told they wouldn't reset the zone because reseting the zone wouldn't help the war quest work.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rassy fleetfoot</div><div class="date">12-14-2002, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">good info Argargh..today i zoomed back out to HS and found the wolves were popped instead of the owlbears the way i left last night. I had run a test last night after i posted..the substances DO indeed drop in the base camp, where the grimling chief spawns, altho MUCH slower than the island you mentioned. <br />
Today i went to the big island and started pulling and AE'ing everything (bard with druid helper) and picked up 100 substances in about 2 hours..much better loot rate than what i tried yesterday. <br />
<br />
now to get the owlbears back..hehe the completely random war sounds a lot more likely to what i was seeing tho, i couldnt manage to forcefully make anything happen, but it seemed coincidental that when i killed the grimling chief and his bodyguards about 5 minutes later some faction was marching on the camp. Will see if i can pull it off again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arghargh</div><div class="date">12-14-2002, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I spent much more time getting swirling shadows than on both substances together.  They drop slower (average 32/hour), and you need two per attempt.  One the bright side, you don't have to worry about the shades in TS being up or not, and you get some minor pp and loot too.<br />

They spawn in relatively high numbers near hole to the caves, to the right of Sharvahl, mainly up along the wall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iwar_VZ</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the excellent post about the HM-war that rassy fleetfoot refer too there is a way to reset the war mentioned, although it is supposed to be &quot;hopelessly bugged&quot;. Is this rumor only or how is it supposed to work? On my server I have yet to see the zone with all inhabitants at the same time alive. Sucks too because my smith is only lvl 30 and can not go to TM and farm. What lvl is the sonic wolves in TM btw? I however found the Grimy Owlbear spawn in PC to be quite rewarding.<br />
<br />
Is there more ways to kill Sonic wolves other than in HM and TM?</div></div><hr />

Its clearly bugged, and they don NOT have the customer service to handle it properly. The hollowshade moor zone had a life expectancy of about 8 hours on my server before it became useless.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nizanko</div><div class="date">12-19-2002, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way that GM command permissions are set up, they wouldn't be able to grant a guide permission to repop one zone without giving them the ability to repop any zone (which, as we could all agree, would be a Bad Thing).<br />
<br />
They should just go back and fix the war, which would make a lot more sense and wouldn't require a GM ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gymp</div><div class="date">12-19-2002, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm in the &quot;completely random&quot; camp when it comes to the Hollowshade War. I just spent the last 2 days (about 12-14 hrs total) in the zone and there was no logical pattern or triggering events that I could find. I honestly do not think there is a triggering event to spur the war, here's why:<br />
<br />
- A Necro farmer on my server regularly parks himself w/pet right next to the named spawnpoint in the Wolf cave for hours on end. What this means is every 12 min (or what ever the spawntime is) the named or a PH is killed. In 2 hrs of him killing like clockwork (and verifying named were killed,) the wolves never attacked another camp. <br />
<br />
- Quite a few times, I got a war mesg when I was the only one in the zone and had not killed anything<br />
<br />
- I parked myself at the grimling camp (after missing the chance to get the Owlbears to win) and camped the grimling chieftan for 3 hrs, killing the chief every time he spawned. Only once did the grimlings attack the wolves and only once were the grimlings attacked (out of 13-14 kills)<br />
<br />
- No pattern in the war mesg. Sometimes there would be 2-3 fights within a few min of each other (sometimes a repeat,) other times it would be an hr to an hour and half between war mesg.<br />
<br />
You mileage may vary but I am highly doubtful there is a single triggering event. I'm just glad I was able to help the Owlbears win today on BB.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All this stuff is hocus-pokus.<br />
<br />
Though it is a nice diversion to run in and snipe off the named, so not all is lost.  Well, some is lost, but that's just on my server...&amp;lt;kicks Trivial Loot Code in the nuts&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iwar_VZ</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 03:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, definitely random. I came to HSM yesterday after server up to try the war for the first time. I decided to start killing grimling chief and see if anything would happen. When all of a sudden before I have done anything (and Im alone in zone) it announced in zone that Owlbears stares angrily to the south or something like that, I wait for a while and then kill the body guards and chief, wait another while and then the defenders pop, and I kill them too. Then after a while Wolfs(!) suddenly appear although it said Owlbear in announcement, lol. Pretty nice though as Ive been camping wailing substance in PC for the last week or so. Got 87 shrieking substance last night. Hopefully no more server downs for a while now.  8)</div></div><hr />

Then nothing...</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way the war is supposed to be work is: when one of the races takes over all three camps, then that race is also supposed to take over the kitty fort near Shar Vahl.  Then you kill the named that spawns in the fort to reset the war.<br />
<br />
That has never, ever happened.<br />
<br />
I'd love to hear someone say that they've seen the fort taken over by grimlings or sonic wolves or what-have-you.  It'd be nice to see the script work at least once.<br />
<br />
But I think it's completely broken, and SOE has no intention, at this time, of fixing it.<br />
<br />
Ah well.  At least we get zone resets on patch days.</div></div><hr />
