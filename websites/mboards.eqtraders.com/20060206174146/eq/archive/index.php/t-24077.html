<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twistagain</div><div class="date">11-11-2005, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What exactly are you trying to do with this thread? Is this something you are attempting on your own? Or with the cooperation with EQTraders?<br />
<br />
The reason I ask is that, normally, don't we see threads where the names of such software have been edited out...so as not to be appearing to approve of them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mewkus</div><div class="date">11-12-2005, 09:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">kind of explained here (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/showthread.php?p=167770#post167770)<br />
<br />
Didn't have prior permission, but did seem to get permission after the fact. <br />
The purpose of this thread is purely to solicit ads from google that shouldn't be included on this site. I stuck the post here in the stormhammer forum becuase there hadn't been any activity here for like a year and a half prior.</div></div><hr />
