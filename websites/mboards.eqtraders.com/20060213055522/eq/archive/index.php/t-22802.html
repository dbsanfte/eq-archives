Can't imagine we haven't got a one, but can't ever seem to locate any of their wares for my lil froggy warrior in the Bazaar.  And gods help me, 3 sets of skilling to 200+, one to 250+, and tailoring to 200+ has got me frazzled enough atm that I really don't want to do it myself...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angelsyn</div><div class="date">08-01-2005, 05:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have indeed seen Grandmaster's Protectorate (Plate) &amp; Farsight (Chain) Chest &amp; Leg pieces in the Bazaar.  Just tonight, in fact.<br />
<br />
Phirephrog &amp; Bonechipster were the sellers.<br />
<br />
On the flip side, I spotted a Half Elf Bard the other night who had the Master Blacksmith title... but I forgot his name.<br />
<br />
While I'm not quite in the market yet, I would be willing to sell Half Elf armour for someone, if they're interested in making it. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aleksandros</div><div class="date">08-23-2005, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's the latest running around on the General forum here (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/showthread.php?t=22980) , that FRG has been added to the DoN gnome cultural armor.  I believe this is a bug (data entry error with the new froglok classes), and should be fixed shortly, but the devs do have their plates quite full atm with DoDH less than a month from release.  I haven't worked up smithing to any appreciable level with my wee Tinker, so can't confirm or deny personally.</div></div><hr />
