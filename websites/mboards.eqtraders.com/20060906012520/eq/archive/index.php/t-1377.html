I have been foraging in Kithicor Woods for Oak Bark(I always got it here for my fletching) and can usually forage up 1 per hour or so. Is the ground spawn in BBM a better source for this? I thought I would check it out, and spent the better part of two hours running everywhere in the zone and didnt see any. Is there any specific location to look for the bark? And will I be able to find more than one an hour if I am able to find all the various spots it spawns? Any information would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

When i was in need of them i asked my guilds druids to help out for an hour or so, you can fight the undead at night and forage away and with a couple druids or rangers if possible, you can get quite a few.</div></div><hr />

I thought it was going to be easy. Boy did I ever realize how wrong I was. Excellent hides are rare and costly, Oak bark is just rare, and Morning Dew is a pain to forage also. Finally I gave up and probably spent around 125pp per combine. It might not sound like alot, but for the effort it took to get all the pieces,  I coulda pharmed a ton more wyvern combines. Plus I got a whopping 2 skill raises from it (192-193). It's worse than robes...<br />

For some reason, I skilled up much more often with cultural than with Velious. I went up to 228 tailoring skill mainly on cultural. 228 is the trivial. Beyond that you make Tunarean armor which required expensive blue diamonds.<br />
<br />
Oak bark is fairly easy to forage in Kithicor. My 'puter is fairly decent, so I logged out/in to reduce forage time. I averaged a forage every 60 seconds that way.<br />
<br />
Morning dew is also easy to forage. You can also buy it by auctioning in Greater Faydark. I paid 5 pp each.<br />
<br />
Excellent sabertooth tiger hides can be bought fairly easily. I port to Skyfire, egress to OT zone line, auction for hides in OT, zone to Frontier Mountains, egress to LOIO zone line, and auction again in LOIO. I pay 20 pp per hide and averaged 2 - 3 per run. After awhile people would save the hides for me.<br />

That is exactly the way I did it.  I had MUCH better skill up rates using Wood Elf Reinforced Cultural than I had on any other recipie.  After cultural trivialed the next best recipie was Othmir.  Takes twice as many hides, but you can farm while getting EXP and its a relatively cheap combine.<br />

The only problem there is that there are other unique forages in addition to the oak bark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dazmezzn</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 09:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone know where the ground spawn is in Butcherblock for the Oak bark?  And also how many oak bark tannins do you get per each attempt?  <br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for the answers to these questions:)<br />
<br />
May Tunare smile upon you:)</div></div><hr />
