<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koner</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm concerned with the prices that I see most people selling PoP smithing temper components for. Particularly Drops of Pure Rain, Sandstorm Pearls, Fetid Slime, Stormrider blood, Nightmare Mephit blood. <br />
<br />
To make ONE hurricane plate breastplate attempt requires 4 drops of pure rain. With the average asking price of 4k for these that means 16K in just pure rain. Add another 6k for the needed 6 sandstorm pearls, 1200 plat for the 6 stormrider bloods and 4k for the emblem of Storms and 4k for electrified copper (500plat per brick average) this brings the grand total for ONE hurricane bp attempt to 27,200 plat. Now I would not even think twice about paying 3-4K for the Emblem of Storms as it is returned on a failure and only consumed upon a successful cobine. BUT a sucessful combine would cost me 27,200 using the AVERAGE prices from the bazaar. This to make a breastplate that would be very difficult to sell for 30k. Hurricane plate bp's are in the same range as blue diamond cultural bp's except that agnostics can wear them and BD cultural bp's are selling for less than 20K now. As I said I would have ZERO concern paying 3-4K for the emblem as some Jewelcrafter has spent many hours gaining the required 250 skill to make those. They deserve to be rewarded for their efforts (even though the components for emblems are cheap just the imbue spells are pricey and hard to come by). But The rest of you are just all about greed. To make up for my time spent to gain the smithing skill to make this armor I'd have to charge 35-40K for that BP to make any sort of profit. NO player in their right mind would pay 35-40K for a Hurricane or Night Terror plate bp. Let alone the 27,200 plat that the individual components would cost me to make them. <br />
<br />
Come on folks. Relax a little with the greed. Sandstorm pearls and drops of pure rain, although relatively rare drops, are NOT worth what you are asking for them. There is little if any competition to buy them from you (Fermi has had the same 6 Sandstorm pearls for sale for going on two weeks). There is no other use for them outside of tradeskills. You aren't going out there to BoT with the sole intent of farming them to sell in the bazaar for profit. You are simply out in BoT getting exp or looking for gear. The temper components that drop are just fodder for you in most cases. Why not price them reasonably. In the end everyone wins out. You make a profit off of items that you have no use for. The tradeskillers make a profit off their wares. And the people who buy the tradeskillers wares are happy because they get the final result at a price that is decent and NOT jacked up to cover the cost of components AND the hundreds of hours the tradeskillers had to put into EARNING the skill to make them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">windeliane</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, as a tradeskiller, i find these prices expensive too. But i don't complain. If i feel it's too much expensive, i don't buy.<br />
<br />
I agree, plate armor is a waste of money, but you can do some chain armor for much less components, and maybe some benefits.<br />
<br />
Drops of pure rain are also used on a high level quest now (Aid Grimel), so more demand for it, then higher price.<br />
<br />
The market is the market, let it go. Anyway, soon you will have access to BoT, if you have not yet, up to you to farm all these components, now :)</div></div><hr />

If I am in the bazaar and wish to purchase something and the price is to high I just dont buy it.</div></div><hr />
