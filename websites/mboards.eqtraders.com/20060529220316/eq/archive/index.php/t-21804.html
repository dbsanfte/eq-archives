<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nolrog</div><div class="date">05-09-2005, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So.  Well, I figured it was time to finish off my poison making skill.  At the end of the last episode, I was at 275, having finished off Spirit of Sloth.<br />
<br />
So, what to make.  The poisonous ingredients for Scoriae Bite are easy to come by, but the advanced poison vials are a real pain to make (not difficult, but time consuming.)  So that's what I made.  I did about 420 combines or so (didn't count them exactly, I know I had ~ 400 poison vials, and with failures, I got a few freebie combines.)  I got 11 skill up points in those 400 combines broken down like this (Oh, I should mention that my DEX was maxed at 255 for all combines):<br />
<br />
First 100ish combines, 5 skill ups.<br />
Second 100ish combines, 3 skill ups.<br />
Next 200ish combines, 3 skill ups.  <br />
<br />
Overall rate was about 1 skill up for every 40 combines.  In the past, that would have been bad.  With the formula change, I don't know if that was good, bad or about right.<br />
<br />
I'm gonna try farming up skorpkis venom, Mt. Death Mineral Salts, Succulent Sap or anything else that trivials over 283 and doesn't use the dang advanced poison vials.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the info.  I spent mucho time the last few days collecting skorpkis venom.  I collected a little over 6 stacks so far.  Once I hit 10 stacks, I'll make a run.<br />
<br />
I was in Nurga as well, trying to get the mineral salts, but the drop rate wasn't as good as the skorpkis venom.  Anyway, that's what I'm doing.  I may try to get a friend to make me another 200 advanced poison vials as well.  If that's the case, I'll make more scoriae bite.  I just hate making those poison vials.  LOL.  <br />
<br />
I figure 400-500 combines should get me to 300. Of course, that means I need 800-1000 venoms.  Gonna do them in blocks of 100 combines (200 venoms) until I get there.  /sigh.  So many.</div></div><hr />

For one the respawns are constant, for two the drop rate is easily 10 times better, and probably more, than Nurga/droga, for three they die a heck of a lot quicker.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks.  I'll be sure to check that out.  Might be nice to kill something besides a skorpkis for a change.  LOL.  <br />
<br />
I've got 10 stacks of skorpkis venom right now.  Unfortunately, it takes 2 venoms for each combine.  Still, that gives me 100 combines.  Wish me luck.  I'm gonna go through them tonight before my raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A friend is making me some more advanced poison vials, so I'll be back to scoriae bite for another couple hundred combines.  Man, I'm gonna be so glad when this is done.  LOL.  With any luck, that 200 combines will take me to like 295.  With a lot of luck, 300, with the same luck I had last time, 192.  /sigh.</div></div><hr />

OUCH.<br />
<br />
Man, I thought 3 skill ups in 200 attempts was bad.  That's horrendous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My wife's rogue does poison making, beyond the trivial for SoS.  She has several stacks of advanced poison vials around, and I don't understand why she'd ever need more.  When she has the materials to make poisons, she'll make 5 or 10 at a time.  Then she makes the 10 dose, like so:<br />
http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=6986<br />
<br />
This returns the same 10 vials you used making the poison.  I think she has reused the same 10 advanced poison vials dozens of times.<br />
<br />
I'm not a rogue, so I could have missed something... to me, more vials seems like an unnecessary waste of cash.</div></div><hr />

Only a couple of problems with this. First, the quest to get the item that you need to make 5 dose or 10 dose takes way too much time. It took my rogue about 4 days solid to get the quest done. The hardest part was doing the factions. Secondly, not all poisons can be made in to 5 or 10 potion. So, if you choose that route, you won't get your vials back.<br />

I mainly wanted to offer an alternative for those skilling up near 300.  You don't HAVE to have tons of advanced poison vials.<br />
<br />
So there's pros and cons of using coffin bottles.<br />
Con:  GMAS = Very hard quest.  (I helped with parts of this, so I know it's a beast.)<br />
Pro: Owning GMAS is a significant accomplishment (that warm glow of success)<br />
Con:  Not all recipes work.<br />
Pro: Avoid tedium of making vials.<br />
Con: GMAV is expensive<br />
Pro: Save money on Advanced Poison Vials<br />
Con:  Must be 46+<br />
Pro: GMAS required to complete the Master Sketch for some of the advanced poisons.<br />
<br />
Some folks really aren't interested in the poisons produced with poison making. (ie, someone wants to make augs, or just post big skill numbers here.)  On the whole, I think they should skip the GMAS.<br />
<br />
For those interested in using poisons later, or any rogue with the PoP ornate leggings, the GMAS is a fine investment.</div></div><hr />

My rogue is 37.  Can get lots of help, but need to be 46 first.  Maybe I'll drag him out and PL him to 46.  Good tip though, thanks.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the top.  I made a run of 100 of them last weekend (3 skill ups).  Was a real PITA to collect all the skorpkis venoms.  Spent about 3 or 4 days collecting the venom, and I would up with 10 stacks.  It was a nice change of pace from making the poison vials, but got boring farming all those venoms.  Made about 800 plats in coin and other drops as well.  Still, it's faster to make the advanced poison vials, I just hate doing them because of all the combines.<br />
<br />
This weekend, I ran through about 240 combines, mostly scoriae bite (~200), but also a few Warlord's Rage and a 25 or so of Mind Melts (basically using up everything I had collected.)  In those 240 combines, I got 4 skill points.  <br />
<br />
The average skill up rate (based on my personal combines, so take this with a grain of salt), seems to be somewhere between 40 and 60 combines (maybe 50?)  That would be about a 100% increase in the skill up rate from before the change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a question on the level required.  You couldn't do the quest in the past, before level 46 or 50, because you needed to be that level in order to get to 250 poison, which was a requirement.  Since the level requirement to raise poison making was removed, does that mean I can do the quest now?  I'm already way past 250 (293 and counting) and have a good chance at making the trophy on the first try.  Wish I did the burning rapier quest sooner (wish I never sold my blackburrow cask either.  LOL.)  I'm going to give it a go, and see how it works out.  Got a walkthrough for both the rapier and the sketch, so that should help.</div></div><hr />

 :grumpy: <br />
<br />
I tried to at least initiate the quest, however the NPC that starts it told me that I must still prove my worth.  She cons amiable to me.  Maybe it's faction (reportedly need kindly, and I don't remember if that's higher than amiable or not. LOL.)?  You need to be 46 to enter fear?  I should be able to get everything done except that fear drop.<br />
<br />
Where's a good place to PL from 37 to 46 quickly?  I can have a 68 beastie help me (too bad druid is on the same account as the rogue.)</div></div><hr />

You need your GMAS before you can complete the master sketch <br />
Dip Resist sketch requires a combine in a coffin bottle from your GMAS<br />

Remiss sketch u need PP of 190+ so will need to be around 40 to complete<br />
<br />
Sluggish needs a drop from PoH so u need to be 46 for that one<br />
<br />
Vein Rot requires a lot of running around and killing a level 40 for no drop head, np if u can swap to a 60 character (or even take a group if u need too).<br />
<br />
At 55 i have 2 sketches and just need that Eyerezzia from PoFear to get my GMAS.  If anyone on Povar can help me get it, ill be your bestest friend forever  :D</div></div><hr />

I'll have to check with my wife, but I believe you do NOT need max ally faction for talking to Renux.  You DO need Kindly.  (It amazes me how often I see faction requirements exagerated, like people who say you need max ally to get Thurg quest armors.)<br />
<br />
Since the level requirement to raise poison making was removed, does that mean I can do the quest now?<br />
It looks like there's no minimum level to start the quest, but of course you can't finish it without Eyerazzia from Plane of Fear.  Fortunately, it's a fairly common drop from a trash mob.  Unfortunately, killing the scarelings will occasionally spawn the zerker epic mob.  (Bad design.  He should spawn in a fixed location clear of the zone in.  When he's up at the zone in, the entire zone is blocked for the levels it was intended for.)<br />
<br />
My wife built her faction (slowly) in West Karanas by killing all the bandits around 40 times, and in Qeynos by talking to a guy that only spawns at night.  (Sorry, don't remember the name, but it's much faster than the bandits.)<br />
<br />
You need your GMAS before you can complete the master sketch<br />
Dip Resist sketch requires a combine in a coffin bottle from your GMAS<br />
Discussion of the Master Sketch quest is derailing this thread farther than I intended, but I have to say, that dagger from Plane of Hate is a myth.  We've seen more drops of the SEoC than that thing!<br />
<br />
When you pick the pocket of the rogue GM in Kelethin, then hand the parchment back, you get an amazing amount of exp.  This IS after all done without moving, without killing anything.<br />
<br />
You can't get experience grouped with that 68 beasty, can you?  Would make PL very fast since BL's can solo in some nasty spots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buns</div><div class="date">05-25-2005, 06:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, I admit might not need MAX ALLY for the quest. I was unable to do on Amiable or Warmly or something. I did the rogue errand quest for a couple of hours (which took me too max) and then Renux would talk to me. <br />
<br />
The quenos night spawn that Neebat refers too is part of the Rogue Errand. See my pastey below. <br />
<br />
&quot;Starts in rogue guild at North Quenos, speak to Zannsin Resdinet, he gives you a bent playing card which you need to give to Jracol Brestiage by North Quenos zoneline (spawns at night only, a static Gnoll is his PH). Not a huge faction jump each note, but the note is NOT LORE, so with a bit of spamming you can do 80 notes at a time. I went to Max ally from indiff with about 240 cards (4 trips, took me 3 game days). Also went to threatening with the Quenos guards, but back to warm after 4 reality days in Blackburrow (blackburrow cask - burning rapier - mastersketch, as a rogue im sure you know what im talking about).&quot;</div></div><hr />

What I want is the seal, so I can make the coffin poison vials, and reclaim my advanced ones.  I plan on doing every step I can right now, with the exception of the PoF one.  I assume you need to be 46 to zone into fear?<br />
<br />
I am currently amiable. I read that it was kindly you needed to get the quest, and needed the grandmaster vial (I have that.)  I was giving the begger by the docks in Qeynos North 3 gold pieces, and getting a faction hit each time.  Went form indifferent to amiable in about 30 minutes.  Might do that, because it will save the running to get to kindly.  Eventually, I'll get the cask in BBM (and as a consequence, fix my guard faction at the same time.)<br />
<br />
So, I need to get my faction higher to be able to start the quests, assuming I Can start it at 37.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for all the tips everyone.  I'll keep you posted.</div></div><hr />

They are used in 328 trivial<br />
<br />
Death Cap, black henbane, crystal nightshade (sold in Abysmal Sea), Seal poison vial, ethereal suspension (vendor sold in Pok, Abysmal Sea)<br />
<br />
They also both drop regularly from the mobs in Sol B off the kobolds.  If ya got a lvl 40ish alt go farm there, it's not bad exp.  Or just go into te zone and hope ya catch people exping.  Offer to buy it</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Best place for PL is Gunthak or OT till can group with the Bst then go where ever, just have Bst keep aggro on mob w/o dmg and you backstab away.</div></div><hr />

I also used tainted planar essence (for Bite of the Shissar). I had my GMAS so the vials weren't much of an expense - you only lose vials when you fail a combine, and I probably lost less than a stack before I got 300 skill.<br />
<br />
Did I understand right from Neebat's post, that if you have ornate leggings, you can combine the summoned poisons in a coffin bottle? If so, are the five-dose versions still droppable? If that's the case, I might just get myself a pair of ornate legs just for the poison factory. Scoraie Bite isn't my favorite (I like Shissar for the extra damage) but it'd be nice to mass produce it for fellow rogues, etc. - and the stun effect isn't bad if you fight a lot of caster mobs.<br />
<br />
For those of you that have finished master sketch, does Shreiking Ahslpeiss EVER drop? I've committed genocide there several times and still no luck :( Any tips?</div></div><hr />

When it comes to poison making, you're wise to take everything I say with a grain of salt, because my wife is the rogue and she doesn't post here.  She does usually review my posts after they're posted.<br />
<br />
The result of proc'ing the pants (bad visual comes to mind) is TEMPORARY NO TRADE.  In a coffin bottle, you can combine these 5 or 10 at a time to make multidose poison.  The result is a single, NO TRADE item with 5 or 10 charges.  I believe the multidose version is not TEMPORARY.  Unlike all the other multidose poisons, you do not get vials.  (which is fair, since you didn't use any vials)</div></div><hr />

Yes, dropped of off the Avatar first kill, see my post in the bestiary on Alla's for more info. For the person that asked about the help on Povar send me (Nicroll) a tell in game evenings EST. Also for GMAS faction run in a circle killing the bandits in WK for about 3 hours, keep all of the Sashes, then kill guards until you con kindly to Renux. After you complete the quest sneak into qeynos and turn in the sashes you collected while killing bandits to repair your faction with the guards. FYI Lon is assassinatable, conned DB to a 60 rogue.</div></div><hr />
