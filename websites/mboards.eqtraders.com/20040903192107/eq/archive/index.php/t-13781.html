<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korrann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Being a dwarven smith I will stick with the dwarves for this question.<br />
<br />
Is there a reason why berserkers were not added to Underfoot(brell) and Mischevious (Bristlebane) Cultural dwarven armor?<br />
<br />
I saved up a bunch of supplies and was going to make some low end and high end armor and level up a Dwarven Berserker but waited as only the non-inmbued chain armor was designated for the Beserker class.  Hoping that this may be a diety restriction, (Berserkers couldn't follow Brell or Bristlebane) I was truely surprised when making my Berserker the three options for diety were Brell/Bristlbane/agnostic.  So was this an oversite?  Is it the same through the races?  Is there some complaint department I can send a dead fish too?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aethn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Likely its hindsight.  I am sure that within a few days or the next patch Zerkers will be added to thier respective chain culturals that are missing.<br />
<br />
Changing thousands of items to reflect Zerkers is a duanting tak at best, I am certain a few items will be missed and caught up later.  I suggest you /bug and/or /feedback your concern and they will fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Be sure to /bug it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xanafeldier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Berzerkers wear chain and below, only dwarves can make berzerker cultural so far as I know and I'm not entirely certain all pieces have been correctly flagged for berzerkers. Some read (on Lucy and here) as RNG ROG only. On the other hand on Lucy I see elven chain with BER flag so that's not a good place to look.<br />
<br />
    On the bright side I'm selling acrylia chain of all sizes and shapes. Non-level restricted stat armor for a whole bunch of new characters.<br />
<br />
    Reinforced acrylia and geode jewelry selling as well. Some studded that has better stats than reinforced.<br />
<br />
    Adding chain cultural recipes to Ogres shouldn't be difficult just time consuming. Adamantite chain is int caster only. Ogre Splint version includes shamen and ... don't they have the same armor restrictions as berzerkers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Human Freeport cultural (Fine Seafarer's) is wearable by some berserkers.  From Lucy:<br />

So I guess only Barbarian berserkers can use that?  Not sure yet what all the berserker races are, but I believe medium-sized races can't be.<br />
<br />
On a side note, the medium-sized LDoN chain armors are NOT BER tagged, but the large ones are.  I have yet to check small, but I believe they will be.</div></div><hr />

Berserkers can be Dwarf (small) and Troll, Barbarian, Ogre, Vah Shir (large).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Crimson Darksplint armor (Ogre cultural-Rallos Zek) does not have BER tag.  I have not seen any Blackened or Fulvous Darksplint to check them.  It appears though that Ogre/Troll BER are left out in the cold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think that as with the Cultural and PoP armors being left out of the Tradeskill UI they may not have yet been flagged for the Zerkers. As Aethn said they had to change THOUSANDS of items to have the Zerker flag... Most likely it is something that will be corrected but again /bug or /feedback it if you see something that could fit into the Chain and lower armors that also fits the Race/deity combo for a Zerker that does not have the flag... They have corrected items in the past and will continue to do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xanafeldier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm not playing a berzerker.<br />
<br />
If I were I think armor that was incorrectly flagged taken out from under me might be more disturbing than waiting for it to be done right. /shrug<br />
<br />
Half-naked level 65 Troll Berzerker lfg in a week or so?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We are not talking about things that HAVE the zerker flag we are talking the cultural armors that are Chain class that do not have the Flag... Those should definately be /bug or /feedback In my almost 6 years of playing I can only remember a handfull of items that were ever changed to have the classes/races removed from them, most of the time the item was in the game, had a race or class added that it should not have had then was promptly removed.<br />
<br />
Anyway hope this post does not come across as bitchy... Just want to make sure the stuff we smiths make can be used by the new class.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

All these tradeskill updates, it's kinda like Christmas &lt;sniff&gt;:love:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aandaie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Vah and Bar are Medium/Large sized, if I remember right. Just like True elves are small/medium sized (dark elves, wood elves, high elves.) These types can wear either of the mentioned sizes.<br />
<br />
previous to Vah being in the game, barbarian was the only dual Medium/Large sized race.</div></div><hr />

This might be true but this game is their job and jsut so many mistakes should not happen. What if you go and buy a car and the car maker forgot to put hood on your car. The car make tells you they will get to it in a few weeks to place one on it. Is that ok? nope. Same way with EQ. EQ is a product that is bought by many many people and they should have better QA. <br />
I have been playing EQ from the start, just like a lot of people, so yeah I know its part of the game. But common thought tells me that if I create a new class and its a dwarf, well they will need dwarf newbie armor. O but wait TIME weapons and armors are updated. But not the items some with out PLing will be used sooner than later.</div></div><hr />

I'll just close it now to prevent further devolution.</div></div><hr />
