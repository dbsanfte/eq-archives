<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am trying to auto join 2 chat channels and I always want them in the same order. It seems I can only auto join one channel. Which file is the autojoin info stored in so I can see whats up? Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Apolline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You CAN autojoin two channels..<br />
<br />
if you're ingame and just do /autojoin it'll tell you how :)<br />
<br />
example.. I want to join channelA, and channelB<br />
<br />
I do /autojoin channela;channelb<br />
<br />
Then channela is always /1, channelB is always /2<br />
<br />
Annnd if there's a password.. it's the same.. /autojoin channela: password1;channelb: password2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">WOOT thanks ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>JMorgana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Btw, those should be commas (,) not semicolons (;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>salomeasillverfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if you simply want to edit the file, its called eqclient.ini<br />
search for autojoin and then simply edit the line, I autojoin 10 channels so I find it easier to edit the file than retype everything</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Apolline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">But I like semicolons better :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A copy of a guide I wrote up for another board:Chat channels are channels that can be joined by anyone on any server who knows the name of the channel and the password, if there is one. If there were a channel on your server named &quot;greeneggs&quot; and without a password, you would join it by typing:<br />
<br />
/join greeneggs<br />
<br />
If it had the password of &quot;andham&quot; you would type:<br />
<br />
/join greeneggs:andham<br />
<br />
You create a chat channel by being the first one to join it. If it does not have a password and everyone leaves, it ceases to exist. If it does have a password then it will require that password for up to 24 hours after everyone has left. That is why many public channels have passwords that are the same as the channel name. They prevent someone from joining when no one else is on and giving it a password so that no one else can get in. <br />
<br />
If you create the greeneggs channel (no password) on Karana, people on other servers could join it by typing /join karana.greeneggs. Players on Karana could also join it by typing /join karana.greeneggs, but don't have to put the karana part on if they don't want to.<br />
<br />
For channels that are intended to be available to people on all servers, you can designate them as such by using &quot;serverwide&quot; as the server name when they are created. Serverwide is just a generic term you can use to avoid having any particular server's name attached to the channel. Everyone on every server must use the serverwide part of the name to join that channel. <br />
<br />
You can also automatically join channels. If you type:<br />
<br />
/autojoin tradeskills:tradeskills,serverwide.eqtraders,greeneggs:andham<br />
<br />
you will be joined to those three channels every time you log on. As of the October 9, 2003 patch, the autojoin channels are saved independently for each character you play; you must autojoin the channels you desire whenever you start a new character. Changes made to the autojoin list on one character will not affect the other characters....and while I'm at it, I also had a list of serverwide channels...The following are chat channels that are available to the general public.<br />

serverwide.bards:bards<br />

serverwide.cleric:cleric<br />
