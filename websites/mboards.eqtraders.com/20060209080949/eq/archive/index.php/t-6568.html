<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently working on getting a full set of this armor.  I need to know who I can get with on bertoxx to start collecting things for the recipie money, blue diamonds or whatever else is required.  <br />
<br />
One of my questions through out this deal is that if Fierce Heraldic is not the higest type of armor that an Ogre Warrior that worships Rallos Zek can wear that is player made, then that type of armor is not what I am looking for...  I am specifically looking for the HIGHEST!<br />
<br />
Please contact me either through here or email me Guilliusx@msn.com so I can start &quot;knowing&quot; what to keep through out my travels to help a GM smith make me this suit.. to include like I said earlier.. metals, diamonds, plat of course etc.. etc..  thanks in advanced.<br />
<br />
P.S.  I just saw the post on the whole fraud thing.  I guarantee this is no fraud and I am not looking to selling the armor.  If you don't trust that and simply want to sell me the suit then sure I just want to know what I need to do.. as in how much money I need and who to contact.  And to be Honest and up front yes this is my twink but my main character is retired 57 Ranger and not in a guild anymore.. I only play with friends so we are not going to be able to get a bunch of no drop armor etc.. figure my best bet was to have fierce heraldic.  Please contact me before you make a decision about that fraud BS since that is not me.. I'd hate to not be able to get a suit of this because people are paranoid.</div></div><hr />
