I sent SoE &quot;What is the file path to the program that launches the Planetside patcher so I can play the game?&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead of actually answering the question, they sent me a six page form letter, asking things like &quot;What version of DirectX do you use?  Please send us the output of DXDIAG&quot; and &quot;What server do you play on&quot; and &quot;What sort of connection do you have?&quot;<br />
<br />
None of the questions in the form letter will give them any data necessary for them to answer my question; If they had actually READ my request, they'd have all the data needed...but apparently they're smarter than me, and they don't NEED to read my question to know that I stupidly forgot they need to know my DXDIAG data and what server I play on in order to make a desktop link to run the patcher...<br />
