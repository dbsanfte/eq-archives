<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mystrice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I found the recipe for these and it takes you to 222 smithing.  But EQtraders doesn't have what the enchanted velium bits make.  I saw a girl post earlier on another thread saying &quot;thank god I had enchanted velium bits or I would have quit smithing a long time ago&quot;.  So there must be a recipe out there if she's saying that.  Was just wondering if you all had that information or a link as to where I could find out some info on these.  Appreciate the help =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Check out the Grand Robe/Tunic of the Oracle Quest, here is the link from EQTC's quest section: http://www.gamesnet.org/KyrosKrane/Oracle/<br />
<br />
It's one step of making the Phylactery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mystrice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thank you very much  Maevenniia, that helps alot.  Well I suppose I'll just make these to 222 triv then and not worry about the sell back value.  =) Better than skilling up on Acrylia;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh, there is no sell back anyway. :) The Enchanted Velium Bits are Lore and No Drop.<br />
<br />
And yeah, depending on the market for Velium on your server, and the market for Windstones etc... it may be cheaper to do the EVB's.<br />
<br />
On Xegony, that's not the case though. :( EVERYONE has small pieces of Velium for 60PP or more... And the cheapest Small brick, Large Brick, and Blocks of Velium I saw was 110pp... *sigh*<br />
<br />
That's 120PP in Veium, 6PP for the Coldain Velium Temper, and another 13PP for the enchant velium spell...<br />
<br />
140PP with no return of any kind per skill up attempt? At least with Acrylia you can sell back to a merchant, or in the bazaar to get back a little of the cost.<br />
<br />
Currently farming Velium and Shadowscream Combines, and have a few friends helping, but I can't afford the Bazaar prices for Velium anymore. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mystrice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">NO DROP , Lore...ya that's why I won't worry about the sell back value..cause there is none =)<br />
<br />
Well on Terris Thule the Velium goes for around 50-60p a piece.  But I farm the Velium so it's not such a big loss for me.<br />
<br />
Velium (free)  + Enchant Velium (12p) + CVT (6p) = 18p<br />
<br />
18p per combine is alot better, farm the velium =)<br />
<br />
P.S. What's EVB's ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Give this some thought for a moment, and it will come to you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mystrice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well I feel dumb, Enchanted Velium Bits....EVB's.  It was late when I wrote that =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rissenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Enchanted Velium Bits: (Triv. 222, Lore)<br />
<br />
Small Piece of Velium (2), Coldain Velium Temper (1), Spell: Enchant Velium (1)<br />
Combine in Forge.<br />
<br />
NOTE: The recipe calls for you to place the *actual physical copy* of the spell in the forge. One copy per combine. NOT to have an enchanter bespell it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Nimren Stonecutter in Thurgadin sells:<br />
Coldain Velium Temper for about 5.5pp and <br />
Spell: Enchant Velium for about 12.5pp. <br />
I am at max CHA and Allied.</div></div><hr />
