Centaurs were traditionally topless.   And they would have to either change that, or face the wrath of angry mothers.<br />

<br />
A bird-like character would be ok. Levitation or flight would be a natural ability (lower right corner - walk, run, fly).<br />
<br />
Faeries, brownies, pixies, and sprites could be fun to try.<br />
<br />
A centaur archer ... nice combination possibility.<br />
<br />
Borrow (god knows how much they &quot;borrowed&quot; from other systems) from Vampire the Masquerade - Assamite, the shape shifter. But to prevent EVERYONE from playing it, make it extremely difficult to play or develop the shape shifting abilities. Would make an excellent rogue or warrior.<br />
<br />
The game has robots on the plane of innovation and aliens on luclin already ... how about a combination of the two - an EQ Transformer.  NAH! That's just silly.<br />
<br />
Whatever new race there is ... there will always be someone to powerlevel him or herself to maximum level within 2 weeks anyway.  <br />
If you don't role-play the character ... What's the point in playing?<br />

The assamites can't shift shapes, the gangrel do that. But a shapeshifter would be great. along the lines of Garou, Ratkin or Gurahl (to continue ripping of Whitewolf</div></div><hr />

Personally, I wouldn't mind seeing an undead race in the game.  The world of Norrath really doesn't have enough evil in it IMO as far as races go.  Perhaps they could be Mistmoore's ilk.</div></div><hr />

But remember they wont revamp a non original expansion zone. The reason is not everyone has the expansion so they dont want to develope something that not everyone will be able to buy (imagine someone buying the originaL old world eq then buying an expansion that let them be othmirs in velious)<br />

Hello? Iksar? Vah Shir?<br />
Those are both expansion races that you can't play without buying the expansion.<br />
<br />
Another Evil race, or at least an evil city to replace Grobb would be a good idea, although there aren't many good places to put them.  VI has stated that Norrath hasn't been fully explored, and there may be other continents (though astronomers on Luclin should be quite aware of them if there are)<br />
<br />
For myself though, i'd rather see the game fixed and current expansions finished before they work on anything new.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zyrtryx Conjureblade</div><div class="date">03-14-2003, 06:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Othmir, if they can be Bards or Rangers. I can picture an Othmir as a Ranger or a Shaman, but not as a BL or a Druid, for some reason. (What would their BL pet be? A walking fish?)<br />
<br />
Vampires would work, but only if you make it so that they take dmg from being outside during the day and have - 10 or greater penalty to saves vs. fire. Give them a fair amount (lower than Iksar, though) of regen, and a 1 use-per-day (Like Lay on Hands and Harm Touch) Lifetap that does dmg equal to half their hit points. (And if they can become Enchanters, using a racial illusion should NOT eliminate the daytime dmg and fire vulnerability) Make them Apprehensive by DE's, Dubious by the Iksar (since the Iksar and DE's have Necros as available classes), and KoS to all the other races. <br />
<br />
I could see Vampires becoming Warriors, Clerics, Enchanters, Wizards, Necromancers, Shadow Knights, or Rogues. Undead have no real connection to nature, which leaves them out as Beastlords, Druids, Rangers and Shamen, and would probably lack the dicipline to become Monks. (And wouldn't be Bards or Paladins for obvious reasons)<br />
<br />
(No Magicians, because half of the Magician's dmg spells are fire-related, and I couldn't see a Vampire running around with a Fire pet. At least Wizards get cold-based spells besides fire and magic ones.....)<br />
<br />
But what we REALLY need is another race that can be Monks. I was hoping Vah Shir would AT LEAST have the Tiger Claw attack (even if it is misnamed and is really just an Uppercut) when they were announced, and I could actually see Frogloks as Monks, even if SOE couldn't.</div></div><hr />

He even named this froglok... Leggy McFeets... :)<br />
<br />
He is quite disappointed that there are no froglok monks, needless to say...<br />
<br />
Anyways Othmir would be cool :)  And I hope that maybe they'll run another event where you can get scarecrow illusion ... they're SO COOL (OWWWWW!)... but Shissar would be the best! :)<br />
<br />
In my opinion, anyways... and they'd have to be evil....oh yessssssssss....evil precioussssss... we lovesss evil..   :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
OTHMIR RULE!!!! <br />
I would have SOOO much fun terroriz… Err, playing with other people as one.<br />
Taking a look at the classes, here’s my input (yes, I too am crazy about otters in IRL):<br />
Beastlord – I can see it but I have to admit it’s a weak argument.<br />
Paladin – Easily. If you’ve watched an otter protect it’s territory or it’s family this is an obvious match. That and they have a bit of a single mined approach to things fits the discipline needed.<br />
Ranger – Most definitely. I see them as being in touch enough with their world that this fits.<br />
Shadow Knight – Right out. Necromancy does NOT seem to fit.<br />
Bard - a must but it’d be a VISSIOUS fight to see who gets the name Emmett first.<br />
Monk – If you’ve seen an otter fight it fits; they are FAST and fight with every part of their bodies. (besides, there are only 2 races that can be monks right now)<br />
Rogue – Between the otter’s curiosity and ability to get into ANYTHING it’s hard to make an argument against this one.<br />
Warrior – Doesn’t really fit in my mind, too much direct confrontation and taking a beating.<br />
Cleric – Doesn’t really fit considering the other WIS caster options<br />
Druid – All the races that have Rangers have Druids too and I can see it. Again, it’s that connection to the natural world around them.<br />
Shaman – While two races can choose between Druid or Cleric, none of them can between Shaman and any other WIS Caster class. The Othmir would be a good one to break that with I can easily see a connection to their ancestors and spirits of the world.<br />
Mage – perhaps, if for no other reason than the ability to summon playthings. But, I really don’t see INT Caster classes as fitting over all, they seem more WIS Caster types.<br />
<br />
Oh, and the hats would be a MUST. Can you imagine the stovepipes that would come out of people dyeing them?<br />
<br />
And a Snake Monk would just be too much fun to watch in a fight. I’d be laughing to hard to pay attention.  :D</div></div><hr />

Shamans AND One other WIS caster(Clerics).<br />

Not to mention, alot of Shaman races have Beastlords, which are hybrid WIS Casters.<br />

<br />
I was separating the Hybrids into their own &quot;category&quot; anyway.<br />
<br />
Putting together the chart, I noticed some other interesting patterns. Intentional or not, it's interesting:<br />
All races that can be rouges can be warriors too. <br />
It's Either Paladin OR Beatlord and Ranger OR Shadow Knight. (Humans are the exception but then that seems to be their schtick).<br />
There are 4 INT casters, 4 Hybrids, 4 &quot;uniques&quot;, but only 3 WIS casters... Makes me wonder if their holding out for a latter class introduction.</div></div><hr />

All the WIS casters out now are related to the earth/spirits, is there a WIS caster of death, another dark class?</div></div><hr />

3 chain classes<br />
3 leather classes<br />

<br />
war, clr, pal, shd, brd<br />

Our hybrids are:<br />
war + nec = shd<br />
war + clr = pal<br />
war + dru = rng<br />
mnk + shm = bst<br />
**war + enc = brd<br />
<br />
So, we have no rogue hybrids, no mage or wiz hybrids, and no silk wearing hybrids.<br />
the obvious step is to add a rog + wiz or rog + mag silk class hybrid. they would of necessity be very challenging to play, having to watch their agro extremely carefully.  they would have to be competent in melee, have a large array of ac/hp spells or agro reducing spells or abilities, and have a reasonable number of DD spells or pet spells.  I would consider rog + wiz to be the best choice, since beastlords are a pet class hybrid.</div></div><hr />
