<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litermin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking for a good hosting service for my guild's web page, the one we have is currently down about every other day. how has racknine been for you for support and reliability? Really interested in what you folks think, since you seem to get alot of traffic and have some big databases etc that you run.<br />
<br />
Appreciate any comments you might have =)<br />
<br />
thanks!<br />

<br />
We did, about 6 months ago(?), have a disaster that could have been handled better by Racknine and we lost all database data. THey had a major HDD failure. They did not handle the attempt to get data back well at all (if they even tried)<br />
<br />
They have shown effort to help this from being such a disaster again in the future, including helping with a tool that will backup the data to my computer on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
Downtime is NOT unknown.  And the boards seem to be more prone to it than the site...  probably on average once a week.  But a simple trouble ticket usually gets the site back within 5-30 minutes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kehvrynne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Might want to check out GoDaddy.com as well. It's an exceedingly-low-cost webhost/domain name registrar. Hosting your guild's site will run less than $10 a month for up to a gig of bandwidth.<br />
<br />
I'm considering these folks for a larger project.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">godady just caused me huge doamin name problems with another site of mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kehvrynne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Really? Do tell... As I mentioned above, I am (was?) considering these folks to host about 9 sites. <br />
<br />
Your problems may well give me cause to reconsider ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It was just a domain name issue.  It took a week to get them to give me back my domain name.  Racknine used to use them for domain names and now uses a diferent domain name service.<br />
<br />
SO I do not know much about their hosting services... sorry if it was misleading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cubwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've had very good service with both GoDaddy and iPowerweb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>urizen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Another option is ProHosters (http://www.4ph.com).  They offer some nice packages.  I've had no problems with them, although I don't run a high traffic site.</div></div><hr />
