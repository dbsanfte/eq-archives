<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>yawp64</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Howdy, Fellow Fletchers,<br />
<br />
I'm a few ranks away from 202 on arrows and have been researching what will be the least expensive path from there to 250. <br />
<br />
I've come up with some results that stagger me, so I wanted to run them by this board for validation.<br />
<br />
My basic assumptions are:<br />
1) I will forage things that could be foraged;<br />
2) I will be forced to get non-foraged stuff from vendors;<br />
2) I will require 20 combines per skill up.<br />
<br />
So --<br />
202 - 215 = shaped sedgewood compound bow<br />
each bow costs 92 pp (sedge branch foraged)<br />
13 ranks X 20 combines<br />
23,920 pp<br />
<br />
215 - 235 = rough darkwood compound bow<br />
each bows costs 277p (all components bought)<br />
20 ranks X 20 combines<br />
110,800 pp<br />
<br />
235 - 250 = rough shadewood recurve bow<br />
each bow costs 374 pp (all components bought)<br />
15 ranks X 20 combines<br />
112,200 pp<br />
<br />
That's a total expenditure of 246,920 pp.<br />
<br />
Obviously, I'm looking for ways to lower those costs. Ideas I have:<br />
1) Kidnap or befriend a gnome tinker and have him make cams for me at cost.<br />
2) Sell the bows as you make them. What sort of loss can I expect selling them back to vendors?<br />
<br />
What have you all done to support your skill-ups?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oualawouzou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't know about your race, class or diety, but since you can forage, you are:<br />
<br />
-Ranger, Druid or Rogue<br />
AND/OR<br />
-Halfling, Wood Elf or Iksar<br />
<br />
Therefore, there is a good deal of chances that you worship Karana or that you are a Wood Elf.<br />
<br />
If you worship Karana, consider doing the Karana-only arrows in Surefall...<br />
<br />
They trivial over 250 and it will cost you about 35pp per combine.<br />
<br />
Using your assumptions (20 combines per skill-up), I come to a total of 35 000pp to get from 202 to 252 (though technically, you can only skill-up to 250).<br />
<br />
35pp/combine * 20 combines/skill-up * 50 skill-ups = 35 000pp.  That's not counting what you may make by selling back arrows or selling them in the Bazaar (there is a little more market for arrows than for bows).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I don't know much about Wood Elves, so I'll leave that to someone else. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaasper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your logic is flawed:<br />
<br />
First the cheepest skill up is acrylia arrows. I am a godless Hafling Rogue (ie no easy path for me).<br />
<br />
Went 202 to 220 on the arrows and it didnt cost me anythign cuz I was able to farm the shadow and acrylia myself.. If you have to buy these then your costs will rise.<br />
<br />
I failed my first attempt at the Grimell bow and decided it was time to take fletching to max skill. Went from 220 to 240 on bows (I was in a hurry) sure you have to make a lot of bows, but you can sell the successes back to the vendor.<br />
<br />
In my 20 points I sold 400 rough darkwood compound bows (total sales 92K) and 123 rough shaewood 1 cam bow (total sales 34k). Of course I had the 1 in 20 failures which added to the cost.<br />
<br />
Overall the bow skillups cost be 24K so just over 1k per point. However if I had of shot for 250 would have cost me much more as the shadewood points cost about 3 times as much as the darkwood points.<br />
<br />
Oh.. sucess on Grimell bow attempt #2 and proud owner of a signet of might.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In your initial layout of costs, you don't include money back for selling the bow to the vendor.  IIRC on the vendor bows, there is about an 80 plat loss per success.  Failures are full cost, of course.  I didn't use too many, but I tried a couple sedge bows, they sell for silvers to the vendor, but was able to bazaar them at a very tiny profit, but this was when the LDoN expansion was new, they may not sell anymore.<br />
<br />
Assuming good faction and decent CHA, I would expect to spend 70-100k from store bought fletching &gt; 202.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">definetely do acrylia arrows if you aren't extremely rich.  normally even the bazaar prices for the acrylia and condensed substances are better.  i have been saving up since i farm shadeling silk, rockhopper pelts and essescense of shadow in shadeweavers for smithing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>yawp64</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wow, my bad.<br />
<br />
I totally missed the acrylia arrows.  (Which is why I posted the question here! Thanks!) <br />
<br />
So ... if I use acrylia arrows as the path from 202 to 250, that equates to 48 ranks requiring an average of 20 combines per skill-up, for a total of 960 combines. <br />
<br />
That means I need to go farm 480 small bricks of acrylia ore and 480 chunks of condensed &lt;item&gt;.<br />
<br />
Better get crackin ...<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input, Fletchers!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Saleani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did darkwood bows from 202 to 220.<br />
Selling successes back to the vendor = 80pp loss<br />
Failures about 280pp.<br />
<br />
I have 295 wis unbuffed (pretty good for a paladin that used to be 85 wis naked) in my tradeskill suit. To get wis any higher I need to ding 65, and put 3 more aa into planar power.<br />
<br />
I spent 26kpp getting from 202 to 220.<br />
<br />
I don't know which recipe will be better for the next phase, as I am farming velium and acrylia with my shaman. Also, just having spent about 30k getting JC to 250 (from 178), I am kinda burnt out on tradeskilling for a week or 2. From 220-235 in JC, I was getting around 1 skill up per 20 combines. From 235 to 250 it was closer to 1 skill up per 40 combines. I don't know if I had bad hair days or not. These were done in 2 sessions over 2 days in qeynos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>lonewylfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's a lot more than 960 combines (at least it was in my case)...<br />
I ended up with at least 700 combines on acrylia, and that was post 215 with a lot of other things thrown in (did at least 5 levels with TS bow, at least 15 total levels with nightmare bow). Don't remember what I did 202-215...think it was acrylia and mithril.<br />
<br />
Good luck with your fletching!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">well yawp your pm's are disabeled it looks like. <br />
i highly suggest condensed shadow.  its by far the easiest to farm in mass.  anyway good luck.  <br />

its the master tradeskill guide list with links to the others.  i made a fletching guide from what i've read here and what i've done so far.  anyway it has info on all this.  just skim down the page till after normal arrows are trivial.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litetta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Being a Tunare loving druid, I went the Mithril arrow route (mostly because I was pregnant at the time and didn't have the RL stamina to farm acrylia). Spent about 40k roughly from 202 to 250. I gave most the arrows away to friends who wanted them, so I could have easily brought my loss down quite a bit by selling them. (Did enjoy friends saying how they loved the damage they did with those arrows). I averaged 2-3 skill ups per 100 combines with the arrows, and once running a streak of atleast 150 combines without a skill up.  So expecting to skill up once every 20 combines is probably a bit overzealous, unfortunately. However, don't let this discourage you. All the hard work you put into fletching is worth it in the end if you find that one person who about dies because you made an elemental bow for them :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">for an additional 2cp...<br />
<br />
One benefit overlooked in the acrylia path is.. you will get collateral plat when farming.  <br />
<br />
If you farm in AC, you may well MAKE 100k+ in just crap loot (junk weapons in there sell for 120-150pp each) and named drops... which makes it by far the best place to farm (in my opinion).  In farming acrylia to go from 202 to 210, i made over 23K.. plus kept an acrylic bp for my alt... (and gave away over 1k of weapons to a friend that was there for a bit just hanging out).<br />
<br />
Farming acrylia in TM, you'll be getting windstones (yeh, not that neat anymore), and other luclin gems.<br />
<br />
Never farmed in SD, but i'm sure there's little pp drops there also that could add up to a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>yawp64</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">About my assumption on the 20 combine per skill up ---<br />
<br />
I pulled that number from the numerous posts GM fletchers have made in this forum recording their skill-up experience to 250. It's a nice round number that is in the ballpark for a lot of people. I used it just as a way to calculate the general amount of materials and plat I would need to accumulate to accomplish this project.<br />
<br />
My personal experience with the RNG is acrimonious to say the least. I fully expect Lady Luck to treat me as shabbily as she has in the past.<br />
<br />
Good luck, Fletchers!<br />

PS -- I've been farming acrylia like a mad man. The grimlings whimper when I zone in these days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure where you came up with 35pp per combine from.  I'm looking at Steel Guardian Arrows ( http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9627&amp;menustr= ) and it looks like that requires 2 small bricks of steel and one large brick of steel.  That comes out to be 2 * 6 + 55 = 77pp.  Maybe you were giving the average cost after you sell the ones you make to vendor?  Or am I looking at the wrong recipe?  I ask because i'm karana and will be doing the 202 to 240 path soon.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

That means that at 16pp x 40 combines x 48 skill ups to go from 202 to 250 im looking at @ 31,000pp.  Ouch, i dont know anyone on my server who has that kind of money, LOL!<br />

Another note, sell back on these arrows is nominal so dont plan on selling to vendors and getting much back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A Chunk of Taelosian Rock to Imildu in Abysmal yields 2 taelosian stones (You can do this yourself, but even after several stacks of rocks I was still only averaging 1.5-1.7 stones per combine. ) Taelosian stone + water + file = 2x serrated arrowheads. Serrated arrowheads has recipes that trivial at 212 and 227. They sell on NPC vendors for ~3pp and on bazaar traders for anywhere from 5-500pp. <br />
<br />
What I did was pick up any stones off vendors I could find, plus buying up any in the bazaar that cost less than 150p. Once I got 10 or so saved up I'd take em to Imildu, turn em into stones, then make them into arrowheads and I'd have 2 stacks of attempts. The arrows are crap but they're cheap and every rock gives you 4 attempts. I went from 202 to 220 in about 5 sessions with these, my latest being when I spent 2200p on 22 rocks. I turned that into 84 arrowheads and from these got from 211 to 220. This was probably a lucky skillup rate, but regardless, it would have cost me 3 times as much to do the same number of darkwood bows, and that's assuming no failures.<br />

My int is 355 and I think that makes a huge difference.  When I was skilling up for the 8th shawl I only had about 290 int.  Can't say enough about how much the high int has made a difference.

Skillups with these items come *VERY* fast (7 in 96 combines at skill 218-225) <br />

Do the freebie quest in abysmal sea then pick up some chunks of taelosian stone (I got a batch for 50p each) in the baz.<br />
<br />
Start refining your own (I was getting an average of 1:2 --I expect to get 1:4 eventually) then make the arrowheads (anotehr 1:2 split) so for 50p I was getting 4 arrowheads.  Use wood shafts, ceramic vanes, large knocks, and I was running ~17p per combine.  The arrows sell back for 6 gold and change and the yield is 10 so I got back ~6 plat per. That come to 11p net per combine.  with 305 dex  I got 7 skillups in 96 combines (best **** run I've had in forever) which comes to about 150p per point. <br />
<br />
I aint complaining at all given that I was spending more than that PER COMBINE with bows.</div></div><hr />
