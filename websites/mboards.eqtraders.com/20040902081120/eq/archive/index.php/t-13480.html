<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yandros</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I finally ran JC to 250 Friday night!  However, in finishing up after the last patch, it seemed like the  prices on the rings and things I made to get to 250 had been lowered.<br />
<br />
While I did not write down prices before the patch it seemed like I lost approximately 5pp on every successful combine and sell back.  After the patch I was losing approximately 10pp.<br />
<br />
Did anyone else notice this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tunee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I remember reading awhile back that they nerfed the sell-back price on enchanted jewelcraft stuffs so people werent making money off of it. Now tis same price to sell enchanted and non-enchanted i think. Good for us non-chanter types as I myself was worried about having to log onto chanter, chant metals, log on druid make stuff/sell, log on chanter etc etc...especially since i didnt have the patience to enchant everything when i got my enchanter to 250 anyways!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tingteng</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did 2-230 and Trophy friday/saturday and the total cost was near 30k at 230-240 wis......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>nightjackal77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actual I in process of skilling from 223 atm to 250....all sell back prices for non-enchanted are about 10pp lower then cost. ALL enchanted metal items are selling back at about 10pp above cost.<br />
<br />
So far to get to 223 it has cost me 3kpp.<br />
<br />
It is very much worth enchanting the metals still to skill up if you trying to break even. I am estimating that I will lose about 5-6kpp by the time I hit 250.<br />
<br />
That btw is selling to Pok vendors with 183 cha.<br />
<br />
GL hoping to finish JC tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Doebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't know about velium and platinum jewerly yet (I'm both looking forward to and dreading them) but up through gold jewelry, enchanted and non-enchanted sell back for the same cost, a little below material costs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless they changed it with this last patch, enchanting the metal means nothing.  Enchanted items are selling for LESS THAN cost; and, barring they changed it last patch, enchanted items were actually selling for LESS THAN non-enchanted items... so it was worse if you chanted the metal first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darwa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">at sunday the prices were back to normal again, skilled with enchanted platinum from 225 to 236 and spent around 200pp.<br />
<br />
so back to enchanting metals again, unless they changed it already again...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>twistle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">went from 178 to 247 last night, enchanted almost everything, with enchanted bars it cost me under 2k (accounted for by failures, each combine was a small profit) unenchanted would have cost alot more, they were each a small loss.<br />

(and made GM trophy! woot!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">that should be worth an emergency patch!!!!<br />
<br />
.. i'm better now /not really</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>solithan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just drop 10k and got 21 points up from 200. 10p loss per attempt all unenchanted because i'm not a chanter. avging around 35 attempts per skill up.<br />
<br />
The 10p loss adds up, I did my first run up to 200 long before the change and was maintaining break even, not much liking the change but ah well.<br />
