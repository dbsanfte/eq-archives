<br />
19ac 6wis 20m 5sta 35hp 5svC   2str 3wt<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
25ac 5wis 30m      30hp 5svAll      3wt<br />
<br />
The first is the SS armor (Akkirus' Bracelet of the Risen), the second is DE Infused imbued (Dark Price Reagent Bracer).<br />
<br />
Debating trying to get the DE bracer for her, but looking at the two, they are *very* close from what I can tell of a clerics needs (paladin myself).<br />
<br />
[-] Post-255wis, so the 5wis 30mana is more mana than 6wis 20mana, so pro DE.<br />
[-] 25ac better than 19ac, so pro DE.<br />
[-] 5sta 35hp is far better than 30hp, so pro SS.<br />
[-] 5svAll is better than 5svC, so pro DE.<br />
[-] 2str is better than no str, but also not of primary importance (although DEs are weak as anything).  Pro SS<br />
<br />
The DE has more mana, but not by much (~6mana, I think).  Has better saves (more coverage).  Has worse HP (~30 fewer, I think).  Has better AC for when ya do get hit.<br />
<br />
But which really is better?  Ignoring costs, ignoring difficult to get, etc ... which raw bracer is better for a 65 cleric?<br />
<br />
Any advice would be appreciated, thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I decided to stick with the Underfoot, because of the those extra stats. =)<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, now I look like Captain America....hehe, part Underfoot platemail (which is red), Akkirus' gaunts and legs (which are blue), and a Thurg (silver white) BP.  :D <br />
<br />
I hope that helps. =)<br />
