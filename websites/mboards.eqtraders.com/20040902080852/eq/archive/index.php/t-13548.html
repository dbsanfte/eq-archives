<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you're looking for big money fletching isnt it. Rangers buy most of the high end arrows and with endless quiver they buy one or 2 of each. The PoP bows fetch a price fo roughly twice the cost of materials. Since there is a (roughly) 50% chance of success on them you just about break even. The next expansion (GoD) may change all that but right now fletching isn't a very profittable trade skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Osprey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your question isn't really making much sense.<br />
<br />
The subject says &quot;Quickest and easiest way to 200&quot;. The answer is &quot;go make arrows, which will get you to 200 easily&quot;.<br />
<br />
The poll says &quot;What's the market...?&quot;<br />
<br />
The answer is &quot;There is no market for arrows. Rangers can easily get the one arrow they need.&quot;<br />
<br />
As for bows, see above. It's very very limited, and more so when you consider most guilds have skilled fletchers and that there are a huge number of skilled fletchers now due to the tradeskill earring and the shawl quest. Odds are you know someone who can do the combine for you.</div></div><hr />

There is a half decent market for arrows on the rathe, however the only ones that sell relialby and steadaly are the various substance types and/or long range silver tips. While endless quiver reduces the end game requirement for these, it does take a whack of AA points to get. Casual players still need arrows. Trick is don't overprice, make a reasonable profit and they will sell faster than you can make them...usually. Another good money maker for me has been Nightmare bows, but if i cannot get my price, i don't sell them. So you have to willing to sit for a while sometimes. No quick way..</div></div><hr />
