<br />
<br />
I'm interested in selling these items in the bazaar and was wondering what they tend to sell for.  It's hard to gauge their price because no one ever seems to be selling any, maybe the fact that they're lore having something to do with it.  Any info is much appreciated.  =)<br />

Thanks,<br />

I've only seen one of the Medicine Bags for sale once and it was only for a few hudred plat.  No idea if that was high or not, but it wasn't there next time I had looked.<br />
<br />
Good luck.  Many a Shaman across Norrath were pleased when these were introduced.</div></div><hr />
