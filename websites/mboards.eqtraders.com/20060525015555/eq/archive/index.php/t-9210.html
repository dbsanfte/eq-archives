<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rendael Brigh</div><div class="date">07-27-2003, 06:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since I am not elemental flagged, and wish to make armors from these planes, I am seeking interested parties to share the sales of armor successes.<br />
<br />
I have bits and pieces of some needed temper components, but not enough to put together one type.<br />
<br />
I hear metallic substance may not be easy to come by and / or rare. This is the only part I am missing for Inferno chain / plate.<br />
<br />
I have a couple liquified earth sitting in the bank, waiting for granite chips and earth mephit blood to meet up with some more immaculate steel.<br />
<br />
I have several air mephit bloods, waiting for fog fragments, gaseous condensate, and wind metal.<br />
<br />
Fire mephit blood seems to be rather common these days, and I have several in stock. Molten ore is the same as well.<br />
<br />
What I would really like to buy / be supplied to share in is components to make the Farwater chain / plate armors.<br />
I have none of these components needed:<br />
E'cian Ice, water mephit blood, shimmering fish gills, soapstone.<br />
<br />
<br />
In a way, this is sort of a self-quest for me as well.</div></div><hr />
