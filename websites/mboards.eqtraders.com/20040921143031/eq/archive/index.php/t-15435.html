<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am ready to make Celestial Essence and I was in shock to see that the possible ingredients vary so much. I am into buying the easiest, yet cheapest ingredients.<br />
What do you recommend I use to make CE which can be easy to buy from a vendor, yet cheap?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Scent of Marr is AFAIK the only component that you can make CE with thats vendor sold.  The rest are random drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree that Scent of Marr is the only vendor-purchaseable ingredient I know of.<br />
<br />
I buy mine from a chick in the left out building next to the last Inn in East Commons before you zone to WC on the right. Seems like I pay around 34pp for a stack of them. I've read that you can buy it in the PoK as well, but EC is quicker to me, as a Druid, than the lag in PoK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Scent of Marr, poison merchant in PoK.<br />
Celetial solvent, DE spell ingredient merchant in PoK<br />
<br />
Both situated in the western building by the fishing pond. Easiest merchants for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Turlo Lomon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Best way to make it...<br />
<br />
Step 1)<br />
Buy all the supplies for the quantity you need.<br />
<br />
Step 2)<br />
Teach a three year old (ok, ok three and a half!) to click the combine and auto inventory buttons.<br />
<br />
Step 3)<br />
Make a sandwich and enjoy a movie.</div></div><hr />

You forgot to mention the bribe to keep them motivated. Candy is great if you are not the parent, and don't have to deal with them hyped-up at bedtime.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You people are sick, forcing your kids to sweatshop for you. :)<br />
<br />
Don't make me put in a math problem every 10th combine! :zombie: <br />
<br />
See yall at Fan Faire.</div></div><hr />

ACK! No math! <br />

Begone, foul spirit!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">From my days in Scarlet Desert, I found that basically any research component drop from the revenant camp on the plateau could be turned into CE. I just used to take a bunch of solvents along and combine on the hoof. <br />
<br />
However: I did find yesterday that runes that I'd have SWORN could once be used for CE now don't work though... I looked in the new UI and only about 3 runes were listed. <br />
<br />
(I couldn't be bothered to port to PoK and waste another 3 minutes zoning, so I gathered up some components from the bazaar vendors, thereby freeing up precious selling-space which could contain something more interesting... blah...blah....)</div></div><hr />
