<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>paalrh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This guide was made in tought of making you ( the avrage Eq player) more self sufficient and able to survive on your own. basically it will learn you how to make banquet size meals to take with you on your adventures. This guide was made as I worked my way along. Also due to an unfortunat scissor throwing accident by a friend of mine my hand is injured so you will see some strange abriviations and typos. <br />
<br />
<br />
My stats when i did this was 223 int and 135 cha and i used no kind of geerlock device.<br />
I had just reach my 20th season with my Erudian Necrmancer. <br />
I have tried to keep my movement to PoK ( Plane of Knowldge) so i easily could go adventuring if the chance arose or buy stuff coming up for auction. also selling ur excess food becomes much easier.<br />
<br />
Note:<br />
Before starting this load up a good list of your favorite mp3s or turn on a radio/ TV. Watching my fav music videos on my second stationary computer was a life saver and made the time fly by. <br />
<br />
<br />
baking: <br />
well my target here is reaching about level 135. why you might ask ? well thats when fish rolls become trivial so basically you can stop at the moment when ur fails stop exceeding ur successes.<br />
<br />
1 - 83 fish fillets. <br />
You need:<br />
jug of Sauces ( 1 silver from Culkin Ironstove at neg101, pos275 )<br />
Fresh Fish ( 2 silver 6 copper from Ramos Jerwan at neg 17, pos 1436)<br />
<br />
first we head over to mister Culkin. we buy a spit (2 gold 9 copper) and a bunch of sauces. 11 stack to be precise ( note: its better to buy to much sauce then to litle. try to estimate how much u will need compared to how nuch i used and y int).  Then we head over to mister ramos. where we buy fresh fish. The erea around mister Ramos is going to be pretty familiar when ur finished with this guide =). <br />
<br />
A few tips when starting the combines. Open two bags in ur iventory in addition to the spit. Make sure one is filled with sauce and 1 with fish. then place them close to the spit window ( 1 at the left and one at the right). Now press and hold ctrl and use ur mouse to move 1 from the left 1 from teh right then combine and repeat. holding ctrl will automaticly choose 1 item from a stack when clicking on teh stack with your mouse. U can choose to turn  on auto drop and throw away teh few successes u have to start with or get a open slot to put them in. <br />
<br />
after 11 stack combines ( thats 220 combines) i had gotten 80 skill ups  6 stacks of fish fillets and it cost me 220 silver for the sauce and 572 silver for the fish making it a total of 792 silver or ruffly 8 plat. I know i said i was gonna keep it up until i hiy 83 but hey im to lazy to walk back for more sauce for 3 measly skill ups. so now i moved on to the next step<br />
<br />
80 - 135 Fish Rolls.<br />
You need:<br />
Bat Wings ( 1 silver from Darius Gandril at pos 54, pos 1529 )<br />
Fresh Fish ( 2 silver 6 copper from Ramos Jerwan at neg 17, pos 1436)<br />
<br />
We are now starting to reach our goal of endles supplies of banquet size meals. btw darius is the dark elf in the shop at the wall in the same era as the fish man.  After 6 stack cmbines it became clear that skill up werent coming as fast.  Was pretty slow at first put picked up once i hit 90. doh still not matching the 7 skill ups pr stack of the fish fillets.  only reaching to 111 after 6 stacks. Saw a small  increase in sucessrate at 115 and 123. after 10 stak combines i had reached 132 skill and decided to call it a end my sucess rate was acceptable and didnt want to start on a new stack combine.  so this cost me 200 silver for the bat wings and 520 silver for the fish making a total of 720 silver or 7plat 2 gold. <br />
<br />
so in total i spent about 15 plat to get 132 skill ups. which in my book aint that bad. now you have a never ending supply of fish rolls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hehe alts still eating fish rolls and patty melts.  eni has moved on to mtps but think i will make some more fish rolls now.  they last longer than the extra marmalade snadwiches.  thanks for the tip about jug of sauce and fish.  had stuck with fish rolls cause it was so close together.  even i can walk from one end of pok to the other though. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Footsore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Great guide!<br />
<br />
Just one thing I'd add if you aren't going to drop the finished product on the ground:<br />
<br />
In addition to opening the TS container and the bags of components, open your inventory window and position the auto-equip area somewhere convenient. Drop the finished product into the auto-equip area. It's a much bigger target and you don't have to find an empty slot to put them in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i make an autoinventory button on a pad i dont use often and then just press 1.  works well too for when i open up almost all my bags.  making mtps i end up with most all bags open and very little room.</div></div><hr />
