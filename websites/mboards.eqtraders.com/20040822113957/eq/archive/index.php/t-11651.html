<br />
As a behind the scenes tradeskiller since pre-kunark, I've decided to try and take a more active role in the community.<br />
I've been mulling over something in broader's diaries that some have eluded to:  Making brewing casks.<br />
&quot;Halflings and elves hold the secrets to making aged oaken casks.&quot;<br />
<br />
I may be reading too much into this, but just in case, here are some ideas.<br />
<br />
First RL situation: How to make a brew barrew/Cask<br />
(Yes, I watch the learning channel)<br />
Old style, done over an open fire (smithing)<br />
Use Oak or wooden staves, and start hammering consecutively smaller metal hoops around them (with it all places around the fire to heat the wood)<br />
Don't need to get too deep into it. All that really matters is tools involved:<br />
-hammer<br />
-metal hoops/bands<br />
-wood (oak) staves<br />
-open fire<br />
-water (sloshed onto the inside of the wood surrounding fire so as to keep it from burning and making it more plyable)<br />
<br />
Now for the in-game mechanics.<br />
The obvious is oak first of all.<br />
We have recently seen that Shadewood Bow Staff + Whittling Blade = shadewood clasps, indicating fletching = a form of woodworking.<br />
It may be possible to combine a whittling blade with any of the following:<br />
-oak bowstaff<br />
-branch of sylvain oak<br />
-branch of planar oak<br />
-possibly that Faydwer twig that has been a ground spawn in GFay as well.<br />
-(did I miss anything?)<br />
<br />
Maybe we don't even need to go that far, and just use the branches, bowstaff directly.<br />
<br />
The mention of halflings and elves to me implies that the metal banding will either be mithril(wood/high elves), High Quality Ore (halflings) or Adamantite (just to include Dark Elves), so we would either use:<br />
-*metal* bits<br />
-*metal* boning<br />
-sheet of *metal*<br />
-AGAIN, to avoid reading too much into it, maybe it's regular metal used....<br />
<br />
Other possible components necessary would be:<br />
-smithy hammer (to hammer rings/metal around oak)<br />
-flask of water<br />
-morning dew (just because of the elves, and for posterity)<br />
<br />
The obvious permutations are huge.<br />
<br />
Then again, maybe it's just a refference to the brew barrels on location.  Who knows, but a thought worth considering since there are confirmed unknown recepies.<br />
<br />
Won't be online for a bit, but watching threads, wanted to add some thoughts.</div></div><hr />
