<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am 210 in Fletching with a geerlock tool.  In my other tradeskills I noticed some 250 combines are very easy to make, others are not and one tends to fail even if 250 skill.  I haven't noticed a good way to determine how difficult a combine is after it is marked 250+.  In my experience that 250+ can vary greatly.<br />
<br />
When is it probable that I may make a planar bow, like a nightmare bow?  Is this one of those difficult combines that people tend to fail on, or one that people tend to make once they are over 200 or so.<br />
<br />
In fletching, what items have other found to be easy or hard that are over 250?</div></div><hr />
