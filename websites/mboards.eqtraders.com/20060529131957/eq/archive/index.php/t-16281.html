<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EQScott</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know that the Solstice Components is old news, but I made this spreadsheet a while back to help manage how many items I needed.  The list on EQTraders tells you the minimum number of items needed for a combine, but since some combines are not 1 to 1, you end up with a lot of extra components (especially for MTP).  This way you can play with the numbers and see how many components you need before you start and minimize the number of ingredients you need to buy.<br />
<br />
This is more of tool for people who are already experienced in making solstice components, not a beginner's tool.<br />
<br />
For this to work, there are some things you need to know:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Enter the amount of components you want to make in the yellow box only... don't touch anything else.<br />
 The results of the subcombines are in bold<br />
 the subcombines are tiered, just click on the pluses and minuses to expand the selections<br />
 the totals are located at the bottom of each worksheet<br />
 The trivials are listed next to each combine result<br />
 The pricing isn't done, it's simply a way to ballpark what you'll need for vendor bought items<br />
 <br />
<br />
I was going to give this to RPG Expert, but then I figured that this site has given way more time and effort to tradeskills than they ever will.<br />
<br />
I don't claim to be an Excel master, so if you guys want to steal it, make improvements, etc... feel free.</div></div><hr />
