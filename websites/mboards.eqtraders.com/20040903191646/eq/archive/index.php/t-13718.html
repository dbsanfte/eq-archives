<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">having gmed baking several weeks ago i was waiting to have an &quot;extra&quot; 5k to spend on the seal.  well i got lots of new gear upgrades and was broke again.  then i was told to start my epic so decided to do a picnic run for some cash as the wizard epic takes 1800pp.  well being bored i was chatting more than making picnics (bad eni!) and started a conversation with another erudite baker who was a 65 enchanter.  talk for a bit about baking and picnics (didn't like the subcombines) and i mention i'm waiting on some money to make an attempt at my trophy.  <br />
<br />
&quot;follow me and keep it a secret.&quot;  ok so i wonder if she has a couple of the gems i need to get the seal made in bank.  she turns around and hands me 5k for the seal.  :eek: :faint: :hyper: WOW!  i'm absolutely floored.  ok now i can't move and had to take off my -8 str rings to put the money in the bank.  run to bazaar.  find a trader with one for 5k.  buy it.  run back to pok.  combine in my very own spit.  SUCCESS!  :D send a tell saying thanks again.  gave her the last 50 combines of picnic combines pre-made just needing combine clicked.  read through my chart on jc trivials to give her a progression all the way to 250 from 100.  (yes the 65 enchanter had 98 jc.  a very special person.)  added to friend's list and had a party.  :D  <br />
<br />
now i have a new frined a trophy and fewer picncis to make.  :)  the best part was &quot;plat doesn't mean a lot to me, friends do.&quot;  (maybe not exact quote but close.)  anyway.  thank you much.  if you're reading this you know who you are.  it made my trophy a lot more special to have gotten it this way.  252 versus 250 isn't nearly this special.  <br />
<br />
anyway thats my spoon story.  i chose to share the whole story instead of just spoon woot.  i love people like this.  they make me hand out picnics to newbies i run accross and convince me this game has people besides loot whores and griefers.  i have a good server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>iasmin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">God I love hearing stories like this. It makes me smile. I still haven't gotten up the courage to try making my spoon. Too jittery and not easy to have someone hold your hand while you do it. Is it crazy that I want to make my spoon in a particular location? Where did you make your spoon (anyone who has one)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">its not the location.  its using the lucky spit.  :)</div></div><hr />

The first time I managed to save and buy a seal, I went into East Freeport, the location of my first batch of fish rolls...<br />
<br />
Failure.<br />
<br />
<br />
The second time, I bought my seal, and zoned into Shadowhaven and found the oven I had made most of my picnics on...<br />
<br />
Nope, Nada, Failure.<br />
<br />
The third time, I bought the seal, zoned to SH, found the closest oven, and tada, I had the spoon.<br />
<br />
It's all about luck and Gnome sacrifices.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did both my brewing trophy attempts in Kaladim. Mostly because I like the city, and there's NO lag at all. It's very strange to find 2 people in the zone. *shrug*<br />
<br />
My baking spoon I did in SH only because I happened to be bound right at an oven, and didn't want all my buffs to fade while travelling somewhere else! hehehe I know buffs don't matter when you're 250 already, but hey, I had em, might as well do it eh?</div></div><hr />
