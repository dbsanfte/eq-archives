<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bregalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a 'gut' feeling that finding any Fiend guts is not gonna be easy, given that all other Obsidianwood components go on bazaar for dirt cheap.<br />
<br />
Any info on what exact mobs in PoFire drop them?  <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nimphe Wildwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Demon mobs (think Tim Curry's The Lord of Darkness from the movie Legend).  And those mobs are raid encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Galain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep.  Fennin encounter or Blazzax only.  I would not ever expect to see any for sale really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Doremi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wouldn't it be nice if the Diablo-looking mobs in Miragul's (Sol C as well, maybe) dropped them as well?</div></div><hr />

Well unless they could move those mobs over into PoP, I don't think that will be happening any time soon.</div></div><hr />

*sigh* can't even buy the things on the Rathe, the guilds that have the ability to collect them restrict there sale. I have near a stack of the cam's and half a dozen of the stave's just taking up bank space.</div></div><hr />

You might as well destroy them now and get your bag space back. Given what drops then and the number of said mobs you are not likely to ever see any for sale. I'd say total between the 1 named and the mobs in the fennin event your looking at a dozen mobs or so total every 3-4 days. Any guild capable of getting the guts is definitely going to be able to make thier own bows for thier own use or for sale as compleated items and there's 0 chance of an exp group ever getting any.</div></div><hr />

ROFL umm no, these are actully financing my equipment upgrades at the moment. The molten cams sell for 3-5k each and they sell steady. Not had much luck on the staves, bit they run form 100-1k plat at the moment. The molten ore is rare but i am in no hurry so i wait till the price drops then snap it up. I have a guildy who tinkers the bolts and gears for me free, when i supply the parts. They are not quite triv to him so he is skilling up for free on them. Good deal all around.<br />
<br />
But i still lust after that bow....................:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Osprey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The honest truth is that they're being bought by people that have no clue how few fiend guts drop in a week. They're hoping to find some, not realizing it will be a very long time before they do.<br />
<br />
Any guild that could get them and spare them would just make a bow and sell that.</div></div><hr />
