<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, my firend got to look over my computer, and is not sure whether or not the HD is salvageable.  So, I decided that I would just get him the components to upgrade my pathetic 800mhz and 512 ram.  I have a nice new mobo with a 2.6 processor, 1gig of ram, cooling fan, power supply, 40 gig HD, and a XFX geforce 5200 with 256mb on order.  Hopefully, it will be shipping out today to arrive for him to put together on wednesday.  The cost for the upgrade was not too bad, minus th $17 for 2day shipping, and the $30 rebate, it's costing me less than $500.:D <br />
<br />
All I had to do was bribe my friend with a chocolate cheesecake and some Guiness to put it together for me.<br />
<br />
So, now, I am sitting and waiting (kind of like the anticipation of going to the doctors next week with my wife).  I am giddy.  I know I could have just replaced the HD for about $60, but now I will be able to 2 box the second account that we got for the wife on one computer(when she is not playing with me using her laptop):hyper: :hyper: :hyper: :hyper: :hyper:</div></div><hr />

<br />
They did not ship the stuff yesterday, and then, could not change it to ship via next day today :steamed: <br />
<br />
Now, I have to wait until the weekend until I can get my computerback (datenight with the wife Thursday as I have an evening job on the weekends), and then, I won't even be able to patch and play until monday night. :steamed: :steamed: <br />

Urrgghh... yes, I must be addicted.  There are worse things to be addicted to, though.</div></div><hr />
