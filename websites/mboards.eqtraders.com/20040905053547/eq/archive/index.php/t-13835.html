Presumably the weapons with the regular nihilite, and the shimmering steel, will be superior in quality to these -- and the difficulty/rarity of those drops will probably be obscene.</div></div><hr />

The weapons you mentioned above do NOT have two augmentation slots, these do.  So given that fact, these GOD items are infact better in the long run.<br />

So you can have a two handed blade with Flowing Thought II and Anger III (type 7 and type 4  Augs) which for say a Shadowknight is a pretty darn nice weapon.  Until Gates, there are NO tradable multi-slotted blades in the game AFAIK.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">While I appreciate the enthusiasm for new weapons, these are pretty bad for the plat cost. The ability to add a type 4 augment does very little, due to the bad damage delay ratio, and lack of hit points. No one able to afford any real augments would put them in these, with considerably better weapons available much cheaper. The tae ew weapons are MUCH better in comparison. Given the gear which is available to even new servers, these are rather poorly designed when you consider the price of the store bought ingredients. On an established server, these MIGHT be desired by untwinked players in their 20's, if their cost was significantly lower.  Hopefully these can be adjusted, in terms of quality and cost to produce.</div></div><hr />

tae ew has 34/35 dmg/delay ratio and half the str.<br />
pale velium has 24/30 dmg/delay lower but bastard swords are lower than 2handed normall and no hp.  They are for the 50+ crowd, so expect the Recommended Level restrictions to start there.  recommended he says.  meaning at 40 you can equip it.  would prefer the dmg uped to 30 to get a 1 dmg/delay weapon but still not bad.  needs sta though if it doesn't give hp.  hadn't seen that.  might lower price on tae ew blood though.<br />
<br />
edit i hadn't seen the loss in hp till it was pointed out.  man i am just not a tank class hehe.  that is a considerable bit of downgrade.  it still looks mostly store bought instead of farmed though.  that is something i guess.  :o</div></div><hr />

The stats are pretty inconsequential compared to the loss of raw hp and dps. You could not sell this sword for what it costs to make it on Drinal. Theres no need for a recommended level on it in the least, its that mediocre. I wonder if the damage was supposed to be 34? :p Is it even flagged as magic (ie, able to hit will o wisps?)<br />

Prepare to be dissapointed. I would be very suprised if there are any tradeskill weapons out of GoD that are anything much if at all above a 1/1 ratio. There sure as hell isn't going to be weapons who's ratio can compete ok with everything that existed pre-PoP (including Emp/Cursed/Seru drops) and everything tier3 and below in PoP.

<br />
The only REAL benefit of the blade is an additional type *7* slot - the same slot every piece of dropped armour has.  Assuming you have EVERY type 7 slot filled and could use this, you probably picked up a better weapon at some point.<br />
<br />
And you can get that extra type 7 slot in exchange for... wait for it... doing 81 percent of the DPS of a WMBS (at 65 based on magic number) which is about 6k in the bazaar. At 51 this weapon would do 83 percent of a WMBS assuming that damage scaled when you are below recommended level - which it doesn't.<br />
<br />
You buy weapons for DPS, then you look at the DPS and when you've done that, check the DPS.  There's no type 7 augment that will increase your DPS by 20 percent (and if there was you could put it on any piece of armour you own).<br />

Rayin Yvain talks about making SK armor to me and she says something along the lines of when you find a piece of muramite metal, a muramite metal armor mold, she can make you some armor with the metal infused with Nalasrine's compound.  I don't think that the compound is truly tradeskill related, but more like Bor Warhammer's quasi-tradeskill combine with the requisite plat sink and stuff.  Seeing as no one has found any muramite metal or molds yet, I have a feeling that this stuff is probably from the higher tiers of GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Eidolon Faer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Okay, first of all...<br />
<br />
Remember there are two different &quot;levels&quot; of tradeskill drops.  The level 45-50 wimp mobs drop the following:<br />
<br />
Raw Pale Nihilite  (JC and Smithing)<br />
Aligned Ore  (Smithing)<br />
Raw Dark Matter  (Tinkering)<br />
Hynid Mane  (Tailoring)<br />
Hynid Blood  (Tailoring)<br />
Taelosian Rock (Fletching)<br />
<br />
A direcharm Enchanter can farm this junk all day long with minimal risk, and get experience and several quest drops along the way.<br />
<br />
I have not seen ANY sources for &quot;Shimmering Steel&quot; or &quot;Shimmering Nihilite&quot;.  If I were to hazard a guess, I would assume that these items drop off more-difficult critters deeper in the expansion.<br />
<br />
I would therefore also assume that weapons made from these higher-level materials would have greatly superior stats.  Frankly, I'm rather encouraged that weapons made from drops off such weak MOBs have stats as good as they do.  It's a far cry from the crappiness that is Fiery Ore, and is arguably a better return-on-inventment than even Black Acrylia weaponry.  Akheva Blood drops off FAR tougher creatures than drop these things.<br />
<br />
Sadly, slapping a rec. level of 50 on these weapons is going to trash the market value for them completely.<br />
<br />
Oh, on a side note, while you're farming the ore and gems, save an (undamaged) Turepta Shell from the turtles, you'll need it to quest the reinforced JC kit for making the inlay kits.  And have a friendly jeweler handy.</div></div><hr />

Required levels on a weapon that has recomended levels will indeed reduce the DMG # on the weapon.

The numbers do indeed drop when you look at the weapon. It still works at its best dmg/dly. A good example of this is all the new berserkers running around with the WMSB that is 31/28 dmg/dly (if memory serves me). It is recomended lvl, but you get the 31/28 (except for damage cap) all the way from lvl 1.<br />

<br />
The other Pale Velium stuff needs an *upgrade* -- instead what we're getting is a nerf on something that is okay as-is?

I sincerely doubt (Going 2hdr as I live and breath them),  if it isn't better then a SEWs then no one in a Hgh level guild will really use one, and it just the high level raiders farming plat again, like it is for the most part for ornate armor.<br />
