<br />
Where did those of you who have your gm smithing trophies make the final combine?<br />
<br />
Being a wood elf i tried and failed #'s 7 and 8 in Kelethin, hoping for a little hometown advantage but that didnt seem to help. <br />
<br />
I failed the previous 2 in shadowhaven while in the midst of making sickles<br />
<br />
The last 4 tries have been at skill 243 abd using a geerlok hammer which should put me over the skill cap no prob. <br />
<br />
I realize im a victim of the crappy RNG but help me out and let me know where i should blow up my next attempts :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Level 65 High Elven Paladin.<br />
<br />
1.  Saved up enough to make 10 attempts at a smithing trophy,<br />
2.  Have a blacksmithing skill of 219 (221 now....had 219 on my attempts),<br />
3.  Tried 9 combines in Kaladim, all failed,<br />
4.  Tried one more time in Felwithe, success.<br />
<br />
Was I a loony for making the attempts with a smithing skill of 219?  Some may think so.<br />
<br />
I chalked it up to &quot;homefield advantage&quot;  :rolleyes:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gurck-Quellious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I succeeded my first try in Thurgadin at 229 + geerlok.  Prior to my baker's trophy I hadn't failed a trophy yet in Thurg.  I love the zone, the atmosphere, the memories.  So far I'm 4/7 on trophies there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naelia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I had 3 seals, combined them all in POK at skill 234 (+5%):<br />

(swears, sweats, hits combine, shuts eyes)<br />

Success!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">At 199 pottery,  I threw the mounted gems and clay and mana into the PoK wheel, and it crashed and burned all over the floor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I cursed, muttered, and didn't look at it again until a few weeks later.   Went to SH, all the way in the back where i went 0-199 pottery one night over a year prior, and SUCCESS on the seal.<br />
<br />
Fired it, and (despite my expectations), succeeded.<br />
<br />
<br />
Went to the shop belonging to my dear halfling buddy, by the entrance to Shortytown in SH, asked to use his oven, and made my very own Bakers Spoon on my first seal.  :-)<br />
<br />
I danced for days.    Equipped it for months, over a year, and finally replaced it.   :-(<br />
<br />
Grimina used to sacrifice her dairy spoon whenever someone would attempt the baking trophy.    Maybe you can find someone to do a similar bit of superstition for you?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I replaced it with a Talisman of Benevolance.<br />

I'm looking at making a Ceramic totem of the Rathe to replace that now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>rassy fleetfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks for the ideas..maybe i'll give Thurg a try since i've blown up quite enough trpphies everywhere else. <br />
<br />
Amazing to hear so many made their trophies that close to 200 since i know so many who failed a lot at 250.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Any forge. Doesn't matter where. Made smithing trophy at 233 skill, in 3 attempts, using bazaar forge.<br />
<br />
My druid made his brewing trophy at 200 skill, on his second try.<br />
<br />
You are getting hosed by the RNG. Thats all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Skyllar Un'Var</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well I got bored one day, and figured I'd make myself a smithing trophy.  My Smithing at the time was 223 (plus Geerlok).  <br />
<br />
I was in the Bazaar and found the Artisans Seal for sale - whipped the Smithy Hammer out of my bank and ran over to the Forge in the back.<br />
<br />
Success on the first try!<br />
<br />
Now... I'm too scared to make any other trophies, because I know that even if I have a 250 Skill + Geerlok, I'll fail 20 times because I didn't fail for Smithing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please don't be. I thought the same way after getting my first trophy at first try. It really is random and over the long run it will smooth out. I made all my 7 trophies and it averaged 50%. I made 3 of them on first try with skills ranging from 220 to 250. 3 trophies took 2 tries and one, smithing one, took me 5 tries, grrrr. So on the average it was about 1 out of 2. Don't give up. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zdapus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have made eight trophies on multiple characters.  While my sense of superstition has diminished over that time I still have a few left.  <br />
<br />
One, I don't make a combine in a heavily populated zone.  The bazaar is almost always laggy and while PoK isn't as bad, things get screwy when folks are firing off mgbs at the bank.  <br />
<br />
Two, failures seem to come in pairs too frequently for me to believe in true randomness.  I do some cheap combines untill I get a double failure then make the money combine.<br />
<br />
Three, prepping for multiple attempts increases your chance of success on the first attempt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>rassy fleetfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well as an update, and thanks for all the replies..i made 3 more seals and went to Thurg since so many had good luck there. I popped the first one in the forge..took a deep breath and combined. I sat there for a minute wondering what was on my cursor since im not used to seeing anything there..and it was the gm hammer! weeee! <br />
<br />
so 9 tries total, between skills 196 and 248, all with geerlok and i finally got it. Now i just need those 2 more points to hit 250. Then i can truly be the most useless smith in the server..hooray for wood elves :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've already figured out where I'm going to do the combines for my trophy when I get high enough to try (and have the plat to buy the Artisan's Seal):<br />
<br />
First attempt: Shadow Haven.<br />
<br />
Second attempt, if that doesn't succeed: Felwithe.<br />
<br />
Third and subsequent attempts: Thurgadin.</div></div><hr />
