I've been told it's based on your home town, not diety, yet the one in my home town says &quot;I am not the one to whom you owe allegiance&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm a wood elf agnostiv rogue.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Never mind, I found another.  (Dummy me)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Do you have to have Gates in order to use the tributes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, I have all the expansions and I found another tribute person who accepted me.<br />
<br />
BTW - made poisons are donateable!  :)<br />
<br />
29 points for my Nemanotyc (sp?) poisons...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LoL.  I think you missed the point of my question.  Is a person required to have the Gates expansion to be able to use the tribute system?  I imagine that they would, but just want to confirm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know honestly, I pre-ordered GoD, so it was active the first time I logged in after it went live.<br />
<br />
Anyone here not have GoD and try it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Serenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's a Gates feature, you need the expansion to use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I thought that that would be the case.  I do not have it, and am not sure I am going to be getting it any time soon.  The only thing I can see it offering me are the tributes, and the TS zone.  The other zones I can't get into, and I have yet to go exploring in any of the PoP and LoY zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Anaxo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I tried out the tribute master the day Gates went live without having bought the expansion; nothing showed up for me, so you definitely need the expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Breathe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How exactly does the tribute stuff work?  Is there an online guide to it anywhere?</div></div><hr />
