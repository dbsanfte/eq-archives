<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dalur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In your opinion for a WE druid, would the cultural fletching be cheaper/easier than going the normal route of buying bow parts and making bows?<br />
<br />
The mithril stuff seems to be kind of a pain, but if it's cheaper/easier than that might be a better route.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">little cheaper and easier than the bows.  the main difference is sell back on arrows is nothing and is much better on bows.  failures on bows are killer though.  all that said acrylia arrows if you farm them are uber cheap.  just like shadow scream is for smithing.  they should put a forge in hollowshade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>lonewylfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just be warned that if you go the acrylia route, you will have nightmares about grimlings for months o.o<br />
<br />
I did mithril mixed with trueshot bow combines to go from 202-210 or so. Another thing to do now would be to do sedgewood also, think one form of it trivials in the low 200s.<br />
<br />
Btw, to make all the running with the mithril easier, I logged in a druid on the other account, bound them at the cultural forge, ran them back to felwithe to get the mithril, then gated back to the forge. Made it a lot easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">compound bow.  takes too cams.  if you can't get a tinker to make you a boat load of them (tinkered is about 1/3 cost) then thats 70pp or so anyway.  arrows would prolly still be cheaper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Footsore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just a caution about using Sedgewood bows for skillup. The sell back is terrible. Only way you can hope to use these for skillup is if you don't buy the branch in the bazaar.  Otherwise, it is cheaper and easier to make regular bows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm a wood elf druid and I did mithril arrows and hated doing them.  I broke down and did the expensive bows most of the way to 250.  Bows are extremely easy but expensive.  Sit in front of one vendor and buy a couple items til 250.  It will cost over 70k though.  Mithril arrows were much much cheaper, but successes were very rare and seeing so many failures depressed me.  I was succeeding maybe 1 combine per couple stacks at the low 200s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dalur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the replies.<br />
<br />
So it would seem that maybe you should make some of the bows until around 220ish and then do the mithril arrows?<br />
<br />
Might try that out and see how it goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">farm the components for the trueshot longbow till 235.  /shrug hey it could work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>intertex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Was using the mithril arrows to skill up to 237, then find out the much cheaper way of using Trueshot Bow...SOL's not released at that time so no condensed arrow.<br />
I do agree the failure rate of making arrow can be very depressing (I was like having 1 or 2 success on 20 trials before 220)...but hey! The cost of making Bow is so terribly high for a poor little ranger who have no way but visiting the giant in Rathe Mountain to beg some money :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Footsore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The mention of Rangers reminded me of one other thing.<br />
<br />
Though gathering the stuff for Acrylia Arrows can be a pain, they sell readily in the bazaar for 3-5pp each (on Zeb). The only ones who seem interested in the mithril arrows, though, are those darn high level Rangers with that never-ending quiver thing. :) The mithril arrows seem to sell only one or two at a time no matter what the price.</div></div><hr />
