I wonder what it would take to get SoE to implement Tradeskill Mastery for smithing (and tailoring, fletching, etc...) that they did with JC.  A jeweler with devoted mastery to it reported 95% success on valor rings.  I'd love to be able to boast such a rate for PoP recipes (11/15 or 73% with 250 +5% on nightmare chain).<br />
<br />
I haven't gotten any better at my trade in 8 months (dinged 250 may 6th).  I'd love to see it go higher.</div></div><hr />

To me it seems quite unfair (I'm a dwarf, shouldn't we get Smithing Mastery as a race? :D).  I doubt they would ever implement it, but I do think it would be nice.<br />

And I say that, even though my Smith is a High Elven Cleric!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I say this of course because it would be cool to have both JC (I'm and enchanter) and Tailoring (I'm an Erudite) Mastery.<br />
<br />
Of course Half Elves would continue to get screwed, but oh well, why fix something that is already broken.  ;)</div></div><hr />

I shudder to think of how other tradeskills would get ruined with some implementation of mastery, especially if they were limited to certain class/race.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hukelberi</div><div class="date">01-13-2003, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They should add a non-class specific PoP ability that works for all combines across the board.. Not specidic to any one skill.. <br />

Tannan Tradeskill Mastery..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd still love the failure rate reduction, but it *has* to be costly otherwise its just going to add even more to the problems of &quot;uber with too much cash that floods the market&quot;.</div></div><hr />

If we could deal for so long with having one skill at 250 when all other are capped at 200 then I don't see why we cant have ONE skill Mastered with something like JCM. It would be like an advanced specialization. Then even the people who are at 250 in a ll 7 skills will still have one skill they are really supearior at. As far as the Enchanters with JCM 3 now, Sony can refund them the AA points when they give the AA ability to everyone and they can just re-buy it or buy one of the other skills they might want. I see this as a nice, easy solution to the problem at hand. As far as the 50% less fail rate and it destroying the market, having more and more people everyday with 250 in all 7 skills and having 5,000 people already 250 in that one skill you are working on now has already destroyed the market.</div></div><hr />
