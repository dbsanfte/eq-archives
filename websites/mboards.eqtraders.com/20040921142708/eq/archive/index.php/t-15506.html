<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>filobeto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Logged on last night just in time to see the server coming down message, so I thought I would just vendor from the previous night and log.  Clicking through the bags to see what I had to sell, I click my Vale Kit and get the TS UI - for the love of everything holy, please tell me this is now working!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I heard the new UI worked for the Vale sewing kit until last night's patch.<br />
<br />
OK, I'm just kidding, but I really couldn't resist.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>scarbrowed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Vale Sewing Kit has worked for me since the new UI came out. (OK, I could not log in until 3 days after the UI came out.) It makes tufts so much easier to deal with.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>filobeto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had made haversacks as recently as this weekend and had not, until last night, had the Tradeskill UI pop up....been making'em still the old way, walking up hill in snow.<br />

<br />
NEVER gonna make em with new UI again.<br />
<br />
I never make more than say 6 at a time so doing it the old way is no big deal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as I can tell, this was fixed in the very next patch after the one that introduced the new UI. I was lucky, this only burned me on some velium combines.<br />
<br />
And even when it was bugged, it showed the recipe ingredients in the UI window.  Just double check them before you use a recipe for the first time.<br />
<br />
BTW, did anyone try a petition? I was not going to for a loss of 2 small pieces of velium, but I would have for losing a haversack,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't bother with petitions unless it's something life-threatening, frankly. Response time on Fennin can be pretty poor.</div></div><hr />
