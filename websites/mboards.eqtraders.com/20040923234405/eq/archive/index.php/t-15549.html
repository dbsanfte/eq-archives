<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>euridice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
188 in tailoring.<br />
I'm planning to make a robes night as I gather quite a few forages with my druid (250 sylvan berries &amp; 200 Lichenclover)<br />
my next problem is to find elements for the swatch :<br />
<br />
Nilitim's Grimoire Pg. 115<br />
Tears of prexus<br />
Rune of Sorcery<br />
<br />
I farm the merchants but I'd also like to know if you know a zone/mob where these items drop frequently.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Heartsong_Steelsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">IN GENERAL, research items drop from mobs that are close in level to the spell they make, so I would go see what spells those are for (I can at least say that nilitim's is for an enchanter spell, rune for wizard, tears for mage :))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>euridice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ok so <br />
<br />
Color skew 44 (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=8843&amp;menustr=)<br />
Conjuration : Water 44 (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=8881&amp;menustr=)<br />
Nullify magic 34 (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=8926&amp;menustr=) <br />
so the rune of sorcery should be easier to get =&gt; lvl 34 against lvl 44 for the 2 others<br />
do u think CC is this level ?<br />
I can PBAE with a wiz friend the pit !:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ancarett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Check the merchants in PoK: I see a lot of these runes and such there. Two zones I know I've seen these components drop in are the Overthere and the Dreadlands (was XPing there with my druid last week). Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ChaseFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have personally seen all of those items on the vendors in the village in Jaggedpine Forest. Perhaps not necessarily in quantities to make you drool (I never found more than a handful at a time), but regularly enough to make it worth the trip. If you're so inclined to kill for them, I think the timber griffons had the biggest stash of research components.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ymmi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How long did it take you to get that kind of forage?<br />
<br />
I have about 100 runes/pages in bank and no forages to go with them.  /cry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarabella</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've seen runes of sorcery drop off wyvern in CS, you may want to check the othmir vendors there. Wyverns also a good source of runes of concussion and cyclone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yaztyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I had reasonable luck getting Tears of Prexus in Acrylia Caverns, whilst I was farming .. after they were no longer useful for me, grr.<br />
<br />
Get all your friends/guildmates to check every merchant they see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mewkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm not sure if this is an accurate reflection of the drop rate, but parusing the bazaar has yielded me about twice as many page 115s as Runes of Sorcery, and about 5 times as many Tears of Prexii as runes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>euridice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How long did it take you to get that kind of forage? <br />
i usually dual my druid only on this purpose, since about 2 months :o <br />
without having a separate account I can't imagine you have the patiente to do nothing but forage...<br />
<br />
I leveled him to be able to max forage and made the forager +10% quest</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Maelina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A great way I've found to get research components of all levels is to port around to all the adventure camps for LDoN.  Being that the adventures range in level, so do the research components dropping on them.  It might be yet another set of vendors to add to a list of *likely* sources.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The vendors in Rathe Mountains (gypsies and the ones in the huts) are usually a good source for research stuff, people sell their drops from farming the HGs there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Proctus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hardest part for me is getting the dang Sylvan berries or Lichenclovers ^^ People are so stingy and I don't have a forager =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aamdor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The bottom line here is that the LoY robe swatch components can't really be farmed except from vendors.  When I skilled up using them, I used vendor mining in PoK, Gunthak, and Bazaar (both vendors and traders).  It would take about 3-4 weeks to gather 100+ attempts worth which was fine because it took that long for my rangerette to forage the need clovers and berries.  On Morell-Thule, I have noticed that vendor mining in PoK has become noticeably less successful; may be a spate of HIE tailors atm or, more probably, the server has matured to the point that fewer are going to the zones where they drop anymore.  Either may partially explain the totally outrageous traders prices in Bazaar - 1000p for a Rune of Sorcery! :steamed:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>euridice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">gunthak is nice, <br />
I found yesterday 2 stacks of p115 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>NVekRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If any of you are on Rodcet, I have a bunch of assorted swatches I don't need.  Kept coming across the various words for them while on my merchant rounds and figured I'd toss a few on my bazaar mule, but I'm not getting much response on them so far.  So I'd be happy to share them with fellow tailors.  I'm in the process of packing my house to move and also have a cold so I may be slightly hard to get ahold of, but if you can get me, you're welcome to them. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Muldamai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have been doing HIE cultural robes for a long time, and the Tears of Prexus are by far the most available resource. SImple reason is the level of mobs it comes off of and thats the level most people fight at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ymmi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">But the sylvan berries are killing me...<br />
<br />
I spent about 6 hours foraging in LFay with 188 Forage.  Got ~20 berries.<br />
<br />
Suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Anaxo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Clear the orc camps and forage at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kaaba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Max forage skill 200 + the foraging machete does nothing.  At 200 foraging skill you already forage something every time, and all your foraging skill does is effect how often you forage something, it has nothing to do with rate % of what you forage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Taushar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Clear the orc camps and forage at the same time.<br />
<br />
Totally agree here. Usually, when I use my druid for foraging for sylvan berries (thank god I am done with tailoring) I used to get a wolf form, run from one orc camp to another clearing them, with medding in between and foraging. This yielded at least twice as many sylvan berries then just foraging alone. <br />
