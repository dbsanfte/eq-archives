I bought a collapsible mortar and pestle for the same reason.  But then I attempted to destroy the summoed M&amp;P and destroyed the collapsible instead.<br />
<br />
Doh.<br />
<br />
Then I realized that for the 500pp I spent on the collapsible M&amp;P, I could buy a lot of regular M&amp;Ps and sell them back for something like a 2gp loss.  And mixing bowls are even cheaper.<br />

They took out an advantage Rogues had over other classes (and yes, all classes have advantages).<br />
<br />
To me, it doesn' tmatter, being a grand master baker, it's a necesity to ave a collapsible mixing bowl, but I'm looking at the lowbie rogues who may want to make CEs.<br />
<br />
Don't worry if I seem passionate about this, I've watched Rogues get nerf after nerf (I've bene playing Rogues since before the days of Kunark).  Yes, they've added some great things (no minimum backstab damage is gone, than god) but it seems that the negatives outweigh the positives. (Most nerfs were player initated, not dev. initated, too many people complaining about us).<br />
<br />
Hey, this is great news for my chanter alt.  While she's making magic clay etc.. she can also pump out CEs.<br />
<br />
While I see the good coming out towards other classes, I see it as a negative (or neutral at best) towards Rogues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ambrya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I just don't see how the bug with the m&amp;p was any advantage to rogues that has now been taken away.<br />
<br />
CE has NEVER been a &quot;rogue only&quot; combine.  It was never meant to be.  The new UI BROKE that fact.  It was NEVER designed to be an advantage to rogues and therefore, it is unreasonable for rogues to expect to be allowed to keep it.<br />

I personally could care less what container is used to make CE's, just as long as the combine works with the new UI. *shrug*<br />

Sure I'm losing a little plat that I spent on my collapsible m &amp; p, but I'm just going to turn around and sell it in the bazaar cheaper than the tinkerers are selling it for (sorry tinkerers :p  )<br />

I'm basically posting to respond to the Balkin.<br />
<br />
Well, on Firiona Vie at least where you only get 1 character, those extra 5 slots in the bank (10 slot container - 1 slot for collapsible Mixing Bowl - 4 slots you would have had with regular mixing bowl) really can make a difference.  It adds up to if you include another 3 extra slots (collapsible spit) and that's just baking.<br />
<br />
This doesn't apply to just FV either.  Even on servers where you get 8 slots it is still a pain to have to camp out, bring in mule, put something into shared bank, camp out, log on baker, etc.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying they are a necessity, just that they can make life a BUNCH more convenient, just like the newUI does.  Sure not every recipe is in it, but for the ones it DOES have it is AMAZING.<br />

<br />

<br />
I'll tend to disagree with that and I'll explain why.<br />
<br />
Look at the 2 ingredients, a 'celestial solvent' (I'm assuming it's a liquid) and some research item, or other item.<br />
<br />
Lets say you have a rune, which is like a magic rock.  Unless the solvent is acidic, it will be hard to 'mix' them in a mixing bowl, but you'll need the mortar and pestle to grind the rune into a fine powder to mix with the solvent.<br />
<br />
But on the other hand, a M&amp;P is rather usless when one of the ingredients is a sheet of paper, or another liquid.<br />
<br />
Well, I'll look at the bright side, now is a great time for a newbie Rogue to pick up a collapsible M&amp;P, they're dirt cheap at the bazaar right now while collapsible mixing bowls are being sold at prices as high as I haven't seen since they were first introduced (1K -2K).  Too bad I started my gnome late.  :)<br />
<br />
I do apologize for my statements earlier, yes, it is great news for all the other classes, an M&amp;P costs roughly the same as a mixing bowl, and all the other classes would benefit more from a mixing bowl than an M&amp;P, I feel it took a little away from a Rogue, esp ones who are just starting out into the tradeskill market, CEs are always a good and consistent seller at the bazaar.<br />
<br />
(Like I said, it really doesn't affect my main too much, he's a GM baker, so he already has his collapsible mixiing bowl).  :angel:</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a &quot;no fail&quot; because it's something you should know how to do with little effort, like one of us trying to make a glass of chocolate milk, it's pretty easy and requires little skill, yet we all do it all the time.  Now imagine if chocolate milk was needed in gourmet recipies in bulk, and it wasn't easily available at your local grocer's.</div></div><hr />

LOVE THAT DIRTY WATER Do you suppose there could be some connection? The city of Aliso Viejo is about to officially ban dihydrogen monoxide—turns out that’s water—during the same week that marks the fifth anniversary of a meeting where federal, state and county officials unveiled a multimillion-dollar plan to finally clean up chronically polluted Aliso Creek—a plan that is now deader than a puffed-out fish floating atop a stinky creek mouth. Truthfully, these events aren’t related: one is a hoax perpetrated on the Internet, and the other is a hoax perpetrated on local taxpayers. Several years ago, the comedy duo Penn &amp; Teller tricked the international environmental organization Greenpeace into backing a ban of a &quot;deadly&quot; chemical called dihydrogen monoxide. Like AIDS-infused needles sticking out of theater seats, the unclaimed fortune of Nigeria’s crown prince and GeorgeWBush.com’s Sloganator, the threat posed by dihydrogen monoxide lives on on the Internet and somehow reached the Aliso Viejo City Attorney’s office, which drew up a law banning the dangerous-sounding stuff until those kind souls at the American Plastics Council alert the city on March 12. D’oh!</div></div><hr />

I guess they needed to move the recipe to make it work correctly in the new Tradeskill UI.  Makes sense.  I lose a bit of convenience, but its worth it for the overall good.  However, there must have been some initial reasoning for making it a Mortar &amp; Pestle recipe to begin with.  And why is that reasoning no longer valid?  <br />

I would have hoped they move it to the Glaze Mortar, as that seems to make a little more sense.  In fact because they didn’t, makes me thing the Tradeskill UI will never be implemented for that container.</div></div><hr />

Yep water is a good solvent for ionic materials as pointed out with the salt posts it is even pretty good with things that have some polarity or a lot of hydrogen bonding like some cellulose derivatives, starch, sugars....   <br />

Water is a lousy solvent for non-polar materials.  Just try dissolving something like wax or greasy substances in water - it isn't going to happen (that is why you need soaps and detergents which have a nice polar end and another non-polar end in the molecule - blah blah blah surfactants blah blah micelles blah gibbs surface free energy blah blah blah).  You need to find something with similar polar/non-polar character and getting close in cohesive energy density helps a lot too.  <br />
<br />
So other solvents that may be involved are things like ethanol, hexane, limonene (the terpene in orange oil), benzene, trichlorethane (drying cleaning), THF, NMP, and thousands and thousands of others including probably the best one for a lot of things - supercritical carbon dioxide (although how you contain that in a mixing bowl is beyond me.)  <br />
<br />
Now how purified water is made is another mystery unless the brew barrel  can double as a liquid-liquid extraction vessel and the brewer is skilled with separation processes (I really hated that course).  <br />

All I can say is when chemical engineering fails rely on magic!!!</div></div><hr />

The hundreds of recipes for CE now showing up in the mixing bowl certainly argue for only making it with scent of marr...I mean dang if you had 25 random combinable research pages you would have to search for every single recipe.  Since there are more than 100 ways to make the darned stuff I found my shortcut was to search for &quot;scent.&quot;<br />
<br />
I feel bad for people using random ingredients for this UI.  Unless you look up the CE recipe just made for Dingleberries page 29 left half, then you can't use the UI.</div></div><hr />

You won't be making heaps of CE with random stuff like you would with Scent of Marr.</div></div><hr />
