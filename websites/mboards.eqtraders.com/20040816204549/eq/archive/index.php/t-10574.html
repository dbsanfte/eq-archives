Regardless of the validty or invalidity of his claim, he is quite out of line in his manner.<br />

During the day it is full of RUDE ignorant morons and that is me being nice.<br />

If that is what traders are going to become I may not take part anymore.<br />

Thank you {Ngreth - Clearing names in these posts} and the rest of your crew for showing me what not to become.<br />

Ngreth got all the instances of names occurring in Merkell's post, and the quote of that post done by Kronepsis' reply, but missed the names where they appeared in Lilosh's reply...<br />
<br />
ya might want to get that...</div></div><hr />

I tried to edit, but that's not possible in a locked thread.<br />
<br />
Which makes sense, now that I think about it.<br />
