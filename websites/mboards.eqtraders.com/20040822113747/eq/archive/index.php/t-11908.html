<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Papanishago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The brew ingredients are used for the Warrior only(at least it seems this way) quest to turn red dragon scales green.  Verrell Cogswin is in North Ro near the shrine close to oasis.  You give him water and he talks about a recipe to turn scales different colors.  Well anyway he screws up and he needs you to make an adhesive and a brew. The brew is called Deep Barley Brew and in order to make it you have to get  deep fungus mold, some barley, and a bottle of distilled spirits, and combine them in a brew barrel.  I have verified this brew as working and is also no drop..  Heh now if someone would be so kind as to post in the quest that require tradeskils forum about getting the rest done as I am totally lost. :confused:</div></div><hr />
