Can anyone tell me exactly where I need to go to collect these? I spent an evening in Akehva Ruins killing Mind Burrowers because I thought maybe those were the ones I needed to kill. It seems that was incorrect.  Any advice and/or direction that someone can pass on would be most appreciated.<br />

He told me the only ones that seem to drop them are the big Mind Worms where the Insanity Crawler spawns.<br />
<br />
It took him a couple of weeks of killing these things to collect 2 of them and finally gave up and purchased a third in the bazaar. Apparantly they are very rare drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I get my group in there and we deliberately set off the traps--you usually get anywhere from 3-6 mind worms per trap.<br />
<br />
The only advantage to doing the big worms in the right-hand hall is that they also occasionally drop fairly rare spells, so there is a chance for decent loot off them, but I've never noticed that the hide drops from them are any more frequent than from the small worms.<br />

<br />
I still need some mind worm hides but I havent seen the traps trigger the last times in Akheva. I ahve also killed a few mind burrowers but they did not drop any hides. I have looked in Bazaar for hides too but in 2 months time I havent seen any.<br />
<br />
Do they still trigger or are they bugged? Anyone seen any mind worms lately?<br />

I got some on a 3 hour guild raid.<br />
<br />
36 persons from guild killing the big worms to get the Insanity Crawler to spawn. Total raid time (kill time only) 3 hours<br />
Loot total:<br />
50-something centi meats and toes<br />
30-something mind worm meat<br />
10 spells<br />
9 mind worm hides<br />
<br />
So basically the hides are rarer than the spell drops, at least from the big ones.</div></div><hr />
