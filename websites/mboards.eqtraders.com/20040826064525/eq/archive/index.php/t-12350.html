<br />
I've recently done a lot of work upgrading and editting my foraging guide. I'm pretty happy with it at this point. I'll continue to update it in the future. As it stands, it is (as far as I can tell) the most accurate and comprehensive foraging work available. I hope you enjoy it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GreysLuclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">.. in the brewing thread, I believe I read that this was discovered to be part of a drink.  Look in Lewenya's thread (heh, take awhile to read), but I think I read it is now discovered.<br />
<br />
And Heartfruit Walnuts come from Halls of Honor B, or Temple of Mithaniel Marr (look on Allah's for the correct zone name).  Plane of Honor is not a name, HoHa = Halls of Honor, and HoHb = Temple of Mith Marr (look it up).<br />

Nice compendium, indeed.  =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Liandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Branch of planar oak foraged in Plane of Growth is also used in the Cabbage Earing quest to make the Blessed Fishing Rod.<br />
<br />
Also Justice Fruit is now called Planar Fruit.<br />
<br />
Very nice guide though.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kieroth_whiteleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If I recall correctly, Fish Eggs are a byproduct of a fishing (tackle box) combine.. may have been a baking combine using fished fish.<br />
<br />
But they're definitely a byproduct of something (at very least), and I don't believe I've ever heard of them being foraged (some things are both dropped and foraged).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Loviotor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Fish Eggs are also foraged in the Plane of Water...  I know this for a fact, as I forage them as frequently as anything else in that zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I notice you don't have any of the GoD forages in your table yet. Are you interested in that sort of information?<br />
<br />
I know you can forage 1-15 lb hynid and cragbeast meat in Natimbi. Also, all the tea stuff (Ginsing, Mint, Taleosien Teal Leaves, Moldy Leaves, Sticks and Twigs). Needless to say, Natimbi has one of the largest forage tables I have ever seen. <br />
<br />
It would be nice to know if you can forage all that stuff in Abysmal Sea, would make things easier if you could forage the tea stuff there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Elyssanda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Abysmal Sea has the basic old world forage table..veggies, pods of water, grubs, roots etc.. Nothing specific to Gates.</div></div><hr />
