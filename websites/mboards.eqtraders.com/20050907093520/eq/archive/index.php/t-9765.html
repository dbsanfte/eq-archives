<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grae</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok... been out of it for a bit, not doing a lot of tradeskills (other than poisons with my rogue)..<br />
<br />
But the new Karana fletching caught my eye (I have a Tunare ranger, but always thought those bows were unfair to our Karana-worshipping red-headed-siblings ;)<br />
<br />
But, now the &quot;unfairness&quot; takes a twist.. Half-elf worshippers of Karana can now do &quot;cultural&quot; fletching? What about Half-elves who worship Tunare (Like my rogue?). My ranger is all well and good, he's even at 201 fletching.. but he is no longer my main, and I really only keep him around to do the fletching for my rogue and friends..<br />
<br />
Think this change in SOE's attitude towards half-elves might be addressed for us Tunare worshippers, too?<br />
<br />
I just wanted to verify with others here that half-elves ARE actually able to do the karana fletching before I zap off an email to Sony..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazick</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably not. Because if you ask for &quot;Half-Elf Cultural&quot;... then you will get folks whining about:<br />
<br />
&quot;Vah Shir Cultural&quot;...<br />
<br />
&quot;Froglok Cultural&quot;...<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Cultural Baking for Trolls?&quot;...<br />
<br />
&quot;Dwarven Cultural Brewing NOW!&quot;...<br />
<br />
and on the list can go.<br />
<br />
But then here I am whining (again) about people whining about the lack of -this and that- in the game. And &quot;It isn't FAIR&quot;... &quot;Where is the Balance?&quot;..<br />
<br />
Sorry, I digress... but my point is, if this debate gets started (which it likely will) it is endless and just serves to annoy lots of folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grae</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was curious because of the hard stance Sony has had with half-elves all this time.. if they can suddenly be allowed to do something that is considered &quot;cultural&quot; by their worshipping the &quot;right&quot; deity, then shouldn't the Tunare-worshipping half-elves get the same option with the Tunare-only &quot;Cultural&quot; recipies that wood elf AND high elf have at their disposal?<br />
<br />
Sure, I think the Vah Shir should have more cultural stuff... but not the frogloks.. they already make good eatin (frog legs anyone? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lonewylfe</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think the new fletching is really any type of cultural, wouldn't that limit it to just one race being able to make it?<br />
I do find it odd that the fletching would be accessable to anybody who worshiped Karana, maybe a similar change is coming for Tunare fletching?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grae</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A change to tunare fletching... that's what I want. I prefer rogues to rangers (found out after getting my ranger to 44 and then starting a rogue on a whim). But, I made the rogue a half-elf (part of the roleplaying aspect taken from my real life.. there's a little story there), because I figured that was the easiest way to share weapons between the ranger and rogue.. because I liked the tunare-only bows that could be made (have a Cloudburster on my ranger, and Swiftbolt on my rogue).<br />
<br />
If my rogue could make his own, though, as it appears the Karana worshipping half-elves can do, then I could become more self-sufficient with my rogue..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OberonMiM</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it would be best to coin it &quot;Diety tradeskills&quot;<br />
<br />
which opens up a whole new can of worms cause why is it that only karana gets &quot;Diety&quot; tradeskills<br />
<br />
I mean cultural implies that the technique is passed down through the ages by a race which kinda makes vague sense. But being able to combine something JUST because you worship a god makes no sense at all.<br />
<br />
I expect the can of worms has just been opened</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LatemYvaeh</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok here is my question back in the day when they released the Wood Elf cultural Fletching they had stated they were either going to add Human or Ranger Cultural Fletching. Now they have added Karana Fletching which leaves Human and Half Elf Rangers with out any Fletching. So what are the rest of the Human Rangers like myself suppose to do for fletching I mean my home town won't even let me make the surefall bows and arrows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grae</div><div class="date">08-09-2003, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's pretty much what I'm saying, Latem.. they make the change so it's &quot;Karana&quot; fletching, so any Karana worshipper can do these.. but this then changes their long-standing position that half-elves get nothing.<br />
<br />
All I want to see is consistency... they said one thing, but have done something opposite. I'm not going to cry and scream about it; I do have a wood elf ranger which I can continue to work the Tunare fletching with.. I just would like to know if they've changed their mind about half-elves, and if so, when can us Tunare-worshipping half-elves get in on the action..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remil Eaglespirit</div><div class="date">08-10-2003, 12:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back when Wood elf fletching came out I was pretty upset. Why? Because there where these bows and arrows out there that Myself as a Half elf Ranger that followed Karana couldn't even use and also that as a fletcher I was pretty limited in the options to raising my skill over 201. <br />
<br />
I was told as was most people that Half elfs had no culture of there own since they where a mixed race. I was also told that in there opinion since Half elfs are of medium size they could wear alot of the other races cultural armor. BUT with Wood Elf fletching even if I wanted to hand over my hard earned plat to buy something nice made from a wood elf I still couldn't use it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Jaggedpine Forest also had not been open to the rest of Norrath at that time, Since JP is the home of a bunch of Karana worshipers that where sealed off from the rest of the world it is logical to assume they would at least come up with something uniqe in there isolation for who knows how long hehe. So for all the Tunar following Half elfs and humans shame on you for folowing a god other then the one your race was supposed to be protecting!!<br />
<br />
p.s. LOL yes back then I did petition to see if I could change the god I followed because I felt like I was following a god that was forgoten in the world of Norrath. hehe go do the tunare badge quest in Gfay and Lfay</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zyrtryx Conjureblade</div><div class="date">08-10-2003, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Offhand, I'd say that the Karana fletching was done to benefit Halflings more than Half-Elves, since Halfling Rangers worship Karana, not Tunare.<br />
<br />
And its about time they did this! Now I finally have a reason to work on Oakenthorn's Fletching again! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crydee Ossiriand</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is diety-restricted fletching. Any fletcher who worships Karana, regardless of class can make the items. This includes both items requiring you to have Karana as your diety and items useable by followers of other dieties along this line.<br />
<br />
What you are referring to as Tunare-diety fletching is not. This is wood elf cultural fletching. All wood elves and only wood elves can fletch both the items requiring you to follow Tunare and items for followers of other dieties regardless of if the wood elf actually worships her or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Victoriatana</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't call the new Karana fletching &quot;cultural&quot; as we know it since many different cultures (Halflings, Human, Half-Elves) can use/make it.   SoE always said that Half-Elves would never have a racial culture hence no racial tradeskills, but they never said anything about deity based tradeskills.  That said, I don't see why Half-Elves being able to make/use Karana Fletching is so taboo.<br />
<br />
I looked up culture in the dictionary (well, www.dictionary.com), and culture is defined as &quot;The totality of socially transmitted behavior patterns, arts, beliefs, institutions, and all other products of human work and thought.&quot; and &quot;The predominating attitudes and behavior that characterize the functioning of a group or organization.&quot;, and if we look at the description of the followers of Karana &quot;Typical followers of Karana are rural humanoids - farmers, ranchers, hunters, and the like. They will often offer strangers shelter from the elements. Many of Karana's followers live a nomadic lifestyle, travelling where the winds take them. They are humble, generous people who value strength and honesty and brook no disrespect of Karana or of his work for they know it is only through his wisdom and kindness that all of Norrath is not consumed in an eternal tempest.  Now, being a Karana worshiping Half-Elf from the Surefall region, wouldn't I have a culture of my own, defined by SoE itself?  <br />
<br />
Look at Qeymnos (more specificaly, it's territories: Surefall, JPF, and the Plains of Karana) and it virtualy screams the description of Karana followers.  So, IMO, worshiping Karana is it's own culture, regardless of race.<br />
<br />
I, as a Karana worshiping Half-Elf from Surfall(in game, not in RL  :p), won't press for Half-Elf cultural, but I see worshiping Karana as my culture and I live by it, so I am very happy with this new deity cultural fletching.<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
All that said, culture should come down to how you RP your character in game, but since very few people do RP, it's a very weak point.<br />
<br />
Note:  This whole post is from the Karana Half-Elf from Surefall point of view, as I never played a Halfling or Tunare Half-Elf/Human.  I do RP in game with my ranger, and that's how I see the world of Norrath.  I never really thought of the implication of being a Tunare Half-Elf (and how they were accepted in Kelethin) until recently, so I didn't write anything about how they would of seen the world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Besides considering how much it rains in the karana's i know every agnarr kill we have a few people BEGGING to kill karana</div></div><hr />
