<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dyllwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
   Been camping in Natimbi as much as my patience will allow, getting all kinds of No Drop items, some for known quests but many unknown. In the several days I've been there I've picked up 3 Hynid Blood. Have never even seen a Cragbeast Skin/Hide.<br />
<br />
   Anyone have any idea if there's a better place for the blood, or where the skins drop from Cragbeasts?</div></div><hr />

Just seeing one of the new backpacks is completed, an easier recipe than the one I'm working on and it resulted in 10 slot giant, 35% WR</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have not extensively ventured through the new lands, but the only Cragbeast that I remember is the Cragbeast Queen.  i have heard that she is a raid-type mob.  She looks like a giant sand lizard, and was red at level 65.  Maybe she is the one that drops the blood/skins?  I believe she shows up every night.  There is a zonewide message in white soemthign to the effect of, 'You hear a howl on the wind.'  Just my 2 copper pieces worth.  :&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dyllwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The bloods in question drop from Hynids, my main question there was if anyone knew of a better area for drops then Natimbi, because they drop excrutiatengly slow there.<br />
<br />
The skins I was asking about are the Cragbeast skins/hides that are required for teh cragbeast version of the bag recipes. The large turtles in Natimbi are called Turepta Cragbeasts, so unless there's a different mob elsewhere also called a cragbeast I would assume they drop from them. As far as the skins only dropping from the Cragbeast Queen, I can't believe Sony would do something like that, since from all reports she's Quarm level in difficulty.</div></div><hr />
