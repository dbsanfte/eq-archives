<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>iasmin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In theory, if you have your settings to not send you email when someone posts to a thread, you shouldn't be getting email of any activity in that thread....however....despite my settings in my account being set to no email notification, I still seem to be getting email sent to my account.<br />
<br />
I can't imagine that I've missed a setting somewhere that would make this happen, but on the off chance that I have, can someone point me in the direction of which additional radio buttons I need to set other than the one turning email notification of thread activity off? I'd really appreciate it. My online email account keeps getting stuffed with all this fantastic advice, but given how often I find myself visiting, it seems redundant.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Click on the User CP button at the top of the forums, then make sure you're not subscribed to any threads or forums.  If you are, you might be getting notification of new posts from that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>iasmin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Already done. Here's to hoping that's what the trouble was. If it is, my sincere apologies for cluttering the boards with goofball I should know better questions. :)<br />
<br />
Cheers, you guys. You do a great job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Now the painful part.  You may need to go to all the threads that you have posted in and make sure none of them have that setting set.  I wish that the boards were more inteligant than that, but they are not.   So you may still get something from some older threads you have posted in until you are sure it is off in all threads (or if you get email from a thread... check all your posts in that thread... it is easier than chacking all of your threads)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>iasmin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just a followup.... no future emails, even by accident. Thanks for the help, folks. I very much appreciate it.</div></div><hr />
