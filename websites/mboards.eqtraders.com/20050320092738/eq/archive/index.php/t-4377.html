<br />
Thinking of buying a LoY lizard when I get the cash back.<br />
<br />
Anyone bought one yet? What is your opinion about it? Same thing as the horses with another look or there is an advantage / disadvantage to them compared?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've never got neither one nor the other though, so I can't tell you more about that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verdandi</div><div class="date">03-04-2003, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Folks on the shaman boards were saying that you bounce up and down a LOT when running, so if you're using your lizard for travel then you might tend to get seasick.  They said it's not a problem when they walk, though, so if you'd be using your lizard mainly while fighting it shouldn't be as much of an issue.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm gonna stick with the horse.  Who ever heard of lizards in Halas?  :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will not be buying a lizzie, it will make me seasick. Blarg!</div></div><hr />

I can't confirm that personally as I don't own a horse or a lizard (although I'm hoping to get a horse soon :))</div></div><hr />

Bah, just make a druid.   We run faster!<br />

Of course, we don't regen mana while standing.<br />
