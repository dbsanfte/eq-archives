<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone had success making any of the GoD baking recipes that use snake eggs since this morning's patch?<br />
<br />
Got a DNC on BBQ Crab Cakes, BBQ Crab Pie, and BBQ Crab Souffle using the oven in Abysmal.  I tried with both one and two snake eggs.  ::sigh::</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maddoc-the-Wayfarer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">These recipes were modified slightly, to take into account the different types/sizes of eggs.<br />
<br />
You must now make &quot;Egg Batter&quot; which is used in place of the eggs in the recipes. Different types of eggs will yeild different amounts of batter (just like dough). <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank you, Korendir :)<br />
<br />
Apparently the recipes were changed and instead of 2 snake eggs, you need two Egg Batter. <br />
<br />
Egg Batter = egg + milk in mixing bowl.<br />
<br />
Snake egg yields one batter; griff egg yields 7 batter.<br />
<br />
Edited to add:  thank you Maddoc, also :)  Someone in chat mentioned the batter before I saw your post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqNichola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Maddoc that should really go in the Database Updates forum :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Neat - this will make things a bit more convienent.<br />
<br />
But I must say if I tried to make a souffle with an egg batter made by beating eggs and milk together it would fall and make a mess.  It would make a good custard but never a successful souffle.<br />
<br />
Now if cragbeast custard was edible is another question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>sunpuppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">recipe's for the higher Eggs (wurm, dragon etc) seem to be broken.</div></div><hr />

Whats that sound? Ahh yes its the snakes.... they are happy. I never knew they could clap?!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nods .. just tried Drake Eggs.  <br />
<br />
Auto-Learn recipe in mixing bowl shows only milk and flour, and even with both of those in inventory the Flour icon stays red and is DNC.  Experimenting with Drake Egg and Milk earned a DNC.  <br />
<br />
Milk, Flour and Drake Egg in experiment yields dough (as it should).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mikebridge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i'm still wondering why there's the intermediate combine between  X lb tuna/crab, to a stack of 1 lb tuna/crab, to tuna meat/crab meat, why can't the original combine generate a stack of the meat? making the sauce, then doing sauce + meat is enough subcombines, why have that additional one in there?<br />
<br />
edit: found 1 recipe (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=12805&amp;menustr=)  that uses the 1 lb meat, so perhaps there's more out there that we haven't found, but again, why not just convert the raw fish directly into meat, instead of the 1lb chunks first?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xanafeldier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You get 15x1lb pieces of meat from a 15lb chunk, 7 from a 7, etc.<br />
Fish up an 11lb fish or loot a 5lb chunk and it adds up after the mixing bowl combine. Chopping the meat up appears to be no fail, making Meat failed once in a while for me.<br />
<br />
Oddly, the final meat after combining lb chunks is done yields a meat not flagged for tradeskills. That Worried me this morning as I tried snake egg recipes for the first time after patch. About an hour oh fussing and trying substitutes before finding this thread.<br />
Thank you!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There are also recipies that use 2 and 4 pound Tunas.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if I could turn a 6 pound tuna into a 2 &amp; a 4 pound tuna... :D</div></div><hr />
