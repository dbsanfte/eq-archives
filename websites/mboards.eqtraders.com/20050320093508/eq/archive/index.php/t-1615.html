<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verdandi</div><div class="date">02-25-2003, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taken from this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=c28d9a23f29bb1f7f091a9d06ae7cabb&amp;threadid=11335):<br />
Dorking around with a frog last night I noticed an oddity with the new quests. I was told to get an eye from a spider and when I returned I handed it to the quest guy as usual and he gave it back. I hailed him instead and he took the item and finished the quest. <br />
<br />
So for LoY quests, always hail the quest guy before trying to hand him stuff. Cuz it looks like they changed up their quest system a bit (at least for some of the new zones).<br />
This also prevents MQ'ing...<br />
It's taken from a thread about acquiring the new spells, but that bit looks like it might have much broader implications.  I'd say we need to test it a bit more, but for now I'd advise always Hailing right before the turn-in and being careful what you give.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delfontes</div><div class="date">02-25-2003, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can confirm that they don't always take the turn in, and that you never give anyone an item for LoY quests.  They just say they don't need it, but if you hail them they sure notice you have it.<br />
<br />
I did 1-10 last night as my shaman and got a spell, how to sew small sizes, 2 alcoholic beverages, and alot of fun for my time.  Still have 3 quest items the NPC's basically said do with what you want, or some such.<br />
<br />
Thinking back it would be all but impossible to MQ since no hand in is involved whatsoever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kirusgreymist</div><div class="date">02-26-2003, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah but also i know some items made the rounds like the fungus spore.. i think just about every frog used the same one for thier quests).<br />
<br />
also noticed the journal picks up stuff like a fire beetle lunges to attack and a fire beetle slinks to the ground dead messages not just the quest related npc sayings anyone know how if the is a fix to fix it? if not soe might wanna change it cause its a pain deleting the billion fire beetle attacks or dies messages lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delfontes</div><div class="date">02-26-2003, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I bought everything I needed for the quests from a vendor, and accidentially picked up that battle page or whatever...<br />
<br />
So yah, these quests are made for their simplicity, and tecnically the non-no drop stuff can be MQ'd like that.<br />
<br />
But that page is no drop I think, still have it on my frog, dunno what for. <br />
<br />
So an NPC on a harder quest wanting a rare No Drop item and 3 tradable items it would check your inventory for all 4, so you would have at least had to get the No Drop part yourself... which is what the MQ'er previously did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, I just have to find a troll raider, and Jin Zruu (hopefully) gets his newbie brooch upgraded to something useable. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delfontes</div><div class="date">02-26-2003, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stopped at the same place, hehe<br />
<br />
Where is that darn raider? ;)<br />
<br />
I was thinking I'd wait til the tadpoles got bored and left, leaving 20-30 in the zone... instead of the 100+ last time I was in it.</div></div><hr />
