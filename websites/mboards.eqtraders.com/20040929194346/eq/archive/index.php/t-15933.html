<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mrchaos101</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I finaly got my brewing up to 250.<br />
<br />
I wanted to make a spreedsheet that had the items I can make and the stuff that goes in it. Also the cost.<br />
<br />
I was trying to figur it out and relized, it had to be done. I rused ot eqtraders and did a search on spreed sheets.  I found a bunch of keywrds but nothing but dead links.<br />
<br />
I am willing otr modify any spread sheet that i need to. Just wanting a helping hand to get started.   Is there a good brewing spread sheet, or a spreed sheet for any trade skill that has cost and all items?</div></div><hr />
