<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got my brewing to 250 a couple days ago, now I'm wondering what to do with it. What are you guys making money off of? I know about Kaladim Constitutionals, but the market is pretty full right now. Gathering up stuff for the trophy, but its not a priority right now.<br />
Any suggestions would be appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqNichola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All you can really make money off is QAT / GLM / KC.<br />
<br />
QAT: needs an uncommon forage from East Karana, and Griffon Feathers - check Karanas and Jagged pine merchants.<br />
<br />
GLM: Entirely storebought, uses a reusable corking device, a LOT of subcombining involved.<br />
<br />
KC: Needs those groundspawn mushrooms<br />
<br />
<br />
So there is money to be made, but it's not handed to you on a plate :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>YurienStonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you can also make the demi sec champagne for the solstice earring</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>vovinit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can make a decent bit from essences for cultural needles and from dyes for LOY ribbons you don't exactly need to be a gm to do em but i have made a few plat doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh,<br />
<br />
My 250 brewer makes KC's and GLM's for sale. <br />
<br />
I also make QAT, but that's just for my casters to drink. the tea leaves are WAY to much of a pain in the booty to forage to sell the stuff. I keep it for myself to use. Hey, 4 of 8 characters are pure casters of one kind or another, and 2 are hybrids. I drink a lot of tea! :eek: :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The market on Xev for Grobbs and Kaladims has been trashed.  Kaladims are selling for less than 15 each and Grobbs are down tot he 4-5 plat range.  Just not worth enough plat for the time invested in combining.<br />
<br />
Afternoon Tea is a little better due to the scarcity of the forage.  <br />
<br />
Baking is in a similar spot.  HMP's are about 4-5 each now.  Misty Thickets are staying steady around 10-15 though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>YurienStonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">what are you complaining about Slippy? on MM hmp/mtp sell for 5-10p GLM 4p KC15p and QAT 12p. all in all thats good money if you make a good quanity. i could easily make 1k a night jsut on the GLM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Like I said, it's time invested.  Yes, even at those prices there is money to be made.  But balance the time it takes to collect ingredients, do sub-combines, do final combines then transfer to mule.<br />
<br />
That is a lot of time.  Time that could be spent xp/loot farming.  If I spend 3 hours making enough Grobbs to make 1k plat in the bazaar that is 3 hours wasted.  In that same time frame, I could have gone on nearly 3 dungeon runs and made almost the same amount of plat.  Not to mention xp and augs.  <br />
<br />
It's an issue of what is more valuable to you?  For a couple months Grobbs were selling for 7plat and up.  And Kaladims were lowballed at 20 each.  Then the time investment made it worthwhile.  For some reason, something happened and the market tanked over the course of about a week and now it just isn't worth the time investment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>YurienStonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">if it takes you 3 hours to make enough GLM then you're takeing the slow path. if i'm selling it at 4p per then i only need 250 GLM which is ummm 42 combines i think? only takes me abount 20 min to make all the subcombines and then brew it up and before i'm accused of it i'm not using a gamepad or whatever they are called. set up my trader, make subcombines while in trader mode so i can make money/search for items i need then pop over to SH for final combines then back in the baz and sell out it another 20 min. not too bad considering it takes me an entire night hunting in dulak to get 1kp between loot and coinage</div></div><hr />
